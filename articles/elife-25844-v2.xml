In voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels and the prokaryotic KcsA channel, conduction is believed to result from opening of an intracellular constriction that prevents ion entry into the pore. On the other hand, numerous ligand-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels lack such gate, suggesting that they may be activated by a change within the selectivity filter, a narrow region at the extracellular side of the pore. Using molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology measurements, we show that ligand-induced conformational changes in the KcsA channel removes steric restraints at the selectivity filter, thus resulting in structural fluctuations, reduced K<sup>+</sup> affinity, and increased ion permeation. Such activation of the selectivity filter may be a universal gating mechanism within K<sup>+</sup> channels. The occlusion of the pore at the level of the intracellular gate appears to be secondary.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25844.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Potassium channels are proteins found in almost all living organisms and are vital for many different biological processes. These proteins contain a pore that allows potassium ions to flow through cell membranes, but only when the channel is open. Most channels have a narrowing at the inward side of the pore, which was proposed to form a gate that controls the flow of ions. This gate only opens when the channel activates. Nearer the outward side of the pore is another narrow region called the selectivity filter. This region interacts selectively with potassium ions as they pass through the channel.</p><p>Not all channels form a tight constriction at the inward end of their pore, yet they still only allow potassium ions to flow through when activated. This suggested that these channels might instead use the selectivity filter as a gate. It would also mean that whilst different potassium channels have similar structures, they do not share a common gating mechanism that controls the flow of ions.</p><p>Heer et al. studied the bacterial channel called KcsA, which was thought to control the flow of potassium ions via a traditional inward gate. Computer simulations based on this protein’s structure, and experiments with purified KcsA in artificial membranes, showed that the selectivity filter was also involved when KcsA was activated. When the activated channel changed shape, the selectivity filter – which had been constrained by regions forming the pore – could now move and allow potassium ions to flow through the pore. Heer et al. confirmed using a mutant KcsA that the motion of the inward side of the pore upon activation affected the movement of the selectivity filter gate as predicted by the simulation.</p><p>These findings show that the KcsA channel opens and closes at the selectivity filter. The changes at the inward side of the pore, previously believed to be the gate, firstly enable the selectivity filter to serve as a gate while also forming a secondary gate. Heer et al. propose that most if not all potassium channels may also use this mechanism. These findings illustrate that molecular simulations can be powerful for predicting how changes in the structure of a protein will affect its behavior. This and future studies of other potassium channels will help scientists to better understand the subtle differences between the diverse range of channels found across different organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>conductance</kwd><kwd>gating</kwd><kwd>pH gated</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>free energy calculations</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF Professorship No. PP00P3_139205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernèche</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FP7 European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Human Brain Project No. 604102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernèche</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM088352</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimigean</surname><given-names>Crina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Foundation for Excellence and Talent in Biomedical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernèche</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Irma T Hirschl Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nimigean</surname><given-names>Crina M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transmembrane helices forming the pore determine the conductance of the selectivity filter through allosteric interactions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In voltage-gated potassium channels, the opening of an intracellular gate formed by a ‘bundle-crossing’ of the inner pore-lining helices is hypothesized to allow K ions to flow through the pore, down their electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yellen, 1998</xref>). A narrow section of the pore located towards the extracellular side of the membrane, called the selectivity filter because it allows the pore to select for K ions, has been proposed to play double duty as an inactivation gate: following a stimulus, the pore opens at the intracellular bundle-crossing and, in the continued presence of the stimulus, the selectivity filter changes its conformation to prevent further flux of K ions. Thus, in voltage-gated K<bold><sup>+ </sup></bold>channels, the intracellular bundle-crossing of the pore-lining helices is believed to be the activation gate, while the selectivity filter is believed to be the inactivation gate. This gating mechanism is believed to be shared by a subset of K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels such as KcsA and inward rectifier channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phillips and Nichols, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uysal et al., 2011</xref>). However, functional experiments examining state-dependent accessibility of pore blockers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Contreras and Holmgren, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilkens and Aldrich, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rapedius et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Posson et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Posson et al., 2015</xref>) or thiol-modifying agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flynn and Zagotta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2011</xref>), have shown that in other channels the intracellular pore-lining helices no longer form a bundle crossing that obstructs K<sup>+</sup> flux in the closed state, thus strongly implicating the selectivity filter as an activation gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flynn and Zagotta, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Proks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruening-Wright et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Contreras et al., 2008</xref>). This suggests that different K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels with high sequence and structural homology do not share a universal gating mechanism. Here, we challenge this statement based on our findings with KcsA, a structurally characterized model K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channel, which was believed to activate by simple opening of the intracellular bundle-crossing gate. We find that this outward movement of the transmembrane helices in KcsA leads to a change in the selectivity filter from closed to conductive during channel activation. We thus propose that the selectivity filter is the main gate in KcsA.</p><p>Ion permeation through the selectivity filter of K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels has been investigated and described based on KcsA X-ray crystallography data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morais-Cabral et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>) and molecular mechanics simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aqvist and Luzhkov, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernèche and Roux, 2001</xref>). The generally accepted model for permeation involves alternating states of the selectivity filter loaded with two or three ions separated by water molecules, low ion desolvation free energy at the filter entryway, and the occurrence of a knock-on transitional state in which two K ions come in close contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernèche and Roux, 2001</xref>). Structures of KcsA are available with the inner helices in different configurations, making KcsA a good model to investigate ion permeation gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uysal et al., 2011</xref>). In the ‘closed’ KcsA structure, the inner helices are closed at the bundle crossing gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>), while in the ‘activated’ KcsA crystal structures, the inner helices are wide open at the bundle crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>).

The plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows a projection of the potential of mean force (PMF) as a color-coded energy map that varies as a function of the position of the three K ions along the channel axis. The reduced reaction coordinate <italic>Z<sub>12</sub></italic> corresponds to the center-of-mass of the two ions on the extra-cellular side, and <italic>Z<sub>3</sub></italic> to the innermost ion, relative to the center of mass of the selectivity filter. Thus, one can read directly from the plot the relative free energy of the filter configuration corresponding to any position of the three ions. As examples, the molecular structures of the key ion occupancy states corresponding to well and saddle points along the permeation pathway are illustrated. The PMF calculation, which was initiated with K ions in sites S0-S2-S4 separated by water molecules in S1 and S3, shows deep free energy wells of at least 6 kcal/mol, indicating high K<sup>+</sup> binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In disagreement with the assumption of a conducting filter, these calculations suggest that ion permeation is rather impeded. Our result did not depend on the initial ion configuration, as a PMF calculation started with K ions in sites S1-S3 and Cav (cavity) with water molecules in S2 and S4, reveals similar free energy wells about 7 kcal/mol deep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike the first PMF, this one shows the formation of a knock-on state achieved via the loss of the water molecule between the 2nd and 3rd ions. Similar occupancy states were observed by other groups who proposed mechanisms where ions in the filter are most often not separated by water molecules during permeation, the higher ion density resulting in greater ionic repulsion and current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furini and Domene, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köpfer et al., 2014</xref>).

We wondered whether the barriers to permeation we calculated were due to a non-permissive conformation of the KcsA selectivity filter, adopted when the channel’s intracellular activation gate is ‘closed’. To explore this possibility, we next examined the free energy of ion movement through the selectivity filter of a KcsA channel with an ‘open’ intracellular gate. All KcsA ‘open’ states documented in the literature allow K<sup>+</sup> access through the intracellular entryway but display a selectivity filter in a collapsed state, in agreement with functional data showing that KcsA inactivates within seconds after activation by protons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chakrapani et al., 2011</xref>). Permeation is prohibited through such a collapsed filter conformation as rotation of the amide planes within the collapsed selectivity filter disrupt K ion binding and lead to new, stabilizing interactions of the amide planes with water molecules that intercalate between the subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Removal of these water molecules has been shown to facilitate recovery from inactivation and restore the ‘conductive’ form of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Two KcsA structures with an open bundle-crossing and collapsed selectivity filter (pdb entries 3F7V and 3F5W, with intracellular entryway diameters of 23 Å and 32 Å, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>) were chosen for the preparation of simulations of an open KcsA channel. In line with the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ostmeyer et al., 2013</xref>, we prepared a conductive selectivity filter conformation using a simulation in which the tightly bound water molecules behind the selectivity filter were removed and K ions maintained at the canonical binding sites S1-S3-Cav or S0-S2-S4 using harmonic restraints (see Materials and methods). No direct restraints were applied to the selectivity filter itself in order to minimize the possibility of introducing artifactual structural changes in the channel. This procedure led to a selectivity filter nearly identical in structure with that of the closed state KcsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The PMF calculation describing ion movement within the selectivity filter of the open state KcsA, based on the 3F5W structure and initiated with ions in sites S0-S2-S4, reveals small free energy barriers of 2 to 3 kcal/mol, conducive to ion permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A PMF describing a complete permeation event (the entrance of a K ion on one side and the release of a K ion from the other side) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. Compared to the above simulations using the closed KcsA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), these results indicate that a dramatic increase in K ion conductance occurs within the selectivity filter after the channel has switched from a conformation with the intracellular gate closed to one where it is open.</p><p>Ion permeation in the open state appears to be favored by increased fluctuations and slight enlargement of the selectivity filter. The histogram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, extracted from 20-ns long simulations of the open and closed states, shows that following the opening of the intracellular gate the selectivity filter adopts conformations that are up to 1 Å wider in diameter. This slight widening of the selectivity filter allows for a knock-on transition state in which two K ions accompanied by a water molecule (as opposed to one K<sup>+</sup> and one water) occupy the S3 and S4 binding sites (state identified by (∗) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The knock-on state is not strictly required for permeation and an alternative pathway, referred to as vacancy-diffusion, is also accessible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, dashed arrow). The vacancy-diffusion pathway involves that ions occupying the selectivity filter move first, leaving a vacant site that is filled by an incoming ion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schumaker and MacKinnon, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernèche and Roux, 2001</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25844.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fluctuations around the selectivity filter.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The histogram shows the inter-subunit, adjacent (1) and opposite (2), distances between the C<sub>α</sub> atoms of residues 75 to 78.

In those simulations, the fluctuations of the selectivity filter required for ion permeation were originating from the intrinsic flexibility of the protein main chain, which was overestimated by CHARMM22, a previous generation of the CHARMM force field (see section ‘Force field and ion permeation’ in Materials and methods). For comparison, the distance distribution in the selectivity filter of the closed state channel is also plotted for a simulation using the CHARMM22 force field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, dashed line). The plot shows fluctuations similar to those observed in the open channel using the current CHARMM36 force field. This new generation of force field notably contains a correction term for backbone dihedral angles developed on the basis of X-ray crystallographic data and quantum mechanical calculations of the protein backbone conformational energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackerell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Best et al., 2012</xref>). The improved force field allows us to better understand how the fluctuations of the selectivity filter are actually controlled by allosteric interactions involving the transmembrane and pore helices.</p><p>Departing from the permeation mechanism described here where three ions, accompanied by waters, permeate the selectivity filter, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köpfer et al., 2014</xref> suggested a hard knock-on mechanism in which ion permeation arises from the entrance of a fourth ion, excluding at the same time water molecules from the selectivity filter. The discrepancy between the two proposed permeation mechanisms is in part due to differences in the force field parameters defining the K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interaction, which result in much stronger ion binding affinity to the selectivity filter in the study by Köpfer et al. (see section ‘Force field and ion permeation’ in Materials and methods). However, it is important to consider that, as shown here, the ion binding affinity is essentially determined by the functional state of the selectivity filter. Simulations performed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al. (2013)</xref> suggest that the activated state of the channel, which has the lowest ion binding affinity, is not susceptible to the effect of ion parameters. Their simulations of the Kv1.2/2.1 chimeric channel have shown that the ion force field has little influence on the permeation mechanism since parameters that yield different magnitudes of K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interaction still sustained similar mechanisms involving alternating ions and water molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>). It remains unclear why permeation in the open KcsA channel appears to be susceptible to the ion force field while permeation in the Kv1.2/2.1 chimera is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köpfer et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The outer helix is involved in activation gating</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, the widening of the selectivity filter is associated with movement of the pore helix. Interestingly, only the lower part of the pore helix moves outward upon activation, while the upper part of the pore helix remains mostly unchanged. The lower pore helix segment is in direct contact with the outer transmembrane helix (TM1) at the level of residue L40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The side chain of this leucine is within van der Waals distance from the side chains of Ser69 and Val70 at the bottom of the pore helix. The simulations reveal that the distances between the L40 alpha carbon (C<sub>α</sub>) atoms of opposing subunits increases by about 1 Å as the TM1s move outward upon opening of the intracellular gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is this outward movement of TM1 at the level of L40 that gives the pore helix and the selectivity filter the required room to expand at the base and become conductive. This mechanism predicts that reducing the volume of the residue at position 40 by mutation to a smaller amino acid would similarly provide more space for the pore helix and selectivity filter to expand, and would make it easier for the filter to open and become conductive. Such a mutation would thus favor permeation by reducing the coupling between channel activation and selectivity filter opening. To test this hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological analysis of the L40A KcsA channel mutant.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25844.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Contacts between the TM helices and the pore helix that can potentially transmit the activation signal.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) vdW interactions of the individual residues of the TM1 and TM2 helices with the pore helix. Residue Leu40 from TM1 forms the strongest interactions.

The gating behavior displayed by L40A was identical to that of H25R, a mutant designed to mimic constitutive protonation at histidine 25, the KcsA proton sensor where proton binding is most strongly coupled to channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Posson et al., 2013a</xref>). First, the mutation of H25 to arginine removed the proton binding sites at H25 that strongly and cooperatively contributed to the opening of the control channel, yielding a shallower dose-response for the mutant channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Second, the arginine substitution mimicked histidine protonation, which dramatically increased the intrinsic gating equilibrium (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) towards the open state (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Surprisingly, the L40A mutation displays a proton dose-response that is as shallow as H25R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting that the potency of the H25 sensor is diminished in this mutant by as much as removing the sensor altogether. In addition, the L40A channel begins to open at lower proton doses in much the same way as H25R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We thus propose that the L40A mutation similarly favors channel opening both by increasing the intrinsic gating (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) compared to the E71A control and by altering the state-dependence of H25 protonation (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Both changes are necessary to fit the data and constitute the most parsimonious model to fit the gating behavior of the L40A mutant. We propose that these effects result from partial uncoupling of the bottom of the pore helix from the TM1 helix and from the protonation state of H25. A residue at a position equivalent to KcsA L40 was previously found to control permeation and open probability in another K channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K channel (KCa3.1) that gates at the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garneau et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting a common mechanism.</p><p>To verify the impact of the L40A mutation on K<sup>+</sup> permeation, we performed simulations of this mutant using the closed conformation (pdb entry 1K4C), as well as the 3F7V structure in which the main gate is open less widely than in 3F5W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cuello et al., 2010b</xref>).

Free energy barriers of 6 to 10 kcal/mol are observed between the 2-ion and 3-ion states. The E71A/L40A mutant brings about fluctuations that reduce the ion binding affinity and the relative stability of the 3-ion state. The 2-ion states are stabilized by about 6 kcal/mol, and are thus more accessible. The free energy barriers along the permeation pathway are also reduced to 4–5 kcal/mol. In the partially open conformation (3F7V), the control channel shows reduced free energy barriers of about 4 kcal/mol. The L40A mutant further reduces the barriers by 1 to 2 kcal/mol, to 2–3 kcal/mol.

This is in agreement with the observation made by EPR experiments that the conducting state of the KcsA selectivity filter displays larger fluctuations than non-conducting states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raghuraman et al., 2014</xref>). Such changes in the structural dynamics of the selectivity filter through activation could also explain the sub-conductance levels with altered selectivity detected by electrophysiology measurements in Shaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zheng and Sigworth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chapman and VanDongen, 2005</xref>). Our work shows how fluctuations at the selectivity filter have direct impact on its conductance and gating properties, and could potentially be affected by other signaling factors, e.g. temperature and membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rodríguez et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25844.018</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The selectivity filter as the center of the activation mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The superposition of the open and closed channel illustrates how the movement of the TM1 helices (arrow 1) allows for the displacement of the pore helix and slight expansion of the selectivity filter (arrow 2). (<bold>B</bold>) The selectivity filter is found in three states (closed (resting), open, inactivated) that determine the functional state of the channel.

The corresponding helix in voltage-dependent channels is S5, which is directly connected to the voltage-sensor through a linker (S4-S5 linker). This linker is believed to interact directly with the S6 helix to open the channel at the intracellular ‘bundle crossing’. While S5 was generally thought to play little role in activation gating, it is plausible that the voltage-sensor exerts force on S5 and by doing so regulates the conductance of the selectivity filter through interactions with the pore helix, without necessarily engaging the S6 helix via the S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lees-Miller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garneau et al., 2014</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, previous results by other groups showed that voltage activation can occur without an S4-S5 linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lörinczi et al., 2015</xref>) and that the S4-S5 linker in a subset of voltage-dependent channels does not directly engage the S6 helix (e.g. EAG channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Whicher and MacKinnon, 2016</xref>)). This does not exclude that the inner TM helices may form, in KcsA and other channels (such as voltage-gated channels), a second steric barrier at the intracellular end of the pore. This model also fits the behavior of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels, found to ultimately open and close at the selectivity filter, although the gating is accompanied by a large movement of the pore-lining inner helices not unlike that found in voltage-gated channels and KcsA, albeit less obstructive at the intracellular entryway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Posson et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our work contributes a unified gating mechanism for all K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels. We propose that the selectivity filter can be found in at least three different states that determine the functional states of the channel: a restrictive closed state, a dynamic and slightly expanded open state, and a pinched inactivated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Transitions between these functional states are controlled by the channel transmembrane domains that provide distant allosteric interactions between the selectivity filter and disparate regulatory sites such as voltage sensor and ligand binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Panyi and Deutsch, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clarke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wylie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Posson et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we propose that the universal gate in K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels is the selectivity filter, whereas the pore-lining helices may undergo large motions that can lead to a secondary closure point at the intracellular bundle-crossing for a subset of K<bold><sup>+</sup></bold> channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular simulation systems</title><p>The molecular membrane systems were built based on the X-ray structure of the KcsA channel in its high-[K<sup>+</sup>] closed conformation (pdb entry 1K4C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhou et al., 2001</xref>) and the open inactivated structures (pdb entries 3F7V and 3F5W) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuello et al., 2010a</xref>). Helical turns were added to the transmembrane helices of the two open structures so that these helices have the same length in all constructs, each subunit containing residues 22 to 124. All residues were assigned their standard protonation state at pH 7, except Glu71, which was protonated. The E71A and L40A mutations were applied to the X-ray structures and a new system was built for each independent case. The systems were assembled using the CHARMM-GUI web-service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jo et al., 2008</xref>) following a protocol developed by Woolf and Roux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Woolf and Roux, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2014</xref>).

The number of ions in the bulk was adjusted to reproduce an ionic concentration of about 150 mM KCl and to obtain neutral systems, which typically yields a total of 19 cations and 31 anions. The resulting molecular systems each contained about 48,000 atoms.</p><p>All calculations were performed using the CHARMM software version c36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brooks et al., 2009</xref>). The all-atom potential energy function CHARMM36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Best et al., 2012</xref>) was used for protein and phospholipids, and water molecules were modeled using the TIP3P potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 1983</xref>).

The solvation free energy of K<sup>+</sup> in liquid amide is not experimentally known, but by comparison with data available for similar organic solvents one would suggest a value of about −2 kcal/mol in reference to solvation in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marcus et al., 1988</xref>). Given the uncertainty on this value and that it is arguably small, it was decided in the context of the free energy calculations published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernèche and Roux (2001)</xref> to set the K<sup>+</sup> solvation free energy in liquid amide and water equal. For consistency with this previous work, we maintained the same parameters for the current study. Periodic boundary conditions were applied and long-range electrostatic interactions were calculated using the Particle Mesh Ewald algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Essmann et al., 1995</xref>). The molecular systems were equilibrated for about 400 ps with decreasing harmonic restraints applied to the protein atoms, the ions and the water molecules localized in the P-loop and the filter.

In the simulations of the open E71A constructs, the conformation of the intracellular gate was maintained by a harmonic root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD) restraints (force constant of 10 kcal/mol•Å with an offset of 0.1 Å) applied to residues 22 to 38 and 100 to 124.

Starting from a single initial configuration, this self-learning approach automatically constructs simulation windows following the valleys of lower free energy. PMF calculations were initiated from the occupancy states S1-S3-Cav and S0-S2-S4 as specified in the text. The upper free energy limit for the creation of new windows was set to 12 kcal/mol. The reaction coordinates were defined as the distance along the pore axis (which is aligned with the Z axis) between an ion, or the center-of-mass of two ions, and the center of mass of the selectivity filter backbone (residues 75 to 79). Independent simulations of 600 ps were performed every 0.5 Å along these reaction coordinates using a biasing harmonic potential with a force constant of 20 kcal/mol•Å<sup>2</sup> and were unbiased using the weighted histogram analysis method (WHAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kumar et al., 1992</xref>) with a grid spacing of 0.1 Å in both dimensions. The first 100 ps of sampling is considered as equilibration and is not included in the final PMF calculation. For each PMF, the reference free energy value is set to zero at the free energy minimum. The statistical error on the PMF calculations is calculated by subdividing the sampling in slices of 100 ps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). In a subsequent step, a free energy off-set is attributed to each interval PMF according to a least-square fit to the final PMF considering only the grid points for which the free energy is &lt;6 kcal/mol. Using the PMFs of the last five intervals as an ensemble, the standard deviation is calculated at every grid points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The PMFs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> were obtained from the combined sampling of two independent automated umbrella-sampling simulations initiated in different ion occupancy states, respectively S1-S3-Cav and S0-S2-S4.

These free energy simulations were performed based on the 3.2 Å structure of the closed KcsA channel (pdb entry 1BL8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Doyle et al., 1998</xref>) using CHARMM22, an earlier generation of the CHARMM force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MacKerell et al., 1998</xref>). Since then, correction terms were added to the <italic>Φ</italic>, <italic>Ψ</italic> backbone potential energy function in the CHARMM force field to better reproduce crystallographic data and quantum mechanic calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackerell et al., 2004</xref>). As documented by MacKerell and co-workers, these corrections, which are now included in the CHARMM36 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Best et al., 2012</xref>), led to a decrease of the backbone RMS fluctuations across all tested proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mackerell et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, the CHARMM22 force field was biased toward higher backbone fluctuations, which favored ion permeation in simulations of the closed KcsA channel as reflected by the PMF calculations found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernèche and Roux (2001)</xref>. The CHARMM36 force field, on the other hand, results in more limited fluctuations of the KcsA selectivity filter that are not sufficient to sustain ion permeation in the closed channel. Repeating the PMF calculation on the 1BL8 structure using the latest force field yielded essentially the same results as those obtained with the 1K4C structure, and thus the differences between those structures are not critical (data not shown). The fluctuations required for ion permeation are recovered when the intracellular gate of the channel opens. The CHARMM22 force field allowed for a description of the ion permeation mechanism in the selectivity filter of K<sup>+</sup> channels. The CHARMM36 force field allows us to go further and explain how ion permeation is regulated.</p><p>Our findings differ from those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köpfer et al. (2014)</xref> who proposed a hard knock-on mechanism in which the binding of 4 ions to the selectivity filter is required for permeation to take place in the open KcsA channel, versus 3 ions intercalated with water molecules in our simulations. Although Köpfer and colleagues also have used the CHARMM36 force field, they have not, unlike us, applied a NBFIX correction to the interaction between K<sup>+</sup> and backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms. This lead to a stronger K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interaction in their CHARMM36 simulations compared to ours, with a difference in K<sup>+</sup> solvation-free energy in liquid amide of about 8 kcal/mol. For ion permeation to take place, the ion binding affinity to the selectivity filter needs to be compensated by the ion-ion electrostatic repulsion. Thus, in the systems of Koepfer et al. (2014)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Köpfer et al., 2014</xref>, the intrinsically higher ion-binding affinity requires a higher number of bound ions to promote ion permeation, impeding at the same time the entrance of water molecules into the selectivity filter.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein purification and reconstitution</title><p>The L40A mutation was made in a construct of the non-inactivating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cordero-Morales et al., 2006</xref>) KcsA-E71A pQE60 by QuikChange mutagenesis (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and verified with sequencing.

Decades of work on various proteins in this family demonstrate that for many members, such as the Shaker Kv channel, the internal pore functions as a gate to regulate ion permeation. In these instances, the selectivity filter in the external pore determines the species of ions that can permeate and functions as an inactivation gate to limit ion permeation as the channel inactivates in the continual presence of an activating stimuli. For some members, such as BK and CNG channels, the internal pore undergoes a conformational change in response to the activating stimuli but seems to not function as a barrier to ion permeation; in these instances, the selectivity filter has been proposed to function as the primary gate. Multiple structures have been solved of the KcsA potassium channel in closed and open states, showing that the internal pore indeed opens in response to protonation and that the selectivity enters what appears to be an inactivated conformation. Previous simulations from this group and others have suggested that the selectivity filter is capable of supporting ion permeation in channels with a closed internal pore. Based on computation investigations of the KcsA potassium channel using improved force fields, the authors now propose that the structure of the selectivity filter is <italic>not</italic> capable of supporting ion permeation in channels with a closed internal pore, and that opening of the internal pore articulates a subtle structural change in the filter to a conducting state. The idea they advance is that the filter fluctuates between non-conducting closed to conducting open and then to non-conducting inactivated states, and that outward movement of the TM1 helix articulates the closed to open structural change in the filter. They further propose that L40 in TM1 directly interacts with S69 and V70 at the bottom of the pore helix to couple movements of the internal pore with the closed-open change in the filter. When viewed with a perspective of everything that is known about gating of ion access to the pores of different channels in the family of tetrameric cation channels, they advance the idea that it is the selectivity filter that functions as a universal gate in all channels, and although movement of the internal pore is required to open the filter, it need not actually close to prevent ion permeation. The ideas advanced in this manuscript are fascinating and if true would represent a major advance in our understanding of gating in the large and diverse family of tetrameric cation channels. The following are issues that the authors need to address in revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The functional characterization of the L40A mutant needs to be enhanced and more rigorously presented. The authors fit the Po-pH relationship with a specific model wherein Lo increases, from which they conclude that opening is favored. This is not very convincing when one sees kinetics like those shown at pH 5.5 where both open and closed times appear to decrease. The authors need to show more data, including traces and both open and closed time distributions at different pH values, and do a better job of articulating what exactly can be learned from their analysis. Can the results only be interpreted as an increase in Lo? The authors should also mention the caveat that which gate(s) is(are) opening and closing during the single channel recordings is unclear.</p><p>2) The authors should do a better job of describing their manipulations to the filter to make it conductive. The brief description in the second paragraph of the subsection “Relaxation of the selectivity filter is required for ion permeation”, says little and one must go to the methods for even a conceptual picture of what was done. How do we know the result is not some artificially widened or broken filter? We are told the filter is occupying space left open by the outward movement of L40 by TM1, but is there evidence for a stable open filter state, such as through time-dependent structural analysis?</p><p>3) It is essential that the authors present simulations that explicitly demonstrate permeation events can occur at a reasonable rate through the water-mediated knock-on mechanism depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> – when the channel is in the activated state hypothesized here (i.e. both at the intracellular gate and the filter), and when a reasonable membrane voltage is applied across the membrane. We appreciated that the focus of this study is not the mechanism of K<sup>+</sup> permeation per se; however, the fact is that authors consider the feasibility of permeation as the reporter of the activation state, logically. E.g. the filter is said to be inactive in the closed state of KcsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) because permeation appears unfeasible – for the specific mechanism considered in the PMF calculations. It is therefore key to show this is the relevant mechanism. We also appreciate that the PMF surface in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> is consistent with possibility of fast diffusion (in contrast to that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but this calculation does not explicitly demonstrate that permeation events will be observed, or that they will proceed primarily though the mechanism that is evaluated in the PMF calculations. Our request stems from the apparent discrepancy between the results presented here and those previously reported by Koepfer et al. in Science 2014, 346 p352 – who do focus on the mechanism of K<sup>+</sup> permeation. In that study, the authors consider a hypothetically conducting state of KcsA that is based on an open structure of the channel (PDB 3f5w), but with a selectivity filter re-modeled as in the closed state (1k4c). Our understanding is that here, Heer et al. consider this same hypothetical state, although we imagine the structures are not identical to begin with. Koepfer et al. do not compute PMF surfaces, and instead design their simulations to evaluate the rate of ion permeation across the channel under an applied membrane voltage – without imposing a specific mechanism, aside from the starting condition. The results that are relevant here are those obtained with the CHARMM36 forcefield – which is also used here. At ~300 mV Koepfer et al. observe no permeation events through a water-mediated knock-on mechanism akin to that studied in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, where 2 ions occupy the filter (S1-S4 sites) at a time. Instead, Koepfer et al. report that permeation events occur when 4 ions occupy the filter, under larger voltages (~600 mV). The data and conclusions of this study implicit contradict the results of Koepfer et al., but the authors do not explicitly address this discrepancy – which, in our view, not only undermines the impact of this study, but will also add further confusion to the field. We therefore believe that it is essential that additional simulations be provided to more directly demonstrate that a water-mediated knock-on mechanism is indeed the primary permeation mechanism.</p><p>4) What is striking in this manuscript is the abandonment of the past Nature paper by Berneche and Roux 2001, with recomputed calculations yielding very different answers. The low (1-2 kcal/mol) barriers for ion movement in 2001 and high (7 kcal/mol) barriers here in 2017 are explained loosely in terms of improved force fields, with reference to supplementary materials (being only general) glossing over a critical issue. If changes in protein force field in CHARMM are responsible for a slight change in positional distribution sufficient to eliminate conduction, then it is vital that the accuracy of those new terms for the particular selectivity filter secondary structure be explained. The authors could also compare distributions (like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>) between existing old and new force field simulations to show the difference.</p><p>5) The identification of L40 in the communication of gate-filter change is interesting, but discussion of the subsequent simulations of this mutant focuses only on a partially activated state. The lacking effect on the closed state is dismissed. Surely, if L40 is important, the presumed non-conducting filter would become more flexible around S4 and reduce the barrier toward 2 kcal/mol. i.e. Why does Leu-Ala mutation not free up space behind the pore helix comparable to slight TM1 movement? Is it a matter of not sampling the change in short 20ns (or 600ns umbrella sampling) simulations?</p><p>6) The authors set K<sup>+</sup> water and liquid amide solvation free energies equal. KCl partitioning involves a 3.5 kcal/mol shift (Yu et al. 2010. JACS. 132:10847), and we might expect some difference for K<sup>+</sup>? DE Shaw (Jensen et al. 2013. J. Gen. Physiol. 141:619), and more recently de Groot et al., have explored the roles of K-carbonyl parameters, perhaps warranting more explanation for the choice, which could determine the barriers that distinguish conduction states. If you change the K<sup>+</sup> – C=O interaction enough, you will change the mechanism altogether. But even small changes can alter the maps presented. How do we know what is right?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanism of Activation at the Selectivity Filter of the KcsA K<sup>+</sup> Channel&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Kenton Swartz, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have done a good job revising the manuscript to address the reviewers' comments. As a result the manuscript has been greatly improved, and it is now considerably more accessible to the general reader. However there remain two concerns that must be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>The first concern pertains to the length of the unbiased simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) provided in support of the water-mediated knock-on mechanism analyzed in the free-energy landscapes. Given that the applied potential is fairly large (400 mV) it is a concern that this simulation might simply reflect a perturbation of the KWKWK configuration assumed initially. This concern would be addressed if the trajectory was extended to reveal the permeation of K<sup>+</sup> ions not initially bound to the selectivity filter.</p><p>The second issue pertains to the free-energy landscapes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> – which derive from the combination of the 'forward' and 'backward' calculations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The extent to which these 'forward' and 'backward' free-energy surfaces differ from each other is problematic. This difference is arguably a good indicator of the statistical error of the calculations, and is typically much greater than the error inferred from the block analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>. It can be therefore questioned whether the simulation data supports the conclusion that the L40A mutation reduces the free-energy barriers between the two ion configurations considered. It would be important that the authors demonstrate that the magnitude of this change exceeds the magnitude of the error, either through additional analysis of the existing data or, if necessary, with additional simulations.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Mechanism of Activation at the Selectivity Filter of the KcsA K<sup>+</sup> Channel&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We will not discuss further the limited unbiased simulations as we believe they demonstrate, in a limited way, that conduction might occur with water mediation. But concern remains about the calculations to observe the effect of L40A mutation, which should be addressed, or at least presented in a way that more transparently reflects the possible uncertainties in those calculations.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> attempted to show that L40A mutation influences PMF barriers, and is thus important to the story. The authors volunteered separate simulations with S0-S2-S4 and S1-S3-Cav starting points, yielding free energy maps that differ by up to 7 kcal/mol, with very different shapes. Yet the authors just combined these trajectories into a single WHAM solution to yield <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. When questioned about this, the authors added unconvincing statements in the caption to suggest that this has nothing to do with error. They just cite a past study that shows combination of different endpoint free energies using Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) can lead to improvement (and note that their theory WHAM and BAR become the same in the limit of infinitesimal bin size; though that is not the case here). While it might be credible, in general, that one can extract some meaningful data from such combination of disparate histograms, it is misleading to write in this fashion, as that study has not been demonstrated to have similar extents of endpoint distribution overlap that could allow judgment of error here. The statements come across as if it has been shown for this current problem that it would not lead to error, which is not the case. In fact there is <italic>no</italic> guarantee that one can combine any endpoint calculations and expect the combination to be meaningful. If the authors are to argue this line, then they should be obliged to carry out analysis to demonstrate the resultant errors are indeed small, as currently they remain undetermined.</p><p>We have limited faith in the quantitative nature of the combined results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Without demonstration of the magnitude of the errors in the combined WHAM calculations, we cannot put a measure of confidence in the results for the effects of mutation. This is not the main result of the paper, but it is one interesting component. We suggest that the misleading comments be removed and replaced with statements about likely uncertainties based on the supplementary figure results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25844.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The functional characterization of the L40A mutant needs to be enhanced and more rigorously presented.

We reworked <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to now include 3 sets of single-channel traces for comparison between the control channel, the L40A, and the H25R mutant channels. It is now easy to see that the control channel is closed at pHs ranging from 7 to 5.5 and opens very cooperatively with protons over ~0.5 pH units, where the activity goes from nearly 0 to 100%. Indeed, it is difficult to identify a recording where the control channel is captured at an intermediate pH where it displays an intermediate open probability. In contrast, L40A opens at lower proton concentrations than the control channel, and has much less cooperative opening, as evidenced by the gradually increasing activity displayed at intermediate pH conditions. This is manifested in a decreased Hill slope for L40A compared with the control, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.</p><p>Thus, proton binding is less coupled to L40A channel opening, to an extent mimicking that of a KcsA mutant with an extreme phenotype where one of two pH sensors was mutated, H25R, with single channel records shown side by side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and dose response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. The simplest way to interpret the behavior of both mutants in the context of a model we previously proposed in Posson et al., 2014, is to increase L0, since the channels require fewer protons to open and are open at intermediate levels of pH. The results cannot only be interpreted as a decrease in L0 since the decrease in slope also requires less coupling between proton binding and channel opening, and was best (and most parsimoniously) fit with only one weak pH sensor, as opposed to the two (one strong, one weak) required by the control channel. It is of course possible to fit L40A dose-response with more complex models, for instance involving two weak pH sensors instead of one. However, since we do not have any information about the degree of involvement of the individual sensors in the gating of this mutant and we are not drawing any conclusions based on the number of pH sensors remaining, we did not elaborate on these alternative models and stuck with the most parsimonious model required to fit the data.</p><p>We believe that kinetic analysis of KcsA gating is not necessary for an appreciation of the impact the L40A mutation has on channel function, as described above. Since we did not perform any kinetic analysis of either the control channel or L40A, we have removed all reference to gating kinetics from the paper. The significance that position L40 has on KcsA gating can now be easily understood using the proton dose-responses and the sets of single-channel traces of the control and mutant channels, L40A and H25R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). All these properties have been described with an improved text in the third paragraph of the subsection “The outer helix is involved in activation gating”.</p><p>We added a sentence in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> where we state that we don’t know the identity of the gates that open and close during the single-channel recording traces shown.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should do a better job of describing their manipulations to the filter to make it conductive.

We believe that this approach, which does not involve direct restraints on the selectivity filter itself, minimizes the possibility of introducing structural artifacts into the channel.</p><p>We have improved the description of the open state model preparation as follows: “Two KcsA structures with an open bundle-crossing and collapsed selectivity filter (pdb entries 3F7V and 3F5W, with intracellular entryway diameters of 23 Å and 32 Å, respectively) were chosen for the preparation of simulations of an open KcsA channel. […] This procedure led to a selectivity filter nearly identical in structure with that of the closed state KcsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>).” Further details are provided in a new subsection “Modeling the open activated selectivity filter” in Materials and Methods.</p><p>The molecular representations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> show that the selectivity filter can locally enlarge to accommodate ions and water molecules in intermediate states, but overall maintains a canonical conformation.

A time-series analysis is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>.

While it is beyond the scope of the present work to examine the root cause of these differences (this is indeed an ongoing effort across several groups), we have added the following additional text: “Departing from the permeation mechanism described here which involves the binding of three ions to the selectivity filter, Koepfer et al. (2014) suggested a hard knock-on mechanism in which ion permeation arise from the entrance of a 4th ion, excluding water molecules from the selectivity filter. This discrepancy between the two proposed permeation mechanisms is in part due to difference in the K<sup>+</sup> ion force field parameters, which results in much stronger ion binding affinity to the selectivity filter in the study by Koepfer et al. (see subsection “Force field and ion permeation” in Materials and methods).” This paragraph is followed by a discussion related to point 6 below.</p><p>We also added a more technical discussion in the subsection “Force field and ion permeation” in Materials and methods: “Our findings differ from those of Koepfer et al. (2014) who proposed a hard knock-on mechanism in which the binding of 4 ions to the selectivity filter is required for permeation to take place in the open KcsA channel, versus 3 ions intercalated with water molecules in our simulations. […] Thus, in the systems of Koepfer et al., the intrinsically higher ion binding affinity requires a higher number of bound ions to show ion permeation, impeding at the same time the entrance of water molecules into the selectivity filter.”</p><p>While Koepfer et al. have used several different force fields we have limited our discussion to their simulations based on the CHARMM force field, which are representative of their general conclusions. The apparent discrepancy between different simulation studies and the divergent permeation mechanisms should be addressed more exhaustively in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is striking in this manuscript is the abandonment of the past Nature paper by Berneche and Roux 2001, with recomputed calculations yielding very different answers.

If changes in protein force field in CHARMM are responsible for a slight change in positional distribution sufficient to eliminate conduction, then it is vital that the accuracy of those new terms for the particular selectivity filter secondary structure be explained.

This essentially is as follows.</p><p>The simulations published in Bernèche and Roux, 2001 were performed with the CHARMM22 force field. Since then, correction terms were added to the 𝜙, 𝜓 backbone potential energy function in the CHARMM force field to better reproduce crystallographic data and quantum mechanic calculations (2). As documented by MacKerell and co-workers, these corrections, which are now included in the CHARMM36 force field (3), led to a decrease of the backbone RMS fluctuations across all tested proteins (2). Thus, the CHARMM22 force field was biased toward higher backbone fluctuations, which was favoring ion permeation in K channels as reflected by the PMF calculations found in Bernèche and Roux, 2001. The CHARMM36 force field describes better the backbone fluctuations and shows that in the closed state of the KcsA channel, the fluctuations of the selectivity filter are not sufficient to sustain ion permeation. The fluctuations required for permeation are recovered when the intracellular gate of the channel opens up. The CHARMM22 force field allowed us to describe the ion permeation mechanism in the selectivity filter of K channels. The CHARMM36 force field allows us to go further and explain how ion permeation is regulated.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ suggestion to provide a comparison of the selectivity filter fluctuations between the older and newer versions of the force field, we added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> data extracted from simulations published in Bernèche and Roux (2001), which were based on the CHARMM22 force field. The plot shows that, using the CHARMM22 force field, the fluctuations of the selectivity filter in the closed channel are slightly larger than the fluctuations observed in the open channel with CHARMM36.</p><p>2) MacKerell Jr. A.D., Feig M., and Brooks III C.L. &quot;Extending the treatment of backbone energetics in protein force fields: limitations of gas-phase quantum mechanics in reproducing protein conformational distributions in molecular dynamics simulations.&quot; Journal of Computational Chemistry, 25: 1400-1415, 2004.</p><p>3) Best R.B., Zhu X., Shim J., Lopes P.E.M., Mittal J., Feig M., and MacKerell Jr. A.D. &quot;Optimization of the additive CHARMM all-atom protein force field targeting improved sampling of the backbone phi, psi and side-chain chi1 and chi2 dihedral angles.&quot; Journal of Chemical Theory and Computation, 8: 3257-3273, 2012.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The identification of L40 in the communication of gate-filter change is interesting, but discussion of the subsequent simulations of this mutant focuses only on a partially activated state. The lacking effect on the closed state is dismissed.

After analysis of the free energy data, we considered the possibility of a hysteresis, i.e. a dependency on the starting ion occupancy state of the PMF calculations, which could obfuscate the mechanism. We thus ran new PMF calculations starting from the S0-S2-S4 occupancy state for both the control channel and the L40A mutant in the closed (PDB ID 1K4C) and the partially activated (PDB ID 3F7V) conformations. The PMF calculations shown in the original manuscript were initiated in occupancy state S1-S3-Cav. The forward and backward umbrella sampling data were combined and yielded new PMFs, which we present in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. The effect of the L40A mutant is now clearly visible in the closed channel, as the free energy barriers between stable occupancy states are lower, and new stable states are made accessible in comparison to the control channel. In the partially activated conformation, the effect is less strong but it is still visible. This is expected since the opening of the channel reduces the steric interactions between residue L40 and the pore helix, and thus the impact of the L40A mutation is reduced. The discussion on page 9 was modified accordingly. The individual forward and backward PMFs are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and show that the L40A mutation facilitates ion permeation in all cases, except one that is non-conclusive. We believe these results are more comprehensive than those presented in the original version of the manuscript and we thank the reviewers for requesting that we address this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors set K<sup>+</sup> water and liquid amide solvation free energies equal. KCl partitioning involves a 3.5 kcal/mol shift (Yu et al. 2010. JACS. 132:10847), and we might expect some difference for K<sup>+</sup>? DE Shaw (Jensen et al. 2013. J. Gen. Physiol. 141:619), and more recently de Groot et al., have explored the roles of K-carbonyl parameters, perhaps warranting more explanation for the choice, which could determine the barriers that distinguish conduction states. If you change the K<sup>+</sup> – C=O interaction enough, you will change the mechanism altogether. But even small changes can alter the maps presented. How do we know what is right?</p></disp-quote><p>The solvation free energy of K<sup>+</sup> in liquid amide has not been experimentally determined. By comparison with data available for K<sup>+</sup> in other similar organic solvents (4), the solvation free energy of K<sup>+</sup> in liquid amide was estimated to be -2 kcal/mol different from solvation of K<sup>+</sup> in water. Given that the value is uncertain and arguably small, it was decided in the context of the free energy calculations published in 2001 to set the K<sup>+</sup> solvation free energies in liquid amide and water equal (Bernèche and Roux, Nature 2001). For consistency with this previous work, we maintained the same parameters for the current study. A mention to this effect was added to the Materials and methods subsection “Molecular simulation systems” (last paragraph).</p><p>Regarding the concern reviewers have toward the effects of changing the K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interaction parameters, previous simulations performed by Jensen et al. (2013) based on the open Kv1.2/2.1 channel show that the permeation mechanism is robust and is not dictated by the ion force field. They reported that the outcome of changing the parameters defining the interaction between K<sup>+</sup> ions and carbonyl groups (i.e. by either incorporating the NBFIX correction mentioned above or leaving it out) is a change in the relative probabilities of observing the two permeation pathways described in Bernèche and Roux (2001) and in the current manuscript, i.e. the knock-on and vacancy diffusion pathways. These pathways alternate between 2-ion and 3-ion occupancy states, with intercalated water molecules. Thus, the activated state of the channel, which has the lowest ion binding affinity, is not susceptible to the effect of the parameters defining the K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interactions.</p><p>Similarly, as we demonstrated in this manuscript using the weakest K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interaction (i.e. using the NBFIX correction), the closed state of the KcsA selectivity filter presents the highest ion binding affinity, and further strengthening of the K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interactions by removing the NBFIX correction would simply increase further the ion binding affinity and prevent permeation. Thus, we are confident that the choice of K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl parameters, within the range of values previously used, does not affect the interpretation of the mechanism we proposed here, for either the open or closed states of K<sup>+</sup> channels.</p><p>It remains unclear why, in the study of de Groot and colleagues, permeation in the open KcsA channel is susceptible to the ion force field (see point 3 above), while, in the study of Jensen et al., permeation in the Kv1.2/2.1 chimera is not. One possibility is that the truncated structure of the open KcsA is not as stable as the Kv1.2/2.1 structure and that small, uncontrolled reorientation of the TM helices in KcsA could partially close the selectivity filter and increase its ion binding affinity. This increase of ion binding affinity combined with an ion force field that defines stronger K<sup>+</sup>-carbonyl interactions could result in a system in which the selectivity filter can bind four K ions. In order to prevent such uncontrolled conformational changes of the open intracellular gate in KcsA, we applied a rmsd restraint to residues on the intracellular side of TM1 and TM2 (see Materials and methods).</p><p>This discussion is summarized as follows at the end of the paragraph related to point 3 above: “[…] it is important to consider that, as shown here, the ion binding affinity is essentially determined by the functional state of the selectivity filter. […] It remains unclear why permeation in the open KcsA channel is susceptible to the ion force field while permeation in the Kv1.2/2.1 chimera is not (Jensen 2013, Koepfer 2014).”</p><p>4) Marcus Y., Kamlet M.J., and Taft R.W. “Linear Solvation Energy Relationships.

As a result the manuscript has been greatly improved, and it is now considerably more accessible to the general reader. However there remain two concerns that must be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>The first concern pertains to the length of the unbiased simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) provided in support of the water-mediated knock-on mechanism analyzed in the free-energy landscapes. Given that the applied potential is fairly large (400 mV) it is a concern that this simulation might simply reflect a perturbation of the KWKWK configuration assumed initially. This concern would be addressed if the trajectory was extended to reveal the permeation of K<sup>+</sup> ions not initially bound to the selectivity filter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have extended the simulation to 200 ns. The trajectory shows that an incoming ion at t= 2 ns leaves the pore around t= 120 ns. In the interval t= 40 ns to 200 ns, the selectivity filter undergoes two full cycles starting with ions in S2-S4, followed by incoming ions around t= 45 ns and 105 ns, the release of ions at t= 45 ns and 120 ns, and the return to state S2-S4 around t= 50 ns and 190 ns. Note that the S2-S4 state was not imposed and emerges from the simulation, first at t= 40 ns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second issue pertains to the free-energy landscapes shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> – which derive from the combination of the 'forward' and 'backward' calculations described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The extent to which these 'forward' and 'backward' free-energy surfaces differ from each other is problematic. This difference is arguably a good indicator of the statistical error of the calculations, and is typically much greater than the error inferred from the block analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>. It can be therefore questioned whether the simulation data supports the conclusion that the L40A mutation reduces the free-energy barriers between the two ion configurations considered. It would be important that the authors demonstrate that the magnitude of this change exceeds the magnitude of the error, either through additional analysis of the existing data or, if necessary, with additional simulations.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with the view that the difference between the forward and backward free energy surfaces is a good indication of the statistical error. It was shown for free energy perturbation calculations that combining forward and backward sampling is improving the accuracy of the calculation and that the statistical error is much less than that inferred from the difference between the forward and backward simulations (Lu et al., 2003). Combining the forward and backward simulations is done using algorithms such as the Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (mBAR) or the Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) – mBAR corresponds to WHAM with a bin-width approaching zero. The same approach is here applied to potential of mean simulations.</p><p>We have added the following to the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>:</p><p>“In presence of the L40A mutation, free energy barriers are reduced under all four conditions. In the forward calculation of the closed channel, the L40A mutant impacts mainly on the transition between the S1-S3 and S2-S4 states, while in all other conditions the mutation also reduces the free energy barrier for a third ion to bind or unbind (transition toward or from state S0-S2-S4). […] The statistical error on the PMFs of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> was estimated using block averaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">5</xref>).”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors have made additions with extended unbiased simulations, and a response to the concern about hysteresis. We will not discuss further the limited unbiased simulations as we believe they demonstrate, in a limited way, that conduction might occur with water mediation. But concern remains about the calculations to observe the effect of L40A mutation, which should be addressed, or at least presented in a way that more transparently reflects the possible uncertainties in those calculations.</p><p>The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> attempted to show that L40A mutation influences PMF barriers, and is thus important to the story. The authors volunteered separate simulations with S0-S2-S4 and S1-S3-Cav starting points, yielding free energy maps that differ by up to 7 kcal/mol, with very different shapes. Yet the authors just combined these trajectories into a single WHAM solution to yield <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. When questioned about this, the authors added unconvincing statements in the caption to suggest that this has nothing to do with error. They just cite a past study that shows combination of different endpoint free energies using Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) can lead to improvement (and note that their theory WHAM and BAR become the same in the limit of infinitesimal bin size; though that is not the case here). While it might be credible, in general, that one can extract some meaningful data from such combination of disparate histograms, it is misleading to write in this fashion, as that study has not been demonstrated to have similar extents of endpoint distribution overlap that could allow judgment of error here. The statements come across as if it has been shown for this current problem that it would not lead to error, which is not the case. In fact there is no guarantee that one can combine any endpoint calculations and expect the combination to be meaningful. If the authors are to argue this line, then they should be obliged to carry out analysis to demonstrate the resultant errors are indeed small, as currently they remain undetermined.</p><p>We have limited faith in the quantitative nature of the combined results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Without demonstration of the magnitude of the errors in the combined WHAM calculations, we cannot put a measure of confidence in the results for the effects of mutation. This is not the main result of the paper, but it is one interesting component. We suggest that the misleading comments be removed and replaced with statements about likely uncertainties based on the supplementary figure results.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewers’ recommendations we have rearranged <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and its associated supplements. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 4</xref> and 5 now present the statistical error of the individual forward and backward calculations instead of being based on the combined sampling, which was problematic.</p><p>We believe that the combined PMFs provides a valuable and convenient summary of the complex picture depicted by the individual forward and backward simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, and thus we kept <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> as it was.

In the end, both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> lead us to the same conclusions.</p><p>We added the following to the main text:</p><p>“The free energy calculations presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> combine data from independent automated umbrella sampling simulations initiated in different ion occupancy states, as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>. The PMFs of both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 – figure supplement 1</xref> lead to the following observations. In the closed conformation (1K4C) of the control channel, the state with 3 ions bound to the filter (S0-S2-S4) is overly stabilized in comparison to states with only 2 ions bound to the filter (S1-S3-Cav and S2-S4-Cav), with a free energy difference of about 11 kcal/mol. Free energy barriers of 6 to 10 kcal/mol are observed between the 2-ion and 3-ion states. The E71A/L40A mutant brings about fluctuations that reduce the ion binding affinity and the relative stability of the 3-ion state. The 2-ion states are stabilized by about 6 kcal/mol, and are thus more accessible.[…].”</p><p>We also modified the captions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> as follows:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.[…] [W]ith a free energy difference between the 3-ion (S0-S2-S4) and the 2-ion (S1-S3-Cav and S2-S4-Cav) states of about 11 kcal/mol, and free energy barriers of up to 9 kcal/mol between these states. The L40A mutation stabilizes the 2-ion states by about 6 kcal/mol and reduces the free energy barriers to 4-5 kcal/mol. […] Each of the 4 PMFs shown here combines together data from two independent automated umbrella-sampling simulations initiated in states S1-S3-Cav and S0-S2-S4, respectively. Since the statistical error on the PMFs combined in this fashion might not be readily definable, we only present the statistical errors associated with the underlying individual PMFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 – figure supplements 1</xref> (individual PMFs), 4 (convergence) &amp; 5 (statistical error)).[…] Despite this limitation, the combined PMFs shown here provide a convenient summary of the underlying calculations presented separately in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>.”</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5 —figure supplement 1</xref>.[…]In the case of the closed channel (A), the main impact of the L40A mutation is to make accessible the states in which only 2 ions are bound to the selectivity filter (states S1-S3-Cav and S2-S4-Cav).

The L40A mutation adds fluctuations that reduce the binding affinity and the relative stability of the 3-ion state. In the partially activated channel (B), the main impact of the mutation is to reduce the free energy barrier along the permeation pathway […]”.</p><p>Finally, the following was added to the Materials and methods, in the subsection “Potential of Mean Force Calculations”:</p><p>“The PMFs presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> are obtained from the combined sampling of two independent automated umbrella-sampling simulations initiated in different ion occupancy states, respectively S1-S3-Cav and S0-S2-S4.
