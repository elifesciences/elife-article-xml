regulate motor output. In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging has demonstrated that spatially overlapping ensembles of direct and indirect pathway SPNs (dSPNs, iSPNs) are co-active during spontaneous movement. This co-activity is statistically greater among nearby neurons, correlates with behavioral state, and changes in an SPN-type-specific manner under pathological conditions. How this co-activity arises and whether it is important for movement are not well understood. Co-activity likely arises from shared excitatory inputs, the strength of which are scaled by well-characterized mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. Here, we show that the Group I metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5), which regulates the strength of corticostriatal synapses, is a key mediator of behaviorally relevant SPN co-activity. Pharmacological modulation of mGluR5 signaling bidirectionally altered movement and co-activity, but not the absolute level of activity in dSPNs. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs recapitulated the effects on spatiotemporal neural dynamics and movement, consistent with a striatum-specific effect of mGluR5 modulation. Targeted deletion of mGluR5 also produced changes in the synaptic properties of dSPNs. Separate from any effects on overall activity, our results show that excitatory synaptic modulation influences motor function by coordinating the spatial co-activation of dSPNs in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>motor behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04xeg9z08</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH099114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Contractor</surname><given-names>Anis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bidirectional modulation of the activity of the synaptic protein mGluR5 alters spontaneous mouse motor behavior and produces correlated changes in co-activity patterns among direct pathway neurons in the dorsal striatum.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The dorsal striatum is central to movement initiation and to regulating the kinematics of learned movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klaus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wolff et al., 2022</xref>). Synaptic plasticity in this input structure of the basal ganglia has been demonstrated to be important for motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dang et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, the strength of corticostriatal synapses between the motor cortex and spiny-projection neurons (SPNs) in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) is strengthened by learning a motor sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rothwell et al., 2015</xref>) or during the acquisition of a motor skill (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang et al., 2022</xref>). These glutamatergic, corticostriatal inputs form synapses onto two types of SPNs that are distinguished by their expression of dopamine receptor subtypes and downstream axonal projections. The D1 dopamine receptor-expressing, or direct pathway SPNs (dSPNs) project monosynaptically to the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and globus pallidus internal segment (GPi). By contrast, D2 dopamine receptor-expressing SPNs (iSPNs) project indirectly to basal ganglia output nuclei via the globus pallidus external segment (GPe) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerfen and Surmeier, 2011</xref>). In classical models of the basal ganglia circuit, activity in dSPNs facilitates movement, and activity in iSPNs inhibits movement. Therefore, the relative level of activity between the two populations is predicted to correlate with an animal’s motor state (e.g. moving or at rest).</p><p>This rate-model framework of striatal function garnered early support from anatomical and pharmacological observations as well as findings from studies investigating the neuropathology of striatum-related neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>). However, the model is inconsistent with more recent observations employing in vivo imaging techniques. In these studies, where the activity of genetically defined iSPNs and dSPNs can be monitored concurrently in awake behaving animals, dSPNs and iSPNs are consistently co-active during movement initiation and procession through movement sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, it was shown that dSPNs and iSPNs simultaneously activate with spatially clustered dynamics, and that this spatiotemporal organization is important for motor control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>). Spatiotemporal clustering, or heightened co-activity among proximal SPN pairs, is most pronounced during periods of rest, but also transiently increases during transitions from rest to movement, then subsides as SPNs become more active during movement progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, dopamine signaling appears to play an important role in sculpting these dynamics. The loss of dopamine diminishes the spatiotemporal coordination of iSPN activity, while heightened dopamine release decorrelates activity in dSPNs and heightens iSPN co-activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Although the mechanisms that constrain the spatiotemporal coordination of dSPN and iSPN activity are not precisely known, SPNs have hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials that prevent action potential generation in the absence of glutamatergic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson and Groves, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>). Given that glutamate is required for SPN activation, and given dopamine’s role in modifying the strength of glutamatergic synapses in SPNs, it is likely that synaptic plasticity influences the spatiotemporal dynamics of SPNs by regulating their collective sensitivity to convergent excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wall et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>dSPNs and iSPNs receive excitatory input from the cortex and thalamus. Cortico- and thalamostriatal synapses differ in their expression of pre- and post-synaptic neurotransmitter receptors and forms of synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive in vitro work has demonstrated various mechanistically distinct types of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) at cortical inputs to dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li and Pozzo-Miller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Surmeier et al., 2009</xref>). While the range of physiological and neuromodulatory mechanisms of corticostriatal plasticity are complex, one well-studied type of plasticity is endocannabinoid (eCB) dependent LTD, induced in vitro by moderate to high frequency stimulation of corticostriatal inputs paired with postsynaptic depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, corticostriatal LTD requires activation of postsynaptic Gq-linked, Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). mGluR activation causes the mobilization of endocannabinoids (eCBs) from the postsynaptic neuron which act as a retrograde signal by activating presynaptic CB1 receptors to reduce the release probability of glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerdeman et al., 2002</xref>). mGluR LTD occurs at corticostriatal synapses in both dSPNs and iSPNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagetta et al., 2011</xref>) but not at thalamostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). eCB release and retrograde signaling can also produce transient modulation of presynaptic release to cause the short-term depression of corticostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marshall et al., 2018</xref>), similar to what has been observed at synapses in several other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chevaleyre et al., 2006</xref>). Despite extensive in vitro work, little is known about the circumstances under which eCB-dependent synaptic modulation occurs in vivo and how it may relate to motor behavior. Moreover, it is unknown how the modulation of corticostriatal synaptic strength regulates the level and/or spatiotemporal dynamics of SPN activity with respect to movement.</p><p>In the striatum, mGluR5 has been shown to have a prominent role in mGluR-dependent synaptic plasticity. Therefore, we asked whether mGluR5 signaling contributes to voluntary movement and the dynamics of dSPN activity in the DLS. We found that manipulating mGluR5 signaling had bidirectional effects on movement and the spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPN activity, with minimal effects on their overall levels of activity. Specifically, using in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, we found that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 signaling produced a reduction in spontaneous movement and heightened the spatially clustered patterns of co-activity in dSPNs, whereas positive modulation of mGluR5 signaling had the opposite effects. Consistent with these findings, conditional knockout of mGluR5 in dSPNs (D1 cKO mice) had minimal effects on the levels of dSPN or iSPN activity but specifically increased the spatiotemporal coordination of dSPN activity and reduced spontaneous locomotion. Collectively, these findings suggest that mGluR-mediated synaptic plasticity mechanisms bidirectionally constrain the spatiotemporal coordination, but not the levels of dSPN activity, into states that correlate with increased or decreased locomotor activity. Our study lays the groundwork for dissociating the separable roles of the activity rates versus patterning of SPN activity in motor control and has implications for correcting disruptions of this patterning in basal ganglia-associated diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>dSPNs exhibit spatially clustered activity that varies with movement</title><p>There is a strong correlation between spatiotemporal patterns of SPN activity and motor output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>), but it is not known if synaptic properties modulate this coordinated activity in vivo. To assess the activity of dSPNs during spontaneous motor behavior, we implanted gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses into the dorsolateral striatum of mice expressing Cre-recombinase in dSPNs under the control of the <italic>Drd1a</italic> promoter. A Cre-dependent AAV to express GCaMP6f was introduced either by a prior stereotaxic injection of virus or by coating the lenses with a silk fibroin film containing the AAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackman et al., 2018</xref>). The GRIN lens was coupled to a head-mounted miniscope for 1 P imaging of somatic Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aharoni and Hoogland, 2019</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> shows an example of a field of view from one mouse and the segmented outlines of neurons after processing of the videos (<italic>see</italic> <bold>Methods</bold>) and examples of individual dSPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). Consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2023</xref>), Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rates in dSPNs increased during periods of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d and e</xref>). The probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events in detected cells (defined as fluorescence change of 2.5x the baseline for each cell, <italic>see</italic> <bold>Methods</bold>) increased during movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate increased with increasing animal velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that dSPNs and iSPNs are spontaneously co-active in spatially intermingled clusters, a feature that has been proposed to be important for action selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). To examine this spatiotemporal coordination and its modulation by movement state, we measured dSPN co-activity using a Jaccard index of dSPN pairs as a function of the Euclidean distance between the cell pairs in the DLS. This measure captures co-activity between neuron pairs (as opposed to co-inactivity) more specifically than a linear correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref><bold>; Methods</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). Across all cell pairs in the field of view for each session, a correlation matrix was generated in which, for each frame of the recording, the cell pair was scored a 1 if both cells were active, or 0 otherwise. These scores for each frame were divided by the number of events in both cells to generate a co-activity score for that pair. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref> shows schematized raster plots to demonstrate this process. Then, those values were normalized to averages measured from independently shuffled Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces for each cell in the recording (using 1000 independent shuffles for each cell trace), to control for changes in mean activity level between conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). If cells were co-active independently of distance, then a plot of co-activity normalized to the shuffled data as a function of distance would be flat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref><bold>, top</bold>), while clustered co-activity (i.e. higher among proximal cells) would show a downward-sloping curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref><bold>, bottom</bold>). Consistent with prior reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klaus et al., 2017</xref>), this analysis revealed that co-activity among neuron pairs is markedly higher among proximal cells and decreases with increasing Euclidean distance between pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref><bold>, top</bold>). Furthermore, as we had previously demonstrated, co-activity among all pairs was higher during rest and decreased during periods of movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref><bold>, top</bold>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Direct spiny-projection neurons (dSPNs) exhibit spatially clustered activity that varies with movement.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cartoon representation of implanted gradient refractive index (GRIN) lens and miniscope imaging in the dorsolateral striatum (DLS).

We then performed a pair of Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests (<bold>methods</bold>) to determine if the cumulative distribution of active cell distances in each frame was smaller (i.e. left-shifted or more ‘clustered’) or greater (right-shifted or less ‘clustered’) than that of the shuffled data. This analysis allows for visualization of how the spatiotemporal dynamics of SPN activity change instantaneously (e.g. during movement onset). Consistent with that reported previously, the degree of ‘clustered’ activity quantified in this way increased significantly during movement onset (within 2.5 s of the mouse initiating movement; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>).

In both cases, the SCI peaked around the time of movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>). This suggests that the most significant effect of mGluR5 on dSPN co-activity is to increase its overall extent, rather than the relative extent to which it becomes more or less ‘clustered’ during behavioral state transitions. As fenobam treatment reduced movement, and co-activity is modulated by movement, we separated our analysis into periods of movement and rest to compare equivalent behavioral states during vehicle and drug treatment. While fenobam treatment increased dSPN co-activity during both rest and movement, its effects were most pronounced during periods of rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j and k</xref>). However, in analyzing the relative increase in coactivity between rest and movement, there was no significant difference between fenobam and vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that fenobam may suppress movement by transitioning spatiotemporal dSPN ensemble dynamics towards a rest-associated state of high overall co-activity, without affecting the absolute rates of their activity. In this rest-associated state, overall neuronal activity is reduced but more correlated, resulting in a higher degree of co-activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>An mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) increases movement and decreases SPN co-activity</title><p>Next, we sought to determine how promoting mGluR5 signaling affects motor output and SPN dynamics.

We administered JNJ (100 mg/kg) or vehicle via i.p. injection 30 min prior to measuring dSPN dynamics for 1 hr during locomotion in an open field arena. In contrast to fenobam, JNJ treatment decreased the amount of time the animal spent at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

Additionally, there was no effect on the amplitude or duration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, JNJ significantly decreased the co-activity among dSPN cell pairs measured across a range of Euclidean distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>).

To address this question, we used a viral ‘Cre-off’ strategy to express GCaMP6 in Cre-negative, iSPNs of <italic>Drd1a</italic>-Cre; <italic>Grm5<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). We found that the deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs had no effects on either the levels of activity in iSPNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>) or their spatiotemporal clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). Therefore, the alteration in SPN dynamics in D1 cKO mice appears to be cell-autonomous, as specific targeting of mGluR5 in dSPNs did not affect iSPN activity in D1 cKO mice.</p><p>Together, these results demonstrate that the manipulation of mGluR5 signaling, through pharmacological or targeted genetic means, leads to changes in the spatiotemporal patterns of activity in dSPNs with minimal effects on their overall levels of activity. Notably, these spatiotemporal dynamics varied with locomotor speed under normal conditions, and manipulations of mGluR5 signaling induced changes in these dynamics that correlated with locomotor state. These findings suggest that these two facets of activity—levels and spatiotemporal patterning of activity—are separable and provide important insights into the role of spatiotemporally coordinated activity in the generation of movement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The rate-model of basal ganglia function posits that activity in dSPNs and iSPNs have distinct and opposing effects on movement. This framework is primarily based on anatomical evidence from the distinct projection targets of dSPNs and iSPNs and electrophysiological recordings in their downstream projection targets under conditions modeling Parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson and Kreitzer, 2014</xref>). These target nuclei inhibit motor control nuclei in the hindbrain mesencephalic locomotor region and thalamic regions that project to the motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McElvain et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Parent and de Bellefeuille, 1982</xref>). In this context, dSPN activation is predicted to increase activity in these motor control regions to facilitate movement, while iSPN activation is predicted to decrease activity in these same regions to inhibit movement.</p><p>However, this classical model is not supported by recent in vivo imaging studies using fiber photometry or endoscopy to record Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in genetically specified dSPNs or iSPNs. In contrast to the predictions of the rate model, dSPNs and iSPNs are indistinguishably responsive to increases and decreases in movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, in vivo endoscopy has shown that overlapping clusters of dSPNs and iSPNs co-activate during movement, with small but statistically significant correlations between the activation of different clusters during different movement types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbera et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest an alternative model where, in contrast to the relative level of activity in each SPN type, the degree of co-activity among SPNs and ensemble identity may be important for specifying proper motor output.</p><p>Despite evidence that SPNs may influence movement via the coordination of their activity, the biological mechanisms responsible for these coordinated patterns are not known. Seminal in vitro electrophysiology studies demonstrated that SPNs fire action potentials coincident with large excitatory inputs that shift their resting membrane potential to transiently stable, depolarized ‘up’ states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilson and Groves, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996</xref>). These excitatory inputs arise from the cortex and thalamus. Our results suggest that the modulation of the synaptic weight, particularly at corticostriatal synapses where several forms of plasticity require mGluR5 receptors, is a crucial mechanism constraining the patterns of dSPN co-activity in states associated with movement or rest.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Spontaneous motor output correlates with the level of coactivity in dSPNs</title><p>In the current work, we used pharmacological and genetic manipulations to examine how activity in dSPNs varies with movement while targeting the receptor controlling the dominant form of synaptic plasticity in the DLS. Systemic administration of the mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator, fenobam, led to significant increases in co-activity among dSPNs and reduced locomotor activity. By contrast, systemic administration of the mGluR5 positive allosteric modulator JNJ decreased dSPN co-activity and increased locomotion. Notably, neither pharmacological manipulation of mGluR5 led to significant changes in the rate of dSPN Ca<sup>2+</sup> events. Our results suggest a model whereby either potentiating or inhibiting mGluR5 signaling alters the recruitment of dSPNs such that the overall activity level is preserved but that the patterns of their co-activity change in a manner that corresponds to motor output. This is further confirmed by our data from animals with targeted deletion of mGluR5 in dSPNs, which similarly showed no change in event rate but an increase in co-activity.</p><p>Our results are consistent with prior analysis demonstrating that the co-activity among pairs of dSPNs is higher at rest than during movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yun et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we found that pharmacological manipulations that alter these clustered co-activity states correspondingly alter the levels of spontaneous motor output. Specifically, shifting the dSPN network to a level of higher co-activity, as with fenobam treatment or mGluR5 deletion in dSPNs, leads to a reduction in the amount of time animals spent moving. By contrast, potentiating mGluR5 receptors with systemic JNJ administration led to an increase in time spent moving and a corresponding decrease in the dSPN co-activity.</p><p>Our ex vivo electrophysiology data from cKO animals further supports these conclusions, as disrupting endogenous mGluR5 signaling in dSPNs does not result in changes in the excitability of neurons. Instead, genetic deletion of mGluR5 altered the synaptic properties of dSPNs, likely an adaptive response consistent with the established role of mGluR5 in regulating corticostriatal synaptic weights. These findings suggest that these selective changes in synaptic plasticity may underlie the altered spatiotemporal patterning of dSPN activity without changes in their overall levels of activity observed in vivo.</p><p>It is important to note that, in our pharmacological experiments, we observed that inhibition of mGluR5 with systemically administered fenobam increased the co-activity among active neuron pairs across all distance bins we measured. That is, co-activity was increased in both proximal and distal neuron pairs, and this increased co-activity correlated with decreased ambulatory behavior. Administration of an mGluR5 PAM decreased co-activity when measured across all binned distances of neuron pairs, and this occurred in coincidence with increased ambulatory behavior. It has previously been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>), and we replicated here, that surrounding movement onsets, there is an increase in the extent to which proximal neuron pairs are statistically more likely to be co-active than distal neuron pairs. Using a previously established metric for quantifying this increase, the spatial correlation index, we did not resolve any significant changes in the onset-related changes in this metric following either genetic or pharmacological alterations of mGluR5 activity. Our central finding, observed with both pharmacological and genetic manipulations, is that manipulating mGluR5 signaling alters overall dSPN co-activity, irrespective of cell proximity, in a manner that correlates with changes in motor output. We hypothesize that these changes are likely due to alterations in synaptic weight at dSPN synapses that occur following mGluR5 manipulation.</p><p>One way in which mGluR5 may modify synaptic weight is through long-term plasticity. In vitro studies have demonstrated that mGluR5 activation occurs following pairing of postsynaptic depolarization with moderate to high frequency excitatory synaptic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerdeman et al., 2002</xref>). mGluR5 activation can result in the long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic transmission or a more transient depression in release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kreitzer and Malenka, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marshall et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shen et al., 2015</xref>). If rest-associated ensembles of dSPNs are substantially different in composition from movement and/or movement-onset ensembles, then our data suggest that synapses onto dSPNs may have a lower synaptic weight during spontaneous behavior than movement or movement onset ensembles, potentially due to eCB release. Inhibiting mGluR5, either through pharmacology or genetics, may increase this synaptic weight, thereby promoting activation of rest ensembles and decreasing motor output. This input that primarily governs the activation of movement-related ensembles could either be a separate population of cortical inputs with higher synaptic weight or thalamostriatal inputs more resilient to mGluR5 manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our results are an important step in understanding how the regulation of synaptic weights by mGluR5 may act on the coordinated activity of dSPNs in vivo to regulate behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Global enhancement of eCB levels does not alter clustered co-activity</title><p>The lack of change in spatiotemporal coordination following systemic administration of the 2-AG degradation inhibitor JZL-184 suggests that global enhancement of eCB levels does not produce a similar outcome as modulating mGluR5 signaling. However, in contrast to selective mGluR5 modulation, we did observe a reduction in overall dSPN event rates with JZL. One possibility is that a degree of synaptic specificity is required to affect clustered activation of dSPNs. Thus, JZL treatment may have exerted such broad effects on the circuit that it resulted in a different outcome for neural clustering and motor output than that observed following treatment with the allosteric modulators of mGluR5 receptors that modify the weight of specific active synapses.</p><p>These results support a model whereby the level of co-activity among specific groups of dSPNs is potentially important for controlling motor output. Therefore, globally altering the synaptic weights of all neurons may overshadow the results of synaptic alterations in specific subsets of SPNs. This idea is consistent with the notion that individual dSPNs may be precisely tuned to have specific roles in regulating motor output, such that altering the activity of one dSPN subgroup would not have the same effect as altering the activity of a different subgroup. This interpretation is also at odds with the classical rate-based models of SPN activity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of non-dSPN mGluR5 receptors in regulating movement</title><p>There are notable differences in the design of our experiments using conditional deletion of mGluR5 from dSPNs and systemic administration of a negative allosteric modulator of mGluR5. Following fenobam administration, we observed a significant increase in co-activity when animals were at rest and a smaller increase during movement; however,, the relative increase in co-activity between rest and movement did not differ significantly from controls in either cKO animals or following fenobam treatment. Therefore, in both cases, inhibition of mGluR5 may promote the activation of rest ensembles and thereby inhibit motor output.</p><p>Within the striatum alone, mGluR5 is expressed in iSPNs and interneurons, and modulation of these cell types by systemically administered compounds could produce changes in behavior and striatal circuit function. dSPNs receive GABAergic input from both iSPNs as well as striatal interneurons. Of particular note, parvalbumin-positive fast-spiking interneurons also receive excitatory input from the cortex and provide feedforward inhibition onto both subtypes of SPNs, and genetic disruption of mGluR5 in parvalbumin interneurons increases striatum-dependent repetitive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes et al., 2015</xref>). The modulation of synaptic strength at these connections by fenobam and JNJ could also partly account for the effects of these compounds on dSPN activity and behavior when systemically administered, which would not occur in cKO animals.</p><p>Collateral inhibition between SPNs is another potential source for modulation of co-activity. In vitro electrophysiology has shown that dSPNs are more likely to form synapses onto other dSPNs, while iSPNs form synapses onto neurons of both pathways with equal probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Taverna et al., 2008</xref>). However, the strength of collateral synapses formed by dSPNs appears to be smaller than that of synapses formed by iSPNs. Our analysis of iSPN activity in cKO mice suggests that iSPN circuit properties are largely normal when mGluR5 is genetically disrupted in dSPNs, perhaps reflecting the less substantial modulation of iSPN circuitry by dSPNs reported in the striatum, at least during spontaneous behavior. Whether this relationship holds across additional behavioral states remains to be addressed. Additionally, whether disruption of iSPN networks affects dSPN networks, perhaps due to stronger unidirectional iSPN-dSPN connectivity, is a key question for further research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Translation implications of dSPN spatiotemporal dynamics</title><p>The relationship of mGluR5 pharmacology to dSPN spatial coordination and motor output is clinically relevant to the treatment of motor disorders. Prior studies examining the spatial coordination of SPNs in Parkinsonian mice demonstrated that, following dopamine depletion to model a Parkinsonian state, dSPN activity was reduced but maintained spatial coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). However, when levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) was modelled in these animals, dSPNs lost spatial coordination. In the current work, we show that pharmacological inhibition of mGluR5 increases spatial coordination. It is tempting to speculate, therefore, that in the case of LID, the therapeutic efficacy of mGluR5 NAMs may involve regulation of the spatially coordinated co-activity of dSPNs. Additionally, further examination of how spatially coordinated SPN activity is disrupted in motor diseases involving basal ganglia pathology may be a promising avenue for future therapeutic development.</p><p>In summary, our data demonstrate that the modulation of signaling that affects synaptic properties of excitatory synapses onto dSPNs is a key mediator of the normal patterns of SPN co-activity that typify the striatum’s neural ensemble dynamics in relation to spontaneous movement. These results provide further support for models where the local synchronization of SPNs (and the basal ganglia circuit in general) is a stronger determinant of motor output than their overall levels of activity. Our results also provide a framework for future lines of inquiry to address how striatal synaptic properties shape circuit function and striatum-dependent behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animals were group housed with 14 hr:10 hr Light/Dark cycle and food and water were provided ad libitum. Mice of both sexes, between 4–12 months old, were used and all experiments were performed in accordance with procedures approved by the Northwestern University IACUC. To express GCaMP6f in dSPNs, we used mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>Drd1a</italic> promoter (D1cre, Drd1a-Cre Ey262) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gong et al., 2007</xref>). A Cre-dependent GCaMP6f under the control of the synapsin promoter (pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, 100833-AAV9 from Addgene) was used for delivery of the construct. To express GCaMP6f in iSPNs in the D1cre mice, we generated a novel AAV vector with GCaMP6f under control of the synapsin promoter and downstream of a DO (Double-floxed Open reading frame) which prevents expression of the construct in cells expressing Cre recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Saunders et al., 2012</xref>). This construct (pAAV.Syn_hGH.DO_FAS.GCaMP6f.WPRE.bGHpA) was packaged into an AAV9 virus (Virovek, Houston, TX). For in vitro patch clamp electrophysiology experiments, we further crossed the D1Cre line to mice expressing a Cre-dependent tdTomato reporter inserted in the <italic>Rosa26<sup>Ai9</sup></italic> locus (Ai9), in order to identify dSPNs in the DLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). For genetic deletion of mGluR5, we used floxed mGluR5 mice (Grm5<sup>loxP/loxP</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xu et al., 2009</xref>) crossed to either D1cre mice (D1cre; mGluR5<sup>f/f</sup>, or D1 cKO), for in vivo imaging experiments, or D1 cre mice crossed with Ai9 mice (D1cre; mGluR5<sup>f/f</sup>; Ai9<sup>+/+</sup>) for patch clamp experiments. All mice were maintained on the C57BL6/J background strain.</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><sec id="s4-1-1-1"><title>Motor learning on the accelerating rotarod</title><p>Mice of both sexes were placed on the rotarod and the initial revolution speed set to 4 rpm for 120 s. The rotarod then accelerated at a rate of 0.12 rpm·s<sup>−1</sup> for 300 s. Mice were trained in three trials per day with a 30 min inter-trial interval for four consecutive days (12 trials total).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-2"><title>Open field</title><p>The dimensions of the square open field arena (in cm) were 60 l×60 w×30 h. Animals were placed in the middle of the arena at the start of the test and remained in the arena for 30 min during which time their position was tracked using an overhead camera and analyzed using software (Limelight; Actimetrics).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-3"><title>Digging behavior</title><p>Mice were placed in a novel cage containing wood chip bedding (3 cm deep) in a brightly lit, open area. Animals remained in the testing cage for 15 min. Mouse digging time was manually scored using a stopwatch.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-4"><title>Voluntary wheel running</title><p>Mice of either sex were single-housed with wireless running wheels (MedAssociates) for at least 7 days. Total distance run was quantified for each day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-5"><title>Virus injection</title><p>For mice that received a viral injection (pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, 100833-AAV9 from Addgene) prior to GRIN lens implant, we anesthetized mice with isoflurane (2% in O<sub>2</sub>) and stereotaxically injected virus at a rate of 250 nl min<sup>−1</sup> into the DLS using a microsyringe with a 28-gauge beveled-tip needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV). Stock titer virus was diluted 1:10 with sterile PBS. The coordinates for injection were: A/<italic>P</italic>+/-0.05 mm, M/L+/-1.8 mm, D/V –2.4 mm (from dura). For all DV coordinates, we went 0.1  mm past the injection target and then withdrew the syringe back to the target for the injection. After each injection, we left the syringe in place for 10 min and then slowly withdrew the syringe. We then sutured the scalp, injected analgesic (Buprenorphine SR, 1 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>), as well as meloxicam (2x/day for 48 hr, 5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>), and allowed the mice to recover for at least 14  days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-6"><title>Silk fibroin coating of GRIN lenses</title><p>For animals in which we implanted a GRIN lens coated with a fibroin:AAV mixture, we autoclaved both GRIN lenses and a small aliquot of 5% W/V silk fibroin solution prior to coating. Then, the sterile fibroin solution was mixed 1:1 with stock titer AAV (pAAV.Syn.Flex.GCaMP6f.WPRE.SV40, 100833-AAV9 from Addgene). A microsyringe with a 23-gauge flat tip needle (Hamilton Company, Reno, NV) with a manual stereotaxic injector (Stoelting) was used to apply a 1 µL droplet of the mixture to the tip of the GRIN lens in a biological safety cabinet. The mixture was allowed to dry slightly for 5 min with the droplet in contact with both the GRIN lens surface and the syringe needle tip before the syringe needle was removed; this prevented the mixture from coating the side of the lens. Once the needle was removed, the droplet was allowed to fully dry to the surface of the lens for at least 1 hr before implanting. Lenses were stored at 4°C for implanting either the same day or within approximately 24 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-7"><title>Surgical implantation of GRIN lens and viral transduction</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane in O<sub>2</sub> (induction 4%; maintenance 2–3%). Following verification of anesthesia, hair was trimmed from the incision site, the scalp cleaned with three alternating swabs of betadine and 70% ethanol, and an incision made through the scalp to uncover the skull. The skull surface was cleaned and verified to be level by measuring the coordinates of bregma, lambda, and two sites +/-2 mm lateral to the midline. The M/L and A/P coordinates for implantation of the GRIN lens (Inscopix for v4 lenses, or Edmund Optics for v3 lenses) were marked on the skull (A/<italic>P</italic>+/-0.05 mm, M/L+/-2 mm) and a Dremel with a sterilized 0.6 mm tip was used to remove an approximately 2 mm circular region around the implant site. The skull was cleaned, dried, and scored crosswise with a scalpel. While continuously perfusing the tissue with ACSF, the dura and cortex were removed using a 26 GA blunt-end needle connected to a vacuum line until the fibers of the corpus callosum became visible, at which point a 30 GA blunt-end needle was used to carefully remove the fibers of the callosum until striatal tissue became visible under a dissecting microscope. A 1 mm or 1.8 mm diameter GRIN lens was then lowered into the aspiration site (D/V –2.4 mm), held in place using a pipette tip and vacuum line attached to the stereotax. The lens was secured to the skull using dental cement (Metabond) and cyanoacrylate glue. Buprenorphine SR (1 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) was administered following surgery, as well as meloxicam (2x/day for 48 hr, 5 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup>), dexamethasone (1x/day, 0.2 mg·kg<sup>−1</sup> for 7 days), and Sulfatrim (for 7 days in the drinking water). Mice were allowed to recover for 2–4  weeks before mounting the miniature microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-8"><title>Miniscope mounting and imaging</title><p>Two to four weeks following surgery to implant the GRIN lens, the mouse was again anesthetized under the stereotax and a miniscope (UCLA V3 or V4) with a baseplate attached was lowered to the top focal plane of the GRIN lens. Once the optimal imaging plane was found, the baseplate was secured with dental cement (Metabond, Parkell).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-9"><title>In vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging and analysis</title><p>All mice were habituated to the weight of the miniscope over a 60 min session in the open field. Following habituation, we placed mice in the open field for 60 min each day for 1–3 days with the miniscope attached. The number of cells and the number of sessions used per mouse for each analysis are contained in the Supplementary files (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). For analysis of calcium dynamics in dSPN cKO mice, we analyzed data from the first 20 min of day 1 of these sessions. In the majority of animals used in these experiments, we used v3 miniscopes which required higher LED intensities compared to v4 miniscopes. Therefore, we limited recording to 20 min to limit photobleaching. For experiments testing fenobam, JZL, and JNJ, 60 min of open field activity were recorded following IP injection. For these experiments, we used v4 scopes which allowed for the use of lower LED intensities. Fenobam (26 mg/kg) and JZL (10 mg/kg) were administered immediately prior to the test, following a 15 min habituation. Due to its pharmacokinetics, JNJ was administered 30 min prior to beginning the test. Fenobam was diluted in 40% beta-cyclodextrin, 10% DMSO, JZL, and JNJ were diluted in 10% DMSO and 90% corn oil.</p><p>We used open-source V3 and V4 miniscopes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4">https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aharoni, 2023a</xref>) that were connected to a coaxial cable which connected to a miniscope data acquisition board (DAQ) 3.3. The DAQ was connected to a computer via a USB 3.0 cable. Data was collected via the Miniscope QT Software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software">https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aharoni, 2023b</xref>) at 20 frames per second. Simultaneous video recordings of behavior were performed at approximately 30 fps, and data was aligned post hoc using the time stamps collected by the miniscope software for each frame. Miniscopes and DAQ boards were purchased from Open Ephys, LabMaker, or parts were machined by Shylo Steitler (UCLA) and assembled.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-10"><title>Pre-processing and motion correction</title><p>Videos were preprocessed to remove sensor noise using a 2D FFT spatial frequency filter and low-pass Butterworth filter (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/tree/master/Miniscope-v4-Denoising-Notebook">https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-v4/tree/master/Miniscope-v4-Denoising-Notebook</ext-link>) and then motion correction was performed using the normcorr algorithm in the CaImAn package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giovannucci et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-11"><title>Identification of neurons (CNMF-E)</title><p>Cells were automatically identified using the CNMF-E algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Recordings were grouped in batches of 1–5000 frames for processing and spatially downsampled 2x during the running of the CNMF-E algorithm. The maximum neuron diameter was determined based on manual observation of each of the motion-corrected videos in ImageJ and the minimum local correlation value (Cn) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for a pixel to be used as a cell ‘seed’ was determined by visualizing the correlation image for a subset of recording frames of each video. The threshold for merging neurons was set at 0.65, neurons were merged if their distances were smaller than two pixels and they had highly correlated spatial shapes (correlation &gt;0.8) and small temporal correlations (correlation &lt;0.4). The output of the CNMF-E analysis performed on the video was then manually checked to ensure accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-12"><title>Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity</title><p>The cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity traces from CNMF-E were processed first by scaling to the 99-percentile value of each cell’s activity trace during the recording session. The resulting normalized trace was then expressed as a Z-score by subtracting each sample from the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of the entire trace. Finally, this trace was downsampled to 5 Hz (using the maximum value within the downsampled regions) and this result was used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-13"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> event rate and correlation to velocity</title><p>A threshold crossing algorithm was used to detect peaks that were ≥2.5 s.d. above the baseline signal value for 1 s and the time of each event was calculated as the midpoint between the maximum value of the event and the preceding minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). We used EZ track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pennington et al., 2021</xref>) to compute the frame-by-frame velocity of the animal in the open field arena. Using custom Python scripts, we applied a 1 s median filter to this velocity trace and downsampled to 5 Hz for alignment to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-14"><title>Pairwise cell co-activity</title><p>The Jaccard index of pairwise coactivity was calculated following 1 s ‘forward-smoothing’ of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity traces as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). The mean value of the Jaccard index was calculated as a function of the Euclidean distance between cells in a neuron pair, and the mean values were binned into either 50 or 250 µm bins. These values were normalized to shuffled data sets where the Ca<sup>2+</sup> traces for each cell were shuffled in time, using 1000 independent shuffles of the binarized Ca<sup>2+</sup> event traces for each cell. This data was used for statistical comparison of coactivity between groups as a function of distance and behavioral state, i.e., moving or resting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-15"><title>Spatial coordination index</title><p>To measure spatial coordination, the extent to which co-activity is greater among more proximal neurons versus more distal cells, during each frame of the video, we calculated a previously used metric, the spatial coordination index (SCI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Parker et al., 2018</xref>). For each frame of the down-sampled video, we shuffled the pairwise distances for each neuron pair (1000 independent shuffles for each frame of the video), but not each cell’s Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity signal. From these 1000 different distributions of distances between cell pairs, we calculated the cumulative distribution of active cell distances for the actual dataset and each shuffled dataset. We then performed a pair of Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests to determine if the cumulative distribution of active cell distances in each frame was smaller (i.e. left-shifted or more ‘clustered’) or greater (right-shifted or less ‘clustered’) than that of the shuffled data. We took the logarithm (base ten) of the smaller p-value from either test and used this value as the spatial coordination index. If a frame did not have any active cell pairs, the index is 0. This analysis allows for visualization of how spatiotemporal dynamics change more specifically during movement onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-1-16"><title>Detection of movement onset</title><p>To most precisely detect instances of movement onset, specifically forward ambulatory motion, for our SCI analysis, we used the frame-by-frame velocity calculated from the mouse’s centroid location detected by ezTrack. We then filtered the velocity traces by determining if the animal’s centroid moved by more than 1 cm from its location in the current frame at any point over the next 1 s of the recording. If not, we set the velocity to 0 for that frame. We then smoothed the resulting trace using a 167 ms moving average. To find periods of movement onset that would allow us to more clearly measure whether there were consistent changes in spatial coordination, we identified where this velocity trace exceeded 0.5 cm/s for at least 2 s preceded by a period of rest for 4 s. We used the timestamps recorded by the miniscope software to find the matching period in our SCI signal. This allowed us to clearly measure how the degree of spatial coordination among dSPNs changes between rest and movement.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Slice procedure and in vitro electrophysiological recording</title><p>Parasagittal slices containing the dorsal striatum were prepared using standard techniques. Mice were deeply anesthetized (xylazine 10 mg/kg and ketamine 100 mg/kg i.p.) before undergoing transcardial perfusion with an ice-cold sucrose artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) solution containing (in mM): 85 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 75 sucrose, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 4 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. The brain was removed and mounted on the stage of vibratome (Leica Microsystems, Inc). 350 µm thick sections were made in ice-cold sucrose ACSF. Slices were transferred to a recovery chamber containing the sucrose slicing ACSF solution, which was gradually exchanged for a normal ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.2 Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, while the slices were maintained at 30°C. Individual slices were transferred to a recording chamber and visualized under DIC. Micro-Manager open source software was used for collecting the CCD camera image (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>). For extracellular recordings, slices were perfused with normal ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 1.2 Na<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 25 glucose, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Recording electrodes were manufactured from borosilicate glass pipettes and had resistances of 3–5 MΩ when filled with regular ACSF. For whole-cell voltage clamp experiments, recording electrodes were filled with internal solution containing (in mM) 95 CsF, 25 CsCl, 10 Cs-HEPES, 10 Cs-EGTA, 2 NaCl, 2 Mg-ATP, 10 QX-314, 5 TEA-Cl, 5 4-AP for recording of EPSCs, or 75 CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, 60 CsCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP, 0.3 GTP-Na<sub>2</sub>, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine, 10 TEA, 5 QX-314. SPNs were visually identified and were voltage clamped at –80 mV. Miniature events (mEPSCs) were recorded in the presence of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker TTX (1 µM) and bicuculline (10 µM). Analysis of mEPSCs was performed using Eventer software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eventerneuro.netlify.app/">https://eventerneuro.netlify.app/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Histology</title><p>Following in vivo imaging experiments, mice were anesthetized using ketamine/xylazine and perfused with PBS containing 0.02% sodium nitrite and 4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub> followed by 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) for 6 min, and 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5) for 12–18 min. The brains were removed from the skull, post-fixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer (pH 8.5), then sectioned coronally at 50 μm on a Leica Vibratome VT1000s in PBS. The sections were collected and stored at 4°C in PBS containing 0.02% sodium azide. Free-floating sections were rinsed for 30 min in PBS followed by four 15 min washes in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8787) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma, A4503). The sections were then blocked with 3% normal donkey serum (NDS; Jackson ImmunoResearch, 017-000-121) for 1 hr and then incubated in primary antibody overnight (Mouse anti-GFP, Millipore, MAB3580). Sections were washed three times for 15 min and then incubated in secondary antibody for 1 hr and washed three times prior to mounting and imaging with a 20x objective on a Zeiss Imager M2 microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics</title><p>For comparisons of single mean values per mouse, for instance, mean velocity per animal, we used non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test or the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. Where the same measurement was made multiple times, we used a repeated measures ANOVA. For cases where multiple different but correlated, non-independent, comparisons were made within mice, for instance, in comparing mean event rates at different speeds or mean coactivity across neuron pairs at different distances, we used a linear mixed effects model (LMM) to account for the non-independence of measurements made from the same animal. The model was implemented using the statsmodels Python package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.statsmodels.org">https://www.statsmodels.org</ext-link>), the drug treatment or genotype was the independent variable, mean values measured per mouse are the dependent variables and individual mice are the group term. Where this model was used, we tested for the effect of genotype or drug treatment and reported the significance for that measurement. Results were considered significant when p&lt;0.05. In all figures, individual data points represent the mean of a group, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. N numbers for each group are specified in the figure legend.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were performed in accordance with procedures and protocols approved by the Northwestern University IACUC.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98122-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Number of cells and recording sessions for analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98122-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Number of cells and recording sessions for analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98122-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Number of cells and recording sessions for analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98122-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Number of cells and recording sessions for analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98122-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper and/or the Supplementary Materials.

The authors examine effects of dSPN-specific constitutive mGlu5 deletion in several motor tests to arrive at this finding. Effects of inhibiting the degradation of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoyl glycerol are also examined. Overall, this is a valuable study that provides solid new information of relevance to movement disorders and possibly psychosis.</p><p>The combination of in vivo cellular calcium imaging, pharmacology, receptor knockout and movement analysis is effectively used. The main findings do not involve gross firing rates or numbers of active neurons, but rather are revealed by specialized measures involving Jaccard coefficient and an assessment of coactivity. The authors conclude that mGlu5 expressed in dSPNs contributes to movement through effects on clustered spatial coactivity of dSPNs. More specifically, reduced mGluR5 increases coactivity during rest (defined as low velocity periods) but not during locomotion periods. The authors observe a role for mGlu5 expression in dSPNs in modulating the frequency of mEPSCs, suggesting a role in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Some data suggesting the story may be different in the other major SPN subpopulation (iSPNs) are also presented but these studies are relatively underdeveloped leaving some ambiguity as to how cell-selective the findings are. In addition, an occlusion experiment in which the pharmacological mGluR5 agents are delivered to the dSPN mGluR5 KO to clarify if other sites of action are involved beyond the proposed D1-expressing neurons is missing. Finally, the authors present a working model that sets the stage for future experimentation. Overall, this study provides an important and detailed assessment of mGluR5 contributions to striatal circuit function and behavior.</p><p>Remaining concerns include:</p><p>(1) To clarify that dSPNs are sole site of action, it is necessary to examine effects of the mGlu5 NAM in the dSPN mGlu5 cKO mice. If the effects of the two manipulations occluded one another this would certainly support the hypothesis that the drug effects are mediated by receptors expressed in dSPNs. A similar argument can be made for examining effects of the JNJ PAM in the cKO mice.</p><p>(2) There is a concern that the D1 Cre line used (Ey262), which may also target cortical neurons expands the interpretation of the study beyond the striatal populations. Further discussion of this point, particularly in the interpretation of the mGluR5 cKO experiments, would provide a better understanding of the contribution of the paper.</p><p>(3) The use of CsF-based whole-cell internal solutions has caused concern in some past studies due to possible interference with G-protein, phosphatase and channel function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044743104000296">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1044743104000296</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/6/10/2915.full.pdf">https://www.jneurosci.org/content/jneuro/6/10/2915.full.pdf</ext-link>). It is reassuring the DHPG-induced LTD was still observable with this solution. However, it might be worth examining this plasticity with a different internal to ensure that the magnitude of the agonist effect is not altered by this manipulation.</p><p>(4) Behavioral resolution of actions at low velocity that are termed &quot;rest&quot; are not explored in this study. Thus, a remaining ambiguity is whether the activities in rest include only periods of immobility or other low-velocity activities such as grooming or rearing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98122.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Marshall</surname><given-names>John J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Jian</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yeh</surname><given-names>Nai-Hsing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yun</surname><given-names>Seongsik</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nomura</surname><given-names>Toshihro</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>John N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Parker</surname><given-names>Jones</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Contractor</surname><given-names>Anis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>“Can the authors offer a hypothesis as to how decreased coactivity promotes increased movement velocity.”</p></disp-quote><p>In our revision we have added an additional metric measuring how spatial coactivity changes during movement onset, the spatial correlation index, which replicates a previous finding that co-activity among proximal neurons is statistically greater surrounding movement onset. We did not find, as outlined in the revision, that mGluR5 manipulations significantly altered this relationship. Our data therefore shows, consistent with that shown previously, that ensembles of dSPNs that are co-active during movement onset, in particular ambulatory movement, are more likely to contain neurons that are closer together and the neurons are highly active. In contrast, rest ensembles contain neurons that are less active but have more highly correlated activity, across all pairwise distances. Additionally, mGluR5 inhibition, genetic or pharmacological, promotes the activation of rest ensembles but does not affect the properties of movement ensembles. Previous studies (e.g. Klaus A. et al., 2017) have shown that neurons in rest ensembles are, in general, unlikely to also be members of movement ensembles, We therefore hypothesize that corticostriatal synapses onto SPNs of rest ensembles are more likely, during spontaneous behavior, to have reduced synaptic weight due to mGluR5 signaling, potentially due to eCB mediated inhibition of neurotransmitter release. Therefore, when we inhibit mGluR5 at these synapses, we increase synaptic weight and increase the probability of activation of this coordinated rest ensemble, which suppresses movement. If, on the other hand, the synapses that govern activation of neurons in movement ensembles have a higher weight, they may be unaffected by mGluR5 inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The use of the Jaccard similarity index in this study is not intuitive and not fully explained by the methods or the diagram in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more detail to the paper to explain the methodology of the jaccard similarity measure. The advantage of this method is that is specifically captures cells that are jointly active, as opposed to jointly inactive and is therefore useful for capturing co-activity in our sparsely active Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The analysis of a possible 2-AG role in the mGlu5 mediated processes is incomplete.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that, as an experiment to outline which endocannabinoids are involved in modulating synaptic strength through mGluR5, this experiment alone is not sufficient.</p><p>However, our main focus in this paper is how manipulations of mGluR5 affect the spatiotemporal dynamics of dSPNs and we chose not to focus on specific mechanisms of endocannabinoid signaling, though these would certainly be interesting to investigate further in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would seem to be a simple experiment to examine effects of the mGlu5 NAM in the dSPN mGlu5 cKO mice. If effects of the two manipulations occluded one another this would certainly support the hypothesis that the drug effects are mediated by receptors expressed in dSPNs. A similar argument can be made for examining effects of the JNJ PAM in the cKO mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this experiment would be valuable and extend our findings presented in the paper, however, it has practically been outside the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Pharmacological and genetic manipulations of mGluR5 do not differentially/preferentially modulate the activity of proximal vs distal dSPNs, therefore, it could also be interpreted that mGluR5 is blanketly boosting/suppressing all dSPN activity as opposed to differential proximal/distal spatial relationships.</p></disp-quote><p>As in the response to reviewer 1 above, we have added additional clarification to the text explaining that our manipulations do not differentially affect the co-activity of proximal vs distal dSPNs, this is also quantified throughout the text using the spatial coordination index. However, we disagree that “it could also be interpreted that mGluR5 is blanketly boosting/suppressing all dSPN activity” as we do not observe statistically significant changes in the event rate following either pharmacological or genetic manipulations of mGluR5. Rather, we consistently observe statistically significant changes in co-activity among neurons, the extent to which activity of active neurons during either rest or movement are correlated with each other. This is the central finding of our manuscript, inhibiting or potentiating mGluR5 signaling alters behavior, not by blanket suppression or enhancement of the activity as measured using the event rate, of dSPNs, but by affecting their ensemble dynamic properties. Co-activity during rest versus ambulatory movement is statistically greater in both proximal and distal cells and inhibiting mGluR5 increases this co-activity and decreases movement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For these analyses of prox vs distal and all others, please include the detail of how many proximal vs distal cells were involved and per subject.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplemental table that details the number of cells included per subject in all analyses</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Ln. 151-152: Please provide data concerning how volumes of infectivity differ between injecting AAV vs. coating the lens? If these numbers are very different, this could impact the number of Jaccard pairings and bias results.</p></disp-quote><p>While viral injection may lead to a larger volume of expression, with this one photon imaging method only those cells within ~200 microns of the edge of the lens will be able to be resolved, therefore practically, if there is an additional volume of infected tissue outside of the field of view of the lens, it would not affect the results as these neurons will not be resolved by the endoscope camera. Accordingly, the average number of cells detected per session is very similar following each approach (mean # of cells per session with coating 90.93 ± 23.69 cells, with viral injection 90.03 ± 29.29 cells)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is mGluR5 affecting dSPN activity in other measures beyond co-activity and rate? Does the amplitude of events change?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added supplemental data for figures 2, 3, and 5 demonstrating that manipulations of mGluR5 do not affect the amplitude or length of Ca<sup>2+</sup> events included in the analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the model of mGluR5 signaling in a resting state vs. movement? What other behaviors are occurring when the mouse is in a low velocity &quot;resting state&quot; (0-0.5 cm/s). If this includes other forms of movement (i.e. rearing, grooming) then the animal really isn't in a resting state. This is not mentioned in the open field behavior section of the methods and should be described (Ln. 486) in addition to greater explanation of what behavior measures were obtained from the video tracking software (only locomotion?)</p></disp-quote><p>It would be very interesting to determine if during “rest,” when the animals is not engaged in ambulatory behavior, it may be engaged in some fine motor behavior. However, the resolution of the cameras used to measure locomotor activity in this dataset does not allow us to do this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is large variability in co-activity in proximal dSPNs when animals are &quot;resting&quot; (2j). Could this be explained by different behavior states within your definition of &quot;rest&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that if the animal is engaging in fine motor behavior that we cannot resolve with our behavior setup, this could produce some variability in coactivity. However, as shown previously (e.g. Klaus A. et al., 2017), ensembles active when the animal is not moving (our definition of “resting”), regardless of additional fine motor behaviors the animal may be engaged in when not moving, are substantially different that those ensembles that are active when the animal is moving. We therefore expect that this may limit, although potentially not eliminate, variability due to different behavioral states we may have grouped into our “resting” category. Unfortunately, as mentioned above, we are not able resolve variations in fine motor output in this behavioral data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have you performed IHC, ISH or another measure to validate D1 cell specific cKO?</p></disp-quote><p>The mGluR5<sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice used in this study were characterized previously by our lab (Xu et al., 2009), we used the same mice here with a different, but also published and characterized Cre-driver line, Drd1a-Cre Ey262 (Gerfen et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why are the &quot;Mean Norm Co-activity&quot; values in 5e so high in this experiment relative to figures 2-4?</p></disp-quote><p>In experiments where we treated the same animal with vehicle and a drug (i.e., experiments in Figure 2 and 3), we normalized the values for each animal in the drug treatment group to the distal bin of that animal following vehicle treatment. This allowed us to more clearly resolve the changes within each animal due to drug treatment. As comparisons in the data in figure 5 d–f are between different animals (rather than different treatments of the same animal) we could not perform this normalization procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Some D1 Cre lines have expression in the cortex.

However, the statistics of the figure legends say: however the change in mean velocity (3b) is not significant (p=0.060, U=3, Mann-Whitney U test), nor is the mean bout length during vehicle and JNJ (p=0.060, U=3, Mann-Whitney U test) (3d) Comparison of mean number of bouts of each animal during vehicle and JNJ (p=0.403, U=8, Mann-Whitney U test).</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected to indicate only the change in time spend at rest is statistically significant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This effect was most pronounced during periods of rest (Figure 3i, j).
