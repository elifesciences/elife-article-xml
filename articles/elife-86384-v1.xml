The TPC1/SV channel functions as a depolarization-stimulated, non-selective cation channel that is inhibited by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In our search for species-dependent functional TPC1 channel variants with different luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, we found in total three acidic residues present in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 2 and 3 of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive AtTPC1 channel from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> that were neutral in its <italic>Vicia faba</italic> ortholog and also in those of many other Fabaceae. When expressed in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtTPC1-loss-of-function background, wild-type VfTPC1 was hypersensitive to vacuole depolarization and only weakly sensitive to blocking luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. When AtTPC1 was mutated for these VfTPC1-homologous polymorphic residues, two neutral substitutions in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 alone were already sufficient for the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> At-VfTPC1 channel mutant to gain VfTPC1-like voltage and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity that together rendered vacuoles hyperexcitable. Thus, natural TPC1 channel variants exist in plant families which may fine-tune vacuole excitability and adapt it to environmental settings of the particular ecological niche.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Brassicaceae</kwd><kwd>Fabaceae</kwd><kwd>pore</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>voltage gating</kwd><kwd>vacuolar calcium sensor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Koselleck award HE 1640/42-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hedrich</surname><given-names>Rainer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>priority programs 'MAdLand -

The SV channel is similarly permeable for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>, and in principle also to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. However, the physiological relevance of a potential Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability in planta is highly controversial (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya, 2022</xref>), a view further supported – among other studies – by recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Navarro-Retamal et al., 2021</xref>). About two decades after the discovery of SV channels, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peiter et al., 2005</xref> revealed that the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> SV channel is encoded by the single copy gene <italic>TPC1</italic>. Since then, the AtTPC1 channel has become a model for understanding the physiological role and function of SV/TPC1 channels in higher plants. Studies on AtTPC1 mutant plants suggest that TPC1 is not responsible for global Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses but contributes to long-distance electrical and Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling under salt stress conditions and is an essential player in vacuole excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bellandi et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaślan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ranf et al., 2008</xref>, for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Within the tree of live, there are TPC1-like sequences in animals and plants (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaślan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kintzer and Stroud, 2018</xref>). During land plant evolution characteristic structural fingerprints of TPC1-type channels remained unchanged from mosses to flowering plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dreyer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hedrich et al., 1988</xref>). Recently, both the crystal and cryoEM structure of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> AtTPC1 channel and thus the molecular topology of this vacuolar cation channel became available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintzer and Stroud, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). AtTPC1 is formed by a dimer whose monomers consist of two tandem Shaker-like cassettes, each with six transmembrane domains (TM1–6), connected by a cytoplasmic loop with two EF hands. Calcium binding to the EF hands is necessary for SV/TPC1 channel activation at elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schulze et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). Structural 3D motif comparison and point mutation analysis identified the major voltage-sensing domain (VSD) required for depolarization-dependent activation in each monomer in the first four transmembrane segments of the second Shaker-like cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jaślan et al., 2016</xref>). CryoEM structures further suggested that activation of VSD2 is required for Ca<sup>2+</sup> activation of the EF hand domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, channel activation is strongly suppressed when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> level in the vacuolar lumen reaches 1 mM and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaślan et al., 2019</xref>). Luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> can bind to three non-canonical calcium-binding sites each formed by three acidic residues in AtTPC1 (site 1: D240, D454, and E528; site 2: E239, D240, and E457; site 3: E605, D606, and D607; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintzer and Stroud, 2016</xref>). Site 1/2 residues are located in luminal linker regions between transmembrane domains while site 3 residues are found in the luminal pore entrance. Among them, sites 1 and 3 play key roles in voltage gating and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibition.</p><p>Screening a chemically induced <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutant collection for individuals producing elevated amounts of the wound hormone jasmonate (JA) identified the TPC1 mutant <italic>fou2</italic> (fatty acid oxygenation upregulated 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaventure et al., 2007a</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>fou2</italic> channel behaves like a hyperactive TPC1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyhl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaventure et al., 2007a</xref>) and opens already close to the vacuole resting voltage which is around –30 mV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, wild-type AtTPC1 becomes active only upon depolarization. The hypersensitivity of the <italic>fou2</italic> TPC1 channel toward voltage confers hyperexcitability to the vacuole and results from a mutation of the negatively charged glutamate at position 454 to the uncharged asparagine (D454N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaventure et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaślan et al., 2019</xref>). This TPC1 site is directed toward the vacuole lumen and is part of the non-canonical Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintzer and Stroud, 2016</xref>). Therefore, the block of channel activity by elevated luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, typical for wild-type TPC1, is greatly attenuated in the <italic>fou2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lenglet et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, <italic>fou2</italic> vacuoles must experience episodes in which the membrane potential is short circuited. As a result, <italic>fou2</italic> plants appear wounded and produce large amounts of jasmonate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaventure et al., 2007a</xref>). Interestingly, strong membrane depolarizations triggered by current injection into healthy <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves strongly activated the JA pathway, suggesting a link between vacuolar membrane potential and activation of JA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mousavi et al., 2013</xref>). However, this link between TPC1-dependent vacuolar excitability and changes to electrical signaling of the plasma membrane and JA production remains to be explored (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya, 2022</xref>). Functional studies in the context of the <italic>fou2</italic> mutation site showed that additional luminal amino acids other than the central Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites like D454 are involved in luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing, for example the adjacent E457 from Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintzer and Stroud, 2016</xref>).

Despite similarities of the fava bean channel with its <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homolog, both TPC1s showed also astonishing differences in voltage- and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent properties. In search for the structural reasons for this divergence, we could pinpoint three polymorphic sites within two luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordinating regions. When these polymorphic sites were implemented into the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> TPC1 channel, AtTPC1 was converted into a hyperactive SV/TPC1 channel desensitized to luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, mimicking the properties of VfTPC1 and the AtTPC1 mutant <italic>fou2</italic>.

The strongly reduced susceptibility of VfTPC1 currents to inhibitory luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions was associated with a significantly reduced inhibitory effect on voltage activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

This resulted in the triple VfTPC1 mutant N458E/A607E/N608D and the double, triple AtTPC1 mutants E605A/D606N and E457N/E605A/D606N, respectively. When transiently expressed in the background of the <italic>attpc1-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), all these channel mutants were localized in the vacuole membrane and gave rise to the typical SV/TPC1 channel currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref>). When the two VfTPC1 channel variants were examined with respect to their voltage dependence and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity, no significant differences were found between VfTPC1 wild type and its triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–G</xref>). In contrast, the AtTPC1 mutants differed in some respects from AtTPC1 wild type. Compared to AtTPC1 wild type, the double but not the triple AtTPC1 mutant activated significantly faster under luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The lack of effect on activation of the AtTPC1 triple mutant is likely related to the attenuating influence of the mutated residue E457N, because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref> showed that the activation kinetics of the single AtTPC1 mutant E457N were slowed down. The deactivation of both, the double and triple AtTPC1 mutants, however, was not much affected and was more AtTPC1- than VfTPC1-like (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that other functional domains than Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 determines the deactivation behavior of TPC1 channels. This view is also supported by the fact that deactivation of the PpTPC1a channel from the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> was slower than that of AtTPC1, although all three luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 1–3 were functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and resulted in AtTPC1-like luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and voltage dependence of PpTPC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, in the absence of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the current voltage curves (<italic>I</italic><sub>ss</sub>/<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>(<italic>V</italic>)) and even more so the activation voltage curves (<italic>G</italic>/<italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub>(<italic>V</italic>)) of the double and triple AtTPC1 mutants appeared shifted to more negative voltages by about 30 mV compared to wild-type AtTPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The changed voltage dependence of both AtTPC1 mutants was reflected in <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub> values similar to VfTPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). When the two AtTPC1 mutants faced 10 mM luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, again the current and activation voltage curves as well as the <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub> values resembled those of VfTPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The fact that AtTPC1 channels carrying the VfTPC1 polymorphisms (i.e., double or triple residue substitutions) exhibit a low luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> susceptibility is best displayed by the channel behavior to 50 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Under such high luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> loads, almost no SV/TPC1 currents were observed with wild-type AtTPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The current and voltage activation curves (<italic>I</italic><sub>ss</sub>/<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>(<italic>V</italic>), <italic>G</italic>/<italic>G</italic><sub>max</sub>(<italic>V</italic>)) of the AtTPC1 mutants and VfTPC1, however, showed similar strong SV channel activity even at this extreme luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Thus, the E605A/D606N exchange is already sufficient to provide AtTPC1 with the voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of VfTPC1. The additional E457N replacement in the AtTPC1 E605A/D606N mutant background, however, did not further affect the transition from an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>-like to a VfTPC1-like gating behavior, nor did it further reduce luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref> reported that neutral residues at site 457 (E → N/Q) in AtTPC1 made the channel significantly less sensitive to luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> but attenuated voltage-dependent activation compared to wild-type channels, as midpoint voltages (<italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub><italic>, V</italic><sub>2</sub>) were shifted to more positive values. Thus, the hyperactivity of the native <italic>V. faba</italic> TPC1 channel is most likely related to the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 rather than to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 2. Considering further the similar luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of E605A/D606N and E457N/E605A/D606N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), the two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 2 and 3 with their residues E457 and E605/D606, respectively, do not have additive effects on channel gating.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The voltage and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence of the VfTPC1 triple mutant N458E/A607E/N608D.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mesophyll vacuoles released from <italic>attpc1-2</italic> mesophyll protoplasts after transient transformation with eYFP-tagged VfTPC1 triple mutant construct.

Surprisingly, the biochemical behavior of VfTPC1 was significantly different than that of AtTPC1 and we were unable to recover any usable material after purification. Hence, we constructed a homology model of VfTPC1 using our high-resolution cryoEM structure of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound AtTPC1-D454N (<italic>fou2</italic>) as a template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). From our previous structures of wild-type AtTPC1 and <italic>fou2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kintzer and Stroud, 2016</xref>), we determined that the luminal pore entrance operates an inhibitory Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (site 3) that is coupled to the functional VSD2. In the wild-type and <italic>fou2</italic> structures, the three luminal acidic residues (E605, D606, and D607) of site 3 line the conduction pathway upstream of the selectivity filter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the wild-type crystal structure, E605 binds a divalent metal on the symmetry axis. In our high-resolution structure of <italic>fou2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>), we showed that these residues rearrange to interact with the hydration shell around a bound metal in the selectivity filter and that D606 in <italic>fou2</italic> moves to the position of E605 in the wild-type structure, suggesting that both acidic residues regulate channel function. In our homology model of VfTPC1, neutralization of the acidic residues A607 and N608 in the luminal pore entrance (equivalent to E605 and D606 in AtTPC1) clearly alters the electrostatics of the pore. These substitutions almost certainly prevent the pore entrance from binding the inhibitory Ca<sup>2+</sup> observed in the wild-type structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), and from interacting with the water network in the pore as seen in <italic>fou2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>). Recent MD simulations with AtTPC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Navarro-Retamal et al., 2021</xref>) additionally indicated that the E605/D606 motif is structurally very flexible and adapts according to the direction of ion flow. This may suggest a valve-like regulatory mechanism: The efflux from the cytosol to the lumen stabilizes the position found in the hyperactive <italic>fou2</italic> mutant, that is, the open channel. In contrast, influx from the lumen to the cytosol drives the E605/D606 loop toward the pore, fostering channel closing. The MD simulations further suggest a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent interaction between the E605/D606 motif and a Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination site at the luminal entrance of the selectivity filter (D269/E637; in VfTPC1: D271/E639). Higher luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to occupy the coordination site which stabilized the E605/D606 motif in the pore-facing conformation. Neutralizing E605A/D606N mutations would reduce electrostatic interactions and result in channels that open with less activation energy. This effect could explain how an altered Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site at the luminal pore entrance of VfTPC1 – compared with AtTPC1 – shifts the voltage activation threshold to more negative values. The difference in the voltage activation profile between AtTPC1 and VfTPC1 may have been further enhanced by a luminal Mg<sup>2+</sup> effect on the intact luminal pore E605/D606 motif of AtTPC1 wild type. Like Ca<sup>2+</sup>, also luminal Mg<sup>2+</sup> inhibits the AtTPC1 channel but with a much lower efficiency than Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pottosin et al., 2004</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Structural comparison between wild-type AtTPC1 structure (beige color) and a VfTPC1 homology model (purple) depicts the functional consequences of sequence divergence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: side view from in the plane of the membrane of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> site showing the external (luminal) pore entry at the top.

In the simulation too, the duration of the post-stimulus voltage-plateau phase (<italic>t</italic><sub>plateau</sub>) was found to depend on the stimulus strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C, E</xref>). The voltage activation threshold of TPC1 had an additional influence on <italic>t</italic><sub>plateau</sub>. A negatively shifted TPC1 activation curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13A</xref>, black) provoked that the vacuole membrane remained in the excited state after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>, black).

The dual polymorphism of two residues within the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 in the luminal pore entrance is most likely responsible for this different gating behavior, because double loss-of-function mutations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 of AtTPC1 resulted in VfTPC1-like AtTPC1 channels. Reverse mutations, however, did not convert the features of VfTPC1 to AtTPC1, suggesting that additional structural adaptations have evolved and counteract these efforts to gain function in terms of greater voltage and luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence. However, reverse gain-of-function approaches with plant ion channels also failed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johansson et al., 2006</xref>). Earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>), we proposed that Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 in AtTPC1 is formed by three negatively charged residues (E605, D606, and D607). Here, we have now found that E605 and D606 play the most important role within this triad of site 3 in gating control in AtTPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Neutral residues at this site, as naturally already present in VfTPC1 (A607/N608; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), uncouple luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> coordination from gating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>VfTPC1 versus AtTPC1: what is the rule and what is the exception?</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> is the model plant for plant molecular genetics and physiology. Is the AtTPC1 structure–function relation reference for all plant SV channels? Obviously not! In comparison to AtTPC1, VfTPC1 is hyperactive and less sensitive toward luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In fact, these VfTPC1 features may be even more widespread in the plant kingdom, because TPC1 channels from some other plant species like for example <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic>, <italic>Oryza sativa</italic>, and <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> also exhibit the neutralizing triple-polymorphism characteristic of VfTPC1 in the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). In well agreement with this triple polymorphism, the fabacean TPC1 channel from <italic>L. japonicus</italic> shows a VfTPC1-like gating behavior and low luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity as TPC1 currents can still be recorded at 50 mM luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Similarly, voltage- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent TPC1 current responses from mesophyll vacuoles of the monocots <italic>O. sativa</italic> and <italic>H. vulgare</italic> appear also to exhibit a lower luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and higher probability to open at more negative voltages, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lenglet et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pottosin et al., 1997</xref>). Such luminal pore polymorphism, feeding back on gating behavior of TPC1 channels, could allow species to adapt the electrical properties of the vacuole to given individual environmental settings. In support of this hypothesis population-based evolutionary genomic approaches have pinpointed a polymorphic pore residue – other than the E605/D606 motif – in the vicinity of the TPC1 selectivity filter of <italic>Arabidopsis arenosa</italic> populations adapted to non-serpentine and serpentine soils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Konečná et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turner et al., 2010</xref>). Serpentine barrens are characterized by skewed Ca<sup>2+</sup>/Mg<sup>2+</sup> ratios and elevated heavy metals, often combined with low nutrient availability and drought conditions. While the functional consequences of this polymorphism for ion permeation remain elusive and subject to future studies, these results suggest that TPC1 channels are also involved in control of ion homeostasis in addition to a possible contribution to the vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dindas et al., 2021</xref>; see below). Of note, this residue is also polymorphic in the legume clade of TPC1 channels. In legumes, rhizobia-triggered nodule formation depends on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and is accompanied by a pronounced K<sup>+</sup> loss from the vacuole during the life span of infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fedorova et al., 2021</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the peculiar luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> tolerance of legume TPC1 type promote nodule formation and control ion homeostasis during nodule development. This hypothesis can be tested by generating TPC1-loss-of-function mutants in the model legumes Lotus and Medicago.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The complex relationship between TPC1 and Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>In well agreement with experiments with <italic>V. faba</italic> vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ivashikina and Hedrich, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward and Schroeder, 1994</xref>), our cation replacement experiments with TPC1-expressing HEK cells demonstrate the principal ability of VfTPC1 and AtTPC1 to conduct not only K<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> but also Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.

Under physiological, plant cell-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> concentrations and gradients, the fava bean SV/TPC1 channel was predominately conducting K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">SchulzLessdorf and Hedrich, 1995</xref>, for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedrich and Marten, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya, 2022</xref>). This permeation profile is consistent with the K<sup>+</sup>-starvation transcriptome and the elevated vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> content of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaves equipped with hyperactive <italic>fou2</italic> TPC1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beyhl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonaventure et al., 2007b</xref>). The latter suggests that the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites of TPC1 or, in other words, the susceptibility of TPC1 to block by elevated luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> may be the key for the Ca<sup>2+</sup> storage capacity of the plant vacuole. At the same time, a much lower luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity would then keep TPC1 functional even at high luminal vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels. Based on the observation that TPC1/SV channels are in principle permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> under certain experimental conditions, it was speculated that TPC channels (similar to the animal field) are part of a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ward and Schroeder, 1994</xref>). Intruigingly, studies on TPC1 overexpressing and loss-of-function <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants showed that the AtTPC1 activity modulates the speed and not the amplitude of traveling Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves in roots triggered by salt stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi et al., 2014</xref>).

Alternatively, TPC1-triggered vacuole excitation could cause the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the vacuole to the cytosol via a Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostat (i.e., a combination of yet-to-be identified Ca<sup>2+</sup> transporters, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dreyer, 2021</xref>) with a striking correlation between the duration of excitation and the amount of released Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dindas et al., 2021</xref>). In such a model scenario, the control of the voltage activation threshold of TPC1 by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) would directly influence the excitation duration of the vacuole membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figures 12</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13E</xref>) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in turn. Without such a regulatory process, a higher luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration would imply a larger transmembrane Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient and therefore the release of a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> quantum. Tuning of the TPC1 activity by luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> would thus have the potential to mitigate or even counterbalance the electro-chemical potential of a larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> gradient. A higher luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration downregulates TPC1 activity, which in turn would reduce the excitation duration and would result in a shortened Ca<sup>2+</sup> release of larger amplitude. Since TPC1 channels are involved in certain Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pottosin and Dobrovinskaya, 2022</xref>), such a scenario could be triggered by a cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable channels of the plasma membrane or ER membrane. Given the involvement of TPK channels to vacuolar excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaślan et al., 2019</xref>), the increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> level could initially lead to the activation of TPK channels for initial depolarization of the vacuolar membrane. Consistent with the findings on the TPC1 activation sequence from recent molecular TPC1 structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dickinson et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ye et al., 2021</xref>), these two signals, voltage together with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, could activate TPC1 channels and lead to further depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen and Sanders, 1996</xref>) affecting the vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostat. The TPC1-dependent activation of a vacuolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostat may also explain the wounding and retarded growth phenotype of the <italic>fou2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonaventure et al., 2007a</xref>) in comparison to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> wild type. The presented model scenario could also be imagined for <italic>V. faba</italic>. Nevertheless, the absence of a retarded growth phenotype of these plants may point to species-specific differences. In view of the high impact of the TPC1 activation threshold on hormone homeostasis and plant growth, future research is now warranted on how <italic>V. faba</italic> plants can (1) prevent retarded growth and (2) benefit from a TPC1 channel variant with a greatly reduced luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity for potentially better adaptation to their respective ecological niche.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>A. thaliana</italic> wild type (Col0) and <italic>attpc1-2</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Peiter et al., 2005</xref>) were grown in a growth chamber under short day conditions (8 hr light, 16 hr dark) with a day/night temperature regime of 22/16°C, a photon flux density of 150 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> and a relative humidity of about 60%. <italic>V. faba</italic> and <italic>L. japonicus</italic> plants were grown in the greenhouse at a 16-hr day/8-hr dark photoperiod, a day/night temperature regime of 22/18°C and a light intensity of approximately 1250 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>RNA sequencing</title><p>Leaves from 6- to 8-week-old <italic>V. faba</italic> plants were harvested and mesophyll RNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin Plant RNA extraction kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Vivek Garg (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After consultation, the reviewers agree that the following experiments are needed:</p><p>1. Reverse mutations in VfTPC1 need to be made and tested.</p><p>2. Expanding the single channel data to include the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on open probability would help provide crucial insight into channel gating (especially since max conductance is not reached for all the channel's macroscopic current recordings).</p><p>In addition, please attend to the reviewer's individual comments, which are aimed to improve the clarity of the data presentation and the manuscript's conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The order of presentation of findings in the text and the order of the figures is confusing. It jumps back and forth. The figures should be presented in the same order as they are refered to in the text.</p><p>2) Figure 1. The recording of VfTPC1 in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> is puzzling, the tail currents are much slower than any other channels studied in the same condition and do not correspond to the findings in Figure 3 (High Ca<sup>2+</sup> slows the tail current). Might this be an artifact of a poorly clamped vacuole with currents too big?</p><p>3) Figure 4 shows the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the G-V curves for all channels, but, since the maximum conductance is not reached, it is impossible to understand to what extent the effect of ca<sup>2+</sup> is on the V1/2 of activation or a reduction of the maximum conductance, indicating possible block by such high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This possible block of ca<sup>2+</sup> should be explored in single-channel recordings.</p><p>4) Line 177. The authors state that VfTPC1 channels activate at the resting potential of the vacuole but no indication is given of this value.</p><p>5) The model employed for generation of vacuole action potentials is presented in a manner that is too simplified. More details on the equations and numerical methods are needed to enhance reproducibility.</p><p>6) Figure 4- Supplement 1. The tail currents of LjTPC1 channels are extremely slow. The current density indicates that the current magnitude is extremely large and the tail current shows signs of poor space clamp. A meaningful comparison between conditions (0 and 50 mM calcium) should be made with smaller currents.</p><p>7) Structural Figures 6 and its supplement lack detail and spatial orientation to be useful. These figures should be remade in a clearer way for the reader to get the message.</p><p>8) Tail currents in Figure 7 show a reduction of their magnitude in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The authors should explain if this is explained by reduced permeability to ca<sup>2+</sup> ions as compared to Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> or if it reflects a pore blocking effect of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>9) The single channel data presented in Figure 8 is interesting, but it lacks context. What is the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration used? An experiment showing the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on single-channel behavior would be more informative (see comment 3 above).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Line 246-252, authors acknowledge that E457N mutation does not add further to voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity of the double mutant (E605A/D606N). But the abstract and the discussion give the impression that three polymorphic residues are responsible for the above sensitivity. This needs to be clarified or the text might need some rewording to reconcile these statements.</p><p>To enhance clarity, the position of the three Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites and the two or three residues mediating luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity can be depicted in a cartoon or topology model of the channel in one of the figure.</p><p>Voltage protocol should be clearly defined for each figure along with the pulse interval (either in the legend or methods) e.g. the voltage used for recording tail currents in Figure 1 is presumably the same as the holding potential. Since the deactivation is significantly different between AtTPC1 and VfTPC1, pulse interval can significantly modify the current activation kinetics.</p><p>In the previous publication authors already tried some of the individual single point mutations for some of the polymorphic residues presented in this paper. It will be worthwhile to present that data in this paper for comparison (maybe as supplementary figures).</p><p>E457 residue (site 2) is far away from the E605/D606 residues (site 3) in the model. This mutant was not tested before. It will be worth checking the current phenotype of the single mutant, E457N AtTPC1, and comparing it with the double mutant E605A/D606N.</p><p>When comparing AtTPC1 and VfTPC1 channels, I wonder if making the reverse or corresponding mutations in VfTPC1 (i.e. A607E/N608D) will result in a channel with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity similar to AtTPC1. Is it possible that the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the allosteric voltage sensor coupling mechanism be different in At versus Vf?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My specific comments are as follows.</p><p>1. The physiological luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of plant vacuoles are between 1.5 and 2.3 mM, yet the lowest Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration used in this study was 10 mM. Are there any measurable differences between AtTPC1 and VfTPC1 at physiological ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations? Is there a plant growth phenotype when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors of AtTPC1 are mutated?</p><p>2. In Figures 1 and 9, vacuoles from Arabidopsis tpc1-2 should be included as negative controls.</p><p>3. For Figure 2, the activation is both time and voltage dependent. It might be helpful to compare the time courses of the close state vs. the fully activated state. According to the G-V curve in Figure 4, AtTPC1 is not fully activated at 90 mV. Hence, a stronger depolarization might be necessary for the demo trace in Figure 2A. Likewise, the deactivation in Figure 3 should also be studied with the fully activated AtTPC1. In Figure 3A, it is not clear which trace is for +80 mV or +100 mV.</p><p>4. The authors suggested that three luminal residues are responsible for the distinct properties of TPC1 from different species. While it was shown that mutating the residues in AtTPC1 into those in VfTPC1 made the AtTPC1 channel resembling VfTPC1, how about the reversed mutations in VfTPC1? Do they make the VfTPC1 channel resembling AtTPC1?</p><p>5. The deactivation of TPC1 from <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> appeared to be much slower than that of VfTPC1. Given these residues (i.e, A607 and N608) are the same for both channels, it is unlikely they are the primary determinants responsible for the slow deactivation.</p><p>6. In Figure 7A, the scale bars should be numbered, and the controls from non-transfected HEK293 cells should be shown. In addition, the selectivity data from AtTPC1, AtTPC1-E605A/D606N, and VfTPC1-A607E/N608D in HEK293 cells should be compared.</p><p>7. For E605A/D606N and E457N/E605A/D606N mutant channels, longer depolarizations might be needed to see the steady state currents in 50 mM ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>8. In Figure 8A, the genetic background should be mentioned in the legend. Additionally, single channel recordings of non-transfected and VfTPC1-A607E/N608D -transfected cells should be provided.</p><p>9. Indeed, all the experiment conditions should be clearly described in the figure legend, e.g., the steady state currents in Figure 1 and the genetic background of experiments in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 9.</p><p>10.

Might this be an artifact of a poorly clamped vacuole with currents too big?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no reason to believe that the slower relaxation of the VfTPC1 tail currents compared with the AtTPC1 channel variants in Figure 1A (now labeled as Figure 2A) is an artifact due to poor clamping of the vacuole. This is supported by the mean half-deactivation times in Figure 3B (now labeled as Figure 4B): The mean half-deactivation times of VfTPC1 derived from current recordings at 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are significantly slower than those of the AtTPC1 wild type channel at higher negative membrane voltages (Figure 3B; now labeled as Figure 4B) and becomes faster with an increase to 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Figure 3B, C; now labeled as Figure 4B, C). These experiments were characterized by similar patch clamp parameters such as membrane capacitance (<italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic>), series resistance (<italic>R<sub>series</sub></italic>) and absolute current amplitudes (<italic>I</italic>) at the pre-activating voltage pulse applied before the deactivating voltage pulse, as given by the following mean values ± SE: AtTPC1-WT (n=5) <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 42.7 ± 1.9 pF, <italic>R<sub>series</sub></italic> = 2.6 ± 0.3 MΩ, <italic>I</italic> = 8.7 ± 1.6 nA; AtTPC1-D605A/E606N (n=4) <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 47.0 ± 4.2 pF, <italic>R<sub>series</sub></italic> = 2.3 ± 0.2 MΩ, <italic>I</italic> = 11.0 ± 1.1 nA; AtTPC1-D605A/E606N/E457N (n=5) <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 48.0 ± 2.0 pF, <italic>R<sub>series</sub></italic> = 2.7 ± 0.2 MΩ, <italic>I</italic> = 8.8 ± 0.6 nA; VtTPC1 (n=4) <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 45.5 ± 4.3 pF, <italic>R<sub>series</sub></italic> = 2.9 ± 0.2 MΩ, <italic>I</italic> = 10.3 ± 1.0 nA. In comparison, AtTPC1-WT, the double and triple AtTPC1 mutants (AtTPC1-D605A/E606N, AtTPC1-D605A/E606N/ E457N) show comparable deactivation kinetics. We would also like to point out that such slow deactivation kinetics as found here for VfTPC1 is not uncommon among the TPC1 channels of other plant species. For example, the TPC1 channel variant from the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic> (PpTPC1a) also shows much slower deactivation than AtTPC1 (Dadacz-Narloch et al. 2011, DOI: 10.1105/tpc.111.086751). See also the response to comment 6 (reviewer 1) and to comment 5 of reviewer 3. In the revised manuscript, we now go into more detail about the different deactivation behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 4 shows the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the G-V curves for all channels, but, since the maximum conductance is not reached, it is impossible to understand to what extent the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is on the V1/2 of activation or a reduction of the maximum conductance, indicating possible block by such high concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This possible block of ca<sup>2+</sup> should be explored in single-channel recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced shift of the activation threshold shown in Figure 4 and also in Figure 1A (now labeled as Figure 5 and Figure 2A, respectively) clearly excludes the possibility that the current reduction predominantly results from a block of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Figure 4A (now labeled as Figure 5A) further shows that in 0 Ca<sup>2+</sup> the G/V curves almost reached their maximum, in particular for VfTPC1, the AtTPC1 double and triple mutant. Thus, the slope of the curve at the midpoint activation voltage is rather well determined. With increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup>, this slope does not change markedly, which supports the notion that the dominant effect is on the midpoint activation voltage V<sub>1/2</sub> and not on G<sub>max</sub>. Based on these considerations, we refrained from exhaustive single channel measurements to additionally disprove a fact that is rather unlikely. Nevertheless, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> block might contribute to the observed current reduction. In current recordings on <italic>Vicia faba</italic> vacuoles, Ward and Schroeder (1994, see below <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>) showed that the permeant cations K<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> both affect the single channel conductance. With only Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a permeant cation on both sides (50<sub>vac</sub>/5<sub>cyt</sub> mM), the single channel conductance of VfTPC1 was only 16 pS, but increased to 155 pS when K<sup>+</sup> (100 mM) was the major cation on both sides of the vacuole membrane. Under symmetric K-based solute conditions (100 mM) on both sides of the vacuole membrane, the presence of 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the luminal side caused a decrease in the single channel conductance from 250 pS (see below <xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table2">Author response table 2</xref>; our recordings, 0 mM luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>) to 155 pS (Ward and Schroeder 1994). Thus, luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> at a concentration of 10 or 50 mM under symmetric K conditions (150 mM) in our whole-vacuole current recordings probably affected not only the TPC1 voltage dependence but also the single channel conductance even though the negative Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect on the ion transport capacity may be attenuated by the higher K<sup>+</sup> concentration (150 vs 100 mM K). Note that, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect on the ion transport capacity does not appear to correlate with Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3, as this side is not functional in VfTPC1.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><caption><title>Single channel conductance of TPC1/SV currents in <italic>Vicia faba</italic> guard cells (Ward and Schroeder 1995, doi 10.1105/tpc.6.5.669).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="3" valign="bottom" align="center">Pipette solution in mM(luminal side)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="3" valign="bottom" align="center">Bath medium in mM(cytosolic side)</th><th rowspan="1" valign="bottom" align="center">Single channel conductance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>K</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ca</bold><sup><bold>2+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>pH</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>K</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ca</bold><sup><bold>2+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>pH</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">16 pS</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">50</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">117 pS</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">155 pS</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="sa2table2" position="float"><label>Author response table 2.</label><caption><title>Single channel conductance of VfTPC1 expressed in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> vacuoles (Lu al., present manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="3" align="center" valign="bottom">Pipette solution in mM(luminal side)</th><th rowspan="1" colspan="3" align="center" valign="bottom">Bath medium in mM(cytosolic side)</th><th rowspan="1" align="center" valign="bottom">Single channel conductance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>K</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ca</bold><sup><bold>2+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>pH</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>K</bold><sup><bold>+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>Ca</bold><sup><bold>2+</bold></sup></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"><bold>pH</bold></td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">5.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">100</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">0.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7.5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">250 pS</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In addition, our group has studied this question also on <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> wild type and <italic>fou2</italic> mutant plants in Beyhl et al.

The tail currents of LjTPC1 channels are extremely slow. The current density indicates that the current magnitude is extremely large and the tail current shows signs of poor space clamp. A meaningful comparison between conditions (0 and 50 mM calcium) should be made with smaller currents.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the critical comment. We agree that space clamp problems cannot be fully excluded for this experiment with LjTPC1 channels shown under 0 mM luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> because the membrane currents were very large indeed. After re-inspection of our LjTPC1 experiments under 0 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we now found an experiment with lower TPC1 currents at +110 mV. This current amplitude was comparable to those recorded at +110 mV with the other TPC1 channel variants (VfTPC1: 595±10 pA/pF (n=5); AtTPC1-WT 571±66 pA/pF (n=5); AtTPC1-D605AD606N 671±81 pA/pF (n=5); mean±SE). Nevertheless, the tail currents were still very slow as illustrated in the relabeled Appendix 1—figure 1. However, such extremely slow relaxation for TPC1 channel is not unusual. The At2HsTPC2 mutant, in which three selectivity filter residues in AtTPC1 were replaced by those of human HsTPC2, also showed very slow tail currents (Guo et al. 2017, Figure S2, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1616191114).

Additionally, the dashed zero lines of the current responses in C-E were set to the same level, and the currents of nontransfected HEK293 cells are shown as a negative control for all three solute conditions.</p><p>Yes, the tail currents recorded in Figure 7C-E (now labeled as Figure 10C-E) from the same HEK cell were reduced under extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> condition compared with K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>. On the one hand the lower tail current amplitude in Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be attributed to the 10-fold lower Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (15 mM) compared with Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> (each 150 mM). On the other hand, it also is in line with the recent mechanistic explanation that the relative permeability of TPC1 (P<sub>Ca</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> » 5:1) does not correlate with the actual Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductivity (Navarro-Retamal et al., 2021). Or in other words, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions cannot permeate the channel better than K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ion which may additionally lead to a lower tail current amplitude. This is further supported by the very small single channel conductance under Ca<sup>2+</sup>based solute conditions compared to K<sup>+</sup>-based ones. Furthermore, the single channel conductance is reduced at a high luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> addition under K<sup>+</sup>-based solute conditions (see above the author response Tables 1 and 2 given in response to comment 3 from reviewer 1).

We have mentioned in the present manuscript that AtTPC1 wild-type data at 0 and 10 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> are identical to those shown in Dickinson et al., 2021.

This mutant was not tested before. It will be worth checking the current phenotype of the single mutant, E457N AtTPC1, and comparing it with the double mutant E605A/D606N.</p></disp-quote><p>We have already tested the single mutants AtTPC1-E457Q and AtTPC1-E457N in a previous paper under identical ionic patch clamp solutions (Dadacz-Narloch et al. 2011, doi: 10.1105/tpc.111.086751). The luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of these mutants was significantly reduced compared with AtTPC1 wild type, but without promoting voltage-dependent activation, as half-activation potentials (V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>) were shifted to more positive values and activation kinetics were slowed down. At Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 2, VfTPC1 now contains N458 instead E458 at the homologous site to AtTPC1-E457. With respect to the effect of E457 on the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of AtTPC1, therefore we further examined whether a neutral residue at site 457 (E457N) intensifies the effects of the double mutations in Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 (E605A/D606N) on AtTPC1 channel gating under different luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. As mentioned in the previous manuscript version at the end of the result section “Polymorphic AtTPC1 triple mutant mimics the VfTPC1 channel features”, we found and concluded the following:</p><p>“An additional E457N replacement did not further affect the transition from an Arabidopsis-like to a VfTPC1-like gating behavior. Considering the attenuating effect of neutralized site 457 (E → N/Q) on voltage-dependent activation of AtTPC1 (Dadacz-Narloch et al., 2011), the hyperactivity of the native <italic>Vicia faba</italic> TPC1 channel is most likely related to the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3.” Since the reader, like the reviewer, may overlook the fact that we have already addressed this AtTPC1-E457 issue, we have revised this section as followed: “Thus, the E605A/D606N exchange is already sufficient to provide AtTPC1 with the voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of VfTPC1. The additional E457N replacement in the AtTPC1 E605A/D606N mutant background, however, did not further affect the transition from an Arabidopsis-like to a VfTPC1-like gating behavior, nor did it further reduce luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity. Dadacz-Narloch et al. (2011) reported that neutral residues at site 457 (E → N/Q) in AtTPC1 made the channel significantly less sensitive to luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> but attenuated voltage dependent activation compared to wild type channels, as midpoint voltages (V<sub>1</sub>, V<sub>2</sub>) were shifted to more positive values. Thus, the hyperactivity of the native <italic>Vicia faba</italic> TPC1 channel is most likely related to the altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 rather than to Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 2. Considering further the similar luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of E605A/D606N and E457N/E605A/D606N (Figure 5C), the two Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 2 and 3 with their residues E457 and E605/D606, respectively, do not have additive effects on channel gating.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>When comparing AtTPC1 and VfTPC1 channels, I wonder if making the reverse or corresponding mutations in VfTPC1 (i.e. A607E/N608D) will result in a channel with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity similar to AtTPC1. Is it possible that the luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the allosteric voltage sensor coupling mechanism be different in At versus Vf?</p></disp-quote><p>Using the VfTPC1 triple mutant (N458E/A607E/N608D), we tested whether such inverse mutations cause VfTPC1 to become AtTPC1-like. Unfortunately, the gating behavior of this VfTPC1 triple mutant was only slightly different from VfTPC1 wild type under 0 and 10 mM luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The triple mutant still started to activate close to the vacuolar resting membrane voltage around -30 mV and similarly responded to an increase to luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> (10 mM) (see Figure 7). Thus, the VfTPC1 triple mutant did not gain the high luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and high depolarization-dependent gating behavior of AtTPC1, indicating that other additional structural adaptations have evolved and counteract these “gain-of-function” efforts. The literature shows that in contrast to “loss-of-function” mutations (successfully applied here to AtTPC1), such reverse gain-of-function approaches with plant ion channels also failed before (Michard et al. 2005, doi.org/10.1085/jgp.200509413; Johansson et al. 2006, doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.02690.x).

The physiological luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of plant vacuoles are between 1.5 and 2.3 mM, yet the lowest Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration used in this study was 10 mM. Are there any measurable differences between AtTPC1 and VfTPC1 at physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that the physiological luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations of plant vacuoles range from as low as 0.2 mM up to 2.3 mM as described in the cited review by Schönknecht (2013, doi: 10.3390/plants2040589). Therefore, we used this lowest physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration of 0.2 mM measured in higher plants in our current clamp and also voltage clamp experiments to record TPC1-dependent membrane polarization and the corresponding TPC1 currents (Figure 12, Figure 12—figure supplement 1). The results have been described in the section: “Vacuoles with VfTPC1 and AtTPC1 triple mutant are hyperexcitable”. Briefly, in these current clamp experiments the vacuoles equipped with VfTPC1 channels were hyperexcitable; they remained depolarized at a voltage of about 0 mV (i.e. at the equilibrium potential for K<sup>+</sup>) during the entire subsequent recording period of 10 s, regardless of the stimulus intensity. In contrast, when AtTPC1-equipped vacuoles were challenged with even the highest current stimulus (1 nA), the post-stimulus voltage remained depolarized for only a short period (<italic>t</italic><sub>plateau</sub> ~ 0.4 s, Figure 12—source data 1) before relaxation to the resting voltage occurred. In comparison to wild type AtTPC1, the AtTPC1-triple mutant vacuoles were also hyperexcitable, behaving very much like the VfTPC1-equipped vacuoles.</p><p>The further analysis of the corresponding TPC1 currents of these same vacuoles revealed, that at this physiological luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration (0.2 mM), the voltage activation threshold of both, VfTPC1 and the AtTPC1 triple mutant E457N/E605A/D606N, but not AtTPC1 wild type was close to the resting membrane voltage of around -30 mV (Figure 12—figure supplement 1E, F). This explains the hyperexcitable vacuoles when equipped with VfTPC1 and the AtTPC1 triple mutant E457N/E605A/D606N.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a plant growth phenotype when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors of AtTPC1 are mutated?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as mentioned in the introduction (third paragraph), there is a phenotype when the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 1 was destroyed by the mutation at site 454 in AtTPC1 (D454N). This so-called <italic>fou2</italic> mutant shows a retarded growth phenotype, appears to be chronically wounded and therefore produces large amounts of the wounding hormone jasmonate (Bonaventure et al., 2007, DOI: 10.1111/j.1365-313X.2006.03002.x ). Since the <italic>fou2</italic> TPC1 channel behaves like a hyperactive TPC1 channel, the <italic>fou2</italic>-equipped vacuoles are hyperexcitable (Jaslan et al. 2019, doi: 10.1038/s41467-019-10599-x) similar to vacuoles equipped with VfTPC1 or the AtTPC1 triple mutant E457N/E505A/D606N (Figure 12). According to the resolved 3D structure of the <italic>fou2</italic> channel (Dickinson et al. 2021, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.2110936119 ) and our VfTPC1 model in this paper, the key residues E605, D606 of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 are now rearranged, preventing binding of luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as electrophysiologically observed for the AtTPC1 mutants E505A/D606N and E457N/E505A/D606N. Therefore, we would expect that AtTPC1 mutant plants E505A/D606N show a similar growth phenotype as <italic>fou2</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Since all these experiments were performed under identical ionic conditions, we feel that the manuscript will not gain much in showing published negative control experiments once again.

For Figure 2, the activation is both time and voltage dependent. It might be helpful to compare the time courses of the close state vs. the fully activated state. According to the G-V curve in Figure 4, AtTPC1 is not fully activated at 90 mV. Hence, a stronger depolarization might be necessary for the demo trace in Figure 2A. Likewise, the deactivation in Figure 3 should also be studied with the fully activated AtTPC1. In Figure 3A, it is not clear which trace is for +80 mV or +100 mV.</p></disp-quote><p>In order to ensure that the TPC1 channels are fully closed, the vacuole membrane was clamped for 4.3 s to the (channel-closing) holding voltage of -60 mV between the applied voltage pulses. Therefore, activation of the TPC1 channels elicited upon increasing depolarized membrane voltage pulses was always achieved from the fully closed channel state. In Figure 2A (now labeled as 3A), the normalized demo traces recorded at +90 mV illustrate the significant differences in activation kinetics of the different channel variants found at less and higher depolarized voltages as well (Figure 2B-D; now labeled as Figure 3B-D). Given the presented data set, we do we do not think the reader gains more by displaying demo traces at different voltages.</p><p>The legend of Figure 3A (now labeled as 4A) now indicates that the pre-pulse voltage of +100 and +80 mV was used for activation of the three AtTPC1 channel variants and VfTPC1, respectively, to study the deactivation process. Unfortunately, it was not possible to pre-activate at +100 mV the VfTPC1 channels in the same way as the AtTPC1 channel variants, since the vacuole got lost. A pre-activating voltage pulse of +100 mV combined with the multiple subsequent deactivating voltage pulses was obviously too stressful for the VfTPC1-equipped vacuoles. However, because of the negatively shifted relative open-channel probability of VfTPC1, deactivation of VfTPC1 was examined as for the other channel types with mostly “fully open” channels (rel. P<sub>o</sub> <underline>&gt;</underline> 0.85 at +80 and +100 mV; see G/V curves in Figure 5A). In addition, the deactivation kinetics at different membrane voltages were always investigated with a constant number of open TPC1 channels in each experiment by always pre-activating at the same prepulse voltage of either +80 or +100 mV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors suggested that three luminal residues are responsible for the distinct properties of TPC1 from different species. While it was shown that mutating the residues in AtTPC1 into those in VfTPC1 made the AtTPC1 channel resembling VfTPC1, how about the reversed mutations in VfTPC1?

The deactivation of TPC1 from <italic>Lotus japonicus</italic> appeared to be much slower than that of VfTPC1.

This is also supported by the PpTPC1a channel variant from the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens.</italic> The PpTPC1a channel shows much slower deactivation than AtTPC1 (Dadacz-Narloch et al. 2011, DOI: 10.1105/tpc.111.086751). Nevertheless, like AtTPC1, PpTPC1a harbors also functional Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor sites 1, 2 and 3 (see Figure 8 in the revised manuscript), as indicated by the AtTPC1-like luminal ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and voltage dependence of PpTPC1a (Dadacz-Narloch et al. 2011, DOI: 10.1105/tpc.111.086751). Additionally, in contrast to VfTPC1, the AtTPC1-mutant E6045E/D606N shows deactivation kinetics similar to AtTPC1 wild type while its Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and voltage dependence are VfTPC1-like (Figures 4, 5). Thus, we can indeed conclude that other functional domains than the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor site 3 determines the deactivation behavior of TPC1 channels.

This is in line with the AtTPC1-like luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity and voltage dependence of PpTPC1a (Dadacz-Narloch et al. 2011, DOI: 10.1105/tpc.111.086751).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

We would also have liked to extend the activating voltage pulses further, but already the applied 1-s lasting voltage pulses were quite stressful for the patched vacuole. Therefore, we have applied a very long time-interval of 4 s between the voltage pulses at the holding voltage, so that the vacuoles could recover, and the currents could relax fully at holding voltage. Or in other words, the risk of losing the vacuole at an even longer voltage pulse time would greatly increase; therefore, the 1-s-lasting voltage pulses for TPC1 current activation was already a compromise between lifetime of the patched vacuole and the achievement of the steady-state current level. However, since we are near the steady-state current level, we feel our results to be quite solid already.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

What is the ca<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependence of the inhibition of TPC1 open probability?</p></disp-quote><p>In this work we have determined the midpoint activation voltages V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub> under three luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (0, 10, 50 mM) (Figure 5). The difference in the corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced shift in the V<sub>1</sub>/V<sub>2</sub> values points to a different Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose dependency of the TPC1 channel variants tested. This can be supported when the V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> values are plotted against the corresponding Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The slope in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>(10 mM)-induced increase in the midpoint activation voltages – particularly V<sub>1</sub> – of the AtTPC1 wild type appears to be steeper than for the other three TPC1 channel variants (VfTPC1, AtTPC1-double/triple mutant). However, more Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations below 10 mM need to be tested in the future to gain more insights into it. Therefore, we did not further address this issue in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> dose dependence of voltage activation of TPC1 channel variants.</title><p>Absolute (A) and normalized (B) voltage activation midpoints <italic>V</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub>2</sub> derived from G/V curves (Figure 5) of the indicated TPC1 channel variants plotted against the corresponding luminal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86384-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
