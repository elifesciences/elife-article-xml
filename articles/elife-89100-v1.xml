normal cells that can frequently be disrupted in cancer. The adrenal tumor pheochromocytoma (PCC) can be caused by activating mutations of the rearranged during transfection (RET) receptor tyrosine kinase, or inactivation of TMEM127, a transmembrane tumor suppressor implicated in trafficking of endosomal cargos. However, the role of aberrant receptor trafficking in PCC is not well understood. Here, we show that loss of TMEM127 causes wildtype RET protein accumulation on the cell surface, where increased receptor density facilitates constitutive ligand-independent activity and downstream signaling, driving cell proliferation. Loss of TMEM127 altered normal cell membrane organization and recruitment and stabilization of membrane protein complexes, impaired assembly, and maturation of clathrin-coated pits, and reduced internalization and degradation of cell surface RET. In addition to RTKs, TMEM127 depletion also promoted surface accumulation of several other transmembrane proteins, suggesting it may cause global defects in surface protein activity and function. Together, our data identify TMEM127 as an important determinant of membrane organization including membrane protein diffusability and protein complex assembly and provide a novel paradigm for oncogenesis in PCC where altered membrane dynamics promotes cell surface accumulation and constitutive activity of growth factor receptors to drive aberrant signaling and promote transformation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RET</kwd><kwd>TMEM127</kwd><kwd>pheochromocytoma</kwd><kwd>clathrin-mediated endocytosis</kwd><kwd>membrane dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009326</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRS-19439</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulligan</surname><given-names>Lois M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-142303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulligan</surname><given-names>Lois M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156355</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Antonescu</surname><given-names>Costin N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahia</surname><given-names>Patricia LM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-178274</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulligan</surname><given-names>Lois M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA264248</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dahia</surname><given-names>Patricia LM</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>TMEM127 depletion alters membrane dynamics, promoting cell surface accumulation and constitutive activity of growth factor receptors, and ultimately providing a novel paradigm for oncogenesis through aberrant receptor localization and signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Internalization of activated receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) from the cell membrane and trafficking through endosomal compartments is a critical mechanism regulating the magnitude and duration of downstream signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmid, 2017</xref>). RTKs internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) transition through successive early and late endosomes for eventual degradation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sorkin and Fortian, 2015</xref>). In cells where endocytosis or trafficking is impaired, RTKs may accumulate inappropriately at the cell surface or in aberrant subcellular compartments, contributing to cell transformation and oncogenic growth. Despite the importance of CME and RTK cargo transition through compartments, the trafficking proteins required for transitions and their roles in these processes remain poorly understood.</p><p>RET (rearranged during transfection) is an RTK required for the development of the kidneys, nerves, and neuroendocrine cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan, 2018</xref>). Under normal conditions, RET is activated by binding of its glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands and GPI-linked GDNF family receptor α (GFRα) coreceptors, which together recruit RET complexes to lipid rafts, leading to downstream signaling through multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pierchala et al., 2006</xref>). Activated RET at the cell membrane is internalized via CME to early endosomes where signaling persists, and subsequently trafficked through the endolysosomal system for downregulation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>). Activating mutations of RET or overexpression of the wildtype (WT) protein are established drivers in several cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan, 2018</xref>). Constitutively active RET mutants give rise to the inherited cancer syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2), which is characterized by the adrenal tumor pheochromocytoma (PCC), while activating mutations or increased RET expression are found in a subset of sporadic PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Hir et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takaya et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takaya et al., 1996b</xref>).</p><p>PCC has also been associated with inactivating mutations of TMEM127, a multipass integral membrane protein broadly expressed at low levels and localized to the plasma membrane, endosomes, and lysosomes in normal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Qin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). TMEM127 functions are poorly understood but it has been suggested to facilitate endosomal transition and cargo trafficking and has been shown to modulate endolysosomal function in renal cell carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Deng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Loss-of-function mutations of <italic>TMEM127</italic> have been identified in both familial and sporadic PCC, leading to loss of TMEM127 protein or mislocalization to the cytosol in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, our recent data have demonstrated that RET expression is increased in TMEM127-mutant PCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The presentation of RET-mutant or TMEM127-deficient PCC are not clinically distinct. Both RET and TMEM127 have been predicted to confer PCC susceptibility through altered kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mulligan, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Neumann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>), however, their relationship has not been explored. The importance of endolysosomal trafficking in regulating the intensity and duration of RET pro-proliferative signals suggested that loss of TMEM127-mediated endosomal transition could alter RET trafficking, promoting accumulation or signaling from aberrant subcellular compartments and contributing to transformation. In this study, we have investigated the effects of TMEM127 depletion on RET regulation and function and more broadly on cellular processes that could contribute to PCC pathogenesis. Here, we show that loss of TMEM127 leads to cell surface accumulation and constitutive activation of RET and that this accumulation is due to alterations in membrane organization and composition that reduce efficiency of CME and decrease internalization of RET as well as other transmembrane proteins, suggesting a global impairment of membrane trafficking. As a result of changes in membrane dynamics, TMEM127 depletion increased RET half-life and led to constitutive RET-mediated signaling and cell proliferation that was blocked by RET inhibition. Our data further demonstrate that TMEM127 loss increases membrane protein diffusability and impairs normal membrane transitions and the stabilization and assembly of membrane protein complexes, allowing inappropriate accumulation of actively signaling RET molecules at the cell membrane, and that mislocalized RET is the pathogenic mechanism in TMEM127-mutant PCC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss-of-function mutations disrupt TMEM127 localization and reduce early endosome formation</title><p>WT-TMEM127 has previously been shown to localize to endosomal compartments, while loss-of-function PCC-TMEM127 mutants reduce protein expression or may be aberrantly localized in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Qin et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we assessed colocalization of transiently expressed TMEM127 with the early endosome marker EEA1 in human retinal pigment epithelial ARPE-19 cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. We showed that WT-TMEM127 localized robustly to EEA1-positive endosomes but that colocalization was significantly reduced for two transmembrane domain TMEM127 mutants (C140Y, S147del), which did not show appreciable localization to EEA1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

In ARPE-19 cells transiently expressing RET and TMEM127, GDNF stimulation promoted colocalization of RET with WT but not mutant TMEM127 in EEA1-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

We confirmed that these TMEM127-KO cells had similarly reduced EEA1-positive endosomes to our transient models, described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, we observed notably increased levels of RET protein in TMEM127-KO compared to control Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which was consistent with accumulation of a fully mature glycosylated RET form that is found primarily on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Richardson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takahashi et al., 1991</xref>). This accumulation was not due to changes in <italic>RET</italic> gene transcription, since TMEM127-KO cells had significantly less RET mRNA in qRT-PCR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting a possible feedback loop modulating RET transcription. Transient re-expression of WT-TMEM127 in these cells reduced RET protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

We also saw similar plasma membrane accumulation of endogenous N-cadherin and transferrin receptor-1 proteins in HEK293 cells depleted for TMEM127, and reintroduction of flag-tagged TMEM127 significantly reduced membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To further explore the surface accumulation of RET and impairment of RET internalization in TMEM127-depleted cells, we assessed RET colocalization with cell surface clathrin by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguet et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hyndman et al., 2017</xref>). In Mock-KO cells, GDNF treatment significantly increased colocalization of RET and plasma membrane clathrin structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and caused a significant loss of cell surface RET intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting activated RET is being recruited to CCPs and then moving out of the TIRF field as it is internalized into the cell. In contrast, when normalized for the increased total RET intensity on the cell surface, RET-clathrin colocalization in untreated TMEM127-KO cells was significantly less than in untreated Mock-KO cells and was not increased by GDNF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>), suggesting impaired recruitment of RET to cell surface clathrin irrespective of ligand stimulation. The overall intensity of cell surface clathrin puncta was not affected by GDNF treatment but was significantly less in TMEM127-KO cells compared to Mock-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). A decrease of clathrin fluorescence intensity in plasma membrane clathrin structures could suggest a decrease in the number of clathrin subunits incorporated per CCP, and thus reflect a change in clathrin assembly or size. Alternatively, as TIRF intensity decays exponentially with distance from the coverslip, a reduction of clathrin intensity in the TIRF image could also indicate an increase in membrane curvature. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used concomitant widefield epifluorescence microscopy to assess clathrin fluorescence intensity at puncta detected within the TIRF images above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), as this form of microscopy is not sensitive to changes in fluorescence intensity by the extent of CCP curvature generation. Clathrin fluorescence intensity in epifluorescence images was robustly reduced in clathrin puncta from TMEM127-KO cells, indicating less clathrin and smaller clusters, not more deeply invaginated structures.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Rearranged during transfection (RET) colocalization with cell surface clathrin is reduced and clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) are smaller in TMEM127-depleted cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of RET and clathrin localization in Mock-KO and TMEM127-KO SH-SY5Y cells treated with (+) or without (-) glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (100 ng/ml) for 5 min, fixed and labeled with indicated antibodies, and imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM).

Because over 60% of CCPs have been measured to be less than 200 μm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wu et al., 2001</xref>), the approximate diffraction limit of a light microscope, super-resolution techniques are needed to fully resolve these structures for accurate quantitation. Therefore, we used a technique called dual iterative SIM (diSIM, SIM<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Löschberger et al., 2021</xref>) that combines a lattice illumination pattern with deconvolution and standard SIM processing to resolve lateral structures as small as 60–100 nm in the ~525 nm emission range. Initial visual inspection of diSIM images of TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells expressing EGFP-tagged clathrin light chain (EGFP-CLC) suggested TMEM127-KO cells had fewer and smaller CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We further quantified the 2D area of over 6500 CCPs in and near the plasma membranes closest to the coverslip in TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells. Here, we found TMEM127-KO cells had a 2D CCP area approximately half of Mock-KO cells (0.008 µm<sup>2</sup> vs. 0.016 µm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). An area of 0.008 µm<sup>2</sup> corresponds to a diameter of approximately 90 nm, within the resolving power of the diSIM technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Löschberger et al., 2021</xref>). Finally, we also quantitated the number of CCPs per cell on a single plane near the lower membrane of TMEM127-KO and Mock-KO cells. The added resolving power of diSIM gave us confidence in reaching a more accurate count (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Here, we found a significant decrease in CCPs in TMEM127-KO cells relative to Mock-KO cells (213 vs 289). diSIM provides a clear indication that KO of TMEM127 alters the size and quantity of CCPs in a cell.</p><p>Together, our data indicate that TMEM127 depletion led to smaller clathrin clusters or CCPs, suggesting that TMEM127 regulates CCP formation, assembly, and/or turnover. In contrast, we observed a significant 1.3-fold increase in intensity of cell surface RET puncta in TMEM127-KO cells relative to Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), consistent with the cell surface accumulation of RET, but did not observe a decrease in RET puncta in response to GDNF stimulation suggesting impaired internalization. As fewer CCPs are present in TMEM127-KO cells, some of these intense RET puncta are likely not in CCPs but may represent other organization of the receptor at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, we saw a similar increase in surface EGFR puncta intensity in TMEM127-KO cells, with a 1.4-fold increase over Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), demonstrating that protein accumulation at the cell surface is not exclusive to RET in these cells. We extended this observation using surface biotinylation assays and showed that multiple classes of transmembrane proteins including RTKs (RET, EGFR), cell adhesion molecules (N-cadherin, integrin beta-3), and carrier proteins (transferrin receptor-1) accumulate on the cell membrane in TMEM127-KO compared to Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), suggesting a global effect caused by impaired surface protein internalization. Together, these data suggest that loss of TMEM127 impairs normal membrane processes including formation of clathrin clusters or CCPs and recruitment of cargo, resulting in altered cell membrane composition and accumulation of multiple cell surface proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>TMEM127 depletion impairs assembly and maturation of CCPs</title><p>To explore perturbations of the cell membrane in TMEM127-KO cells, we used live-cell time-lapse TIRF imaging of cells stably expressing EGFP-CLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Animation 1</xref>).

Clathrin assemblies must reach a minimum threshold for nucleation of CCPs to initiate. These assemblies can result in either small short-lived (&lt;15 s) abortive CCPs that spontaneously disassemble without cargo uptake, or longer lived productive CCPs that effectively recruit cargo for internalization and delivery to the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaksonen and Roux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). We examined CCP dynamics over time in live cells using TIRFM and automated detection to identify diffraction-limited EGFP-CLC objects, and assessed the rates of assembly, initiation, and maturation of CCPs in Mock-KO and TMEM127-KO cells. Here, we show that TMEM127-KO cells have significantly increased stochastic assemblies of transient small subthreshold clathrin-labeled structures (sCLS) that are unable to recruit sufficient clathrin to form bona fide CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). As a result of this increase in transient structures, we show a resultant decrease in the initiation of bona fide CCPs in TMEM127-KO cells compared to Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and D</xref>). Further, as indicated by the reduced clathrin puncta intensity at the membrane and reduced area of CCPs detected by dSIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>), the CCPs that do form in TMEM127-KO cells are smaller, potentially limiting their ability to recruit cargo, such as RET, leading the cargo proteins to accumulate on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Interestingly, although there are relatively fewer CCPs formed in TMEM127-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), a smaller fraction of these had lifespans less than 15 s, suggesting CCPs that are able to overcome early assembly defects due to TMEM127 loss are able to mature to productive CCPs more efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The overall increase in sCLS and decrease in CCPs suggests that TMEM127 depletion may reduce the potential for clathrin to form or stabilize CCPs capable of internalization and compromise the maturation of productive CCPs, thereby leading to impaired internalization of RET and other cell surface proteins.</p><p>The defect in cargo recruitment to CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and CCP assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–G</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A–E</xref>) in TMEM127-KO cells could reflect changes specific to cargo engagement within CCPs or broader changes in membrane dynamics, such as protein and lipid mobility. To determine if loss of TMEM127 resulted in broader impacts on membrane dynamics, we examined the mobility of EGFR by single-particle tracking, using strategies we recently developed and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, labeling of EGFR with a Fab antibody fragment for single-particle tracking in the absence of ligand stimulation allows study of EGFR mobility that is largely clathrin independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). TMEM127-KO cells exhibited a similar distribution of the population of EGFR in immobile, confined, and mobile cohorts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that TMEM127 does not disrupt capture of a minor subset of EGFR within tetraspanin nanodomains that occurs in the absence of ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2023</xref>). However, consistent with broader disruption of membrane dynamics upon loss of TMEM127, we observed an increase in the diffusion coefficient of the confined and mobile fractions, in particular the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). This predicts that loss of TMEM127 may broadly impact membrane dynamics, suggesting that defects in receptor recruitment to CCPs and perturbations of CCP assembly that may lead to accumulation of membrane proteins at the cell surface in TMEM127-KO cells may result in part from broad alterations in membrane dynamics and/or receptor mobility that impact the formation of CCPs and their recruitment of diverse cargo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Clathrin adaptor recruitment is not TMEM127 dependent</title><p>Recruitment of RET to CCPs requires interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>). We used proximity ligation assays (PLA) to identify and quantify direct protein interactions in situ to assess association of endogenous AP2 with RET and clathrin in SH-SY5Y cells. In untreated Mock-KO cells, RET-AP2 interaction was minimal but was significantly increased by GDNF treatment, as indicated by increased PLA puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting RET recruitment as cargo to CCPs. Association of RET and AP2 was significantly greater in TMEM127-KO cells, consistent with the higher RET protein levels at the cell membrane, and was further increased by GDNF treatment, suggesting that the RET-AP2 association was not TMEM127 dependent. We saw robust association of clathrin and AP2 in untreated Mock-KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). GDNF treatment significantly reduced association, consistent with maturation of productive CCPs and subsequent uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles and delivery of cargo to endosomes. In comparison, TMEM127-KO cells had significantly greater constitutive association of AP2 and clathrin and this was not affected by GDNF. We did not detect association of AP2 with TMEM127 under any condition using PLA (not shown), suggesting TMEM127 is not closely associated with clathrin-labeled structures. Together, our data suggest that, in TMEM127-KO cells, AP2-clathrin complexes accumulate but are unable to efficiently support the formation and/or assembly of CCPs to facilitate internalization of cargo proteins. This is consistent with the observation that TMEM127-KO cells have significantly higher sCLS nucleation rates, while exhibiting decreased formation of bona fide CCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). It follows that the increased proximity of RET and AP2 in TMEM127-KO cells may reflect increased cell surface levels of RET that may engage with endocytic adaptors, but that these interactions infrequently lead to formation or stabilization of bona fide CCPs. These data suggest that TMEM127 depletion does not directly affect ability of adaptors to associate with clathrin or cargo but may reflect an integral membrane defect that alters normal membrane protein movement and abilities to assemble or stabilize larger membrane protein complexes.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Enhanced recruitment of endocytic adaptors and disrupted membrane microdomains in TMEM127-depleted cells.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Proximity ligation assay (PLA) of Mock-KO and TMEM127-KO SH-SY5Y cells treated with (+) or without (-) glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (100 ng/ml) for 5 min.

Notably, accumulation of surface receptors was not unique to RET as we also saw increased intensity of EGFR puncta and increased membrane levels of other receptors and adhesion molecules in the absence of TMEM127 in both SH-SY5Y and HEK293 cells, consistent with a global defect of membrane dynamics that could also block internalization of membrane proteins. As a result of increased density in the plasma membrane in SH-SY5Y cells, RET is constitutively active, promoting stimulation of multiple downstream signaling pathways. Importantly, treatment with selective RET inhibitors abrogated these signals including mTOR signaling, suggesting that, in this model, the increase in mTOR signaling seen in response to TMEM127 loss is a direct response to RET activity.</p><p>As both RET and TMEM127 have been previously shown to internalize through CME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Crupi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crupi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flores et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Richardson et al., 2006</xref>), we assessed the impact of TMEM127 depletion on membrane clathrin distribution and its effects on cargo internalization. Despite increased RET puncta intensity on the cell surface, RET localization to clathrin puncta was reduced and was not responsive to GDNF, consistent with impairment of clathrin-mediated internalization of RET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The formation of CCPs is a multistep process involving recruitment of clathrin adaptors and stepwise assembly of clathrin-labeled structures at the cell membrane for recruitment of cargo proteins and assembly of productive CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Transient small subthreshold CLSs are unstable and may not recruit sufficient clathrin or cargo to achieve a threshold size and progress further to initiate bona fide CCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Once sufficient clathrin is recruited for initiation, CCPs may mature to pinch off clathrin-coated vesicles from the membrane, but a subset fail to mature and are aborted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadlecova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mettlen et al., 2018</xref>). Our single-particle tracking studies suggest that mobility of membrane cargo proteins like EGFR is enhanced in TMEM127 KO cells, which may decrease capture of cargo at stochastic clathrin assemblies and limit their progression to successful nucleation and initiation of bona fide CCPs. Consistent with this, our data indicate that TMEM127 depletion increased the frequency of the sCLSs but significantly reduced their ability to reach the clathrin threshold size and initiate bona fide CCPs. CCPs that did form were smaller, contained less clathrin, and were able to recruit less RET cargo than in Mock-KO cells. TMEM127 loss did not impair RET-AP2 or AP2-clathrin association, suggesting that key protein interactions required for internalization were largely intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Zastrow and Sorkin, 2021</xref>). However, we saw decreased capture of RET within bona fide CCPs, formation of CCPs was reduced, and those that formed smaller in TMEM127-deficient cells, suggesting that altered membrane dynamics, increasing the diffusability of membrane proteins and impairing capture of sufficient cargo-adaptor complexes into nascent CCPs, could be limiting the recruitment of sufficient cargo and coalescence of CCPs, consistent with previous studies that link membrane tension and CCP formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Djakbarova et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saleem et al., 2015</xref>). Together, our data suggest that accumulation of RET and other transmembrane proteins at the cell surface in the absence of functional TMEM127 is due to reduced efficiency of clathrin recruitment to CCP, limiting capacity for cargo internalization and reducing CME, and that this correlates with the global disruption of membrane protein composition, protein complex assembly, and organization in other domains, such as membrane rafts. Interestingly, our preliminary studies have suggested that one outcome of this may be impairment of the formation of other membrane-associated complexes and processes, such as recruitment of ubiquitination machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2023</xref>), contributing to the TMEM127 phenotype and highlighting the broader implications of altered membrane partitioning.</p><p>As a result of impaired internalization in TMEM127-deficient SH-SY5Y cells, RET protein accumulates on the cell surface and degradation is reduced, leading to sustained downstream pro-proliferative signals. We showed that these pathways can be blocked using selective RET inhibitors, suggesting that targeting RET may be a valuable therapeutic strategy in the subset of PCC tumors where RET mutations have not been recognized but RET expression is detected. In support of this, in recent preliminary studies, we have shown that xenografts of TMEM127 KO SH-SY5Y cells produce larger tumors in nude mice, but that growth is reduced by treatment with the RET inhibitor selpercatinib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, TMEM127 mutations have also been identified as drivers in other cancers, notably renal cell carcinoma, where RET is not highly expressed. In these cancers, we would predict that TMEM127 loss has similar effects on membrane dynamics, membrane protein accumulation, and CCP formation to those seen in our model and that accumulation of other growth factor receptors, such as MET, on the cell surface will lead to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Marona et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rhoades Smith and Bilen, 2019</xref>). Notably, TMEM127 mutations or reduced expression are also seen at low frequencies in a number of other tumor types (e.g. endometrial, liver, breast, kidney, ovarian cancers; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tate et al., 2019</xref>) where TMEM127 contributions have not yet been specifically recognized, suggesting that aberrant accumulation and activation of growth factor receptors could also impact these tumors. Together, our data suggest a novel paradigm for oncogenic transformation in TMEM127-mutant tumors. We predict that altered membrane dynamics blocks normal internalization and degradation of key WT growth-promoting receptors, which then act as oncogenes to drive tumorigenesis in a cell type-specific fashion. Further, we predict that these oncogenes will provide valuable alternative therapeutic targets that have not been previously explored in TMEM127-mutant cancers.</p><p>Importantly, the changes in membrane dynamics and aberrant accumulation of membrane proteins in response to TMEM127 depletion are not exclusively oncogenic but may have other pathological implications. Consistent with our data showing RET accumulation on the cell surface, TMEM127 KO mice have increased insulin sensitivity and upregulation of insulin-dependent AKT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Srikantan et al., 2019</xref>), which may suggest excess surface accumulation of insulin receptors and resulting enhanced signaling in the liver in this model. Notably, recent studies have suggested that TMEM127 may have immune modulatory roles. In <italic>Salmonella</italic>-infected but not normal antigen presenting cells, TMEM127 acts in recruitment of protein complexes that promote downregulation of MHC-II and suppression of T-cell activation, while depletion of TMEM127 in infected cells increases MHC-II surface expression and reduces innate immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alix et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, TMEM127 depletion leads to MHC-I accumulation on the cell membrane in AML cell models, promoting enhanced recruitment of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the outcomes of TMEM127 depletion may be cell type as well as tumor type and stage specific, depending on the cell membrane proteomic repertoire. Further, TMEM127 depletion may promote oncogenic signaling in tumor initiation and growth, as we observed in PCC, or potentially contribute to alterations in the tumor immune environment in progression of other cancer models. These observations suggest that TMEM127 may have broad cellular roles in maintaining balance in the membrane proteome and suggest a generalized role for TMEM127 as a facilitator of diverse membrane protein complexes regulating localized membrane diffusion and promoting stability of complex assemblies to regulate membrane organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human Retinal Pigment Epithelial ARPE-19 cells (CRL-2302, ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0145">CVCL_0145</ext-link>) were cultured in Ham’s F-12 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON, Canada).

Single particles labeled with Cy3B were detected and tracked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jaqaman et al., 2008</xref>), and the motion types and diffusion coefficients were determined using moment-scaling spectrum analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freeman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jaqaman et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>A minimum of three independent replicates were performed for each experiment, except where indicated. Consistency between experimental replicates was assessed through two-tailed unpaired t-tests, and one- or two-way ANOVA with indicated multiple comparison tests using GraphPad Prism version 9 (GraphPad Prism Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Specific significance tests were selected using GraphPad Prism following residual testing for Gaussian distribution (normality tests of Anderson-Darling, D’Agostino, Shapiro-Wilk, Kolmogorov-Smirnov) and testing whether residuals are clustered or heteroscedastic (Brown-Forsyth and Bartlett’s tests). Bar and line graphs, used for immunoblots and time course experiments, were presented with means and standard deviation (± SD), while box plots with whiskers from minimum to maximum values were used for individual cell imaging. Graphs were produced using GraphPad Prism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Software, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-89100-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

The authors showed that deletion of TMEM127 causes RET protein accumulation on the cell surface and, thereby, increased its constitutive ligand-independent activity and downstream signaling. They also unveiled the mechanism of how TMEM127 regulates cell membrane dynamics, particularly focusing on clathrin distribution and its effects on cargo internalization.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>They showed that the deletion of TMEM127 affected multiple classes of transmembrane proteins, including RTKs (RET, EGFR), cell adhesion molecules (N-Cadherin, Integrin Beta-3), and carrier proteins (Transferrin Receptor-1), suggesting a global effect on cell surface proteins. This, at least in part, may explain how TMEM127 mutations act as drivers in PCC as well as in other cancers, such as renal cell carcinoma, where RET is not highly expressed. Overall, these findings provide new insights into the understanding of pheochromocytoma pathogenesis and potentially other cancers.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The major weakness of this study is the lack of human PCC cell lines for evaluating the function of TMEM127. Currently, the cell line models for pheochromocytoma are unavailable, and manipulation of patient-derived organoids is challenging. To complement this weakness, they provided immunohistochemical data showing that RET protein is highly expressed in TMEM127-mutant PCC.</p><p>Furthermore, some of the authors in this manuscript recently published a paper titled 'TMEM127 suppresses tumor development by promoting RET ubiquitination, positioning, and degradation' (Guo et al. Cell Reports 42, 113070, 2023, which is also cited in the current manuscript). In this manuscript, they showed that TMEM127 binds to RET and recruits the NEDD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase for RET ubiquitination and degradation via TMEM127. In general, the ubiquitination of proteins is highly specific to each molecule. In the current version of the manuscript, there is no description of the relevance between these two potentially different mechanisms (clathrin-mediated or ubiquitin-mediated) of accumulating RET and/or other proteins mentioned in two separate papers. I believe the authors should at least discuss this.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89100.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #5 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Walker et al., nicely demonstrated a role of TMEM127 in regulating membrane dynamics of RET, a receptor tyrosine kinase and oncogene for multiple cancers, particularly in pheochromocytoma (PCC).

In the context of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN-2), where RET mutation is the major driver of thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal pathologies, including pheochromocytoma, this mechanistic dissection of RET and TMEM127 is fundamentally sound. While the significance was deemed important, the strength of the evidence was found to be solid,</p></disp-quote><p>Recognizing the limitations of models available for study of neuroendocrine cancers, and specifically for pheochromocytomas, we have revised and clarified the text of the current manuscript version and provide specific responses to the additional comments provided below, highlighting changes and new data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A current lack of pheochromocytoma cell lines and the use of generated cell lines for mechanistic studies presents a significant challenge that may undermine the inferred value of these findings in mock in vitro systems and question reproducibility in pheochromocytoma. Consideration for 3-dimensional patient-derived pheochromocytoma organoid in vitro and patient-derived organoid xenograft in vivo models will enable confirmation or refute novel findings described by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely with Reviewer 1 that ideally, we should replicate these findings with PCC-derived cells in vitro and in organoids. Despite many attempts, PCC cell lines have proved a major challenge for the field of neuroendocrine cancers. Cell line models are not available and PDOs have proven poorly growing and resistant to manipulations, such as CRISPR KOs or siRNA KD. In studies completed since the submission and review of the present manuscript, and subsequently published elsewhere, we have shown that RET protein is highly expressed in TMEM127-mutant PCC by immunohistochemistry. We also showed that the TMEM127-KO SH-SY5Y cell model does grow more robustly than Mock-KO cells in nude mice and that RET inhibition (Selpercatinib) does lead to tumor regression (Guo et al., 2023), suggesting that our findings may be reproducible in vivo. These findings, and potential caveats of the cell models used have been further discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Most notably, all experiments are conducted in an isogenic single-cell line. This exposes the whole story to be potentially confounded by unknown variables.</p><p>In addition, studies would benefit from the adding back of TMEM127, or other methods to modulate endosome and plasma membrane dynamics to mechanistically secure the cause of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2, we have generated a TMEM127 KO in HEK293, an unrelated cell line which expressed low levels of TMEM127 but does not express RET. Consistent with our findings in SH-SY5Y, we saw increased membrane accumulation of endogenous membrane proteins N-cadherin and transferrin receptor-1 in these cells in the absence of TMEM127. Additionally, re-expression of a wildtype TMEM127 (FLAG-TMEM127) in these cells led to dramatic decreases in membrane localization of these proteins (Supplemental Figure 1D). These data suggest that membrane accumulation is indeed TMEM127 dependent, and that these processes are not directly dependent on RET expression.</p><p>References</p><p>Guo, Q., Z.M. Cheng, H.
