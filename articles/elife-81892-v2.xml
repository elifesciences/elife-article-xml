This leaves neurons susceptible to loss-of-function of maternal <italic>UBE3A</italic>. Indeed, Angelman syndrome, a severe neurodevelopmental disorder, is caused by maternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> deficiency. A promising therapeutic approach to treating Angelman syndrome is to reactivate the intact paternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> by suppressing <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic>. Prior studies show that many neurological phenotypes of maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice can only be rescued by reinstating <italic>Ube3a</italic> expression in early development, indicating a restricted therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome. Here, we report that reducing <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> by antisense oligonucleotides in juvenile or adult maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice rescues the abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms and sleep disturbance, two prominent clinical features of Angelman syndrome. Importantly, the degree of phenotypic improvement correlates with the increase of Ube3a protein levels. These results indicate that the therapeutic window of genetic therapies for Angelman syndrome is broader than previously thought, and EEG power spectrum and sleep architecture should be used to evaluate the clinical efficacy of therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ASO</kwd><kwd>RNA therapeutics</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorder</kwd><kwd>EEG</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007137</institution-id><institution>Texas Children's Hospital</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Main Street America Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS100893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH117089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Mingshan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Reactivation of paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> by an ASO therapy in juvenile and adult mouse models of Angelman syndrome reverses the impairments of EEG power spectrum and sleep pattern, suggesting that these two core disease features may be improved by such therapies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angelman syndrome is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe intellectual disability, developmental delay, speech impairment, motor dysfunction, behavioral uniqueness, microcephaly, sleep disturbance, seizures, and abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buiting et al., 2016</xref>). It is caused by loss-of-function of the maternally derived <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene encoding ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kishino et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matsuura et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>UBE3A</italic> is expressed from both maternal and paternal alleles in non-neuronal cells, but is paternally imprinted in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albrecht et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rougeulle et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Judson et al., 2014</xref>). Imprinted expression of <italic>UBE3A</italic> or silence of the paternal allele in neurons is due to a long non-coding RNA, <italic>UBE3A</italic> antisense transcript (<italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic>). <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic> is expressed from the paternally inherited chromosome and localized in the nucleus to repress <italic>UBE3A in cis</italic> through a transcriptional collision mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, loss-of-function of the maternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> leads to the absence of functional UBE3A proteins in neurons. Maternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> deficiency can result from deletions in the chromosomal region 15q11–q13 containing <italic>UBE3A</italic>, which account for about 70% of Angelman syndrome patients, mutations in <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene, paternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15, or an imprinting defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buiting et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Studies in rodent models carrying maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> loss-of-function mutations have provided insights into Angelman syndrome mechanisms and identified therapeutic strategies. Many disease relevant phenotypes were reported in these Angelman syndrome models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rotaru et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang, 2020</xref>), and some of them are robust and reproducible in different models and laboratories, including motor impairments (e.g., poor performance in rotarod and open-field tests), decreased innate marble burying and nest building behaviors, cortical hyperexcitability (e.g, poly-spikes in EEG), altered EEG power spectrum and sleep pattern, increased susceptibility to seizure induction, and reduced synaptic long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Miura et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weeber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yashiro et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehlen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva-Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Judson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Born et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sonzogni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copping and Silverman, 2021</xref>). Thus, these phenotypes are suitable for evaluating the effects of potential disease-modifying therapies even though some of them may not be clinically relevant. By genetically reinstating <italic>Ube3a</italic> expression from the maternal allele at different developmental ages, rescue experiments in mice show that most of these neurological functions require <italic>Ube3a</italic> during late embryonic and early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva-Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rotaru et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sonzogni et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that the therapeutic window for Angelman syndrome may be limited to very young ages.</p><p>Two categories of therapeutic strategies are being actively pursued for Angelman syndrome. One is to target the downstream substrates of UBE3A protein, and the other is to restore <italic>UBE3A</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Margolis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yang, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Copping et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Elgersma and Sonzogni, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Markati et al., 2021</xref>). Since the paternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> allele is intact in Angelman syndrome, an attractive approach is to reactivate the silenced paternal <italic>UBE3A</italic> by suppressing <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Indeed, reducing <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> levels in mice through genetic manipulations or topoisomerase inhibition results in unsilencing of the paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meng et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meng et al., 2013</xref>). Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) or CRISPR/Cas9 targeting the mouse <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> can also upregulate paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> expression. Administering ASO or adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing CRISPR/Cas9 to newborn, but not older, maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice rescues a subset of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Milazzo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid et al., 2021</xref>). Currently, three Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 clinical trials with ASOs targeting <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic> are underway. Another approach is to directly express an exogenous copy of <italic>UBE3A</italic> by AAV, which also only rescues a subset of phenotypes of maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice when administered postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daily et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Judson et al., 2021</xref>). The reversibility of neurological phenotypes at different ages is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. These results imply that gene-targeted therapies may have to be administered to late trimester fetuses or newborns to treat Angelman syndrome, as the first postnatal week in mice is generally assumed to be equivalent to the third trimester of human gestation with regard to the central nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zeiss, 2021</xref>). This timing of intervention would be difficult because currently Angelman syndrome is diagnosed after at least the first 6 months of life and typically between 1 and 4 years of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Ube3a</italic> mRNA is diminished in the brain of a new maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mouse but remains in a previously generated Angelman syndrome mouse model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of <italic>UBE3A</italic> imprinting and Angelman syndrome.

Alterations in EEG power spectrum, particularly an increase in the power of low frequency oscillations (i.e., 1–30 Hz), are well documented in both Angelman syndrome patients and rodent models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Born et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frohlich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Born et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copping and Silverman, 2021</xref>). This brain rhythm is a potential biomarker for assessing clinical symptoms because the power in the delta range (2–4 Hz) correlates with symptom severity in Angelman syndrome patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hipp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostrowski et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, sleep disturbance, another prominent feature of Angelman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Spruyt et al., 2018</xref>), is also recapitulated in the mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colas et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehlen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copping and Silverman, 2021</xref>). Hence, to support the ongoing and planned clinical trials, it is crucial to determine to what extent the EEG and sleep deficits are reversible in juvenile and adult Angelman syndrome mouse models because these developmental ages are more clinically relevant than the neonatal period. To address this question, we generated a new mouse <italic>Ube3a</italic> null allele and administered a single dose of ASOs targeting <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> to juvenile or adult maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice. We first systematically determined the levels of <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> and <italic>Ube3a</italic> transcripts and Ube3a proteins across different brain regions at different timepoints post ASO administration and then evaluated the corresponding EEG and sleep phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a new <italic>Ube3a</italic> null allele in mice</title><p>Our goal was to assess the effect of <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic>-targeted ASOs in a mouse model of Angelman syndrome. The widely used mouse model is a <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout allele (<italic>Ube3a<sup>tm1Alb</sup></italic>, referred to as <italic>Ube3a<sup>Δe5</sup></italic> here to be distinguished from the new allele) that deletes exon 5 (previously named as exon 2), resulting in a premature stop codon in exon 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) analyses on this <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout allele with primer sets targeting different exons. Exons 4, 6, and other exons downstream of the deleted exon 5 were still transcribed in the brains of adult heterozygous maternal (<italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe5/p+</sup></italic>) and homozygous (<italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe5/pΔe5</sup></italic>) mutant mice at a level comparable to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), possibly due to an escape from nonsense-mediated mRNA decay or an alternative start site.

Although this knockout allele produces very little full-length functional Ube3a proteins in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Judson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grier et al., 2015</xref>), we sought to create a new <italic>Ube3a</italic> null allele with diminished <italic>Ube3a</italic> mRNA to facilitate the evaluation of ASO efficacy at the transcript level. CRISPR/Cas9 was used to delete the largest <italic>Ube3a</italic> coding exon, exon 6. The resulting allele (<italic>Ube3a<sup>Δe6</sup></italic>) carries a premature stop codon in exon 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). RT-ddPCR analyses of adult heterozygous maternal mutant mice (<italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic>) showed that <italic>Ube3a</italic> mRNA was diminished in the brain and reduced in the liver as compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Western blots revealed that Ube3a protein levels in different brain regions of <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice were 2–17% of those in WT mice when they were at 6 weeks of age or older (see below). Thus, both <italic>Ube3a</italic> mRNA and proteins are diminished in the <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mouse brains.

The short Ube3a isoform 3 is the dominant isoform and mainly localized in the nucleus, whereas the long isoform 2 is expressed at 20–30% of the isoform 3 level and primarily distributed in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avagliano Trezza et al., 2019</xref>).

Since the protein and transcript levels were measured at the same post ASO injection timepoints from the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres, respectively, these correlations indicate a broad distribution of ASOs in the mouse brains and a spatiotemporally comparable pattern between the changes in transcripts and proteins. Taken together, our results demonstrate that a single unilateral ICV injection of ASO targeting <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> in <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice leads to a long-lasting downregulation of this transcript and reactivation of the paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> allele throughout the brains, and the upregulation of Ube3a proteins by Ube3a-as ASO can last at least 10 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Reactivation of paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> expression alleviates abnormal EEG rhythmic activity in <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice</title><p>Maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> deficiency in mice causes altered brain rhythms, sleep disturbance, and epileptiform activity (e.g., cortical poly-spikes), all of which can be examined by chronic video-EEG and electromyogram (EMG) recordings.

We first averaged the Ube3a protein levels across different brain regions to estimate the overall Ube3a protein levels in each mouse from the Western blot experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and then obtained the mean Ube3a protein levels at each of the 3-, 6-, and 10-week timepoints post ASO injection. Since the Ube3a protein levels in <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice were expressed a fraction of the WT levels, for the corresponding EEG relative power in different frequency bands, power ratio (α + β1 + β2)/γ2, and time in REM sleep, we also normalized the data by the means of those in the corresponding control ASO-treated WT mice. For both ASO injection into juvenile and adult mice, the relative power in the theta (θ, 4–8 Hz), alpha (α, 8–13 Hz), low beta (β1, 13–18 Hz), and high beta (β2, 18–25 Hz) bands negatively correlated with the Ube3a protein levels, whereas the relative power in the low gamma (γ1, 25–50 Hz) and high gamma (γ2, 50–100 Hz) bands positively correlated with the Ube3a protein levels. Therefore, the power ratio (α + β1 + β2)/γ2 also negatively correlated with the Ube3a protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). However, the relative power in the delta (δ, 1–4 Hz) band did not correlate with the Ube3a protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Three active clinical trials of <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic>-targeted ASOs have generated a great deal of excitement and expectation in the community. Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies in mouse models of Angelman syndrome demonstrate that <italic>Ube3a</italic> must be reinstated in late embryonic and early postnatal development to correct most neurological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva-Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rotaru et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sonzogni et al., 2020</xref>). Among the previously tested phenotypes, only a small subset (i.e., synaptic transmission, plasticity, and spatial memory) can be improved upon increasing Ube3a at the age of 6 weeks or older, and slightly a few more (i.e., rotarod performance and susceptibility to seizure induction) when increasing Ube3a at postnatal day 21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Despite limited prior successes in rescuing juvenile and adult maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> deficiency mice, we chose these two ages to examine the effects of ASO therapy on cortical hyperexcitability, altered EEG power spectrum, and sleep disturbance because these ages are more translationally relevant than the neonatal period. Our study reveals that a single ICV injection of <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic>-targeted ASOs to <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice, a new rodent model of Angelman syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shi et al., 2022</xref>), upregulates Ube3a proteins including the critical short isoform and restores the EEG power spectrum and sleep pattern for at least 6 weeks, particularly upon treatment at the juvenile age. Therefore, our results significantly expand the range of phenotypes that can be reversed by restoring <italic>Ube3a</italic> expression in juvenile and adult mice. Interestingly, we were not able to reduce the frequency of poly-spikes in <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice at either age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is possible that suppression of poly-spikes requires upregulation of Ube3a starting at a younger age or reaching to a higher level than what we have achieved, both of which should be tested in future studies. Nevertheless, this result indicates that poly-spikes are independent from the EEG power spectrum and sleep pattern deficits, and probably involve a different mechanism.</p><p>A critical finding of our study is that the improvement in the EEG power spectrum and sleep pattern tracks the increase in Ube3a protein levels across different ASOs, injection ages, and timepoints post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This suggests that following a bolus injection of ASOs, both phenotypes are acutely modulated by the Ube3a levels that decrease over time due to ASO clearance. Future studies should determine if repeated administration of ASOs can generate a long-lasting improvement of the phenotypes beyond the period when Ube3a levels are sufficiently upregulated, as the outcome can help inform the ASO treatment schedule in clinical trials. The ASO treatment in adult mice is less effective than juvenile mice, which is consistent with a recent finding that treating <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe5/p+</sup></italic> mice with Ube3a-as ASO around P35 modestly reduced the EEG PSD in the delta frequency band (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spencer et al., 2022</xref>). This could be due to two reasons. First, the reversibility of disturbed EEG power spectrum and sleep may decrease over age, just like other neurological deficits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Second, the ASO treatment in adult mice causes a smaller increase of Ube3a protein than juvenile mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Given the strong correlation between Ube3a levels and phenotypic improvement, we speculate that the latter is more likely the reason, and a higher dose of ASO or an ASO with a higher efficacy in downregulating <italic>Ube3a-ATS</italic> should further increase Ube3a protein and improve these two phenotypes in adult mice.</p><p>Previous EEG studies of <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe5/p+</sup></italic> mice emphasized an increase of absolute power or PSD in the delta frequency band as compared to WT mice, but the results varied among studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehlen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Born et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copping and Silverman, 2021</xref>).

Interestingly, a reduction of the relative power in the gamma band (30–50 Hz) was observed in both strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>).

Our absolute PSD results from the new <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice are qualitatively similar to the previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), but relative PSD analysis reveals an increase of relative power in the theta, alpha, or beta frequency bands and a decrease in the low or high gamma frequency bands. These differences could be due to different mutations, genetic backgrounds, mouse ages, experimental conditions, or different brain states included in the analyses. Nevertheless, we observed a robust and consistent increase in the power ratio (α + β1 + β2)/γ2 across timepoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In fact, inspection of previous results suggests a common pattern that EEG power is relatively higher in maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> deficiency mice than WT mice in the lower frequency bands (i.e., beta or lower) and relatively lower in the gamma bands, although the results were not always statistically significant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Born et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Copping and Silverman, 2021</xref>). Similarly, the EEG power spectrum of Angelman syndrome patients also shows such a pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we propose that a power ratio between the low- and high-frequency bands would be a more robust measure of the EEG power spectrum phenotype in Angelman syndrome and its mouse models.</p><p>The EEG power spectrum and sleep phenotypes of maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice directly correlate with those in Angelman syndrome patients, but about 70% of Angelman syndrome patients have a larger deletion in the chromosomal region 15q11–q13 that encompasses <italic>UBE3A</italic> and other genes with biallelic or paternal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buiting et al., 2016</xref>). These deletion Angelman syndrome patients have more severe clinical phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buiting et al., 2016</xref>) and a larger increase in the EEG theta band power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frohlich et al., 2019</xref>) than non-deletion patients, suggesting that the heterozygosity of those biallelically expressed genes contribute to the severity of Angelman syndrome. Thus, future studies are necessary to determine the contribution of these genes to the neurological phenotypes including disturbed EEG power spectrum and sleep. Particularly, the <italic>GABRB3</italic>, <italic>GABRA5</italic>, and <italic>GABRG3</italic> genes in this region encode GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit β3, α5, and γ3, respectively, and are likely to be critical given the vital role of GABAergic inhibition in brain functions and the fact that heterozygous loss-of-function <italic>GABRB3</italic> variants cause a broad spectrum of epilepsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Møller et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>HERC2</italic> gene encoding HECT domain and RCC1-like domain 2 can also be important because this E3 ubiquitin protein ligase interacts with UBE3A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kühnle et al., 2011</xref>) and its loss-of-function causes a neurodevelopmental disorder with Angelman syndrome-like features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puffenberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harlalka et al., 2013</xref>). Since <italic>UBE3A-ATS</italic>-targeted ASOs do not affect these biallelically expressed genes, it will be of great importance to determine to what extent reactivating paternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> can rescue the EEG power spectrum and sleep phenotypes in a large deletion mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our study has several translational implications for the ASO and other clinical trials of Angelman syndrome. First, even though it is unclear how the mouse developmental stages in which the neurological phenotypes can be reversed are related to the treatment window for Angelman syndrome, our results suggest that Angelman syndrome patients at different ages may all benefit from the ASO treatment of these two core disease symptoms. Second, the robust correlation between EEG power spectrum and Ube3a levels supports the notion that EEG power spectrum can serve as a quantitative biomarker in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sidorov et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frohlich et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hipp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostrowski et al., 2021</xref>). Third, since the EEG power of Angelman syndrome patients correlates with their symptom severity, particularly the cognitive function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hipp et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ostrowski et al., 2021</xref>), it is reasonable to speculate that ASO treatment may also improve the cognitive function of Angelman syndrome patients. Finally, clinicians and caregivers consider sleep disturbance as one of the most challenging symptoms and important focuses for new treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Willgoss et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, if ASO therapy can reduce sleep disturbance, then it will improve quality of life for both Angelman syndrome patients and caregivers.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Gapdh was detected by a mouse monoclonal anti-Gapdh antibody (Proteintech, catalog # 60004-1-Ig, lot # 10004129, 1:10,000 dilution). β3 tubulin was detected by a mouse monoclonal anti-β3 tubulin antibody (Proteintech, catalog # 66240-1-Ig, lot # 10004491, 1:50,000 dilution). Primary antibodies were detected by a goat polyclonal anti-mouse antibody conjugated with IRDye 800CW (LI-COR Bioscience, catalog # 925-32210, lot # C90130-03, 1:20,000 dilution). Proteins were visualized and quantified using an Odyssey CLx Imager and Image Studio Lite version 5.2 (LI-COR Biosciences). To quantify the total Ube3a levels, both Ube3a isoforms 2 and 3 were included. To quantify the levels of each isoform, total Ube3a and isoform 3 were quantified, and the isoform 2 levels were measured by subtracting the isoform 3 levels from the total Ube3a levels. Total Ube3a, Ube3a isoform 2, or Ube3a isoform 3 levels were first normalized by the Gapdh or β3 tubulin levels and then by the average total Ube3a, Ube3a isoform 2, or Ube3a isoform 3 of all WT mice from the same blot, respectively.</p><p>For RT-qPCR, the brain tissues were homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen, catalog # 79216) containing 1% (vol/vol) β-mercaptoethanol. Homogenization was performed for 20 s at 6000 rpm using a FastPrep Automated Homogenizer (MP Biomedicals). Total RNA was then purified using the RNeasy 96 Kit (Qiagen, catalog # 74182) that included an in-column DNA digestion with 50 U of DNase I (Invitrogen, catalog # 18047019). RT-qPCR was performed in triplicate with the EXPRESSS One-Step SuperScript qRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, catalog # 11781200).

Briefly, 1 week after ASO injection, mice were anesthetized with 2.5% isoflurane in oxygen, and craniotomies were performed as described above for ICV injection. Perfluoroalkoxy polymer (PFA)-coated silver wire electrodes (A-M Systems, catalog # 786000, 127 mm bare diameter, 177.8 mm coated diameter) were used for grounding at the right frontal cortex, referencing at the cerebellum, and recording at the left frontal cortex (AP: 0.475 of DBL, ML: −0.071 of DBL, DV: −1.5 mm), left somatosensory cortex (AP: −0.190 of DBL, ML: −0.428 of DBL, DV: −1.5 mm), and right visual cortex (AP: −0.808 of DBL, ML: 0.594 of DBL, DV: −1.5 mm). An EMG recording and an EMG reference electrode were inserted into the neck muscles. All electrodes were soldered to an adaptor prior to the surgery. The electrodes and adaptor were secured on the skull by dental acrylic. The skin was sutured and attached to the dried dental acrylic. Mice were singly housed to recover for at least 1 week after the surgeries. Before recording, mice were individually habituated in the recording chambers (10-inch diameter of Plexiglas cylinder) for 24 hr. EEG/EMG signals (5000 Hz sampling rate with a 0.5 Hz high-pass filter) and videos (30 frames/s) were recorded synchronously for more than 48 continuous hours using a 4-channel EEG/EMG tethered system and Sirenia 1.8.2 software (Pinnacle Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>EEG poly-spikes and power spectrum analyses</title><p>Poly-spikes and PSD were analyzed from the same 6 hr of each recording (12 AM–1 AM, 4 AM–5 AM, 8 AM–9 AM, 12 PM–1 PM, 4 PM–5 PM, and 8 PM–9 PM on the second day). EEG/EMG traces were visualized in Sirenia Seizure 1.8.2 software (Pinnacle Technology) to identify episodes of poly-spikes and artifacts. An episode of poly-spikes is defined as a cluster of three or more spikes on any of the EEG channels. PSD analyses of EEG data were performed using custom scripts in Python. Prior to PSD calculation, data were detrended by subtracting the mean of the data. The data segments containing artifacts on any of the EEG channels were first excluded, and then an eighth-order Butterworth filter was applied to each channel to bidirectionally notch filter around 60 Hz (±2 Hz bandwidth) to remove power-line noise. The PSDs were then estimated for each channel using a Welch’s periodogram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Welch, 1967</xref>) with a 2 s Hanning window (achieving a frequency resolution of 0.5 Hz) and 50% overlap between windows. To account for the effect of notch filtering, the PSD was linearly interpolated between 58 and 62 Hz using the 10 points before and after the mentioned ranges. To analyze different frequency bands, the PSD was segmented into seven bands: delta (1–4 Hz), theta (4–8 Hz), alpha (8–13 Hz), low beta (13–18 Hz), high beta (18–25 Hz), low gamma (25–50 Hz), and high gamma (50–100 Hz). The power within a frequency band (the area under the PSD curve for a band) was then computed for each band. The relative power in a frequency band is the ratio of the power within the band over the total power within 1–100 Hz. The normalized PSD curves were obtained by dividing the PSD curves with the total power within 1–100 Hz. The low- to high-frequency band ratio was calculated as the ratio of the total power in the alpha and beta bands (8–25 Hz) over the power in the high gamma band (50–100 Hz).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Sleep scoring</title><p>A convolutional neural network-based algorithm SPINDLE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch">https://sleeplearning.ethz.ch</ext-link>) was used for automated sleep scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miladinović et al., 2019</xref>). This method produces domain invariant predictions and makes use of a hidden Markov model to limit state dynamics based on known sleep physiology. Sleep was scored from the entire second day (24 hr) of each recording. EEG signals from the frontal and somatosensory cortices and the EMG signals were used to score each 4 s epoch as wake, NREM sleep, or REM sleep. To assess the performance of this method on our dataset, two WT mice treated with control ASO, two <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mice with control ASO, and one <italic>Ube3a<sup>mΔe6/p+</sup></italic> mouse with Ube3a-as ASO were randomly selected and 1 hr of data from each mouse were scored by SPINDLE and manually by three experts. The Precision, Recall, <italic>F</italic>1-score, and Accuracy were calculated for each pairwise comparison as the following: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>;

The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address these issues fully in your revised submission:</p><p>1. Analysis of the particular isoforms of Ube3a deficient mice that are rescued by the ASO treatment is an important component of the analysis and will allow a better understanding of the effects of the ASO treatment in the context of previous studies with developmental rescue. Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of particular isoforms of Ube3a in function. The authors should evaluate the success of the ASO in rescuing expression of these isoforms and discuss these results in the context of the literature.</p><p>2. We think you must carefully address the concerns about western blots and potential for duplication of lanes/bands in at least one of the blots. It appears that lanes may have been duplicated and reproduced at different exposures.</p><p>3. It is important to address the possibility that this model with ASO rescue may allow analysis of cognitive deficits and their rescue in the mice. This additional information would broaden the significance of the study because it would either indicate that cognitive function may be improved by ASO treatment at postnatal stages, or not. An example would be examining visuospatial behaviors requiring intact hippocampal plasticity and determining if these are rescued.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The figures, in general, are too crowded and difficult to read. The data in these figures is acceptable, but the format is too busy to actually digest the important points. I suggest they find better ways to show changes in EEG spectra than bar graphs (see below). That said, the findings appear to suggest that at least EEG power and sleep rhythms can be rescued at the juvenile and, to a lesser extent, adult stages. Previous studies have shown that through genetic manipulation, Ube3a can be turned on developmentally in a Ube3a deficient background at embryonic stages with complete rescue of &quot;critical&quot; phenotypes (ataxia, anxiety, repetitive behavior and epilepsy). However, these studies did not examine EEG or sleep disturbance in any detail, and yet claimed that rescue of Ube3a expression after embryonic stages may not have any clinically relevant effects.</p><p>I think the authors make the case that at least some clinically relevant phenotypes can be rescued using ASO approaches postnatally in Ube3a deficient mice. Given the potential impact of this manuscript and the novel claim that is somewhat against current dogma in the field, i.e. that rescue after the embryonic stage will have some effect, I would suggest the following experiments:</p><p>1. It is critical to know which isoforms are rescued by the ASO treatments in the new Exon6 deletion mouse model. There has been significant emphasis of isoform III in the literature and the nuclear localization of this isoform as being critical to the rescue of predominant phenotypes (Trezza et al. (2019) Nature Neuro 22, pages 1235-1247). The authors need to show rescue of this critical isoform postnatally and/or demonstrate that one of the isoforms is rescued to near normal levels by western blot using tissue from various regions of the brain. Figure 3 – supplemental suggests that some isoforms may be specific to the cerebellum, thalamus, and olfactory bulb and that in the thalamus, at least, there is better rescue of the lower molecular weight protein than the larger isoform. Can you explain this? A better investigation of the particular isoforms being rescued is warranted here.</p><p>2. There is a missed opportunity here to test cognition. Did the investigators test these mice for rescue of cognitive phenotypes? If not, why? Hippocampal plasticity is essential for cognition and can be rescued at any age in Ube3a deficient animals (Silva-Santos et al. (2015) J Clin Invest. 125: 2069-76 and others – see Elgersma and Sonzogni (2021) Dev Med and Child Neuro 63: 802-807).</p><p>3. Although additional experiments on the impact of other genes in the 15q11.2 critical region (deleted in ~70% of AS individuals) is beyond the scope of the current study, the authors must discuss individual genes, GABA receptors and HERC2, and their impact or involvement in EEG phenotypes in AS. For example, Frolich et al. found that deletion class individuals differ significantly from UBE3A mutation or imprinting center mutation class by spectral power (Frohlich et al. (2019) Biol Psych 85(9): 752-759).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>No effort was made to look at the designed ASO in the original ube3a mouse model. The ability to show good penetration beyond several weeks is an advance in the field and should be built on. However, it is unclear how the newly designed ASO will work in wild type brain or non-neuronal cells. One would expect no change would occur in non-neuronal cells. Many of the rescue experiments appear to be modest but significant differences. The protein rescue appears strong. How about substrates? Is the Ube3a protein functional? Is protein degradation restored? The rescue of the abnormal EEG seems slight and is not different between the control ASO and the ube3a-ASO. Sleep pattern differences look promising and could be expanded upon. The authors report on the finding that poly-spikes are not rescued. It is unclear at this time why this is. It seems that this should be followed up with significant experiments. One possibility is that there is not enough protein being made from the paternal ube3a using the current strategy. The authors could consider repeating their experiments in the original ube3a mouse model to see if similar results are observed. It appears from this study that a best mouse model for AS may not exist. With that in mind, it may be highly beneficial for this group to test several of their ideas on a molecular level and see if in iPSCs derived neurons from AS patients they can observe rescue of cellular and physiological changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a well-designed and executed study. The team first developed a new mouse model of Angelman syndrome and then leveraged the model to validate the ASO oligonucleotides therapeutic approach to knock down ATS expression and increase UBE3A expression from the paternal locus. They performed patient-relevant functional assays including EEG rhythms, sleep architecture, and epileptiform activity. The longitudinal design is another major strength of the study, in which both juvenile and adult age groups were included and functional tests were performed at 3-, 6- and 10-weeks post ASO injection. The authors also did a thorough analysis of UBE3A expression levels in different brain regions under different conditions. Overall, the study demonstrated a clear correlation between UBE3A expression level and EEG power ratio (a+b1+b2)/g2 and REM sleep. Improved UBE3A expression was able to restore (to certain degrees) EEG spectra and sleep functions. These results support a cause-and-effect relationship. Interestingly, improved UBE3A expression did not significantly reduce poly-spikes. In addition, the manuscript is well written with a good discussion of the findings in the context of the literature and future perspectives.</p><p>I have several concerns.</p><p>One concern relates to the Western blot data in Figure 3: there appears to be data duplication and the same blot with different exposures was used for different brain regions.

We performed new Western blot experiments to separate the two Ube3a isoforms 2 and 3 that differ by 21 amino acids and about 2-3 kDa. We found that both long and short isoforms were similarly up-regulated by Ube3a-as ASO or Snord115 ASO in different brain regions at 3 weeks post ASO injection into juvenile mice (new Figure 3-supplement 3). We also examined two brain regions from 3 weeks post ASO injection into adult mice and found the same result (new Figure 3-supplement 4). Therefore, these results are consistent with the rescue of EEG power spectrum and sleep phenotypes in maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. We think you must carefully address the concerns about western blots and potential for duplication of lanes/bands in at least one of the blots. It appears that lanes may have been duplicated and reproduced at different exposures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this critical issue and have inspected all raw data and figures. We realized that in the previous Figure 3-supplement 1A, both images of the “Olfactory bulb” and “Midbrain + Hindbrain” anti-Ube3a blots from “3 weeks post ASO injection to juvenile mice” came from the olfactory bulb blot. We have identified the process that led to this error.</p><p>The two original image files assigned with the Image ID #179 and #182 were generated by LI-COR Image Studio software on August 14, 2019. Multiple images (#179-1, #179-2, #182-1, #182-2, #182-3) were then exported from the original image files with different exposure settings that were adjusted for individual blots (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Images #179 have 2 blots (Blot A: anti-Ube3a from Olfactory bulb, Blot B: anti-Gapdh from Olfactory bulb). However, there was dust partially covering the Ube3a band in the second lane of Blot A (see the cyan box in Image #179-2) and its magnification shown as Image #179-2 MAG”. After washing off the dust, this Blot A was re-imaged with two other blots (Blot C: anti-Ube3a from Midbrain + Hindbrain, Blot D: anti-Gapdh from Midbrain + Hindbrain) in Images #182. For Olfactory bulb, Blot A in Image #182-1 and Blot B in Image #179-1 were correctly selected for anti-Ube3a and anti-Gapdh, respectively. For Midbrain + Hindbrain, Blot D in Image #182-3 was correctly selected for anti-Gapdh. Blot C in Image #182-2 (red box) should have been selected for anti-Ube3a, but unfortunately, Blot A in Image #182-2 was mistakenly selected for anti-Ube3a. This is why the image of “Midbrain + Hindbrain” anti-Ube3a blot in the previous Figure 3-supplement 1A is the same as the one from olfactory bulb with a different exposure setting. We have now corrected this mistake in Figure 3-supplement 1A and its source data by using the Blot C in Image #182-2.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>3 weeks post ASO injection to juvenile mice.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81892-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, we chose not to test cognitive function in the mouse models of Angelman syndrome for two reasons.</p><p>The first reason is that the cognitive deficit is unfortunately a key phenotype that was not well recapitulated in the mouse models, which does not allow a robust test of the ASO therapy. The original maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e5/p+</sup></italic>) were tested in Morris water maze and fear conditioning, but the deficits are mild and highly variable across labs and strains (for example, see Jiang, et al., 1998; van Woerden et al., 2007; Daily et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Born et al., 2017). This issue has been discussed and summarized by Sonzogni et al., 2018 and Rotaru, et al., 2020.</p><p>For Morris water maze, Sonzogni et al., 2018 discussed that “we found that a large number of mice are needed to detect significant differences and results varied strongly among experimenters.” For fear conditioning, Sonzogni et al., 2018 discussed that “we have not been able to get consistent results across experiments and experimenters” and “…Collectively, these studies indicate that this phenotype is rather weak, and hence results, obtained with these tests should be interpreted with care.” The Figure 2 of Rotaru, et al., 2020 summarizes the cognitive phenotypes of Angelman mouse models being “not present/mild”. We believe that most likely for this reason, most of the recent studies testing various genetic therapies in Angelman mouse models did not test cognitive function (see Wolter et al., 2020; Milazzo et al., 2021; Schmid et al., 2021). Judson et al., 2021 did test fear conditioning in the AAV gene replacement experiments, but also stated that “Common learning paradigms in mice – such as Morris water maze and fear conditioning – expose rather mild and inconsistent deficits in the AS model that demand intensive statistical sampling (43). Accordingly, we obtained inconclusive results when fear conditioning adult WT and AS mice treated with PHP.B/hUBE3Aopt or vehicle as neonates (Supplemental Figure 4A). Although mice of each group clearly demonstrated associative learning of the unconditioned foot shock stimulus and conditioned auditory cue (Supplemental Figure 4B), we were underpowered to detect robust deficits in either contextual or cued fear memory in the AS + vehicle group – or rescue thereof (Supplemental Figure 4, C and D).” Note that this experiment used 28, 21, 26, and 26 mice for the 4 groups of mice, yet was still not able to detect the phenotype. It is currently unknown why the cognitive phenotype is mild in the mouse models despite their hippocampal plasticity deficits, but perhaps is due to a compensatory mechanism.</p><p>The second reason is that our colleague Dr. Rodney Samaco in our institute has systematically compared the original model (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e5/p+</sup></italic>) and our new model (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e6/p+</sup></italic>) in different neurobehaviors including cognitive function tests and found that the two models were very similar. Hence, at the outset of our project, we did not plan to test cognitive function or any other neurobehaviors to avoid overlaps with his work. Our goal was to test the EEG power spectrum and sleep phenotypes, which are clinically highly relevant but not examined in any previous genetic therapy experiments.</p><p>Therefore, we hope that the reviewers will agree that testing the effect of ASO treatment on the cognitive function of Angelman mouse models is unlikely to be informative. This would be best tested in a different model that recapitulates the patient phenotype better than the mouse models.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The figures, in general, are too crowded and difficult to read.

The cognitive improvement would be an important addition to the present work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is of high interest to test the effect of ASO treatment on cognitive function. However, we chose not to test cognitive function in the mouse models of Angelman syndrome for two reasons.</p><p>The first reason is that the cognitive deficit is unfortunately a key phenotype that was not well recapitulated in the mouse models, which does not allow a robust test of the ASO therapy. The original maternal <italic>Ube3a</italic> knockout mice (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e5/p+</sup></italic>) were tested in Morris water maze and fear conditioning, but the deficits are mild and highly variable across labs and strains (for example, see Jiang, et al., 1998; van Woerden et al., 2007; Daily et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2013; Born et al., 2017). This issue has been discussed and summarized by Sonzogni et al., 2018 and Rotaru, et al., 2020.</p><p>For Morris water maze, Sonzogni et al., 2018 discussed that “we found that a large number of mice are needed to detect significant differences and results varied strongly among experimenters.” For fear conditioning, Sonzogni et al., 2018 discussed that “we have not been able to get consistent results across experiments and experimenters” and “…Collectively, these studies indicate that this phenotype is rather weak, and hence results, obtained with these tests should be interpreted with care.” The Figure 2 of Rotaru, et al., 2020 summarizes the cognitive phenotypes of Angelman mouse models being “not present/mild”. We believe that most likely for this reason, most of the recent studies testing various genetic therapies in Angelman mouse models did not test cognitive function (see Wolter et al., 2020; Milazzo et al., 2021; Schmid et al., 2021). Judson et al., 2021 did test fear conditioning in the AAV gene replacement experiments, but also stated that “Common learning paradigms in mice – such as Morris water maze and fear conditioning – expose rather mild and inconsistent deficits in the AS model that demand intensive statistical sampling (43). Accordingly, we obtained inconclusive results when fear conditioning adult WT and AS mice treated with PHP.B/hUBE3Aopt or vehicle as neonates (Supplemental Figure 4A). Although mice of each group clearly demonstrated associative learning of the unconditioned foot shock stimulus and conditioned auditory cue (Supplemental Figure 4B), we were underpowered to detect robust deficits in either contextual or cued fear memory in the AS + vehicle group – or rescue thereof (Supplemental Figure 4, C and D).” Note that this experiment used 28, 21, 26, and 26 mice for the 4 groups of mice, yet was still not able to detect the phenotype. It is currently unknown why the cognitive phenotype is mild in the mouse models despite their hippocampal plasticity deficits, but perhaps is due to a compensatory mechanism.</p><p>The second reason is that our colleague Dr. Rodney Samaco in our institute has systematically compared the original model (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e5/p+</sup></italic>) and our new model (<italic>Ube3a<sup>m∆e6/p+</sup></italic>) in different neurobehaviors including cognitive function tests and found that the two models were very similar. Hence, at the outset of our project, we did not plan to test cognitive function or any other neurobehaviors to avoid overlaps with his work. Our goal was to test the EEG power spectrum and sleep phenotypes, which are clinically highly relevant but not examined in any previous genetic therapy experiments.</p><p>Therefore, we hope that the reviewer will agree that testing the effect of ASO treatment on the cognitive function of Angelman mouse models is unlikely to be informative. This would be best tested in a different model that recapitulates the patient phenotype better than the mouse models.</p></body></sub-article></article>
