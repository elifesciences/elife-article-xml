However, we lack an understanding of how an interface can select some ligands, but not others. Here, we present a molecular dynamics approach to identify and quantitatively evaluate the interactions responsible for this selective promiscuity. We apply this approach to the anticancer target PD-1 and its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. We discover that while unbound PD-1 exhibits a hard-to-drug hydrophilic interface, conserved specific triggers encoded in the cognate ligands activate a promiscuous binding pathway that reveals a flexible hydrophobic binding cavity. Specificity is then established by additional contacts that stabilize the PD-1 cavity into distinct bound-like modes. Collectively, our studies provide insight into the structural basis and evolution of multiple binding partners, and also suggest a biophysical approach to exploit innate binding pathways to drug seemingly undruggable targets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22889.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22889.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many proteins need to interact with other proteins to carry out their various tasks in cells. Such interactions are essential for almost all biological processes and are often disrupted in disease. Cells have thousands of different types of proteins and each has a unique shape that determines which other proteins it can bind to.</p><p>It was previously thought that two proteins bind to each other in a manner similar to that of a lock and a key, in which the rigid shape of one protein meshes perfectly with the rigid shape of its partner. However, many proteins are flexible and adopt different shapes depending on whether they are attached to their partner, or not. Moreover, an individual protein may also bind to several different partners, each requiring that protein to adopt several different shapes. These observations have challenged the lock and key model and suggest that flexibility in the structure of a protein plays a key role in its binding to other proteins. However, it is not clear how structural flexibility enables a protein to bind to several different partners while being selective enough to prevent the protein from binding to the wrong ones.</p><p>A protein called PD-1 is involved in immune responses in humans and is an emerging target for drugs to treat cancer. Pabon and Camacho used computer simulations to model PD-1’s structural flexibility and to find out how this enables the protein to form different shapes when it binds to different partners. The experiments show that the region of PD-1 that binds to other proteins adopts a different shape in the absence and presence of its partners. The binding partners make initial contact with PD-1 via specific features that they share in common. This causes PD-1 to change shape, uncovering a surface of PD-1 that is flexible and is able to accommodate a variety of partners. After this, the binding partners form additional contacts with PD-1 that are specific to each partner.</p><p>These findings suggest that the ability of a protein to bind to several different partners is unlocked by certain structures that are present in the binding partners. These structures are found in proteins produced by many different organisms, suggesting that this mechanism is likely to be widespread in nature. This work may open up new avenues for designing drugs to target PD-1 and other proteins that contribute to disease but have so far been impossible to target with drugs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22889.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22889.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>PD-1</kwd><kwd>induced fit</kwd><kwd>specificity</kwd><kwd>promiscuity</kwd><kwd>flexibility</kwd><kwd>anchor residue</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1247842</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pabon</surname><given-names>Nicolas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM097082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Camacho</surname><given-names>Carlos J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Conserved contacts on cognate ligands trigger an induced fit pathway that confers selective promiscuity to PD-1, a flexible regulatory protein and promising anticancer target.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural and proteomic research over the past decade has supplanted the traditional structure-function paradigm by establishing the functional relevance of protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wright and Dyson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haynes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Romero et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ward et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xie et al., 2007</xref>). In particular, eukaryotic regulatory and signaling proteins are skewed toward notably higher degrees of flexibility when compared to other functional categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iakoucheva et al., 2002</xref>). Regulatory proteins also tend toward comparatively higher degrees of binding promiscuity, and we have previously shown thermodynamically how the entropy associated with their flexibility can relate to their specificity toward multiple binding partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2009</xref>). However, a structural understanding of how this selective promiscuity is achieved is still lacking.</p><p>Flexible human regulatory proteins such as MDM2 and PD-1 usually only crystallize when ligand-bound. Although nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) can occasionally resolve unbound (apo) structures of these proteins, it is noteworthy that their apo NMR ensembles often deviate from their bound crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lo Conte et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Betts and Sternberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lázár-Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, for many such proteins, available structural data do not capture the full binding dynamics, and the pathway from the apo, non-bound-like state to the bound-like state is unclear. This lack of data obscures the mechanistic connection between interface flexibility, binding promiscuity, and ligand specificity. Moreover, given that many regulatory proteins are promising drug targets, this missing puzzle piece often spells failure for drug design efforts that only target the bound-like state, assuming that this state is available in the apo ensemble. Rational approaches to target flexible proteins will thus benefit from new methods that can reveal the binding pathways connecting the non-bound-like to the bound-like states.</p><p>Binding to flexible receptors is traditionally described by conformational selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tsai et al., 1999</xref>) or induced fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koshland, 1958</xref>) mechanisms, and NMR techniques are often used to distinguish between these two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Generally speaking, one assumes a conformational selection scenario if the apo protein ensemble samples bound-like states (apo<sub>BL</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boehr et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hoang and Prosser, 2014</xref>). If not, one assumes induced fit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schon et al., 2002</xref>). In reality, whether a protein-protein interaction occurs via conformational selection or induced fit depends on the flux of the system through the two alternate pathways from the non-bound-like apo state (apo<sub>NBL</sub>) to the bound-like encounter complex (EC<sub>BL</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hammes et al., 2009</xref>). Flux through the conformational selection pathway is limited by the free -energy difference between the apo<sub>BL</sub> and apo<sub>NBL</sub> states, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, which determines the fractional population of the bound-like state and thus restricts when selection-association with the ligand can occur.

Human PD-1 is a T-cell receptor and immune response regulator that has recently emerged as a breakthrough anticancer target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dömling and Holak, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couzin-Frankel, 2013</xref>). NMR and crystallographic studies have revealed the flexibility of the PD-1 interface by showing that its apo and bound conformations are very different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lázár-Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggestive of an induced fit mechanism. Specifically, while the apo PD-1 interface shows a polar surface around Asn66 with an unmatched NH2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), in complex this NH2 group forms two hydrogen bonds, with the PD-L1–bound interface exhibiting a hydrophobic patch around Ile126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and the PD-L2–bound interface forming a large hydrophobic cavity flanked by Ile126 and Ile134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Flexibility of the PD-1 binding interface.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The apo PD-1 binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>), showing a flat, polar, core binding interface.

This was somewhat surprising, since the Trp110 binding site observed in the PD-L2–bound cocrystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) displays two key characteristics known to be favorable for ligand binding: concavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Laskowski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 1998</xref>) and hydrophobicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2007</xref>). It is reasonable to assume that the flexibility of the Trp110 pocket, and the fact that in the apo state it is largely occluded by the unmatched, polar NH2 group of Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,d</xref>), would present significant obstacles to traditional structure-based drug-design methods attempting to target this cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cozzini et al., 2008</xref>).

We show that a conserved set of three contacts in the PD-1 encounter complexes with PD-L1/2 progressively lowers the free energy of bound-like receptor states with respect to the non-bound-like state. These molecular triggers reshape the non-bound-like hydrophilic interface around Asn66 into a bound-like hydrophobic surface. A fourth contact that differs by a single atom stabilizes this surface into either a shallow patch that interacts with Ala121 in PD-L1, or a deep cavity that buries Trp110 in PD-L2.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structures of PD-L1/2 – mimicking peptides used to probe PD-1 interface dynamics.</title><p>Left: core interface binding residues of (<bold>a</bold>) PD-L1 and (<bold>b</bold>) PD-L2 in their bound-like conformations.

Namely, for a non-bound-like interface Asn66 is closed and Ile126 is open; for the PD-L1-specific bound-like state Asn66 is open and Ile126 is closed; and for the PD-L2-specific bound-like state both Asn66 and Ile126 are open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). In the PD-L1–bound state, the interface exhibits a large hydrophobic patch that interacts with the side chain of ligand interface residue Ala121 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). In the PD-L2–bound state, the interface exhibits a deep hydrophobic cavity that buries ligand residue Trp110 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Neither this hydrophobic patch nor deep cavity is sampled in the apo PD-1 NMR ensemble, where, instead, the closed state of Asn66 blocks the Trp110-binding pocket by exposing its NH2 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), making a hydrophilic site.

It has been shown that often protein-protein interactions stabilize the initial encounter complex through the burial of a bound-like anchor motif on the ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajamani et al., 2004</xref>), which allows subsequent, longer timescale intermolecular interactions to take shape. Co-crystal structures, MDs and docking studies of PD-L1/2 suggest that the homologous interface residues Tyr123/112 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) may serve as anchors. Specifically, MDs of apo PD-L1/2 show that Tyr123/112 remain within 0.5 Å heavy atom RMSD of their bound-like conformations 88 ± 16% of the time. Furthermore, the Tyr123/112-binding pocket is unobstructed in the apo PD-1 NMR ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), facilitating immediate burial of the side chain upon association. Docking exercises also point to the stabilizing role of the Tyr anchor.

MDs of PD-1 in complex with a GGG peptide positioned to mimic the backbone of PD-L1/2 residues ADY123 and WDY112, respectively, show that Asn66 fluctuates back and forth between a bound-like open state, where it makes the aforementioned backbone hydrogen bond to the GGG peptide, and the non-bound-like closed state, where it is bonded to PD-1 Lys78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). On the other hand, simulations with a GDG peptide show that the Asp122/111 mimic forms a hydrogen bond to the Tyr68 OH group, stabilizing a Tyr68 rotamer that can simultaneously hydrogen bond to the NH2 of Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).

MDs of apo PD-L1/2 further support the importance of Asp122/111 interactions in the encounter complex by showing that this side chain remains within 0.4 Å RMSD of its bound-like conformation 82 ± 25% of the time. The stabilization of the bound-like Asp122/111 side chain in simulation is achieved via hydrogen bonds with the neighboring Lys124/113, bonds which are also observed in bound cocrystal structures of PD-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). The importance of this stabilizing interaction is underscored by the fact that the K124S and K113A point mutations in PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively, both abolish binding to PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lázár-Molnár et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>PD-1 ligands open Asn66 by offering two novel hydrogen bonds (with the Ala121/Trp110 backbone and Tyr68) that out-compete the single Lys78 hydrogen bond that stabilizes the closed state. Interestingly, the one known PD-1 sequence that diverges at the Tyr68 position is murine PD-1, which has a Y68N mutation. The murine PD-1–PD-L2 co-crystal shows that although the shorter Asn68 side chain cannot hydrogen bond directly to Asn66 or Asp111, it hydrogen bonds to a crystal water molecule that forms the same hydrogen bond network as Tyr68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). MDs of a human Y68N PD-1 mutant and the GDG peptide suggest a functional equivalence of Asn68 to Tyr68: the Asn68 side chain spontaneously recruits a stable water to the co-crystal position that then opens Asn66 via a specific hydrogen bond network analogous to that formed by Tyr68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>ADY/GDY ligand motifs stabilize distinct bound-like states for PD-L1/2</title><p>While GDG MDs show an open Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) that exposes a hydrophobic surface, this surface remains flexible and fluctuates between a deep open cavity and closed shallow patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Contrary to the GGG MDs that exhibited open-closed fluctuations of Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), the pocket instability observed in GDG MDs is caused by open-closed fluctuations of PD-1 residue Ile126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>).

Encounter complex MDs recapitulated the triggering mechanisms we identified in our peptide simulations and their resulting PD-1 interface transitions from the EC<sub>NBL</sub> to the ligand-specific EC<sub>BL</sub> states. The chronology for these interactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) is the same for both ligands. Consistently, the first interaction to take place after docking the conserved anchor is the formation of the hydrogen bond between receptor residue Tyr68 and ligand residue Asp122/111. This is followed by stabilization of Asn66 in the open pocket state via hydrogen bonds with neighboring Tyr68 and the ligand Ala121/Trp110 backbone. The Ala121/Trp110 side chains then proceed to stabilize a closed/open hydrophobic pocket. Note that the Trp in the WDY motif of PD-L2 readily fills the hydrophobic pocket as the XDY motif latches and opens Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Consistent with a downhill free energy induced fit mechanism, the realization of these four contacts takes less than 10 ns total. On a longer timescale, encounter complex simulations demonstrate the formation of secondary hydrogen bonds at the interface periphery that are also observed in co-crystal structures of human and murine PD-1. These secondary hydrogen bonds, including the bond from PD-1 Lys78 to PD-L1/2 Phe19/21 and from Gln75 to Arg125/Tyr114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), were consistently observed to form approximately 10 nanoseconds after the aforementioned Asn66 and Tyr68 hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that EC<sub>BL</sub> contacts shaped by the triggers of induced fit are enough to drive the subsequent transition to the HAC.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.020</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Modulation of the PD-1 interface binding cavity in encounter complex simulations with PD-L1 and PD-L2.</title><p>Plot shoes the (rolling average) number of atoms in the bound-like Trp110 side chain reference that are occluded by the PD-1 interface throughout encounter complex simulations with PD-L1/2 (see Materials and methods for full details of how occlusion is calculated).

The result is a large hydrophobic surface where, like in the PD-L1–bound state, the closed Ile126 occludes the Trp110-binding pocket, but where, unlike the PD-L1/2–bound states, a closed Ile134 partially fills the Tyr/123/112 anchor cavity. In fact, pembrolizumab has no anchor analog. Instead, the Arg102 side chain extends along the PD-1 interface such that the C<sub>Z</sub> carbon overlaps the C<sub>γ</sub> position of Tyr123/112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), and the NH1/2 groups hydrogen bond to a crystal water above the receptor interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>). In this configuration, the hydrophobic carbon chain of Arg102 forms a ‘cap’ above the closed Ile126 and Ile134, desolvating their hydrophobic interactions with each other and the neighboring Gly124 and stabilizing a flat hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>).</p><p>A similar closed conformation of Ile134 is observed in our MDs of PD-1 interacting with the GDG peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is unsurprising: like pembrolizumab, the GDG peptide has the necessary machinery to trigger the opening of Asn66, but lacks an anchor ‘wedge’ that prevents the resulting inward collapse of Ile134. Results of the GDG MDs thus rationalize the pembrolizumab binding mode and suggest an anchor-independent induced fit PD-1 binding pathway: one in which the antibody opens Asn66 using the canonical hydrogen bond network and stabilizes the resulting flat hydrophobic interface by ‘capping’ the closed states of Ile126/134 with the carbon chain of Arg102.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Can molecular triggers be exploited to drug PD-1? </title><p>Although two PD-1-targeting antibodies already exist on the market, there are no small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors in clinical trial, despite the enormous interest in this blockbuster immunotherapy target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dömling and Holak, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Couzin-Frankel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zarganes-Tzitzikas et al., 2016</xref>).

Although no mechanism of action has been described, the macrocycle includes a peptidic mGDV motif that is structurally similar to the aforementioned ADY induced fit trigger, with an N-methylated Gly and an Asp side chain that resemble PD-L1’s Ala121 and Asp122, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>). This alignment puts the mGDV motif’s short Val side chain at the position of the much longer Tyr123 anchor, where it aligns with the C<sub>∆</sub> side chain carbon of pembrolizumab residue Arg112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the resemblance of the mGDV motif to the interface residues of both PD-L1 and pembrolizumab, we used our MDs method to evaluate whether this motif was capable of remodeling the apo, non-bound-like PD-1 interface into a bound-like state.

Simulation trajectories showed that the short Val side chain of the mGDV motif, unlike the cognate Tyr123/112 anchors, did not penetrate deep enough into the PD-1 interface to be a ‘wedge’ stabilizing an open Ile134. Instead, like the carbon chain of pembrolizumab residue Arg102, the Val ‘capped’ stable hydrophobic interactions between a closed Ile134, a closed Ile126, and the neighboring Gly124.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.029</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Macrocyclic mGDV motif induces structural changes in the PD-1 interface towards the pembrolizumab–bound state.</title><p>Heat maps show the distributions of PD-1’s Ile126 and Ile134 X<sub>1</sub> rotamer angles in MDs of the receptor interacting with the ADY PD-L1 trigger (left), the BMS macrocycle mGDV motif (center), and the GDV peptide.

Thus, given that mGDV lacks an anchor, a natural question to ask is whether a Ile126 would be opened by a GDV peptide without the N-methyl group. Interestingly, MDs of PD-1 interacting with a GDV peptide revealed identical Ile126 and Ile134 dynamics to mGDV simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), indicating that the N-methyl group was not recruiting Ile126 into the closed state in the style of Ala121 C<sub>ß</sub>.

This mechanism is also consistent with models of macrocycle conformations generated by Balloon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vainio and Johnson, 2007</xref>) docked to PD-1, which readily identify poses that align the mGDV motif to corresponding PD-L1 and pembrolizumab interface residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>), rationalizing the potency and specificity of the compound.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Induced fit motif XDY shared by PD-1 ligands modulates the flexible PD-1 binding interface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic </title><p>Our studies show that apo PD-1 does not sample bound-like hydrophobic interface conformations, but instead presents a non-bound-like hydrophilic patch around Asn66 at the core of its binding interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). By mapping the effect of specific ligand contacts on the apo PD-1 interface, we identify a highly conserved subset of PD-L1/2 motifs responsible for coordinating Asn66 and triggering the transition from the hydrophilic to hydrophobic interface. Namely, Asp122/111 and the backbone O of PD-L1/2 Ala121/Trp110 form a robust, four-membered hydrogen bond network with Tyr68 and Asn66 that neutralizes the latter residue into a bound-like open state. Simultaneously, the conserved anchor Tyr123/112 stabilizes Ile134 into a bound-like state that, with Asn66 open, creates a hydrophobic surface that fluctuates between a patch and a cavity modulated by Ile126. These three linear ligand motifs (XDY), shared by both PD-L1/2, comprise the molecular key that unlocks the promiscuity of PD-1 by revealing a flexible hydrophobic binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A single carbon atom difference can shift the hydrophobic PD-1 binding surface from a stable patch to a stable cavity </title><p>With XDY triggering the transition to the flexible hydrophobic surface, specificity toward the two PD-1 ligands is actualized by the formation of the hydrophobic patch when binding PD-L1 vs. the formation of hydrophobic cavity when binding PD-L2. These two states can be distinguished by the conformation of Ile126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). For PD-L1, we show that the ADY motif is sufficient to stabilize the hydrophobic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Specifically, the Ala121 Cβ atom, which does not overlap with PD-1 apo NMR structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), recruits Ile126 into the closed (patch) state. On the other hand, in the absence of C<sub>β</sub>, the GDY trigger stabilizes the open state of Ile126, producing a large hydrophobic interface cavity consistent with the pocket that buries PD-L2 Trp110. Note that the Trp in the WDY motif of PD-L2 readily fills the hydrophobic pocket as the XDY motif latches and opens Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Bound-like XDY residues and molecular recognition</title><p>The pre-arrangement of PD-L1/2 motifs XDY in bound-like conformations in the absence of the receptor is important for efficient ligand recognition and binding. Docking studies and peptide MDs highlight a critical role for the conserved Tyr123/112 anchor both in both molecular recognition and in modulating Ile134 during induced fit, both of which require the Tyr side chain to maintain a stable bound-like rotamer. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that peptides such as GDG, mGDV, and GDV, which either lack or have a modified anchor analogue, cannot stabilize an open state of Ile126, highlighting an allosteric role for Tyr123/112 in splitting the PD-1 induced fit binding pathway.</p><p>Several anchors substitutes were tested in simulation starting in bound-like configurations similar to the cognate Tyr112/123. These MDs produced three broad types of PD-1 interface dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>): (1) aromatic substitutions XDF and XDW stabilized either an open (X=G) or closed (X=A) pocket like the cognate XDY motif. (2) Polar substitutions XDH, XDR, and XDK were not accommodated in the hydrophobic anchor pocket and their side chains laid along the receptor surface, consistent with pembrolizumab’s bound Arg102 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>), producing a closed pocket like that of (m)GDV. (3) XDG or XDA resulted in open-closed fluctuations of both Ile134 and Ile126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). These observations suggest that certain anchor mutations are tolerated by PD-1 and are consistent with mutagenesis studies showing that the Y112A PD-L2 point mutation slightly reduces, but does not abolish, binding to PD-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lázár-Molnár et al., 2008</xref>). However, the observed conservation of Tyr123/112 in mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lázár-Molnár et al., 2008</xref>) might suggest specific kinetic constraints on ligand recognition arising from hydrophobic contacts with Ile134 and the hydrogen bond with Glu136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which are not shared by other sidechains.</p><p>In addition to the anchor residue, our peptide MDs also suggest an essential role for the conserved Asp122/111 in erecting a stable hydrogen bond network that opens PD-1 Asn66, which can only be achieved by a bound-like Asp side chain. The primacy of these intermolecular interactions to PD-1 binding is reinforced by our MDs of apo PD-L1/2, which reveal that Tyr123/112 and Asp122/111 all remain in bound-like conformations in the absence of the receptor, primed to interact immediately upon interface association. Equally important is the fact that apo PD-1 structures all accommodate (i.e. do not block) any of contacts of the XDY scaffold, ensuring a rapid recognition process that facilitates subsequent induced fit transitions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Downhill binding pathways strongly suggest an induced fit binding mechanism</title><p>Our MDs demonstrate that the set of consecutive intermolecular interactions triggered by ADY and GDY peptides lead to energetically downhill binding pathways with no opposing energy barriers.

On the other hand, ligand-specific triggers are shown to efficiently shift the PD-1 interface conformational ensemble from a non-bound-like: bound-like ratio of roughly 44: 1 (in the apo ensemble) to roughly 1: 7 (in the encounter complex ensemble) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Unconstrained MDs of PD-L1/2 encounter complexes show that the geometry and chronology of triggering contacts is highly optimized, driving the transition from the non-bound-like to the bound-like states in less than 10 ns. This time scale promotes rapid recognition and ensures fast activation of this important T-cell checkpoint.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Two-step binding pathway of PD-1 reveals a simple mechanism for selective promiscuity</title><p>Although regulatory proteins are promiscuous in that they bind multiple targets, they must also be specific so as to limit binding to just those targets. Our analysis of the binding mechanism to PD-1 reveals how these two seemingly contradictory requirements can be simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that apo PD-1 samples an ensemble of non-bound-like conformations that present an obstructive Asn66 on its interface, which likely prevents non-specific binding. The apo PDL1/2 interfaces feature a conserved, bound-like, XDY binding motif that holds the key to opening Asn66 and forming a flexible hydrophobic surface, which completes the first binding step. In the second step, the ligands then attune the flexible interface via specificity-determinant contacts (X=A for PD-L1, X=W for PD-L2) that modulate Ile126, splitting the binding pathway and stabilizing either a hydrophobic patch or a binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>).

This same principle can be applied to design smaller molecular weight PD-1 inhibitors. We have shown that the mGDV motif of the Brystol-Myers-Squibb PD-1 inhibitor combines key pharmacophore features of both PD-L1 and pembrolizumab interfaces: the backbone O of the Gly resembles that of PD-L1’s Ala121, the Asp side chain resembles PD-L1’s Asp122, and the Val side chain resembles pembrolizumab’s Arg102. Simulations suggest that this structural resemblance produces functionally similar dynamics by displacing receptor residue Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10d</xref>) and stabilizing a bound-like, flat hydrophobic surface formed by closed Ile126 and Ile134 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref>).

We show here that induced fit can efficiently reshape the shallow polar interface of a flexible receptor into a hydrophobic interface amenable to binding multiple ligands by co-evolving a common set of intermolecular contacts. From an evolutionary perspective, this is an efficient approach to spawning novel protein interactions, since these core contacts can be designed just once. Selectivity to novel ligands can then be achieved by evolving relatively small sequence modifications around these core contacts.

Briefly, the script takes a molecular dynamics trajectory and a set of static reference atoms and identifies which reference atoms are overlapped in each frame of the simulation. Overlap occurs when any simulated atom crosses the ‘clash radius’ of a reference atom, the clash radius being equal to the sum of the van der Waals radii of the two atoms. The output of the script is the fractional occlusion of each reference atom position, equal to the percentage of simulation frames in which that reference atom is overlapped by simulated atoms. This script was used to evaluate the extent to which the Trp110 and Tyr112/123 binding cavities are open in simulations of PD-1 interaction with various peptides, simulations of apo PD-1, and the apo NMR ensemble of PD-1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Relative free energies of bound-like versus non-bound-like interfaces</title><p>We classified PD-1 interface conformations using two binary order parameters that define whether interface residues Asn66 and Ile126 are in their ‘open’ or ‘closed’ rotamer states. These parameters are used to distinguish the non-bound-like interface, where Asn66 is closed and Ile126 is open, from the PD-L1-specific bound-like state, where Asn66 is open and Ile126 is closed, and the PD-L2-specific bound-like state, where both Asn66 and Ile126 are open (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Reference structures for the open and closed states of Asn66 were defined using its side chain configuration in the first apo NMR model and PD-L1-bound human cocrystal, respectively (Asn66 has &lt;0.2 Å heavy atom RMSD between PD-L1 and PD-L2 cocrystals 4ZQK and 3BP5). Each frame of the MDs trajectory is labeled with the state to which the simulated Asn66 had the smaller side chain RMSD to the reference structure. Reference structures for the open and closed states of Ile126 were defined using its X<sub>1</sub> rotamer angle in the murine PD-L2 and human PD-L1 cocrystals, respectively, this angle being the main distinguishing feature between the two different ligand-bound interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Each frame of the MDs was labeled with the state to which the simulated Ile126 had the closest rotamer angle. The free energy changes of opening Asn66 and Ile126 are calculated using <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation (1)</xref> and then compared across different simulations in order to identify triggers of interface deformations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the National Institute of Health (grant GM097082 to

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Probing protein flexibility reveals a mechanism for selective promiscuity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nir Ben-Tal (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nikolay V Dokholyan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted the following remarks to elicit a response from you. Please consider the serious concerns in comments 1 and 2 below and respond with a plan of how you may be able to address these points by further theory or experiment, and indicate an approximate time from for the completion of such work. The editor and reviewers will evaluate your response and issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>Review:</p><p>The manuscript describes computational analyses of the ligand-responsiveness of the PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. In spite of the availability of a crystal structure of bound PD-1, and NMR structures of the unbound (apo) protein, it is not understood how the receptor is able to bind more than one ligand with different binding modes but with specificity. The manuscript examines two possible pathways for ligand binding: conformational selection vs. induced fit. The binding dynamics is investigated using all-atom molecular dynamic simulations, where known NMR and co-crystal structures are used as the initial models for bound and unbound conformations. Various ligand-mimicking peptides are used to study the role of specific contacts between the protein and the ligand side chains. The conclusion is that binding follows the induced fit mechanism, which starts from the burying of the anchor motif of the ligand and follows by chronological sequence of pocket rearrangement in order to form and increase hydrophobic areas and form hydrogen bonds important for binding. The interesting aspect of this paper is the proposition that the initial docking of one or the other ligand triggers different conformational changes in the receptor that then ensures the appropriate specificity.</p><p>Given the enormous prominence of the checkpoint inhibitors as newly emerging treatments for a wide range of cancers, and in particular the efficacy of reagents capable of directing blockade of PD-1 associated processes, this report is potentially of wide spread interest and importance. Nevertheless, the reviewers and the editors have some serious reservations about the robustness of the results, and how general the principles are. We would like to give you the opportunity to revise the manuscript in order to address these reservations. You should note that these reservations are such that if they are not addressed adequately in the revision, then the paper may be deemed unsuitable for <italic>eLife</italic>. We note three essential points to address below. The first two refer to the most serious concerns, and will require additional computation, or perhaps even experiments. The third point is also essential, but we feel that you should be able to address it by revising the figures and accompanying text.</p><p>Essential issues to address:</p><p>1) While the computational results provide fertile ground for considering the detailed mechanisms underlying PD-L1 and PD-L2 recognition and potentially affinities, there are no prospective experimental studies to challenge and validate these interesting hypotheses. The lack of experimental support is further highlighted in the section describing the binding of a relatively high affinity (Kd ~1 nM) macrocycle developed by BMS. The PD-1 recognition surface assumed for this macrocycle is based on its sequence similarity with PD-L1, which is a reasonable hypothesis; however, there is no direct experimental support for this assumption in the current manuscript or anywhere in the literature. The reviewers are concerned that in its present form the paper does not present a reliable set of conclusions.</p><p>We recognize that your paper presents the results of a computational study, and that it may not be feasible for you to provide experimental data to support your concepts. In that case, please consider alternative ways to establish the robustness of your results.</p><p>For example, does PD-1 have more ligands beyond PD-L1 and PD-L2? &quot;These three linear ligand motifs (XDY), shared by both PD-L1/2, comprise the molecular key[…]&quot;: Are there counter examples? That is, peptides that do not share the motif and were proved in experiments to not bind PD-1? If so, simulations with such negative controls should be added.</p><p>Other proteins in addition to PD-1 could be studied to examine how general the mechanism is.</p><p>2) Y123/112. Several tripeptides were used to examine the importance of this residue but these are just a small portion of the possible sample. How about other aromatic residues? Or HIS? Or other residues that could potentially support a hydrogen bond equivalent of OH_eta?</p><p>3) The illustrations in the paper need to be improved.</p><p>A diagram showing the intact receptor should be shown to provide context for the ligand interaction. In most figures the protein is shown using its molecular surface, without revealing the physicochemical nature and/or residues types underlying the surface. Thus, it is difficult to examine the fit of peptide binding. This is crucial since one of the main observations here is that the binding site shifts its polar nature upon binding. The current figures do not explain this clearly.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> it might be useful to zoom out a bit and show more of the binding pocket, so a reader can understand open/close residues orientation with respect to the pocket.</p><p>It might be useful to include the structures of the ligands themselves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for the comparison of mimicking motifs.</p><p>More information concerning the fractional overlap of atoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4(D, E</xref>)) would be useful.</p><p>Other points to address:</p><p>1) &quot;Interestingly, no small molecular weight inhibitor has been reported for this seemingly druggable interface cavity. This is likely due to our incomplete understanding of how PD-1's flexibility enables selectivity for two distinct ligand interfaces, only one of which stabilizes the hydrophobic pocket&quot;: Speculative. Perhaps nobody tried to target this interface? A reference should be added or the statement should be revised.</p><p>2) &quot;PD-1 has proven to be a difficult target to disrupt using small molecules&quot;: A reference should be added or the statement should be deleted.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Should be GGY rather than GGG.</p><p>4) Overall, there are far too many abbreviations in this paper, and we ask that you use only the most essential abbreviations, and keep these to a minimum. In the current form, the paper is challenging to read. Why abbreviate molecular dynamics simulations as &quot;MDS&quot;? Why use &quot;PPI&quot; as an abbreviation? Please consider the ease with which a reader can follow what you are trying to say.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22889.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential issues to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) While the computational results provide fertile ground for considering the detailed mechanisms underlying PD-L1 and PD-L2 recognition and potentially affinities, there are no prospective experimental studies to challenge and validate these interesting hypotheses.

If so, simulations with such negative controls should be added.</italic> </p><p><italic>Other proteins in addition to PD-1 could be studied to examine how general the mechanism is.</italic> </p><p>The scarcity of experimental PD-1 binding data is unfortunate, especially given that in all likelihood this blockbuster therapeutic target has been subject to extensive biophysical analysis and drug discovery approaches. The incomplete picture of PD-1 binding may in part be due to the flexibility of the receptor, which we know creates essential challenges for structural analysis and small-molecule drug discovery [1]. The fact that so far only antibodies and large, complex macrocycles have been designed to bind PD-1 supports this claim. Furthermore, the fact that negative results from experiments probing PD-1 binding go unpublished prohibits us from using said data to constrain our models.</p><p>To our knowledge, the only currently available experimental data on PD-1 binding mechanics comes in the form of protein sequences, a handful of structures, and a small number of mutagenesis experiments that accompany them [2-8]. Our initial submission rationalized PD-L1/2 – bound structures of PD-1 as well as the sequence conservation of triggering residues and mutagenesis studies of PD-L1’s D111. In our revised submission, we rationalize the results of several additional mutagenesis experiments on murine PD-1 and PD-L2. For example, the fact that the K113A point mutation on PD-L2 abolishes binding to PD-1 can be explained by the fact that this residue is necessary to stabilize a bound-like configuration of PD-L2’s D111. We elaborate on this idea in the Results section titled “Conserved PD-L1/2 Asp122/111 form a specific intermolecular hydrogen bond network that opens PD-1 Asn66 and switches the receptor interface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.”:</p><p>“The robust, four-membered hydrogen bond network between the Ala121/Trp110 backbone mimic, Asn66, Tyr68, and the Asp122/111 mimic that we observe in GDG MDs is fully consistent with all available structures and mutagenesis experiments. […] The importance of this stabilizing interaction is underscored by the fact that the K124S and K113A point mutations in PD-L1 and PD-L2, respectively, both abolish binding to PD-1 [4, 5].”</p><p>Additionally, a number PD-1 interface residues that we suggest are important for molecular recognition and/or induced fit have been shown to reduce or abolish binding when mutated to Ala [4]. This data is included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Tables 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl5">5</xref> in our revised submission.</p><p>Fortunately, since the time of our submission, several crystal structures have been added to the Protein Data Bank (5B8C, 5GGS, 5JXE) showing PD-1 bound to the antibody Pembrolizumab. These new experimental data have allowed us to, in our revised submission, prospectively validate the molecular triggers revealed by our molecular dynamics studies.</p><p>Pembrolizumab is one of the new blockbuster generation of emerging anti-cancer immunotherapies, and it binds to a PD-1 surface that shares the core of the PD-L1 and PD-L2 binding interfaces. Remarkably, even though the Ab shares no sequence similarity with PD-L1 and PD-L2, it participates in a hydrogen bond network with receptor residue Asn66 that is analogous to the network that we identified as a key modulator of PD-1’s selective promiscuity to its cognate ligands. This commonality between the two distinct binding mechanisms highlights the importance of this HB network as an evolutionary constraint on shifting the polar PD-1 binding interface into a mostly non-polar one. A new Results section titled has been added to our manuscript to provide a full structural analysis of the pembrolizumab – bound PD-1 interface in the context of our proposed PD-L1/2 binding mechanism. This section contains a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) that illustrates similarities between the pembrolizumab – bound PD-1 interface and the PD-L1 – bound PD-1 interface. The new section, titled “PD-1 – targeting antibody validates the critical role of Asn66 and suggests an anchor-independent binding mechanism with closed Ile126 and Ile134” is shown below:</p><p>“Recently, two FDA-approved PD-1 – targeting antibodies have emerged as part of a new generation of anti-cancer immune checkpoint inhibitors. […] Results of the GDG MDs thus rationalize the pembrolizumab binding mode and suggest an anchor-independent induced fit PD-1 binding pathway: one in which the antibody opens Asn66 using the canonical hydrogen bond network and stabilizes the resulting flat hydrophobic interface by ‘capping’ the closed states of Ile126/134 with the carbon chain of Arg102.”</p><p>With respect to the BMS macrocycle, we have de-emphasized our predicted binding models and removed them from the main figures, since to date we have no way of experimentally validating them. However, the PD-1 – bound cocrystals of pembrolizumab, which, similar to the BMS macrocycle does not have an anchor analogue, have allowed us to further explore possible macrocycle binding mechanisms. Specifically, we have added a section to the Results with a new figure showing that the macrocycle’s mGDV motif, aligned to pembrolizumab’s core interface residues, closes both Ile126 and Ile134 as in the pembrolizumab-bound cocrystals. The modified Results section, titled “Can molecular triggers be exploited to drug PD-1?”, is shown below:</p><p>“Although two PD-1 targeting antibodies already exist on the market, there are currently no FDA- approved small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors, despite enormous interest in this blockbuster immunotherapy target [23-25]. […] This mechanism is also consistent with models of macrocycle conformations generated by Balloon [38] docked to PD-1, which readily identify poses that align the mGDV motif to corresponding PD-L1 and pembrolizumab interface residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>), rationalizing the potency and specificity of the compound.”</p><p>To our knowledge, extracellular PD-1 has no additional cognate ligands beyond PD-L1 and PD-L2. Furthermore, no negative binding results have been reported for synthetic small molecules. The only available counter examples are the few experimentally tested PD-1 and PD-L1/2 point mutations (referenced above) that abolish or reduce ligand binding, all of which are rationalized by our results and are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Y123/112. Several tripeptides were used to examine the importance of this residue but these are just a small portion of the possible sample. How about other aromatic residues? Or HIS? Or other residues that could potentially support a hydrogen bond equivalent of OH_eta?</italic> </p><p>Our primary aim of our manuscript is to identify the minimal set of native interactions responsible for PD- 1’s selective promiscuity via induced-fit, and the conservation of Tyr123/112 in both PD-L1 and PD-L2 across mammalian species [4] suggest a highly constrained role in this mechanism. As suggested by our reviewers, we investigated several additional peptides with different anchor substitutions and compared the resultant PD-1 interface deformations to those of the cognate peptides. These results are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> and are discussed in the Discussion section titled “Bound-like XDY residues and molecular recognition” of our revised submission:</p><p>“The pre-arrangement of PD-L1/2 motifs XDY in bound-like conformations in the absence of the receptor is important for efficient ligand recognition and binding. Docking studies and peptide MDs highlight a critical role for the conserved Tyr123/112 anchor both in both molecular recognition and in modulating Ile134 during induced fit, both of which require the Tyr side chain to maintain a stable bound-like rotamer. […] However, the observed conservation of Tyr123/112 in mammalian species [4] might suggest specific kinetic constraints on ligand recognition arising from hydrophobic contacts with Ile134 and the hydrogen bond with Glu136 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), which are not shared by other sidechains.”</p><p><italic>3) The illustrations in the paper need to be improved.</italic></p><p><italic>A diagram showing the intact receptor should be shown to provide context for the ligand interaction. In most figures the protein is shown using its molecular surface, without revealing the physicochemical nature and/or residues types underlying the surface. Thus, it is difficult to examine the fit of peptide binding. This is crucial since one of the main observations here is that the binding site shifts its polar nature upon binding. The current figures do not explain this clearly.</italic> </p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> has been modified and two figure supplements have been added to address this concern. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> shows a zoomed-out view of the intact cocrystal structures of the PD-1 – PD-L1 and PD-1 – PD-L2 interactions. The bound structures are shown side-by-side and identically oriented to facilitate comparison between the two ligands. Interface side chains on both the receptor and ligands are shown in order to provide a broad view of all intermolecular interactions, so as to provide context for the key triggering interactions described later in the paper. Other, related figure additions and modifications are discussed below.</p><p>The molecular surfaces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> have been made transparent such that the underlying residues are visible, and the surfaces have been colored to represent their physiochemical properties. The subfigures have been zoomed-out to better depict intermolecular contacts and the overall fit of ligand binding. To further illustrate the induced-fit conformational changes of the PD-1 interface, the apo interface has been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, facilitating direct comparison between the unbound and ligand-bound interfaces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-C</xref>, the location of the core binding interface is indicated in order to clarify the polar-to-nonpolar shift. Similarly, the PD-1 molecular surface in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> has been made transparent and colored by physiochemical property in order to reveal the predicted inter-molecular interactions with the BMS macrocycle.

The Analysis Tools subsection of our Materials and methods has been expanded in order to better explain the procedure by which we calculate fractional occlusion:</p><p>“Measurements of PD-1 binding pocket occlusion, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D, E</xref>, were calculated from molecular dynamics simulations of PD-1 using a Python script (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/npabon/md_pocket_occlusion">https://github.com/npabon/md_pocket_occlusion</ext-link>). […] This script was used to evaluate the extent to which the Trp110 and Tyr112/123 binding cavities are open in simulations of PD-1 interaction with various peptides, simulations of apo PD-1, and the apo NMR ensemble of PD-1.”</p><p>Additionally, brief one-sentence summaries of this procedure have been added to the captions for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D, E</xref>, along with a reference to Materials and methods for complete details:</p><p>“<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

This is likely due to our incomplete understanding of how PD-1's flexibility enables selectivity for two distinct ligand interfaces, only one of which stabilizes the hydrophobic pocket&quot;: Speculative. Perhaps nobody tried to target this interface? A reference should be added or the statement should be revised.</italic> </p><p>Target flexibility remains an essential challenge for structure-based drug discovery [1]. While we cannot be sure that PD-1’s flexibility is the primary reason for the absence of small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors, we can be confident that this absence is not for lack of trying. It is clear that a blockbuster target like PD-1 would be on the radar of pharma, biotech, and academic labs [10-12]. Indeed, my lab, and that of my collaborator Dr. Alexander Dömling, Chair of Drug Design at the University of Groningen, made several attempts to design PD-1 inhibitors that bind to the hydrophobic cavity observed in the PD-1 – PD-L2 cocrystal. Dr. Dömling’s lab produced the first co-crystal of human PD-1 bound to human PD-L1 [3], and also designed small molecules that bind PD-L1 [13], but they so far have no validated hits against PD-1. On this point, we note that the complexity of the patented BMS PD-1 macrocyclic inhibitors is clear evidence that significant efforts has been devoted in pharma towards this important target. For clarification, we have revised the statement in question to read as follows:</p><p>“To date, no small molecular weight PD-1 inhibitors have been reported in the literature despite the importance of this blockbuster target [10-12]. […] It is reasonable to assume that the flexibility of the Trp110 pocket, and the fact that in the apo state it is largely occluded by the unmatched, polar NH2 group of Asn66 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, D</xref>), would present significant obstacles to traditional structure-based drug-design methods attempting to target this cavity [1].”</p><p><italic>2) &quot;PD-1 has proven to be a difficult target to disrupt using small molecules&quot;: A reference should be added or the statement should be deleted.</italic> </p><p>As above, references have been added and the statement has been revised as follows:</p><p>“Although two PD-1 targeting antibodies already exist on the market, there are no small-molecule PD-1 inhibitors in clinical trial, despite the enormous interest in this blockbuster immunotherapy target [10-12].”</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>.
