Bacteria in a biofilm are often insensitive to antibiotics and host immunity. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) could provide an alternative approach to improve the diagnosis and potential treatment of biofilm-related infections. Here, we show that mAbs targeting common surface components of <italic>S. aureus</italic> can recognize clinically relevant biofilm types. The mAbs were also shown to bind a collection of clinical isolates derived from different biofilm-associated infections (endocarditis, prosthetic joint, catheter). We identify two groups of antibodies: one group that uniquely binds <italic>S. aureus</italic> in biofilm state and one that recognizes <italic>S. aureus</italic> in both biofilm and planktonic state. Furthermore, we show that a mAb recognizing wall teichoic acid (clone 4497) specifically localizes to a subcutaneously implanted pre-colonized catheter in mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate the capacity of several human mAbs to detect <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms in vitro and in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>monoclonal antibodies</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Health~Holland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LSHM17026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Vor</surname><given-names>Lisanne</given-names></name><name><surname>van Dijk</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name><name><surname>van Strijp</surname><given-names>Jos</given-names></name><name><surname>Weinans</surname><given-names>Harrie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI083211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horswill</surname><given-names>Alexander R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>QUARAT: Quantitative Universal Radiotracer Tomography</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TTW16885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beekman</surname><given-names>Freek J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramakers</surname><given-names>Ruud M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BX002711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horswill</surname><given-names>Alexander R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Antibody-based biologicals could provide an alternative approach to improve the diagnosis of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> biofilm-related infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Implant-related infections are difficult to treat because of the ability of many bacterial species to form biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arciola et al., 2018</xref>). Biofilms are bacterial communities that adhere to abiotic surfaces (such as medical implants) using a self‐made extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), consisting of proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schilcher and Horswill, 2020</xref>). Bacteria in a biofilm are physically different from planktonic (free floating) bacteria and often more tolerant to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beenken et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, the EPS forms an important penetration barrier for many antimicrobial agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Otto, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Vor et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, most antibiotics cannot kill bacteria in a biofilm because they are in a metabolically inactive state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Resch et al., 2005</xref>) and thus resistant to the antibiotics that act on active cellular processes (such as transcription/translation or cell wall formation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mah and O’Toole, 2001</xref>). Another complication is that biofilm infections often occur in areas of the body that are not easily accessible for treatment without invasive surgical procedures. Consequently, treatment consists of long‐term antibiotic regimens or replacement of the infected implant. Specific and noninvasive laboratory tests for early detection are not yet available and the diagnosis is often made only at advanced stages. This failure to detect biofilms adds further complications to effective diagnosis and treatment of these infections.</p><p>The human pathogen <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> is the leading cause of healthcare-associated infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lowy, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tong et al., 2015</xref>). Today, 25% of healthcare‐associated infections are related to medical implants such as heart valves, intravenous catheters, and prosthetic joints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Magill et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> causes one-third of all implant-related infections in Europe and the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aggarwal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arciola et al., 2005</xref>) and is known for its ability to form biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arciola et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the absence of a vaccine and the emergence of methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MRSA), there is a clear need for diagnostic tools and alternative therapies for <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm infections.</p><p>Antibody-based biologicals could provide an alternative approach to improve the diagnosis and/or treatment of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm-related infections. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) may be exploited as vehicles to specifically bring anti-biofilm agents (such as radionuclides, enzymes, or photosensitizers) to the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tursi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raafat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lauderdale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaplan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brockson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estellés et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van Dijk et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, radioactively labeled mAbs could be used for early diagnosis of biofilm-related infections. At present, only one mAb recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm has been identified. This F598 antibody recognizes poly-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine (PNAG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soliman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Soliman et al., 2020</xref>) (also known as polysaccharide intercellular adhesion [PIA]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Maira-Litrán et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mack et al., 1996</xref>), a highly positively charged polysaccharide that was first recognized as a major EPS component of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm. However, PNAG is not the only component of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms. Recently, it has become clear that <italic>S. aureus</italic> may also use cell wall anchored proteins and eDNA to facilitate initial attachment and intercellular adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cucarella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corrigan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O’Neill et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moormeier et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, deletion of the <italic>icaADBC</italic> locus (encoding PNAG) does not impair biofilm formation in multiple <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beenken et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moormeier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boles et al., 2010</xref>). These biofilms, referred to as PNAG-negative, are phenotypically different from PNAG-positive biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mlynek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rohde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">O’Neill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sugimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McCarthy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fitzpatrick et al., 2005</xref>). Because both types of biofilm occur in the clinic, we here focus on identifying mAbs that recognize PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative biofilm. In this study, we show that previously identified mAbs against staphylococcal surface structures can recognize both PNAG-negative and PNAG-positive <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms. Importantly, we show that some of these mAbs recognize <italic>S. aureus</italic> in both biofilm and planktonic state, which is crucial because release and dissemination of planktonic cells from biofilm-infected implants lead to life-threatening complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lister and Horswill, 2014</xref>). Finally, using SPECT/CT imaging, we show that radiolabeled mAbs have the potential to detect biofilm in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production of mAbs and validation of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms</title><p>In order to study the reactivity of mAbs with <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms, we selected mAbs that were previously found to recognize surface components of planktonic <italic>S. aureus</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Raafat et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sause et al., 2016</xref>). Specifically, we generated two antibodies recognizing cell wall teichoic acids (WTA) (4461-IgG and 4497-IgG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lehar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fong et al., 2018</xref>), one antibody against surface proteins of the SDR family (rF1-IgG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hazenbos et al., 2013</xref>), one antibody against clumping factor A (ClfA) (T1-2-IgG), and one antibody of which the exact target is yet unknown (CR5132-IgG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As a positive control, we generated F598-IgG against PNAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Soliman et al., 2018</xref>). As negative controls, we produced one antibody recognizing the hapten dinitrophenol (DNP) (G2a-2-IgG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gonzalez et al., 2003</xref>) and one recognizing HIV protein gp120 (b12-IgG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barbas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Saphire et al., 2001</xref>). The variable heavy and light chain sequences of all antibodies were obtained from different scientific and patent publications (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kabat et al., 1984</xref>) and cloned into expression vectors to produce full-length human IgG1 (kappa) antibodies in EXPI293F cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Production of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and validation of biofilm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Human IgG1 antibodies are large (150 kDa) proteins, consisting of two functional domains.

A panel of six human IgG1 mAbs that recognize polysaccharide and protein components on the cell surface of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and two nonspecific isotype controls was produced. Variable heavy (VH) and light (VL) chain sequences obtained from different scientific and patent publications were cloned in homemade expression vectors containing human heavy chain (HC) and light chain (LC) constant regions, respectively.

To test this hypothesis, we performed a binding assay on planktonic versus biofilm Wood46 using nonspecific IgG1, nonspecific IgG3 (which is unable to bind to SpA via the Fc-domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jendeberg et al., 1997</xref>), and anti-SpA-IgG3 (binding SpA via the Fab-domain but not the Fc-domain).

Since such colonies more closely resemble a surface attached biofilm than free-floating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Serra et al., 2015</xref>), we were curious whether this mAb could recognize biofilm. Intriguingly, CR5132-IgG1 showed almost no detectable binding to exponential planktonic LAC<italic>∆spa∆sbi</italic> or Wood46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but it bound strongly to both PNAG-negative and PNAG-positive biofilms formed by these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The ability of CR5132-IgG1 to target both types of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms and to discriminate between planktonic bacteria and biofilm makes CR5132 a unique and interesting mAb. Because of the interesting binding phenotype of CR5132-IgG1, we performed experiments to identify its target. LTA was originally identified as one of the targets of CR5132 (US 2012/0141493 A1), but the quality of commercial LTA preparations varies greatly and often contains other components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Morath et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Morath et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we first tested CR5132-IgG1 binding to <italic>S. aureus</italic> purified cell wall components LTA and peptidoglycan coated on ELISA plates. As a positive control, we used the established A120-IgG1, which is known to bind to LTA (EP2027155A2).

Next, we tested CR5132-IgG1 binding to pure α-GlcNAc or β-GlcNAc WTA structures. To do this, we used magnetic beads that were artificially coated with the WTA backbone and then glycosylated by recombinant TarM, TarS, or TarP, resulting in pure β 1,4-GlcNAc, β 1,3- GlcNAc, or α 1,4-GlcNAc WTA structures in their natural conformation on a surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van Dalen et al., 2019</xref>).

Therefore, we collected a variety of <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from endocarditis (n = 4), prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) (n = 16), and catheter tip infections (n = 25). First, we determined whether these clinical isolates produced PNAG-positive or PNAG-negative biofilm by using a crystal violet assay and staining with F598-IgG3 (unable to bind SpA). We could detect significant F598-IgG3 binding to 1/4 endocarditis isolates, 5/25 catheter tip isolates, and 6/16 PJI isolates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This indicates that production of PNAG is not a hallmark of one specific source of biofilm-related infections and that approximately one-third of isolates form PNAG-positive biofilm in vitro.

In this study, we show that previously identified mAbs against <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface structures have the capacity to bind <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm. At the start of this study, the only mAb known to react with <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm was the F598 antibody recognizing PNAG. F598 was selected to bind to planktonic <italic>S. aureus</italic> MN8m, which is a spontaneous PIA/PNAG-overproducing mutant of strain Mn8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly-Quintos et al., 2006</xref>). Because numerous studies have shown that <italic>S. aureus</italic> is capable of forming different biofilm matrices (PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beenken et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moormeier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boles et al., 2010</xref>), we here focused on identifying antibodies recognizing different biofilm forms. Our study identified several mAbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) capable of binding both types of biofilm (4497-, CR5132-, and rF1-IgG1). This indicates that mAbs directed against WTA or the SDR protein family may be interesting candidates for targeting <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm infections. WTA comprises ~30% of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacterial surface, and therefore, it is an attractive mAb target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). However, WTA glycosylation can be strain specific and <italic>S. aureus</italic> can adapt WTA glycosylation upon environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mistretta et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, we found that 4461-IgG1 (anti-α-GlcNAc WTA) and 4497-IgG1 (anti-β-GlcNAc WTA) recognized different <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains and their biofilm. Thus, mAbs targeting WTA may best be composed of a mix of mAbs recognizing both α- and β-glycosylated WTA.</p><p>Our study also shows that it is possible for antibodies to recognize both <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm and planktonic bacteria. This is crucial because during biofilm infection individual bacteria can disperse from the biofilm by secretion of various enzymes and surfactants to degrade the EPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lister and Horswill, 2014</xref>). These dispersed bacteria can then disseminate and colonize new body sites or develop into sepsis, which is the most serious complication of biofilm-associated infections. With antibodies recognizing both biofilms and planktonic bacteria (like mAbs recognizing WTA [4461, 4497]) and SDR protein family (rF1), it should be possible to target <italic>S. aureus</italic> bacteria in vivo throughout the entire infection cycle (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We also observed that some mAbs (F598 and CR5132) bind better to biofilm than the planktonic form of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Such antibodies might be useful for the development of assays to discriminate between biofilm and planktonic cultures. Importantly, none of the mAbs in our panel bound planktonic <italic>S. aureus</italic> but not biofilm produced by the same strain. As our data suggest that the ability to form PNAG dependent biofilm is not a hallmark of certain infections, we think it is important to identify antibodies that recognize both phenotypes. Here, we show that 4497, CR5132, rF1, and T1-2 recognize a large set of clinical isolates derived from biofilm-related infections, being PNAG-dependent and -independent. Potentially, these results can be extended to other bacterial species such as <italic>S. epidermidis</italic>, which is the other main cause of implant-associated infections. Three mAbs in the panel (rF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hazenbos et al., 2013</xref>], F598 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly-Quintos et al., 2006</xref>], CR5132 [US 2012/0141493 A1]) have been described to bind <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in its planktonic state.</p><p>Altogether, our in vitro data suggested that mAbs against <italic>S. aureus</italic> surface antigens may be suited to detect biofilms in vivo. As a proof of principle, we tested <sup>111</sup>In-labeled 4497-IgG1 localization to a subcutaneously implanted pre-colonized catheter in mice and found increased radiolabel around the colonized implant compared to the sterile implant within 24 hr after mAb injection<bold>,</bold> suggesting rapid localization of 4497-IgG1 to biofilm in vivo. The nonspecific localization of control-IgG1 to pre-colonized catheters at lower levels than specific IgG1 suggests that localization is a combination-specific binding to target antigens and nonspecific binding to SpA expressed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Of note, we used a pre-colonized implant model and not an infection model where biofilm is developed in vivo. In the latter model, host factors such as fibrinogen will be incorporated in the in vivo biofilm EPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zapotoczna et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kwiecinski et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kwiecinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nishitani et al., 2015</xref>), which is why clinical biofilm is described as very heterogenic. Therefore, it is important to further test mAb binding in different in vivo models such as PJIs and osteomyelitis models.</p><p>We consider these results as a good starting point to further evaluate the diagnostic and therapeutic purposes of these mAbs. For advanced diagnostic purposes, specific mAbs could also be coupled to gamma- or positron-emitting radionuclides and then be used to detect the presence of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in a biofilm in a patient or during revision surgery. Alternatively, mAbs could be used in vitro to detect the presence of biofilm on explanted implants. For therapeutic purposes, mAbs that bind to biofilm could function as a delivery vehicle to specifically direct biofilm degrading enzymes, antibiotics, photosensitizers, or alpha-/beta-emitting radionuclides to the site of infection. Alternatively, biofilm-binding mAbs could be tested for their ability to induce the activation of the immune system via the Fc-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Vor et al., 2020</xref>). In all cases, the identification of mAbs recognizing <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm will have vast utility in the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for patients undergoing medical procedures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wood46</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28360163/">28360163</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC 10832</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background(<italic>S. aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USA300 LAC; LAC WT (AH1263)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20418950/">20418950</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AH1263</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background(<italic>S. aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USA300 LAC <italic>∆spa, sbi</italic>::Tn; LAC<italic>∆spa∆sbi</italic> (AH4116)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ibberson et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AH4116</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>sbi</italic>::Tn in USA300 LAC <italic>∆spa</italic> (AH3052)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain <break/>background(<italic>S. aureus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">USA300 LAC AH4802</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31723175/">31723175</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AH4802</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Goat polyclonal) anti-human IgG F(ab′)<sub>2</sub>- APC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson ImmunoResearch</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

SPECT image reconstruction was performed using Similarity Regulated OSEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vaissier et al., 2016</xref>), using 6 iterations and 128 subsets, and the total-body SPECT volumes were smoothed using a 3D Gaussian filter of 1.5 mm. To quantify the accumulation of <sup>111</sup>In around the catheters, regions of interest (ROIs) were delineated on SPECT/CT fusion scans as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Branderhorst et al., 2014</xref>. 2D ROIs were manually drawn around the catheters and the full body on consecutive transversal slices that were reconstructed into a 3D volume of interest. Delineating the ROIs was done using an iso-contouring method with a threshold of 0.11. For each ROI, the reconstructed voxel intensity sums (total counts) were related to calibrator dose measurements (kBq). Accumulation of <sup>111</sup>In was defined as a percentage of total body activity, calculated as (total activity in the implant ROI/total activity in the body ROI) * 100. Reconstructed 3D body scans were visualized as maximum intensity projections, and the SPECT scale was adjusted by cutting 10% of the lower signal intensity to make the high-intensity regions readily visible.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical testing</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed in GraphPad Prism 8. The tests and n-values used to calculate p-values are indicated in the figure legends. Unless stated otherwise, graphs comprised at least three biological replicates (independent experiments).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Peschel (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors take advantage of published sequences of 6 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific antibodies. 5 of these antibodies target surface determinants of <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The authors uncover the true target for the 6th antibody erroneously assumed to be directed against LTA. The authors conduct a rigorous analysis of these antibodies. All CDRs are cloned using the same hIgG1 framework and all recombinant antibodies are produced using the same cell system. The authors include appropriate isotype controls.</p><p>The study is complicated by the fact that not all strains of <italic>S. aureus</italic> produce biofilms through the same mechanisms (at least in vitro). Here the authors chose two &quot;representative&quot; strains: Wood 46, a PNAG-dependent biofilm former and LAC, a PNAG-independent biofilm former. More critically, the study is restricted to strains that produce less or no IgG binding proteins, SpA and Sbi. This diminishes the impact of the study. SpA and Sbi are displayed in the bacterial envelope and capture IgG1 non-specifically through the Fc domain.</p><p>By limiting the analysis to spa/sbi deficient strains, the authors find that antibodies specific for β-GlcNac-WTA and SDR proteins can identify both PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative biofilms in vitro. Anti-SDR antibodies are also able to bind planktonic bacteria. The authors validate their findings by using β-GlcNac-WTA antibodies to detect biofilms in a mouse model. They present some very nice images and videos. In principle, the authors achieved their goals i.e. a proof-of-concept study for antibodies that can &quot;mark&quot; biofilms of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>• The authors need to provide evidence about the power of their animal study. Using one group of two mice introduces severe limitations.</p><p>• There is no evidence that mice developed osteomyelitis. Histology is missing. The authors need also to explain why the classical osteomyelitis model of Mader et al. was not studied in their setting.</p><p>• The authors need to omit from their manuscript the use of their antibodies for treatment; they do not provide any evidence for therapy.</p><p>• l.95-96: here the authors state that PNAG-dependent (+) biofilms are phenotypically different from PNAG-independent (-) biofilms and cite 6 references. The authors do not explain whether these phenotypic differences correlate with specific clinical biofilms. In other words, are PNAG+ biofilms a hallmark of infective endocarditis, catheter-associated infections, or arthritis? Is there any correlation at all? At the very least, the authors should test their hypothesis in the animal model. For instance, how would antibody F598 behave in the experiment shown in Figure 6? Would F598 selectively label the Woods46 biofilm but not LAC biofilms?</p><p>• Presumably, the reduced surface display of SpA in strain Wood46 results from decreased expression of the srtA gene (i.e. failure to anchor SpA to peptidoglycan). Nonetheless, Wood46 continues to secrete SpA (Balachandran et al., Plos one 2017). In Figure 2a, hIgG1 control and secondary goat antibodies do not bind to planktonic bacteria. However, control hIgG1 seems to bind Wood46 biofilms quite well (Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 4B, Figure 5A). How do the authors explain the data? Is secreted SpA diffusing away from planktonic cells but retained in biofilms?</p><p>• The authors should use wild type LAC (or a wild type strain Sbi+/Spa+) to evaluate anti-β-GlcNac-WTA and anti-SDR antibodies under physiological conditions.</p><p>• In Figure S1a, it looks as if all strains can attach to uncoated polystyrene microtiter plates however the text indicates that PNAG(+) strains preferentially adhere to such plates (l. 121-123). Is there a significant difference between Wood46 and USA300 LAC in Figure S1a?</p><p>• Figure 1 – S1a: in this study, the authors include either PNAG-dependent or DNA-dependent biofilm strains. Is this the sum of all biofilms encountered in the clinic? Does this imply that antibodies against β-GlcNac-WTA and SDR proteins should be able to mark and identify all biofilms (PNAG+/- and DNA+/-)?</p><p>• The use of signs &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; in Table 1 isn't particularly informative. Could the authors quantify or better describe weak and strong binding activities?</p><p>• Figure 6A: could the authors provide a better assessment for the limit of detection? How large should the biofilm be for visualization shown on Figure 6? Overall the images and videos are aesthetically pleasing, yet circling the area encompassing the biofilm and site of injection is a bit obvious. Were the images analyzed by a &quot;blind&quot; investigator and did the blind investigator reach the same conclusion as the authors?</p><p>• Figure 6A: the authors note that the overall antibody intensity decreases quite dramatically over 3 days. Does radiolabeling increase the turn-over of human IgG1 in mice? Or is the biofilm/infection responsible for the increased turn-over? <italic>S. aureus</italic> secretes several proteases that can degrade antibodies. This could be easily tested by using distinct animals for sterile and pre-colonized implants, although it is understood if adding additional animals to this particular study might be challenging.</p><p>• Line 113-116: Not clear if the statement refers to the control mAbs only or also to the tested mAbs.</p><p>• Line 125: Please rephrase sentence, as it can currently be read as either &quot;SpA complicates the detection…&quot; or &quot;low surface expression of SpA complicates the detection…&quot;</p><p>• Line 130-131: Please add a reference here.</p><p>• 134-135: Does this mean that (1) there is no DNA present in this biofilm, (2) the DNA is not digested by DNaseI due to shielding by other structural components (like PNAG) or (3) that digestion of DNA by DNaseI does not disturb the biofilm as other structural components (like PNAG) are present?</p><p>• 148: Growth condition affects regulation of the enzymes, and thereby their presence. I would suggest rephrasing the sentence to include both (1) presence of the genes encoding the responsible glycosyltransferase enzymes, as well as (2) expression of these genes based on environmental conditions (such as growth phase). Cite e.g. Li et al. 2015 (DOI: 10.1038/srep17219) regarding point 1.</p><p>• 153: This is related to the used growth phase of the bacterial cells (24h), which features high tarM expression. I would suggest also performing this experiment using exponential phase cultures, similar to how this is also performed for the ClfA experiments later on, in order to avoid any confusion regarding presence of the epitope on this strain in the literature.</p><p>• 161-164: See above. This is only true when comparing with stationary phase planktonic growth in broth.</p><p>• 178-179: The authors may consider using a PNAG-pos strain with both WTA modifications and an isogenic ica knockout to substantiate this claim.</p><p>• 192-194: How was this objectively measured? By comparison of the centers of mass of the fluorescent signals? If so, it would be helpful to provide an appropriate statistical method to substantiate these claims.</p><p>• 198.201: This experiment needs some more explanation. For instance, an additional mAb A120 was used in Figure S5c, which should be described. If it is indeed WTA b-GlcNAc that is bound by CR5132, please also show deposition on exponential-phase planktonic LAC.</p><p>• 217- 219: The authors to not provide compelling evidence that the abundance of the ClfA is different between PNAG-pos and PNAG-neg biofilms. They should tone down their statement or, if they want to make such claims, should show this using a different method, e.g. western blot or on the transcriptional level by qPCR.</p><p>• 233-235: What is this ratio based on? Please describe. Not taking into account kinetics, one would need to administer at least 10 g/l * 5 l / 25 = 2 gram of monoclonal antibody to reach a similar ratio in the human circulation. Is that realistic? If not, what would be a more appropriate ratio to test in vitro?</p><p>• 274: How do the authors conclude this, as only one other body site seems to be checked (namely, the sterile control implant)?</p><p>• 275-276: Which data are the authors correlating to make this statement? Please test appropriately.</p><p>• 283-285: What about S. epidermidis? Isn't that a similar if not bigger problem regarding these sorts of infection?</p><p>• References: Text duplication in all references containing &quot;<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>&quot;: in all cases written as &quot;<italic>Staphylococcus aureusStaphyloccus aureus</italic>&quot;</p><p>• Figures: Please plot two-sided error bars instead of the top one only. In addition, several y-axes are too short and clip error-bars (e.g. 3b), please double-check.</p><p>• 755-756: What does control refer to? No Ab or one of the isotype control antibodies defined in Figure 1A?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript deals with the development of novel antibodies that are able to attach on both the planktonic and replicating phase of biofilm formed by <italic>S. aureus</italic>. The authors present evidence for the attachment ability of these antibodies using both in vitro experiments and animal experiments.</p><p>The strengths of the manuscript are (a) the novel approach for an unmet need; (b) the development of antibodies that are targeting both sessile and planktonic forms; and (c) the study in an animal model. The main weak points are: (a) the lack of experimentation with coagulase-negative staphylococci that are the main effectors of biomembranes attaching on matrixes; and (b) the lack of proof that the animal model is a real model of osteomyelitis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors take advantage of published sequences of 6 <italic>S. aureus</italic>-specific antibodies. 5 of these antibodies target surface determinants of <italic>S. aureus</italic>.

The approach leads to a number of important results: it reveals which of the targeted surface structure and modification is expressed in in different <italic>S. aureus</italic> lifestyles and regions of a biofilm and it recommends the use of certain mABs for in-vivo detection of <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilms.</p><p>The study also raises a number of questions that could be more extensively addressed in the discussion. For instance, the mAb binding studies reveal that α and β GlcNAc-modification probably occurs differently in planktonic vs. sessile <italic>S. aureus</italic> lifestyle and in different areas of a biofilm. Can these findings be explained by differential expression of tarS/P and tarM referring to previous genome-wide transcriptomics studies?</p><p>It is also remarkable that mAbs 4497 and CR5132 detect the same WTA epitope but appear to differ in their biofilm-staining capacities.

Using one group of two mice introduces severe limitations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that the group size in our animal study was too small, therefore we have repeated the animal study to introduce more mice. The animal study was powered on the expected difference in localization of 4497-IgG1 to a sterile versus a pre-colonized implant in the same mouse, which functioned as an internal control. We repeated the experiment by injecting 5 mice with 4497-IgG1 (Figure 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 2) and 2 with ctrl-IgG1 (Figure 7—figure supplement 3). In the revised manuscript we now meet the calculated sample size of 4 mice per group (Figure 7). This information about power calculation was added to the revised manuscript in 525. We also rewrote the paragraph about this figure (line 297-314) and removed old Figure 6c as the absolute data is now more convincing and sufficient to substantiate our claims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• There is no evidence that mice developed osteomyelitis. Histology is missing. The authors need also to explain why the classical osteomyelitis model of Mader et al. was not studied in their setting.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that we did not clearly explain in the manuscript that we are not using an osteomyelitis infection model in our study. We also realize that indeed we are not using an infection model here because we are implanting implants pre-colonized with biofilm. Therefore, we more clearly explained the model and removed terminology related to ”infection” at several places in the manuscript, including the title, as indicated by track changes. Moreover, we added a line 401 in the discussion, emphasizing the importance of testing the results in a prosthetic joint infection or osteomyelitis model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors need to omit from their manuscript the use of their antibodies for treatment; they do not provide any evidence for therapy.</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right that our results do not directly result in new antibody therapies. Therefore, we removed some references to the use of antibodies for treatment. However, in particular cases (introduction, discussion) we think it is relevant to refer to the potential use of mAbs as a platform in the development of new treatment. For instance, monoclonal antibodies (mAb) could be exploited as vehicles to specifically bring anti-biofilm agents (such as radionuclides, antibiotics) to the site of infection. Our results are an important first step for such developments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• l.95-96: here the authors state that PNAG-dependent (+) biofilms are phenotypically different from PNAG-independent (-) biofilms and cite 6 references. The authors do not explain whether these phenotypic differences correlate with specific clinical biofilms. In other words, are PNAG+ biofilms a hallmark of infective endocarditis, catheter-associated infections, or arthritis? Is there any correlation at all? At the very least, the authors should test their hypothesis in the animal model. For instance, how would antibody F598 behave in the experiment shown in Figure 6? Would F598 selectively label the Woods46 biofilm but not LAC biofilms?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that this is an important point, and therefore performed additional experiments to study whether PNAG production is associated with certain clinical biofilms. In literature, no correlation between <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm phenotypes and the source of clinical biofilm infections has been described. Therefore, we collected <italic>S. aureus</italic> isolates from endocarditis, prosthetic joint infections and catheter tip infections. Next, we used the anti-PNAG antibody (F598-IgG3) to determine if these isolates produced PNAG-positive or PNAG-negative biofilm. We could detect F598-IgG3 binding to 1/4 endocarditis isolates, 6/25 catheter tip isolates and 5/16 PJI isolates<bold>.</bold></p><p>Overall, these experiments indicate that formation of PNAG positive or negative biofilm is not a hallmark of one specific source of biofilm related infections and that approximately one third of isolates form PNAG-positive biofilm in vitro. In the revised manuscript, these data are included as Figure 6 and we added a new paragraph to the Results section entitled “The majority of mAbs recognize PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative formed by clinical isolates from biofilm associated infections”(line 268 – 297).</p><p>The above data underline that it is important to identify mAbs that recognize both PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative biofilm. For this reason, we focused our in vivo experiments on a mAb that can recognize both phenotypes and not on distinguishing between the two phenotypically different biofilm. We apologize that this was not clear and now better explain that the aim of our study is to identify mAbs that recognize both types of biofilm (line 100 and 288).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Presumably, the reduced surface display of SpA in strain Wood46 results from decreased expression of the srtA gene (i.e. failure to anchor SpA to peptidoglycan). Nonetheless, Wood46 continues to secrete SpA (Balachandran et al., Plos one 2017). In Figure 2a, hIgG1 control and secondary goat antibodies do not bind to planktonic bacteria. However, control hIgG1 seems to bind Wood46 biofilms quite well (Figure 2B, Figure 3B, Figure 4B, Figure 5A). How do the authors explain the data? Is secreted SpA diffusing away from planktonic cells but retained in biofilms?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for raising this interesting point. The revised manuscript contains new experimental data explaining the binding of control hIgG1 to Wood46 biofilms. To test the reviewers’ hypothesis, we performed a binding assay on Wood46 planktonic bacteria vs. biofilm with control IgG1, which is able to bind SpA via the Fc-domain, control IgG3, which is unable to bind to SpA via the Fc-domain and IgG3 mAb binding SpA via the Fab-domain but not the Fc-domain. None of the mAbs bound to planktonic bacteria (Figure 2—figure supplement 2b), indicating that SpA is removed during the washing steps in the assay. In contrast, control IgG1 showed increased binding to Wood46 biofilm compared to control IgG3 and aSpA-IgG3 showed increased binding compared to control IgG1 (Figure 2—figure supplement 2a), indicating that SpA is incorporated in the biofilm and cannot be washed away in the assay. In the revised manuscript, we added one new paragraph to the Results section (line 165-173).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors should use wild type LAC (or a wild type strain Sbi+/Spa+) to evaluate anti-β-GlcNac-WTA and anti-SDR antibodies under physiological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a valuable addition so as suggested by the referee, we have now included mAb binding data to wild type LAC (AH1263). To exclude nonspecific binding of the IgG-Fc domain by SpA, we produced all antibodies as IgG3 subclass. Binding of IgG3 mAbs to planktonic LAC WT (Figure 5—figure supplement 4) was similar to binding of IgG1 mAbs to LAC∆spa∆sbi (Figure 5—figure supplement 1b), except for a relatively high binding of 4497-IgG3 to LAC WT compared to 4497-IgG1 binding to LAC∆spa∆sbi. This could indicate that knocking out SpA and Sbi influenced the production of β-WTA by LAC WT. Binding of IgG3 mAbs to LAC WT biofilm (Figure 5—figure supplement 4b) was comparable to binding of IgG1 mAbs to LAC<italic>∆spa∆sbi</italic> biofilm (Figure 5b). In the revised manuscript we added line 265-272.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure S1a, it looks as if all strains can attach to uncoated polystyrene microtiter plates however the text indicates that PNAG(+) strains preferentially adhere to such plates (l. 121-123). Is there a significant difference between Wood46 and USA300 LAC in Figure S1a?</p></disp-quote><p>The initial screen in old figure S1A was based on literature describing PNAG facilitating adherence to plastic via electrostatic interactions (Arciola et al., 2015; Formosa-Dague et al., 2016). However, in the clinical isolate screen we performed for point 4, we have compared biofilm formation for each isolate on uncoated versus coated plates. From this experiment it became clear that also isolates without PNAG can grow robust biofilm on uncoated plates and isolates with PNAG can form robust biofilm on coated plates. We therefore removed this argument and figure S1A from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1 – S1a: in this study, the authors include either PNAG-dependent or DNA-dependent biofilm strains. Is this the sum of all biofilms encountered in the clinic? Does this imply that antibodies against β-GlcNac-WTA and SDR proteins should be able to mark and identify all biofilms (PNAG+/- and DNA+/-)?</p></disp-quote><p>In literature, a clear distinction is made between PNAG-positive and PNAG- negative <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm (Fitzpatrick et al., 2005; McCarthy et al., 2015; Mlynek et al., 2020; O’Neill et al., 2007; Rohde et al., 2007; Sugimoto et al., 2018). Besides PNAG, the in vitro biofilm can be composed of bacterial proteins and bacterial DNA. The relative contribution of each factor differs per <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain. Furthermore, in an in vivo biofilm human factors will be incorporated, which is why biofilm encountered in the clinic is highly heterogenic (Zapotoczna et al., 2015).</p><p>To answer the referees second question, from the screened clinical isolates (that were used in Figure 6ab), we selected 6 PNAG-positive and 6 PNAG-negative clinical isolates. To this selection of isolates, we tested binding of the mAb panel and we found that all mAbs, except 4461 and F598 bind to in vitro formed biofilm by PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative clinical isolates. These data have been included in Figure 6c and a new paragraph in the Results section entitled: “The majority of mAbs recognize PNAG-positive and PNAG-negative formed by clinical isolates from biofilm associated infections”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The use of signs &quot;+&quot; and &quot;-&quot; in Table 1 isn't particularly informative.

We measured the biofilm size (CFU counts) on the catheters before implantation and at the end point of the study (120h after implantation), but not at each SPECT/CT scanning time point. Therefore, the best assessment for the limit of detection we can provide is that the biofilm size was 4.5 x 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/implant before implantation and 1.1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/implant at the end point of the study (120h).</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with the referee that circling the regions of interest around implanted catheters is obvious. Although we think that circles make our methods easier to understand for the reader, we replaced the circles with letters indicating where colonized and sterile catheters were implanted (C = Colonized and S = sterile), because this is how bio distribution scans are represented in literature (Karmani et al., 2016). Moreover, we added the paragraph “Image visualization and SPECT/CT data analyses” to better explain the analysis procedure.</p><p>To answer the reviewers last question, the implantation of sterile and pre-colonized catheters in the left or the right flank was randomized and the analyzing investigator was blinded for the injection of [<sup>111</sup>In]In-4497-IgG1 or [<sup>111</sup>In]In-Palivizumab.

For example, a humanized IgG1 to melanin labeled with <sup>111</sup>In, displayed a 2 days half-life in C57Bl6 mice (Allen et al., 2019). Thus, significant decrease of the antibody in circulation after 72 hrs is consistent with the pharmacokinetics of human/humanized antibodies in mice. In the revised manuscript we now added this reference and better explained the dramatic decrease within the first three days. Please see line 310.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 113-116: Not clear if the statement refers to the control mAbs only or also to the tested mAbs.</p></disp-quote><p>We replaced ‘these’ with ‘all’ to make clear that all sequences were derived from scientific or patent publications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 125: Please rephrase sentence, as it can currently be read as either &quot;SpA complicates the detection…&quot; or &quot;low surface expression of SpA complicates the detection…&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected this sentence to “nonspecific binding of the IgG1 Fc-domain to SpA complicates the detection”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 130-131: Please add a reference here.</p></disp-quote><p>There is no reference available for this strain, but construction of AH4116 is described in the methods section of the manuscript (Line 461).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 134-135: Does this mean that (1) there is no DNA present in this biofilm, (2) the DNA is not digested by DNaseI due to shielding by other structural components (like PNAG) or (3) that digestion of DNA by DNaseI does not disturb the biofilm as other structural components (like PNAG) are present?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for raising this interesting question. According to literature, the PNAG vs DNA/protein phenotype are not mutually exclusive as PNAG-positive <italic>S. aureus</italic> biofilm has been shown to contain DNA and proteins in addition to PNAG (Mlynek et al., 2020). In Mlynek <italic>et al.</italic> it is suggested that PNAG can shield DNA but also that PNAG can stabilize DNA networks in a biofilm, making it less sensitive to DNase treatment. Thus, option 2 or option 3 could be possible explanations. We added these explanations to the revised manuscript in line 130.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 148: Growth condition affects regulation of the enzymes, and thereby their presence. I would suggest rephrasing the sentence to include both (1) presence of the genes encoding the responsible glycosyltransferase enzymes, as well as (2) expression of these genes based on environmental conditions (such as growth phase). Cite e.g. Li et al. 2015 (DOI: 10.1038/srep17219) regarding point 1.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript now contains this reference and the sentence has been rephrased.

I would suggest also performing this experiment using exponential phase cultures, similar to how this is also performed for the ClfA experiments later on, in order to avoid any confusion regarding presence of the epitope on this strain in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize to the referee that it was not described clearly that all experiments in the main figures were performed with exponential phase bacteria. Only data in Figure 4—figure supplement 1 has been obtained with stationary phase <italic>S. aureus</italic>. We specified more clearly throughout the revised manuscript when we are using exponential or stationary cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 161-164: See above. This is only true when comparing with stationary phase planktonic growth in broth.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript we compared exponential phase LAC<italic>∆spa∆sbi</italic> (AH4116) to biofilm. This is related to point 6 and point 17 and has been made more clear throughout the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 178-179: The authors may consider using a PNAG-pos strain with both WTA modifications and an isogenic ica knockout to substantiate this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>This is related to point 20 where we downgraded our claims about the location of mAb binding mAbs in the 3D structure of biofilm because this an observation and not the focus of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 192-194: How was this objectively measured? By comparison of the centers of mass of the fluorescent signals? If so, it would be helpful to provide an appropriate statistical method to substantiate these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referee that these statements are rather subjective and not proven by statistics. To test the statistical significance, we now performed unpaired t-tests on the mean centers of mass of &gt;2 Z-stacks of the red versus the green channels for n=2 independent experiments. Only in the case of 4497-IgG1 binding in Wood46 biofilm, a significant difference in the center of mass was found. Based on this analysis, we removed the Z-stack profiles (in old Figure 2ef, old Figure 3ef, Figure 2—figure supplement 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4) from the manuscript and removed all lines describing the distribution of mAbs in the biofilm 3D structure as indicated by track changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 198.201: This experiment needs some more explanation. For instance, an additional mAb A120 was used in Figure S5c, which should be described. If it is indeed WTA b-GlcNAc that is bound by CR5132, please also show deposition on exponential-phase planktonic LAC.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that this experiment was not explained well. We added line 211-220 to explain this experiment better. Also, A120 was added to the list of antibodies (Supplementary File 1) and described in the revised manuscript text (line 213). Furthermore, we see comparable binding of CR5132-IgG3 and 4497-IgG3 to exponential planktonic wild-type LAC, data which has been included in the manuscript in Figure 5—figure supplement 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 217- 219: The authors to not provide compelling evidence that the abundance of the ClfA is different between PNAG-pos and PNAG-neg biofilms. They should tone down their statement or, if they want to make such claims, should show this using a different method, e.g. western blot or on the transcriptional level by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we rephrased this line to make it more clear that we are giving two possible explanations for the differences in T1-2 binding that we observed between biofilm formed the two strains. Please see line 237.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 233-235: What is this ratio based on? Please describe. Not taking into account kinetics, one would need to administer at least 10 g/l * 5 l / 25 = 2 gram of monoclonal antibody to reach a similar ratio in the human circulation. Is that realistic? If not, what would be a more appropriate ratio to test in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>This ratio was based on the calculation given by the reviewer, where we think administration of 2 gram monoclonal antibody is realistic as there are ongoing clinical trials (SAATELLITE [NCT02296320]) where 2000 and 5000 mg intravenous mAb is being administered to participants. We added line 257 to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 274: How do the authors conclude this, as only one other body site seems to be checked (namely, the sterile control implant)?</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and removed this statement from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 275-276: Which data are the authors correlating to make this statement? Please test appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point. In the original manuscript, we compared the CFU counts in old figure S10B to old figure 6B, where each shape represents one mouse and it seemed that in mice with higher CFU counts on the implant at end point, we could detect a higher percentage of mAb signal at the colonized implant. In the revised manuscript, these mice can be recognized by their shape in Figure 7b, 120h and are compared to corresponding CFU counts in Figure 7—figure supplement 1b. We adjusted the text to “when a higher bacterial burden was recovered from a pre-colonized implant (n=3) at the end point (Figure 7—figure supplement 1, each shape is one mouse), a higher 4497-IgG1 activity was measured at the implant (Figure 7b, 120h, see corresponding shapes)”. Please see line 328.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• 283-285: What about S. epidermidis? Isn't that a similar if not bigger problem regarding these sorts of infection?</p></disp-quote><p>The referee is right that <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> causes similar amounts of implant infections. We focused on <italic>S. aureus</italic> because this often has a more serious course of disease. We know from previous publications that some mAbs (rF1 (Hazenbos et al., 2013), F598 (Kelly-Quintos et al., 2006)), CR5132 [US 2012/0141493 A1] can bind to planktonic <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> and hypothesize that these also bind to biofilm. Although we feel this is outside the scope of this manuscript, we included a statement about <italic>S. epidermidis</italic> in the discussion (line 380-383).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• References: Text duplication in all references containing &quot;<italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>&quot;: in all cases written as &quot;<italic>Staphylococcus aureusStaphyloccus aureus</italic>&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We corrected <italic>&quot;Staphylococcus aureusStaphyloccus aureus&quot;</italic> to <italic>&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figures: Please plot two-sided error bars instead of the top one only.
