Despite early experiments suggesting that reduced caloric intake augmented lifespan, accumulating evidence indicates that other characteristics of the diet may be equally or more influential in modulating aging. We demonstrate that behavior, metabolism, and lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are affected by whether flies are provided a choice of different nutrients or a single, complete medium, largely independent of the amount of nutrients that are consumed. Meal choice elicits a rapid metabolic reprogramming that indicates a potentiation of TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism, which requires serotonin 2A receptor. Knockdown of <italic>glutamate dehydrogenase</italic>, a key TCA pathway component, abrogates the effect of dietary choice on lifespan. Our results reveal a mechanism of aging that applies in natural conditions, including our own, in which organisms continuously perceive and evaluate nutrient availability to promote fitness and well-being.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The foods we eat can affect our lifespan, but it is also possible that thinking about food may have effects on our health. Choosing what to eat is one of the main ways we think about food, and most animals, including the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, choose their foods. The effects of these choices can affect health via a chemical in the brain called serotonin. This chemical interacts with proteins called serotonin 2A receptors in the brain, which then likely primes the body to process nutrients.</p><p>To understand how serotonin affected the lifespan and health of fruit flies, Lyu et al. compared flies that were offered a single food to those that could choose between several foods. The flies that had a choice of foods lived shorter lives and produced more serotonin, but these effects were reversed when Lyu et al. limited the amount of a protein called glutamate dehydrogenase, which helps cells process nutrients.</p><p>These results suggest that choosing what we eat can impact lifespan, ageing and health. Human and fly brains share many similarities, but human brain chemistry is more complex, as is our experience of food. This work demonstrates that food choices can affect lifespan. More research into this phenomenon may shed further light onto how our thoughts and decision-making impact our health.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>nutrient choice</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>TCA cycle</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Collaborative Research Travel Grant BWF1017452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lyu</surname><given-names>Yang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program DGE 1256260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Kristina J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG049494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Promislow</surname><given-names>Daniel EL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG051649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletcher</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 AG013280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Promislow</surname><given-names>Daniel EL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG030593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletcher</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG063371</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pletcher</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001642</institution-id><institution>Glenn Foundation for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Paul F.

Interest in the nutritional determinants of aging date back to the early 1900s, as experiments in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chippindale et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman and Partridge, 1996</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McCay et al., 1935</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weindruch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weindruch and Walford, 1982</xref>) revealed that limiting total food intake or reducing diet quality, without malnutrition, increased lifespan. Dietary restriction (DR, also called caloric restriction) is now known to effectively increase the lifespan of nearly every species to which it has been applied. In mammals, increased lifespan in response to DR is accompanied by a broad-spectrum improvement in health during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weindruch and Walford, 1988</xref>;Â <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Longo and Finch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barger et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Contestabile, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Research over the past century on the effects of DRÂ has revealed how food characteristics influence healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tatar et al., 2014</xref>). For many years, it was believed that the caloric content of the food and the amount of energy consumed by the animal were the driving forces behind the effects of restriction on lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Masoro, 2005</xref>). More recently, however, conceptual advances such as the geometric framework for nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>), together with comprehensive experiments that manipulate diet in model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>), have made it clear that dietary composition and availability of specific nutrients are often more relevant than calories in shaping life histories. For example, in homogenous nutritional environments where all nutrients are mixed together in a single food, animals fed a high carbohydrateâlow protein diet generally live longer than siblings fed a calorically equivalent low carbohydrateâhigh protein diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2013</xref>). Short-term experiments in heterogeneous nutritional environments, where animals are given a choice of two foods with different macronutrient ratios, reveal a behavioral preference for a diet that is high in carbohydrate and low in protein, suggesting that animals will adjust their dietary choices to optimize evolutionary fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bunning et al., 2016</xref>). The long-term effects of a complex nutritional environment and the accompanying dietary choices on physiology and healthy aging are unknown. Macronutrient intake will almost surely not be the only factor here because sensory perception of specific nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ostojic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waterson et al., 2014</xref>), and even the presence of choice itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avondo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Steenfeldt et al., 2019</xref>), may be influential.</p><p>We have recently reported that how a meal is presented, or perhaps the way in which it is eaten, modulates aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>). We found that flies were longer-lived when aged in an environment in which all dietary components were mixed together (termed a fixed diet) compared to one in which the two macronutrients, yeast and sugar, were available separately (termed a choice diet). When presented with a choice diet, flies consume an equivalent amount of protein and a higher carbohydrate:protein ratio than they do when fed a nutritionally equivalent fixed diet. Contrary to the results of most geometric nutritional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruce et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2008</xref>), however, their lifespan is shorter than those fed on high carbohydrate:protein fixed diets. This led us to speculate that the effects of dietary choice were derived, at least in part, from unknown effects of the complex nutritional environment.</p><p>Here we present a series of experimental results that indicate that dietary choice elicits significant changes in the physiology and lifespan of male <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> through mechanisms that are distinct, at least in part, from nutrient consumption. Coincident changes in behavioral and health metrics suggest that flies exhibit distinct neural and metabolic states when presented with a choice diet than they do when presented with one that is nutritionally homogeneous. We report that neuronal expression of <italic>serotonin receptor 2A</italic> (<italic>5-HT2A</italic>) during the adult stage is required for many of the effects caused by dietary choice, including a 5-HT2A-dependent metabolic reprogramming that is consistent with a significant upregulation of the tricarboxylic acidÂ (TCA) cycle and amino acid metabolism when nutrients were presented separately. Transgenic knockdown of a key enzyme, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), which is predicted to diminish the metabolic changes induced by a choice diet, abrogated its effects on lifespan. Future research may elucidate the downstream targets through which neuronal 5-HT2A signals acts as a potent modulator of aging and physiology in an environment much like our own, where animals must constantly choose between different nutrients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>As with most model organisms, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> reared in a conventional laboratory setting is normally provided with a homogenous, complete media that meets all of its nutritional needs. For flies, this medium is comprised predominantly of a source of protein and micronutrients (e.g., brewerâs yeast) and a carbohydrate source (e.g., sucrose). In natural conditions, however, a complete food source is unlikely to be found, and animals must seek out and identify nutritionally complementary foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Csata et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mayntz et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, fruit flies are known to recognize and choose among different macronutrients based on palatability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiss et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harris et al., 2015</xref>) and physiological demand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steck et al., 2018</xref>). While studying the mechanisms underlying protein feeding, we observed significant modulation of survival depending on whether the animals were given a complete diet or were provided with a dietary choice by presenting the two macronutrient sources separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>). These effects were observed in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and in different laboratory strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The magnitude of the choice effect was consistently greater in males (29â37% change in mean lifespan) than in females (5â15% change in mean lifespan, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Similar effects were observed using two <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lines that were recently collected from the wild: the lifespans of male strains were consistently and significantly reduced in response to dietary choice and there was variability in the female response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The effects on lifespan are not due to some sort of acute toxicity because flies maintained on a choice diet for a short period (e.g.,Â 2Â weeks) exhibited general health metrics, such as intestinal integrity and climbing ability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), that were indistinguishable from siblings that were fed a fixed diet. Together these results indicate that the effects of dietary choice on lifespan are sexÂ specific and are not an artifact of long-term laboratory culture.</p><p>Four lines of evidence indicate that the effect of a choice diet on lifespan isÂ driven, at least in part, by mechanisms that are independent of increased sucrose consumption. First, increased sugar consumption alone is generally not associated with a large reduction in fly lifespan; even extremely sugar-rich diets (e.g., greater than 8Ã sugar intake) have only modest effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>), much smaller than we observed following dietary choice. New data that we obtained when we measured lifespan on fixed diets designed to approximate the nutritional composition that flies voluntarily constructed from their choice diet were consistent with this interpretation. We compared the lifespans of flies aged on a choice diet with those obtained from flies aged on one of two high-sugar, fixed diets (S30Y3 and S24Y3; i.e., 30%Â [w/v] sugar or 24%Â [w/v] sucrose mixed with 3%Â [w/v] yeast, respectively), among which flies consumed statistically indistinguishable amounts of both sugar and yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, represented as mass of nutrient consumed). The effect of dietary choice, relative to the standard SY10 diet, was much greater than that from homogeneous high-sugar diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Second, the effects of the choice diet on gross measures of fly physiology were distinctly different from those caused by increased sugar intake in the fixed diet. Flies exposed to a choice diet exhibited a significant reduction in triglyceride/protein ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) and triglyceride abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>;Â total weight was not affected; ), while increased sugar in the fixed diets had no such effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Third, we observed that simply changing the nature of the choice, by manipulating the concentration of the yeast component of the choice diet, was sufficient to modulate lifespan even though both cohorts of flies consumed the same amount of sugar and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>, represented as mass of nutrient consumed). Moreover, the effect was opposite to that normally seen when similar manipulations were applied to a homogeneous diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mair et al., 2005</xref>); an increased concentration of the yeast component of choice extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Fourth, the transcription factor <italic>dFoxo</italic> is required both for transcriptional changes and for nutritional programming of lifespan caused by excess dietary sugar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>), but it is dispensable for the lifespan effect of dietary choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that animals respond differently to macronutrients depending on how they are presented and that the effects of dietary choice on lifespan and physiology may be mediated by processes that are distinct from macronutrient intake.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The presentation of nutrients significantly affects lifespan independent of the consumption of each nutrient in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Separating macronutrients in diet is sufficient to modulate aging.

Evidence suggests that this is not the case. Individual weight was not different among flies fed different diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and total protein was lower in flies given a dietary choice than it was in their siblings fed a fixed diet, which is the opposite of what would be expected from the effect of dietary choice on lifespan. Furthermore, molecular and physiological markers that were strongly affected by protein availability, including target of rapamycinÂ (TOR) activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fontana and Partridge, 2015</xref>) and female fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>), were not altered by dietary choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we hypothesized that neuronal mechanisms involved in nutrient evaluation might influence lifespan when macronutrients are presented separately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>). Our candidate screen of neurotransmitters and their receptors revealed that the presence of a <italic>P</italic>-element insertion in the promoter region of <italic>serotonin receptor 2A</italic> (<italic>5-HT2A<sup>PL00052</sup></italic>), which creates a putative loss of function mutation in this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nichols, 2007</xref>), reduced protein preference in starved female flies and significantly extended lifespan under dietary choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>). Loss of function in other serotonin receptors had no influence on protein preference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>), yet it remains to be tested whether they influence the aging processes in a choice environment. Here we focused on elucidating the mechanisms underlying the effects of the 5-HT2A receptor and expanded our analysis of its effects on dietary choice and male lifespan.</p><p>Indeed, we found that the <italic>P</italic>-element insertion in <italic>5-HT2A</italic> fully abrogated the male lifespan differences between fixed and choice dietary environments, largely by increasing lifespan when nutrients were presented individually (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mutant flies were modestly short-lived on the standard, fixed diet, which is likely due to the pleotropic effects of this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gasque et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howard et al., 2019</xref>). We also investigated the influence of RNAi-based knockdown of <italic>5-HT2A</italic> expression using multiple RNAi lines. Because <italic>5-HT2A</italic> is highly expressed in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), we used the pan-neuronal driver <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> to achieve <italic>5-HT2A</italic> knockdown, and we observed that this manipulation abrogated the lifespan effect of dietary choice using one of the RNAi lines (<italic>UAS-5-HT2A-RNAi<sup>TRiP</sup></italic>) and strongly reduced the effect in the second (<italic>UAS-5-HT2A-RNAi<sup>KK</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also observed that the survivorship of adult flies fed with 200 ÂµM pirenperone, an anxiolytic known to antagonize 5-HT2A receptor signaling in mammals, was unaffected by nutrient presentation, further supporting a role for this receptor and ruling out a necessity for loss of function during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> for the second replicate). Together, these results implicate neuronal expression of receptor <italic>5-HT2A</italic> in the adult male fly in mediating the effect of dietary choice on lifespan.</p><p>Although we concluded that nutrient intake was unlikely to be responsible for the difference in lifespan in wild-type flies, it remained formally possible that feeding differences between control and <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutant flies were responsible for the dissimilar response to dietary choice. Our previous work demonstrated that 5-HT2A influenced protein preference after starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>), and we asked whether it influenced nutrient consumption in fed flies. Surprisingly, we found that, in the choice environment, <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutant flies exhibited feeding characteristics similar to control animals: each consumed significantly more sucrose than yeast when given a dietary choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), despite spending the majority of their time physically located on the yeast food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Unlike control animals, however, the behavioral differences in <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutants were not coupled to changes in lifespan.</p><p>DR, and the extended lifespan that accompanies it, are associated with increased locomotion behavior in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Weindruch et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen, 2005</xref>), presumably reflecting a motivational state of hunger. By video tracking control and mutant flies in each of the dietary environments (using our DTrack system, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), we found that control flies were generally more active when given a dietary choice: they traveled significantly farther in a 6 hr window when compared to siblings housed on a fixed diet. <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutant flies responded similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, two-way ANOVA on the square root transformed values, p<sub>Diet*Genotype</sub>&gt;0.05). Behavioral classification of the movements during this time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>) revealed that diet-dependent differences were mirrored in both the time spent walking (speedÂ &gt;Â 2 mm/s), in executing micromovements (e.g., grooming or when 0.2 mm/s &lt; movement speedÂ â¤Â 2 mm/s), and in the time spent sleeping or resting (speedÂ â¤Â 0.2 mm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>).

From these data we concluded that diet-dependent changes in locomotion are not causal to changes in lifespan.</p><p>Increased locomotor behavior has been linked with stress in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sestakova et al., 2013</xref>) and perhaps in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohammad et al., 2016</xref>), leading us to examine whether other stress-related phenotypes were changed in flies fed a choice diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Strekalova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Linford et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2015</xref>).

We therefore sought to identify changes in metabolite abundance using targeted metabolomics. To delineate an appropriate window of time to study, we completed a demographic analysis of the effect of dietary choice on age-specific mortality. Mortality rates of male flies whose nutrients were presented separately following eclosion exhibited measurable and high mortality rates by day 10, while similar levels of mortality in flies exposed to a homogenous food did not appear until day 40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, compare black and orange solid lines). To determine how quickly the effects of nutrient presentation manifest, we performed a switch experiment in which flies fed a homogenous medium since eclosion were given a dietary choice beginning on day 20. We observed that the mortality rate of the switched cohort rose within 48 hr after choice began, and after roughly 5Â days, it reached the level of the cohort whose nutrients had been separate since eclosion. We also performed the opposite experiment in which nutrients were combined into a fixed diet at day 20. Flies in this cohort exhibited a rapid decrease in mortality, again within 48 hr.

We also chose to sample flies 48 hr after a dietary switch because this period was sufficient to significantly affect mortality rates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>) and because we felt that a comparison of switched to unswitched cohorts at this time would help further isolate changes that were causal to lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Finally, although neural expression of <italic>5-HT2A</italic> was required for the lifespan effects of dietary choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> above), it is also putatively expressed in salivary glands, in digestive tissues such as the crop, and in reproductive organs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We therefore collected heads and bodies separately to determine whether the metabolomic effects of the two nutritional environments were enriched in the brain or whether they also manifested in peripheral tissues.</p><p>Using principal component analysis (PCA), we identified three principal components (PCs) in each of the tissue samples by which metabolome profiles effectively separated genotypic effects from those caused by nutrient presentation (additional PCA are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

A second PC in each data set identified diet history (PC3 and PC2 in heads and bodies, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). These combinations of metabolites provided separation based on how nutrients were presented to the flies for the 20 days prior to the dietary switch, and they were largely unaffected by the switch itself. Separation was also observed in <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutant flies, suggesting that the metabolites that load strongly on these axes exhibit slow, persistent changes in response to differences in nutrient presentation that are not associated with changes in mortality. Finally, a single PC in both heads and bodies (represented by PC6 in both data sets) distinguished acute responses to dietary switch in both tissues that were abrogated in <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). These PCs identified specific metabolites in either heads or bodies that were correlated with changes in mortality and that shared a common 5-HT2A dependence.</p><p>The PCA results suggested that nutrient presentation influenced two processes: (A) a relatively stable 5-HT2A-independent metabolic network that responded slowly to dietary environment and that accounted for a significant amount of metabolome variation (10.2â11.2%) and (B) a dynamic 5-HT2A-dependent metabolic network that accounted for a smaller component of variation (2.0â2.2%) that responded quickly to dietary choice and that was associated with mortality. Using generalized linear models, we identified individual metabolites that exhibited statistically significant changes consistent with membership in each of these two groups (a summary of the analysis of a third group that distinguished genotype effects is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>; statistics for each metabolite are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Among them, âalanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolismâ was the only category of interest in both tissues, specifically in a 5-HT2A-dependent manner.

The TCA cycle is a series of biochemical reactions that generates energy (ATP) through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from different nutrients, while the same reactions also provide precursors for amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Specifically, we found that oxaloacetate abundance was increased in both tissue samples in a 5-HT2A<italic>-</italic>dependent manner, while Î±-ketoglutarate and fumarate were upregulated only in heads and bodies, respectively. Further analysis revealed consistency among the abundances of the amino acid precursors of these intermediates, which were also increased in their corresponding tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Asparagine, the immediate precursor for oxaloacetate, was increased in both heads and bodies; glutamine, the major precursor for Î±-ketoglutarate, was increased only in heads; and aspartate, the precursor of fumarate, was increased only in bodies. Although we were unable to measure abundance of acetyl-CoA directly, we observed that the abundance of lysine, its precursor, was increased in both tissue samples.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Nutrient presentation modulates central metabolic pathways through serotonin signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Boxplots show the TCA intermediates and amino acids that are modulated by choice diet in a 5-HT2A-dependent manner (two-way ANOVA, p&lt;0.05 for the interaction between diet and genotype).

By separating the two macronutrients of the standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> laboratory diet (i.e., brewerâs yeast and sucrose) and allowing the animals to behaviorally structure their own diet, we found that lifespan was significantly shortened in both male and female flies. In addition, changes in activity, stress resistance, lipid metabolism, and critical metabolic processes were also elicited by dietary choice. Flies carrying a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>serotonin receptor 5A</italic> (<italic>5-HT2A</italic>), with RNAi-mediated neuronal knockdown of <italic>5-HT2A</italic> expression, or fed the putative receptor antagonist pirenperone, exhibited no differences in lifespan between choice and fixed diets, indicating that serotonin signaling through this receptor plays an essential role in the effect of nutrient presentation on aging.</p><p>Flies voluntarily consumed more sugar than yeast when presented with a choice diet. Although it is difficult to definitively rule out differences in consumption as a cause for the phenotypes we observe, several lines of evidence indicate that is not the major factor influencing lifespan: (1) the effect of dietary choice on lifespan is significantly larger than that caused by even the most extreme carbohydrate-rich fixed diets (as shown in both <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and previous studies from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>); (2) the choice diet induced physiological effects (e.g., reduced triglyceride abundance) opposite of those associated with a high-sugar fixed diet (e.g., increased or unchanged triglyceride abundance depending on the genetic background,Â see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Skorupa et al., 2008</xref>); (3) the insulin-responsive transcription factor, <italic>dFoxo</italic>, which is an essential effector of dietary sugar on aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dobson et al., 2017</xref>), is not required for the effect of dietary choice on lifespan; (4) manipulating the nature of the choice is sufficient to influence lifespan without altering the amount of nutrients eaten in a choice paradigm; and (5) flies with loss of <italic>5-HT2A</italic> exhibited the same diet-dependent changes in feeding as did control animals, yet they experienced no diet-induced changes in lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>).</p><p>We found that dietary choice influenced lifespan in both male and female laboratory flies and that 5-HT2A is required for this effect in both sexes (see female data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting the mechanisms are at least partially shared between them. However, sex-specific phenomena were also observed: lifespan was significantly shortened in male flies for all strains tested (from 11Â toÂ 37% in laboratory and wild strains), whereas the effects on lifespan were variable in recently wild-caught females (an average of 3% reduction) relative to a fixed diet. This is, perhaps, not surprising given the effects of different macronutrients among different strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2020</xref>) and sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Camus et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>). Future studies that focus on dissecting the role of individual macronutrients on choice effects or on investigating the involvement of sex-specific nutrient sensing proteins (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hudry et al., 2019</xref>), perhaps with a focus on population genetics of natural populations, will be useful for understanding the nature of sexual dimorphism on lifespan and physiology.</p><p>We found that dietary choice led to a rapid and reversible change in age-specific mortality only during a defined period of life. Dietary choice significantly increased mortality within 48 hr of exposure,Â and this effect was observed only up until middleÂ age (roughly 40 days in our experiments) after which time mortality rates in cohorts provided a fixed or choice diet were indistinguishable. This was true regardless of whether the flies had been presented with a dietary choice starting at eclosion or starting at 20 days of age, and these effects required serotonin receptor 5-HT2A. The effects of dietary choice on demographic aging, therefore, do not appear to accumulate, and they are simply absent in older flies, perhaps because of an age-dependent reduction in serotonin signaling, a lack of consequences of such signaling in older animals, or the manifestation of demographic heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vaupel and Yashin, 1985</xref>). These mortality patterns are distinct from those observed following other types of dietary or environmental perturbations. DR in flies is typically carried out by diluting both the yeast and carbohydrate components of a complete, fixed diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chapman and Partridge, 1996</xref>). DR rapidly influences mortality dynamics, and it is reversible at early ages. Unlike dietary choice, however, DR influences demographic aging across the whole of adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mair et al., 2003</xref>). The effect of different temperatures on mortality is cumulative and permanent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mair et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carvalho et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The neuronal response to dietary choice reshapes metabolic networks that are associated with energy homeostasis in peripheral tissues (see our model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Some of these changes are mediated by 5-HT2A, which is widely expressed in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gnerer et al., 2015</xref>) and in the thoracicoabdominal ganglion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Our metabolomic data revealed that TCA cycle components, as well as key components of amino acid metabolism, are strongly affected by food choice and that such changes require 5-HT2A. There is evidence that at least one such metabolite, Î±-ketoglutarate (Î±KG), is directly involved in the effect of dietary choice on lifespan. Î±KG was more abundant when flies were presented with a choice diet, and inhibition of GDH, which is involved in Î±KG synthesis, abrogated the difference in lifespan between choice and fixed diets (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Talbert et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, it has been reported that Î±KG modulates longevity by inhibiting TOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chin et al., 2014</xref>) and that oxaloacetate increases lifespan through an AMPK/FOXO-dependent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Williams et al., 2009</xref>). The effect of Î±KG on lifespan has recently been independently documented in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2019</xref>), and, more recently, in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadi Shahmirzadi et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting a conserved role for Î±KG in modulation of aging. Published data in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggest that supplementation of Î±KG to a standard laboratory diet increased transcript abundance of AMPK and FOXO and reduces that of TOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Su et al., 2019</xref>). However, our data indicate that neither FOXO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>) nor TOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) signaling is involved in the effects of dietary choice on lifespan, suggesting that Î±KG may recruit different mechanisms in this environment. Perhaps instead of energy sensing pathways, metabolic enzymes that control the branch point of crucial reactions (such as GDH) are more relevant in the context of a choice environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Smith et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Our working model showing how 5-HT2A regulates energy homeostasis to influence aging and physiology in response to nutrient presentation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59399-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We propose the idea that the effects of dietary choice may result from metabolic changes stimulated by an alteration in metabolic state induced by the need to continuously evaluate macronutrient availability against physiological demand, which would not exist in a fixed-diet environment. Flies housed in a choice environment, for example, are allowed to interact with each macronutrient individually, and this behavior would be expected to result in the sequential activation of sugar and protein sensing pathways. Flies exposed to a complete, fixed diet would only experience nutrients simultaneously. The perceived flavor of each macronutrient may be different when yeast and sugar are consumed separately compared to when they are paired together on a fixed diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>)Â and that may also influence lifespan and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ostojic et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, when given a choice, flies consumed more sugar than yeast but spent the majority of time physically on the yeast food. Loss of 5-HT2A did not alter these behaviors, establishing that control flies are capable of recognizing the components of a choice diet and that animals lacking 5-HT2A retain this ability.</p><p>Perhaps the act of decision-making per se is costly? In nature, decisions are made continuously following evaluation of environmental resources to allow animals to adjust their behavior in a way that would maximize their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galef, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lima, 1998</xref>). In humans, an abundance of choices can be stressful, which is thought to reflect the perceived risk of making a bad choice and therefore losing out on other, more valuable resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwartz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inbar et al., 2011</xref>). Although acute stress can be beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhabhar et al., 2012</xref>), chronic stress is often detrimental to lifespan and health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Epel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glaser and Kiecolt-Glaser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lupien et al., 2009</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibit stress-related behaviors that are mediated by neuronal signaling pathways that are conserved in mice and humans, including serotonin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sachs et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mohammad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ries et al., 2017</xref>). It seems reasonable, therefore, to consider the possibility that 5-HT2A influences metabolic decisions in response to the perception or consumption of individual nutrients in ways that are important for aging. Biogenic amines, including serotonin and dopamine, have been shown to encode protein hunger and reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ribeiro and Dickson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vargas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), and serotonin receptor 5-HT2A has been implicated in mammalian stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weisstaub et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sachs et al., 2015</xref>) and in a putatively stressful situation in flies in which prolonged sight of dead conspecifics increases mortality and shortens lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, a recent study in mice reported that unknown characteristics of each meal modulate aging independent of dietary composition or calories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that how animals recognize, interact with, or interpret their food may be a mechanism of aging that is conserved across taxa.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>5-HT2A</italic></td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FLYB:FBgn0087012</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>GDH</italic></td><td valign="top">FlyBase</td><td valign="top">FLYB:FBgn0001098</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Canton-S</italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> stock Center</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>5-HT2A<sup>PL00052</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC Cat# 19367, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:BDSC_19367">BDSC_19367</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Also see Materials and methods, section 1</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>w<sup>Dahomey</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Other</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">L.

Prior to the experiment, 200 ÂµM pirenperone and the same dilution of DMSO (control vehicle) were made. Then, 50 Âµl of the diluted drug or control vehicle was added to each food well. After the liquid evaporated (~2 hr), the food plates were ready for use as described in Survival assays.</p><p>In the GeneSwitch experiment, RU486 (mifepristone) was first dissolved in 80% (v/v) ethanol at 10 mM concentration, marked by blue dye (5%Â [w/v] FD and C Blue No. 1; Spectrum Chemical), and stored at â20Â°C. For experimental food, 200 ÂµM RU486 or the same dilution of control vehicle (80%Â [v/v] ethanol) was made from the stock and added to the food. To ensure flies consumed the same amount of RU486 between the choice diet and the fixed diet, drug was only administrated in the yeast portion of the choice diet, since the yeast intake on a choice diet is indistinguishable from the sugarâyeast intake on the fixed diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Lifespan assay was carried outÂ as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Survival assays</title><p>Lifespans were measured using established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linford et al., 2013</xref>). Normally, six replicate vials (~150 experimental flies) were established for each treatment. Flies were transferred to fresh media every 2â3 days, at which time dead flies were removed and recorded using the DLife system developed in the Pletcher Laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linford et al., 2013</xref>). Flies were kept in constant temperature (25Â°C) and humidity (60%) conditions with a 12:12 hrÂ light:dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Consumptionâexcretion (feeding assays)</title><p>We used the protocol described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shell et al., 2018</xref>). Experimental flies were co-housed in vials (10 flies per vial, 8â10 replicates for each group) for 2â3 days following eclosion and then sorted into individual sex cohorts. After exposure to the choice or fixed diet for 12 days (food was changed every 2â3 days), flies were transferred to the choice or fixed diet with 1% (w/v) FD and C Blue No. 1Â in either (1) only the S10 (10%Â [w/v] sucrose) food in the choice diet; (2) only the Y10 (10%Â [w/v] yeast) food in the choice diet; or (3) food in both wells in the fixed diet SY10 (10%Â [w/v] sucrose and 10%Â [w/v] yeast). Vials were discarded if one or more dead flies were observed after the 24 hr feeding period. Excreted dye (ExVial) was collected by addition of 3 ml of Milli-Q water of vials followed by vortexing. Concentration of the ExVial dye in water extracts was determined by absorbance at 630 nm, which was used to infer macronutrient consumption.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter feeding assays</title><p>Flies were tested on the Fly Liquid-Food Interaction Counter (FLIC) system as previously described to monitor ethanol feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ro et al., 2014</xref>) after exposure to a choice or fixed diet for 10 days. We filled the liquid-food reservoir with 15% (v/v) ethanol + 5% (w/v) sucrose in 4 mg/l MgCl<sub>2</sub>. We synchronized the feeding state prior to loading flies onto the FLIC system. Flies were removed from their food environment to kimwipes with 2 ml of water 2 hr before their natural breakfast time. At the peak of their normal breakfast meal (lights on), we flipped flies back onto their respective choice or fixed diets and let them feed for 2 hr. Following breakfast feeding, flies were briefly fasted for 3 hr on a wet kimwipe with 2 ml of water. We began the FLIC recording software before aspirating flies into the system and analyzed food or ethanol interactions for 6 hr. Flies were anesthetized briefly on ice and manually aspirated into the <italic>Drosophila</italic> feeding monitors (DFMs). Each DFM was loaded with flies from at least two treatment groups to reduce technical bias from the DFM signals. FLIC data were analyzed using custom R code, which is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://wikiflic.com/">wikiflic.com</ext-link>. Default thresholds were used for analysis except for the following: minimum feeding thresholdÂ =Â 20, minimum eventsÂ =Â 1, and tasting threshold = (10, 20). Flies that had zero feeding events over the testing interval were removed from the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Video tracking and analyses</title><p>Experimental males were reared on SY10 food for 2â3 days shortly after eclosion. We aspirated individual flies into the two-choice food arenas (diameterÂ =Â 31 mm, either a choice diet or a fixed diet, NÂ =Â 12 for each group) and let them adapt to the environment for 1 day. Then, 6Â hr video recording (10:00â16:00, at two frames per second with a resolution at 528 Ã 320) was taken and analyzed with DTrack, a video analysis package developed in the Pletcher Laboratory. Using the same speed threshold published before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corrales-Carvajal et al., 2016</xref>), we classified the movements of flies into resting or sleeping (speedÂ â¤Â 0.2 mm/s), micromovement (0.2 mm/s &lt; speedÂ â¤2 mm/s), and walking (speedÂ &gt;Â 2 mm/s). For positional preference assay, we aspirated individual male flies into the two-choice food arenas (NÂ =Â 24 for each genotype) after the designated exposure to the choice diet for 7 days. ThreeÂ hour video recordings were taken (at two frames per second with a resolution at 528 Ã 320) and analyzed with DTrack. The fraction of time flies spent on each macronutrient was computed and used for statistical analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Climbing activity assay</title><p>After the designated exposure to the choice or fixed diet for 10 days (food was changed every 2â3 days), male flies were transferred to the negative geotaxis apparatus using brief CO<sub>2</sub> anesthesia, after which they were allowed to recover for 30 min. We used an automated process in which flies were dropped from 24â. After freefall, which effectively knocked the flies to the bottom of the chamber, a video camera was triggered and individual fly movements were tracked for 10 s using the DDrop software developed in our laboratory. From the tracking data, we were able to calculate, for each male, the total distance traveled up in 10 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fly weight, TAG, and protein assays</title><p>After the designated exposure to the choice or fixed diet for 2 or 3 weeks (food was changed every 2â3 days), experimental flies were quickly frozen, collected into groups of five, weighed, and then homogenized in 200 Î¼l of cold phosphate-buffered salineÂ containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (IBI Scientific) for 30 s at 30 Hz using a QIAGEN TissueLyser. For TAG quantification, the homogenate (20 Î¼l) was added into 200 Î¼l of Infinity Triglyceride Reagent (Thermo Electron Corp.) and incubated at 37Â°C for 10 min with constant agitation. TAG concentrations were determined by the absorbance at 520 nm and estimated by a known triglyceride standard. For protein measurement, 5 Î¼l of fly homogenate was incubated with 200 Î¼l of (1:50) 4% (w/v) cupric sulfate/bicinchoninic acid solution (Novagen) at room temperature for 30 min. Protein concentrations were estimated by the absorbance at 562 nm through the comparison with bovine serum albuminÂ standards. Average weight, TAG, and protein values were based on at least six independent biological replicates (of five flies each) from multiple vials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Starvation assay</title><p>After the designated exposure to the choice or fixed diet for 20 days (food was changed every 2â3 days), flies were transferred to fresh vials containing 1% (w/v) agar. The number of dead flies was recorded approximately every 2â5 hr using DLife system.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Smurf assay</title><p>We investigated intestinal integrity using the Smurf assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Regan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rera et al., 2012</xref>). Experimental flies were grouped in vials (25 flies per vial and 12 replicates per each diet) 2â3 days following eclosion. Following exposure to a choice or fixed diet for 12 days (food was changed every 2â3 days and survivorship of <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> males on choice diet was roughly 70%), flies were transferred to S30 (30%Â [w/v] sucrose) food with 2.5% (w/v) blue dye (FD and C Blue No. 1; Spectrum Chemical) for 24 hr. A fly was counted as a Smurf when blue was observed outside of the digestive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Regan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rera et al., 2012</xref>). The proportion of Smurf flies in each replicate was calculated and used as a single observation for statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Egg laying assays</title><p>Flies were raised according to our standard husbandry protocols (see above), and following eclosion, males and females were allowed to mate on SY10 food for 48â72 hr. Eight females and eight males were then sorted into individual vials, which contained either a choice or a fixed diet. Egg counts were taken on days 1, 2, 5, and 8 after sorting. Flies were transferred to fresh SY food 24 hr prior to the counting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Western blot</title><p>After exposure to the choice or fixed diet for 20 days, experimental flies were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Heads and bodies were separated using a metal sieve on dry ice, and 10 heads were pooled for each biological replicate. Heads were first pulverized to a fine powder using a plastic pestle on dry ice. Protein extraction was carried out on ice using RIPA buffer (SigmaâAldrich) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma), sodium orthovanadate (NEB, 1 mM), and sodium fluoride (NEB, 1 mM). Ice cold buffer (105Âµl)Â was added to heads followed by immediate homogenization with a motorized pestle for 10 s on ice. Lysates were incubated on ice for 10 min followed by 15 s of sonication and centrifugation at 16,000 ÃÂ g at 4Â°C for 10 min. Supernatants were recovered, and protein concentration was determined using the Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Fisher Scientific). Thirty micrograms of protein lysate was added to 2Ã protein sample buffer (1 mM TrisâHCL pH 6.8, 10% sodium dodecyl sulphateÂ [SDS], 1%Â bromophenol blue, and 1M dithiothreitol) and denatured at 95Â°C for 10 min. Protein was separated by SDSâpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 4â12% gel (Bio-Rad) at 200Â V for 30 min, followed by electrophoretic transfer to PVDF membrane at 70Â V for 1 hr. Blots were incubated in 5% milk in 1% TBS-T at room temperature for 1Â hr, followed by overnight incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4Â°C (anti-dS6K gift from Thomas Neufeld; dilution at 1:3500, anti-pS6KThr398 Cell Signaling Technologies, #9209; dilution at 1:1000, anti-GAPDH; dilution 1:6000). Membranes were washed with 1% TBS-T and incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies (Abcam) at room temperature for 4 hr. Membranes were washed again with 1% TBS-T and then incubated briefly in ECL substrate (SuperSignal West Femto, ThermoFisher) before imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Metabolomics analysis</title><p>Male flies were exposed to the choice or fixed diet for 20 days (food was changed every 2â3 days) and then switched to the other diet (experimental groups) or the same diet (control groups). Heads were removed via vortexing and manually separated from the bodies. Heads or bodies were then homogenized for 20 s in 200 Î¼l of a 1:4 (v:v) water:MeOH solvent mixture using the Fast Prep 24 (MP Biomedicals). Following the addition of 800 Î¼l of methanol, the samples were incubated for 30 min on dry ice, then homogenized again. The mixture was spun at 13,000 RPM for 5 min at 4Â°C, and the soluble extract was collected into vials. This extract was then dried in a speedvac at 30Â°C for approximately 3 hr. Using a liquid chromatography triple quadrupole tandem mass spectrometryÂ (LCâQQQâMS) machine in the multiple reaction monitoringÂ (MRM) mode, we targeted 205 metabolites in 25 important metabolic pathways, in both positive MS and negative MS modes.</p><p>After removing any metabolites missing from more than 8 of 76 head samples (10.5%) and 8 of 78 body samples (10.3%), we were left with 103 head metabolites and 125 body metabolites. Metabolite abundance for remaining missing values in this data set were log-transformed and imputed using the <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbor algorithm with the impute package of R Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioconductor.org">http://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>). We then normalized the data to the standard normal distribution (Î¼Â =Â 0, Ï<sup>2</sup>Â =Â 1). PCA was performed using the made4 package of R Bioconductor.</p><p>Our PCA results suggest the choice diet can elicit two processes: (1) a 5-HT2A<italic>-</italic>dependent, fast-responding metabolic network that is associated with aging despite only accounting for a small number of variation in the metabolomes (2.0â2.2%) and (2) a 5-HT2A<italic>-</italic>independent, stable metabolic component that accounts for a significant amount of metabolome variation (10.2â11.2%). To distinguish these two groups of metabolites, we used a linear model to analyze the variance attributed to diet, genotype, and interaction of the two for each metabolite:</p><p>Metabolite abundance (Y) = Diet + Genotype + Diet * Genotype.</p><p>We found 18 of 103 total metabolites in the head and 19 of 125 total metabolites in the body are modulated by choice diet in a 5-HT2A<italic>-</italic>dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, ANOVA, p<sub>Diet*Genotype</sub>â¤0.05). To identify 5-HT2A independent change, we searched for metabolites that have a diet effect (p<sub>Diet</sub>â¤ 0.05) but did not show a dietâgenotype interaction (p<sub>Diet*Genotype</sub>&gt;0.05). In doing so, we found 45 and 46 metabolites in the head and body, respectively. We plotted a heatmap to illustrate the expression changes of the metabolite upon nutrient presentation using the R package gplots. The metabolites were mapped to biochemical pathways using MetaboAnalystR 3.0Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). Because the small number of detectable compounds in our targeted metabolomics panel (NÂ =Â 103 in heads or 125 in bodies) limits the power of the enrichment analysis, candidate pathways were therefore identified as those with the number of hits greater than 3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistics</title><p>Unless otherwise indicated, pairwise comparisons between different treatment survivorship curves (both lifespan and starvation resistance) were carried out using the statistical package R within DLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linford et al., 2013</xref>). pâValues were obtained using logârank test. For testing the interaction between genotypes and diets, we used Cox-regression analysis to report p-value for the interaction term. Mortality rates were calculated using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Partridge et al., 2005</xref>). To test the effects of diet and genotype involved in behavior classification and metabolites, we performed two-way ANOVA (on the square root- or log-transformed values) followed by postÂ hoc significance test. To test for a diet effect on gut integrity, climbing ability, weight, TAG/protein levels, nutrient assumption, andÂ positional preference, we used MannâWhitney UÂ test. Two-tailed p-values were reported unless otherwise mentioned. We designed the layout of individual samples for lifespan, behavior, physiology, and metabolomic analyses, so non-biological factors (e.g. the location of samples) do not contribute to the differences between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source data for all quantifications shown in Data <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, figures supplements, and the supplementary files are provided with the paper.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Lyu et al. present interesting findings that nutritional choice affects organism physiology and lifespan. They provide compelling evidence to support that such effects are not a simple result of altered nutrient consumed. They further implicated the serotonin receptor 5-HT2A in this regulation by the dietary choice. Through metabolomic analysis, they also revealed changes in the TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism. Although reviewers agree the concept of nutritional choice regulating longevity is novel and will be of great interest to the field of aging, they suggested additional data and edits would help strengthen this claim.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The key claim that the observed changes are due to nutritional choice requires additional experiments.</p><p>a) When macronutrients are provided separately, there might be difference in consumption and absorption, contributing to the observed phenotypes. The authors have assayed consumption, showing flies consuming more sugar and the same amount of yeast on the choice diet. But the change in absorption has not been ruled out. The authors should determine whether consumption and/or absorption of each nutrient is altered in the choice diet when compared to mixed diet and perform this comparison in young and middle-aged files. For example, assessment of fecundity and mTOR signaling will help find possible changes in protein intake.</p><p>b) The olfactory perception of yeast can be different between the choice diet and the mixed diet. The previous finding from the lab has revealed the importance of yeast smell on fly lifespan. To rule out the smell of yeast as a confounding factor, the olfactory mutants that are smell blind should be subject to the choice diet.</p><p>2) The mechanistic follow-up of metabolomic analysis is weak. To strengthen this area, the authors should examine whether protein absorption is altered (also mentioned in the point 1) and whether <italic>GDH</italic> RNAi flies eat more under the choice diet.</p><p>3) Linking 5HT2A receptor to the regulation by the choice diet has added mechanistic insight, which needs to be strengthened by provide sufficient rationale for its selection. Are there other receptors screened? Did any additional receptors exhibit potential interactions?</p><p>4) There are many changes in the metabolomic data. What is the rationale for focusing on the TCA cycle intermediates? In addition, all metabolomic data (with statistics) should be shown without cherry-picking.</p><p>5) Statistics should be provided to Figure 2F and G.</p><p>6) Method description should be revised, including nutrient consumption (Figure 2D), Smurf assay for intestinal integrity (adding the missing reference), behavioral analysis (Figure 2F and G).</p><p>7) Additional discussion should be included to address sex specificity and genetic background difference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Lyu et al., present a study in which the main claim is that the choice of different nutrients itself modulates behavior, metabolism and lifespan, rather than AMOUNT of nutrients themselves. The implication of this is that caloric restriction is only one means to modulate metabolism and lifespan; food choice is another. As such, this is an interesting idea. However, several major concerns (see points below) made it unclear whether the observed effects were a true reflection of choice, or of increased sugar consumption. Further, choice of 5HT2A receptor for further study was not seen as a substantial advance, given what is already known. Finally, it was unclear from the data analysis/presentation of the metabolomic data whether TCA cycle changes were the true driver of the observed effects.</p><p>1) In Figure 1, do they have a measure of how much time the flies spend on each nutrient source in the choice diet? Without this, how do you know the flies are actually making a choice? The whole phenotype/effect could be explained by flies dwelling mostly on the sugary food (which they prefer), which the authors have shown to reduce lifespan.</p><p>2) Although the authors show in Figure 1 that intestinal integrity and climbing ability are not compromised in a 2-week period on the choice diet, it would be important to show that these measures are not more compromised than the fixed diet in older flies that have been on the choice diet for longer: 10, 20 and 30 days to assess the true effect of CD-based reduced lifespan.</p><p>3) Are the differences in Figure 2F and G significant? No statistics are provided and the data do not look convincing; correspondingly the conclusion that the diet-dependent changes in locomotion are not causal to changes in lifespan does not seem warranted.</p><p>4) The rationale for choosing 5HT2A mutants is presented as having reduced protein preference in starved female flies, and increased lifespan under dietary choice. However, it is possible that the effects they observe in the present study are an aspect of the same observation (see point 1).</p><p>5) In Figure 3, it is important to show all the PCA data in graphic format, not just those that differed amongst the various conditions.</p><p>6) Many metabolites were altered in the different conditions (Figure 4). What is the rationale for choosing to focus on the TCA cycle intermediates? It appears that there are broader changes to amino acid metabolism. Also, fold changes are not mentioned and cutoffs not given.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting extension of previous work from the Pletcher lab, published in <italic>eLife</italic> (Ro et al., 2016). The concept of nutritional choice impacting organismal physiology and longevity is very interesting.</p><p>The challenge, of course, is to provide irrefutable evidence that it is the âchoiceâ that causes the observed physiological changes. On the whole, the authors have done an admirable job to exclude potential confounding factors. I have, however, some remaining concerns/suggestions for alternative explanations.</p><p>I am happy to leave it to the authors as to whether to attempt to address these concerns with additional experiments and/or to discuss in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>The entire premise of the paper assumes that the observed effects are âlargely independent of nutrients consumedâ. Technically, the authors have done a very good job, when focusing on nutrient consumption.</p><p>However, there could be more to this than just food consumption.</p><p>Is it possible/likely that on the choice diet the flies are absorbing more yeast/protein?

Again, as outlined above, couldn't this reflect elevated protein intake?</p><p>The <italic>GDH</italic> RNAi experiment is very interesting, but, there appears to be little follow up and/or validation. Some suggestions to validate and/or strengthen the claims:</p><p>â Validate that the RNAi line works âas advertisedâ.</p><p>â Do <italic>GDH</italic> RNAi flies also eat more under the choice diet? This would strengthen the claims.</p><p>â Does neuronal RNAi also alter the response?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an important contribution to the field of aging, nutrition and neuroscience. It will be of great interest to the general scientific audience of <italic>eLife</italic> and I am highly supportive of its acceptance for publication.</p><p>In this manuscript, Lyu et al. report that it is how nutrients are presented, or the way that they are eaten, which modulates aging and physiology in the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The authors provide compelling evidence to demonstrate that such effects are independent of the amount of nutrients consumed and that neuronal expression of the serotonin receptor <italic>5-HT2A</italic> is required for metabolic changes induced by dietary choice, which include upregulation of the TCA cycle and amino acid metabolism. Based on global metabolic data they identify and show that one key enzyme in these processes (Glutamate Dehydrogenase) is causal in the effect of diet choice in lifespan.</p><p>The results are intriguing and, together with previously presented data related to the role of 5-HT2A for evaluating protein demand, these discoveries demonstrate that nutrient assessment per se, and/or the feeding choices that result, have significant biological impact on aging. The effects of dietary calories and composition on aging are well-known and highly studied, and it seems reasonable to consider that specific characteristics of each meal, such as the ways in which they are presented (perhaps involving sensory perception) or the pattern in which nutrients are consumed, are important as well. These mechanisms may also be relevant to understanding the effects of different types of fasting/feeding regimes that have experienced a resurgence of interest in research (e.g., Mitchell et al., 2019) and in the general public.</p><p>The data presented in Lyu et al. are extensive, and the authors do an outstanding job of disentangling the confounding effects of behavior, feeding, and lifespan, from dietary presentation. Most importantly, the authors have provide convincing evidence that changes in lifespan in flies given a choice diet are not caused solely by a change in nutrient intake (i.e., an increase in sugar consumption). They make the extraordinary observation that at least for flies and likely many other organisms, there something of great interest occurring in making choices in the environment that is outside of the standard foci of calories or amount consumed. The support for 5-HT2A receptor in this process is absolutely solid, as is the link to specific metabolic changes through metabolic analysis and genetic manipulation. These are all major strengths of the manuscript. The authors speculate that the psychological effect of choice or the act of decision making itself may somehow be costly, and it is these assertions that while perhaps less-well supported, nonetheless follow from their work and are well appropriate for speculation given their strong data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59399.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The key claim that the observed changes are due to nutritional choice requires additional experiments.</p><p>a) When macronutrients are provided separately, there might be difference in consumption and absorption, contributing to the observed phenotypes.

Here, and in the revised manuscript, we hope to assuage the concern about nutrient absorption by adding the fecundity and TOR data per reviewerâs requests. Indeed, neither these two measures indicate effects of dietary choice. In addition, we highlight the weight and total protein data (presented in Figure 1âfigure supplement 3) to discuss the involvement of protein intake. Together, these data support the interpretation that differences in protein intake/absorption is not the cause of lifespan effects of a choice diet.</p><p>âAlthough protein intake was not different in flies fed different diets, it seemed possible that dietary choice improved protein absorption, which might be important considering the influential role of this macronutrient in reducing lifespan (Fontana and Partridge, 2015). [â¦] Furthermore, molecular and physiological markers that are strongly affected by protein availability, including mTOR activity (Fontana and Partridge, 2015) and female fecundity (Jensen et al., 2015) were not altered by dietary choice (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3).â</p><p>The process and effects of sugar absorption are, however, less clear than that of protein. While of interest, we believe that they are beyond the current scope of the manuscript considering the evidence that lifespan is distinct from molecular and physiological mechanisms of sugar effects, whether they be due to differences in sugar consumption or absorption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The olfactory perception of yeast can be different between the choice diet and the mixed diet.

Our goal in the manuscript was to expand our understanding of the behavioral, physiological and aging effects of the choice diet, to determine the extent to which this effect was present in males, and to study the underlying mechanisms at play in this pathway. Loss of function in other serotonin receptors had no influence on protein preference (Ro et al., 2016), however it remains to be tested whether they might influence the aging processes in a choice environment through unknown mechanisms. We have revised text to the manuscript that clarifies this:</p><p>âPreviously we hypothesized that neuronal mechanisms involved in nutrient evaluation might influence lifespan when macronutrients are presented separately (Ro et al., 2016).

It is possible that mechanisms of nutrient perception or that cell-nonautonomous effects of perceived protein reward underlie the mechanisms through which lifespan is affected, and if so, that would be a significant advance. Similarly, we document 5-HT2A-dependent metabolic changes in response to dietary choice, among which Î±KG seems to be causal for effects on lifespan.

I have, however, some remaining concerns/suggestions for alternative explanations.</p><p>I am happy to leave it to the authors as to whether to attempt to address these concerns with additional experiments and/or to discuss in the manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>The entire premise of the paper assumes that the observed effects are âlargely independent of nutrients consumedâ. Technically, the authors have done a very good job, when focusing on nutrient consumption.</p><p>However, there could be more to this than just food consumption.</p><p>Is it possible/likely that on the choice diet the flies are absorbing more yeast/protein?

If so, could this be a confounding factor?</p><p>Two suggestions to investigate this hypothesis:</p><p>1) Assay fecundity, which is linked to protein intake in flies in choice vs. fixed diet</p><p>2) Assay TOR signaling which is also linked to protein intake</p><p>3) Examine olfactory mutants (smell blind)</p><p>If the authors could demonstrate no difference in these parameters, it would strengthen the claims of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the insights and critiques provided by this reviewer, particularly those focused on protein sensing and absorption in the dietary choice effects, as we recognize that many uncharacterized features of diets may modulate aging. We have worked hard during difficult times in the lab to add data from new experiments that address these issues in the revised manuscript:</p><p>a) Specifically, three new experiments provide insight into the point about the possibility of diet-dependent protein absorption. Briefly, we measured fecundity and TOR activity (based on phosphorylation status of S6K) and neither measure indicated an effect of dietary choice. Furthermore, total protein in the fly was also not affected by protein choice (nor was weight), which also indicates that, given similar amounts of protein intake, protein absorption/utilization is not different between diets. The manuscript has been revised accordingly (Results).</p><p>b) This reviewer raised an interesting point that the choice effects could be the result of âpairingâ different nutrients/foods. We find this (and other effects of patterning in feeding) to be very intriguing, and to our knowledge, it is largely unknown how flies adjust feeding behaviors in complex environments (but see Ahn et al., 2011). We believe that the choice diet paradigm (and modifications to it) provides an excellent opportunity to investigate such mechanisms in the future. For now, we are happy to include this possibility in the Discussion, as show below:</p><p>âFlies housed in a choice environment, for example, are allowed to interact with each macronutrient individually, and this behavior would be expected to result in the sequential activation of sugar and protein sensing pathways. [â¦] The perceived flavor of each macronutrient may be different when yeast and sugar are consumed separately compared to when they are paired together on a fixed diet (Ahn et al., 2011), and that may also influence lifespan and metabolism (Ostojic et al., 2014).â</p><p>c) We agree that this would be a good experiment test the role of sensory perception in dietary choice effects. While the characterization of sensory requirements is complex and is well beyond the focus of a single manuscript (e.g., if you canât smell or taste the food can you extract reward from it?), our current ongoing experiments clearly indicate that it is not simply a more odorant rich environment that is reducing lifespan upon dietary choice. This experiment is on-going, although the results are clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We will be willing to include the final data in a final version of the manuscript if the editors and reviewers feel it is an essential. Indeed, a more complete investigation of external and internal sensory mechanisms, together with patterned feeding, is a likely next step, although, we believe, outside the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2:</p><p>Figure 2A-E is w<sup>1118</sup> really an appropriate control?

We chose in this instance to use extensive backcrossing of <italic>5-HT2A</italic> mutants (ten generations; as described in the Materials and methods) together with background-independent RNAi. Precise excision (together with backcrossing) is also a reasonable approach, which we chose not to pursue. The primary reason for this is the potential for unintended genetic effects of excision and the time and effort required to achieve it. We felt the two manipulations described above provided strong inference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Not surprisingly, different genotypes appear to have varying degrees of reduced longevity in response to the âchoice foodâ.

In <italic>Drosophila</italic> to name a few, 5-HT2A is involved in circadian rhythms (Nichols et al., 2006), walking (Howard et al., 2019), feeding (as shown in this paper, Gasque et al., 2013 and Ro et al., 2016), and sensory perception of dead conspecifics (Chakraborty et al., 2019). All of these effects could potentially contribute to its lifespan effect on a fixed diet. We have added some discussion of this to the revision.</p><p>âMutant flies were modestly short-lived on the standard, fixed diet, which is likely due to the pleotropic effects of this receptor (Gasque et al., 2013; Chakraborty et al., 2019; Howard et al., 2019).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The metabolic data presented (Figures 4 and 5) are interesting, but, there is little in terms of mechanistic understanding provided.</p><p>It is interesting that amino acid metabolism is upregulated in response to the choice diet. Again, as outlined above, couldn't this reflect elevated protein intake?</p></disp-quote><p>As related to our responses to the point #1, there is no evidence showing that flies on a choice diet have elevated protein intake. The upregulation of amino acid metabolism therefore seems to reflect differences in the way that a fixed amount of amino acids are metabolized (also see our response to reviewer #1, point #6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The <italic>GDH</italic> RNAi experiment is very interesting, but, there appears to be little follow up and/or validation.

We interpret this as implying that this particular pathway is subject to complex regulatory mechanisms (Smith et al., 2019). Indeed, our results simply provide one direction forward in identifying specific molecules that are responsible for the aging effect, which we believe is a significant advance. Given the difficulty of laboratory work, we would argue that detailed molecular analyses of multiple components of this pathway are beyond the scope of the current contribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Do <italic>GDH</italic> RNAi flies also eat more under the choice diet?
