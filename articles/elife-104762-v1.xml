There is mounting evidence that intercropping can increase insect biodiversity while maintaining or increasing yield. Yet, intercropping is often considered impractical for mechanized farming systems. Strip cropping is a type of intercropping that is compatible with standard farm machinery and has been pioneered by Dutch farmers since 2014. Here, we present ground beetle data from four organically managed experimental farms across four years. Ground beetles are sensitive to changes in habitats and disturbances, and hold keystone positions in agroecosystem food webs. We show that strip cropping systems can enhance ground beetle biodiversity, while other studies showed that these increases have been achieved without incurring major yield loss. Strip-cropped fields had on average 15% more ground beetle species and 30% more individuals than monocultural fields. The higher ground beetle richness in strip crops was explained by the merger of crop-related ground beetle communities, rather than by ground beetle species unique to strip cropping systems. The increase in field-level beetle species richness in organic agriculture through strip cropping approached increases found for other readily deployed biodiversity conservation methods, like shifting from conventional to organic agriculture (+19% –+23%). This indicates that strip cropping is a potentially useful tool supporting ground beetle biodiversity in agricultural fields without compromising food production.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Insects are the largest and most diverse group of animals, comprising approximately 80% of all animal species. They inhabit nearly every place on Earth and play important and varied roles in ecosystems, from serving as a food source for other animals and as recyclers of organic matter and nutrients, to acting as crop pollinators and pest controllers.</p><p>Sadly, insect biodiversity is declining worldwide, with agriculture being a major contributor to this decline. For example, monoculture farming is a common form of farming where only one crop species is grown at a time, providing limited habitats and food resources for insects. By cultivating a diversity of crops in narrow, alternating strips, a technique known as strip cropping, farmers might make fields more suitable for insects, without reducing crop yield and productivity. However, so far, it was unknown if strip cropping can indeed increase insect biodiversity.</p><p>Croijmans et al. set out to investigate whether strip cropping can increase the biodiversity of ground beetles. Ground beetles play a key role in agricultural ecosystems, preying on common insect pests and weeds. They are sensitive to changes in farming practices and are often used as an indicator of agricultural sustainability. For this purpose, the researchers analysed four years of data from four organically managed experimental farms in the Netherlands, which included a diverse set of crops.</p><p>Croijmans et al. found that strip-cropped fields have more beetle species and more individual beetles than monocultures. As different ground beetle communities have natural preferences for specific crops, it is thought that the higher number of ground beetle species in strip-cropped fields is mostly due to the combination of two crop-related communities, rather than species unique to strip cropping. For example, if cabbage is strip-cropped with wheat, one would mostly find the ground beetle species corresponding to both cabbage and wheat, but few additional species. Interestingly, some ground beetle species preferred strip-cropped fields, while others preferred monocultures.</p><p>In conclusion, strip cropping can be a strategy to increase ground beetle biodiversity without losses to crop production. Therefore, farmers wanting to increase biodiversity might consider this approach instead of standard monocultures. Many biodiversity-increasing measures, such as flower strips or hedgerows, take up land that might otherwise be used for crop production. Strip cropping allows a more biodiverse field while keeping all land in production, making it a biodiversity measure that enables farmers to maintain the same level of crop production.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>carabidae</kwd><kwd>intercropping</kwd><kwd>organic agriculture</kwd><kwd>crop diversification</kwd><kwd>agroecosystem</kwd><kwd>community ecology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>727482</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Apeldoorn</surname><given-names>Dirk F</given-names></name><name><surname>Rossing</surname><given-names>Walter AH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00k4n6c32</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>727672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Apeldoorn</surname><given-names>Dirk F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Public Private Partnership</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LWV19129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Apeldoorn</surname><given-names>Dirk F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03b1hdw57</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KB36003003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuperus</surname><given-names>Fogelina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04jsz6e67</institution-id><institution>Dutch Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWA.1389.20.160</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cuperus</surname><given-names>Fogelina</given-names></name><name><surname>Poelman</surname><given-names>Erik H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Strip cropping is a farm management practice that increases ground beetle diversity without major effects on crop yield and while being practically implementable.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Insects account for 80% of the animal species in the world and, therefore, the recently reported unprecedented rate of insect decline is cause for alarm about the state of biodiversity on Earth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Klink et al., 2020</xref>). An array of biodiversity metrics provides strong evidence for declines of especially terrestrial insects across all continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">van Klink et al., 2020</xref>). This includes declines in abundance of both common and rare species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hallmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pilotto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Seibold et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Klink et al., 2024</xref>) and in total species richness and changes in assembly composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blowes et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>). Insects are essential for crop production through their role in decomposition, pollination, pest control, and sustaining food webs. Therefore, erosion of insect communities can have potentially devastating effects on ecosystem functioning, provision of ecosystem services, and ultimately on human civilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dirzo et al., 2014</xref>). The main drivers of insect biodiversity decline are habitat loss due to conversion to agriculture, pollution, invasive species, and climate change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Díaz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Müller et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wagner et al., 2021</xref>). Strategies for biodiversity conservation in conjunction with adequate food production require understanding of how biodiversity responds to agricultural management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cozim-Melges et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mupepele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders, 2020</xref>). Ideally, sustainable agricultural practices retain yield and enhance biodiversity, preventing the need to convert natural habitats to agricultural land to maintain food production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tscharntke et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Increasing crop heterogeneity can facilitate biodiversity conservation in highly productive agricultural landscapes without compromising yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin Guay et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sirami et al., 2019</xref>). Crop diversification can enhance niche complementarity by creating heterogeneous habitats and increasing availability and diversity of resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tamburini et al., 2020</xref>). A promising crop diversification strategy is strip cropping, where crops are grown in alternating strips, wide enough for using standard agricultural machines yet narrow enough to facilitate ecological interactions among crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ditzler et al., 2021</xref>). Crops that are grown in strips may benefit from increased resource use efficiency and the suppression of pests and diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Croijmans et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karssemeijer et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rakotomalala et al., 2023</xref>) without major yield compromises (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campanelli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juventia and van Apeldoorn, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Oort et al., 2020</xref>). Growing multiple crops on a field may foster a larger diversity of organisms than monocultures through greater plant species richness that cascades into richer herbivore and predator communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crutsinger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuperus et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the expected increase in available and potentially complementary niches within the agricultural field due to higher spatial diversity in crops can result in admixture of communities related to individual crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hummel et al., 2012</xref>), or the creation of completely new communities by enhanced richness of agriculture-related species, and/or the occurrence of species rarely found in agricultural fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rischen et al., 2021</xref>). So far, it is not well understood if and how insect communities respond to strip cropping across distinct crops.</p><p>Here, we present data of 4 years of pitfall trapping of ground beetles at several moments during the growing season in 14 crops at four organic experimental farms across the Netherlands where strip cropping was compared to monocultures. Ground beetle communities are sensitive to changes in farming practices and are frequently used to examine agricultural sustainability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holland and Luff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Makwela et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turin, 2022</xref>). Furthermore, ground beetle species are important for maintaining ecological functions as they comprise scavengers and predators of (weed) seeds, detritivores (e.g., collembolas and earthworms), and herbivores (e.g., aphids and caterpillars). We first examine whether strip cropping fields have greater ground beetle activity density, species richness, evenness, and diversity than monocultural fields. We also test for 12 abundant ground beetle genera whether their activity density is higher in strip cropping than in monocultures. Lastly, we evaluate whether ground beetle community changes are caused by admixture of communities, whether these assemblages promote species associated with agricultural or with natural ecosystems, and whether they contain rare species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A total of 48,108 ground beetles belonging to 71 species were caught using pitfall traps over 4 years at four different organically managed experimental farms in The Netherlands: 40,153 at Almere; 3777 at Lelystad; 1126 at Valthermond; and 3052 at Wageningen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2">Supplementary file 1 and 2</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Strip cropping enhances ground beetle richness</title><p>Strip cropping fields had on average 15% higher ground beetle taxonomic richness than monoculture fields after rarefaction to the number of samples of the least-sampled crop configuration (β<sub>0</sub>=0.151, SE = 0.044, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>).

This latter species was found most often in a wheat monoculture, but this was likely due to a failed crop which created a very open habitat. <italic>H. signaticornis</italic> is known to inhabit recently disturbed, dry, open habitats with limited vegetation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Turin et al., 2012</xref>), a situation similar to this sparsely covered monoculture.

Our study shows that strip cropping increased field-level ground beetle richness by 15%. However, ground beetle communities within the same crop in a strip or in monoculture were mostly similar. This indicates that the 15% increase in richness at the field level can be mostly attributed to the higher number of crops in strip-cropped fields that harbored crop-related ground beetle communities, and that there was only limited mixing of ground beetle species among crops in strip crops. This is in line with earlier findings that ground beetle movement is reduced by crop edges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allema et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2024</xref>). Further research on movement behaviors of ground beetles at crop edges might help explain how ground beetles distribute themselves within a strip cropping field, and whether they utilize the different resources provided by a more diverse cropping system.</p><p>The 30% higher ground beetle activity density in strip cropping fields compared to monoculture fields may be explained by a more stable and diverse habitat with refuges and alternative resources in strip crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ratnadass et al., 2012</xref>). Crop diversification enhances prey biomass for ground beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>) and increases weed seed richness as compared to monocultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ditzler et al., 2023</xref>), both of which reduce bottom-up control by increased food provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carbonne et al., 2022</xref>). Alternatively, the increase in activity density might be caused by higher movement of ground beetles, which in turn can be the consequence of food starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallin and Ekbom, 1994</xref>). Indeed, several papers show reduced abundances of herbivorous insects in strip- and intercropping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alarcón‐Segura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuperus et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rakotomalala et al., 2023</xref>), which may be potential prey for ground beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turin, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, strip cropping systems may support high herbivore reproduction in combination with a high predation pressure resulting in herbivore populations dominated by early life stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karssemeijer et al., 2024</xref>). Therefore, strip cropping may favor ground beetles that predate on, for instance, herbivore eggs, such as <italic>Bembidion</italic> spp. and <italic>Anchomenus dorsalis</italic>, which were more abundant in strip cropping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Finch, 1996</xref>), and disadvantaging ground beetles that feed on larger prey, such as <italic>Pterostichus melanarius,</italic> which was less abundant in strip cropping. Multi-taxa evaluation of future strip cropping studies will be a valuable approach to increase understanding of biomass flows and trophic interactions within diverse agricultural systems.</p><p>The 15% increase in ground beetle species richness through strip cropping is mostly caused by an increase in species (relatively) common to agricultural fields, rather than an increase in rare species or species otherwise common in other habitat types. A keystone species here might be <italic>P. melanarius</italic>, the most common <italic>Pterostichus</italic> species in our samples. <italic>P. melanarius</italic> can be very dominant in pitfall traps, as we regularly found hundreds of individuals per trap. This relatively large ground beetle might compete with or predate on other ground beetle species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roubinet et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>P. melanarius</italic> is especially well-adapted to highly intensive agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turin, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Turin, 2000</xref>), which explains why it was more abundant in monocultures previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ditzler et al., 2021</xref>). In turn, the reduced <italic>P. melanarius</italic> populations in strip cropping might allow other species to persist, such as <italic>Harpalus</italic> spp. and <italic>A. dorsalis</italic>. Therefore, strip cropping might facilitate ground beetle biodiversity by reducing the dominance of a common, competitive species.</p><p>Biodiversity gains in our study did in most cases not coincide with productivity losses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Earlier studies on crop yield in the strip cropping fields in Lelystad and Wageningen during the years of pitfall trapping show a yield decrease when strip cropping cabbage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo-Reche et al., 2023</xref>) and wheat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ditzler et al., 2023</xref>), whereas potato yield was unaffected by crop configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ditzler et al., 2023</xref>). In Almere, bean and parsnip yields were higher in strip cropping, whereas oat and onion yields were lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juventia and van Apeldoorn, 2024</xref>). In Valthermond, crop productivity was similar for monocultures and strip cropping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Therefore, biodiversity gains through strip cropping do not compromise agricultural production.</p><p>We show that changing crop configuration from monoculture to strip cropping, on average, enhances ground beetle richness by 15% and activity density by 30% within agricultural fields. These results show that strip cropping can lead to increases in biodiversity that approach those achieved by shifting from conventional to organic farming practices (+19% richness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; +23% richness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2022</xref>) and by other in-field diversification measures, like hedgerows and flower strips (+23% richness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>; +24% richness, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beillouin et al., 2021</xref>). While organic management or in-field diversification measures generally lead to lower productivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2022</xref>), strip cropping can maintain crop productivity without taking land out of production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campanelli et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Juventia and van Apeldoorn, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Oort et al., 2020</xref>), although occasional yield reductions have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrillo-Reche et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ditzler et al., 2023</xref>). The biodiversity gain in our study was achieved without additional crop-level diversification strategies designed for biodiversity conservation, such as cover cropping or (flowering) companion plants. This increase in biodiversity stacks on top of already higher biodiversity achieved through organic management (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lichtenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the estimated richness effects of strip cropping, that is, no change at crop level and 15% increase at field level, are conservative because they only consider the pairwise comparison of biodiversity of two or three crops in a strip cropping configuration to monocultures, whereas the inclusion of more crops within strip cropping could further enhance ground beetle biodiversity. Also, the effect of strip cropping on ground beetle biodiversity might be more pronounced in conventional agriculture and at larger field sizes, as the relatively small-scale, organic fields that we studied might have already had a relatively high ground beetle biodiversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tscharntke et al., 2021</xref>). The ground beetle communities in our study were dominated by farmland and eurytopic species and contained only two rare species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turin, 2022</xref>). Future research could test whether the inclusion of other in-field diversification measures within strip-cropped fields, such as the establishment of perennial semi-natural habitats (SNHs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rischen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sirami et al., 2019</xref>) or uptake at larger spatial extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tscharntke et al., 2021</xref>) would allow ground beetles with other habitat preferences to establish in agricultural fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study area</title><p>A multi-location study was conducted on four organic farms across the Netherlands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

At Almere, eight different crops were grown in alternating strips of 6 m width, including celeriac (<italic>Apium graveolens</italic> var. <italic>rapaceum</italic>), broccoli (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var. <italic>italic</italic>), oat (<italic>Avena sativa</italic>), onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>), parsnip (<italic>Pastinaca sativa</italic>), faba bean (<italic>Vicia faba</italic>), potato (<italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>), and a mix of ryegrass and white clover referred to as grass-clover (<italic>Lolium perenne/Trifolium repens</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>). At Lelystad, four different crop pairs were grown in alternating strips of 3 m width, including carrot (<italic>Daucus carota</italic> subsp<italic>. sativus</italic>) and onion, white cabbage (<italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> var<italic>. capitata</italic>) and wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>), sugar beet (<italic>Beta vulgaris</italic>) and barley (<italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic>), and potato and ryegrass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">8</xref>). At Valthermond, eight different crops were grown in alternating strips of 6 m width, including potato, barley, barley mixed with broad bean (<italic>V. faba</italic>) in 2020, barley mixed with pea (<italic>Pisum sativum</italic>) in 2021, sweet corn (<italic>Zea mays convar. saccharata</italic> var<italic>. rugosa</italic>), sugar beet, common bean (<italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>), and grass-clover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplements 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s10">10</xref>). At Wageningen, three different crop pairs were grown in alternating strips of 3 m width, including white cabbage and wheat (2019–2021) or oat (2022), barley and pumpkin (<italic>Cucurbita maxima</italic>, 2020–2022) or bare soil due to crop failure (2019), and potato and ryegrass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s11">Figure 1—figure supplements 11</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s14">14</xref>). The crop combinations and neighbors were selected based on literature, expert knowledge, and experience of functionality in terms of expected advantages for yield and pest and disease control. Large-scale monoculture plots (0.25–2.30 ha) served as reference, hereafter referred to as monoculture. At Lelystad, Valthermond, and Wageningen, not each crop grown in strips was present as monoculture in each year, but only those crops for which a monoculture was present were sampled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). All fields were managed according to organic regulations, yet at each location fertilization and weed management reflected regional practices and were adjusted to local soil conditions. Flower strips were sown within the experimental fields at Almere and Valthermond (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Sampling</title><p>The ground beetle community was sampled using pitfall traps in all crops for which both a monoculture and strip cropping field were present, at each location and in multiple rounds per year between March and September. The sampled crops, number of rounds, and number of pitfalls differed per year and per location (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). Pitfall traps consisted of a transparent plastic cup (9.2 cm diameter, 14 cm height) placed in the soil so the top of the cup was flush with the soil surface. We did not use funnels inside the cups. Pitfalls were filled with approximately 100 ml water mixed with non-perfumed soap (around 3 cm high water level) and covered with a black plastic rain guard (12.5 cm diameter) around 2–5 cm above the soil surface. Pitfall traps were placed in the center of a strip (1.5–3 m from the edges of the strip), and at least 10 m from field edges at fixed locations at different moments in a year. Furthermore, traps were mostly placed at equal distances from the field edges in strip-cropped and monocultural fields. At Almere and Valthermond, the number of pitfalls in monocultures and strip cropping was the same. At Wageningen and Lelystad, the number of pitfalls in strip-cropped fields was usually lower than in the monoculture because the area of the strips was only half of that of the monocultures.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Ground beetle identification</title><p>Ground beetles were identified up to species level for Almere in 2021 and 2022, Lelystad and Wageningen. At Almere in 2020, identification was kept at the genus level due to an extremely high abundance of <italic>P. melanarius/niger</italic> and <italic>Poecilus cupreus/versicolor</italic>, and the associated high time investment for identification. At Valthermond, due to labor constraints, we chose to consider species that are complicated to distinguish only up to genus level (like <italic>P. cupreus/versicolor</italic>, <italic>Harpalus</italic> spp. other than <italic>H. rufipes</italic> and <italic>H. affinis</italic>, <italic>Bembidion</italic> spp.). For all analyses, year series were made, in which all ground beetle catches from the same pitfall trap were pooled per year. We examined habitat preferences of ground beetle using <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Turin, 2022</xref> and ground beetle rarity using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://waarneming.nl/">https://waarneming.nl/</ext-link> (checked on January 15, 2025).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>We used R, version 4.2.2, for all statistical analyses.</p><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Effect of crop configuration on field-level richness and activity density</title><p>To analyze the difference in species richness and activity density between monocultures and strip cropping configurations at field level, we used rarefaction of samples within the same field. To rarify to an equal sampling intensity, we calculated the average cumulative number of species or individuals within x year series, where x is the largest number of year series available for the crop configuration comparison (correcting for unequal sampling between monocultures and strip cropping, or for missing samples). Next, we calculated the relative change due to strip cropping by subtracting the number of species or individuals found in the monoculture field from the number found in the strip cropping field and then dividing the result by the number of species or individuals in the monoculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zou et al., 2020</xref>). This gave the relative change centered around zero, where negative values indicated higher richness in monocultures and positive values higher richness in strip cropping. We then analyzed this data using generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) with a Gaussian distribution and assessed whether the intercept deviated significantly from zero. As random variables, we used location and year, with year nested in location. We ran these analyses using a dataset that included all comparisons among monocultural fields and strip cropping fields of all locations. However, as in this case the strip-cropped field was compared with both monocultural fields of the corresponding crop pair, we also tested the effect of field-level richness using only one monoculture per strip-cropped field. To obtain a conservative estimate of the effect of strip cropping, we chose the monocultural fields with the highest taxonomic richness or activity density among the constitutive crops of the strip cropping fields. Generalized linear models (GLMs) were run using the glmmTMB package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooks et al., 2017</xref>) and tested for model fit using the DHARMa package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>Effect of crop configuration on crop-level biodiversity</title><p>To quantify biodiversity we used five variables: (1) activity density, the total number of ground beetles found per year series; (2) taxonomic richness, the total number of species or genera (lowest taxonomic level available) found per year series; (3) the inverse Simpson index, the inverse of the sum of proportions of different species over the total abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simpson, 1949</xref>); (4) absolute evenness, the number of effective species calculated by dividing the inverse Simpson index by the taxonomic richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Williams, 1964</xref>); and (5) Shannon entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shannon and Weaver, 1949</xref>). We chose absolute evenness as our measure for evenness as this method removes the richness component from the inverse Simpson index and adheres to all requirements for an evenness index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith and Wilson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tuomisto, 2012</xref>). We included both the inverse Simpson index and Shannon entropy as the former is more sensitive to changes in evenness and the latter to species richness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeJong, 1975</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the effect of crop configuration on total ground beetle activity density, taxonomic richness, evenness, inverse Simpson index, and Shannon entropy, we used GLMM. We constructed models for each response variable, using data from all four locations. In these models, we included crop configuration (monoculture or strip cropping) as a fixed factor. We included location, year, and crop as nested random variables in these models, with crop nested in year and year in location. To quantify and visualize the variation in responses between locations, years, and crops, we ran GLMs with a variable that combined these three variables into one, which was also included as a fixed factor. Here, we also included the interaction between crop configuration and the combined variable for crop, location, and year. For the model on activity density, we used the negative binomial distribution (log link function), as this was count data; for richness, evenness, and Shannon entropy, we used Gaussian distribution; and for the inverse Simpson index, we used a gamma distribution (inverse link function) as a Gaussian distribution did not fit well. We used the ‘DHARMa’ package to validate model assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hartig, 2018</xref>). We used estimated marginal means to assess differences between monoculture and strip cropping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hothorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenth, 2018</xref>).</p><p>To analyze the effect of crop configuration on the activity density of the 12 most common ground beetle genera, we used GLMMs with negative binomial distribution. Fixed effects were crop configuration, location, and their interactions, and crop nested in year was added as a random effect. As certain genera only occurred at specific locations, we only included locations where the genus was found. All models were tested for model fit using the DHARMa package. We used estimated marginal means to assess differences between monoculture and strip cropping.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-3"><title>Community composition of crop configurations and crops</title><p>To assess whether crop configurations have distinct ground beetle communities, we used permanova with a Hellinger transformation (with 999 permutations) using the ‘vegan’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oksanen et al., 2013</xref>). We used a Hellinger transformation to give more weight to rarer species, thus accounting for highly abundant species in some samples (such as <italic>P. melanarius</italic> and <italic>H. rufipes</italic>). We only included species that occurred in at least 3% of the pitfall samples to avoid strong influence of very rare species. We used data from locations and years where pitfall catches had been identified to species level (Almere 2021/22, Lelystad and Wageningen). We considered four models, one for all locations combined and one for each location separately. In all models, we included crop configuration and the nested variables of location (whenever applicable), year, and crop as fixed factors. We also analyzed the interaction between crop configuration and this nested structure of location, year, and crop. To visualize these results, we used non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) on Hellinger transformed data. To show whether crop configurations have distinct ground beetle communities, we used redundancy analysis (RDA) on Hellinger transformed data. Here, we again conducted four analyses, one for all locations combined and one for each of the three considered locations. We only used crop configuration as a predictor to force RDA to show any change in ground beetle community associated with crop configuration. As such, only one RDA axis was created per model, which was plotted against the first principal component describing the residual variation.</p><p>Due to the large influence of location and year on ground beetle communities, visualizing any general effects of strip cropping on these communities using all available data was challenging. To address this, we conducted RDA and visualized the effect of crop configuration on a subset of the data from one location and one year. We chose the data from Wageningen in 2021 and 2022 for this analysis because it provided a set-up where strip cropping of two crops could be compared with their constituent monocultures within the same experimental fields. Here, we used both crop configuration, crop, and their interaction term as explanatory variables for each crop pair separately. To analyze whether ground beetle communities significantly differed among combinations of crops and crop configurations, we ran pairwise permanova on all three fields and two years separately using the ‘pairwiseAdonis’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martinez, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>All ground beetle species found among the four locations, and their species codes as used in several figure supplements.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-104762-supp1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Total number of ground beetles caught per species (or genus), per location.</title><p>The number of year series is given per location in brackets.

Moreover, after the first round of reviews, the authors have done a great job at rewriting the paper to make it less overstated, more relevant to the data at hand and more solid in the findings. Many of the weaknesses noted in the first review have been dealt with. The overall structure of the paper is good, with a clear introduction, hypotheses, results section and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this positive feedback. We are glad that our extensive revision after extensive review from three reviewers has paid off in addressing earlier weakness of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The weaknesses that remain are mainly due to a difficult dataset and choices that could have stressed certain aspects more, like the relationship between strip cropping and intercropping. The mechanistic understanding of strip cropping is what is at stake here. Does strip cropping behave similar to intercropping, a technique which has been proven to be beneficial to biodiversity because of added effects due to increased resource efficiency and greater plant species richness.</p><p>Unfortunately, the authors do not go into this in the introduction or otherwise and simply state that they consider strip cropping a form of intercropping.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a mechanistic understanding on how intercropping and strip cropping differ would be very interesting. However, we also feel that this topic is somewhat beyond the scope of the current manuscript. We are already planning work to elucidate mechanisms that may explain the pest and suppressive effects of strip cropping.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also do not like the exclusive focus on percentages, as these are dimensionless. I think more could have been done to show underlying structure in the data, even after rarefaction.</p></disp-quote><p>While we generally agree with this point raised by the reviewer, for our heterogeneous dataset it was difficult to come up with meaningful units with dimensions. Therefore, we believe that percentages are the most suitable approach to present readers a fair comparison of the treatments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A further weakness is a limited embedding into the larger scientific discourses other than providing references. But this may be a matter of style and/or taste</p></disp-quote><p>We believe our manuscript to be well-embedded within the relevant scientific discourse, but as indicated by reviewer 3 this might indeed be a matter of style/taste. Without exact examples it is difficult for us to judge this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestion for title: &quot;Strip cropping shows promising preliminary increases in ground beetle community diversity compared to monocultures&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the title could indeed be nuanced. We incorporated the suggested title, except for the word “preliminary”, as we felt that this is slightly misplaced for a 4-year study conducted at 4 locations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>line 26: the word previous may be confusing to readers, as it suggests previous research on beetles or insects. I think it would be better to use for instance &quot;related&quot; or &quot;productivity focused research&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this wording might be confusing, and changed it to “other studies showed”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 84-85: this is vague. can you make explicit what you are trying to answer here?</p></disp-quote><p>We made “biodiversity metric changes” more explicit, and changed the sentence accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 88-89: I think this would fit better with the first question in line 83-84, so I suggest placing it upwards. Also, I think you mean abundant instead of common. Common suggests commonness in the entire population. Abundant suggests found often in this study. While these definitions may very much overlap, they are distinctly different.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved this sentence up and changed “common” to “abundant”. To make the result section more in line with this section, we also moved the section on the relationship between crop configuration and abundant genera up.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 146: defining rareness of species should be in the methods section. Also &quot;following&quot; would be better than &quot;according&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We now added a sentence on how we examine habitat preferences and rarity in the methods section (line 316-317). We also changed “according to” to “following”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 291: it is called being &quot;flush&quot; with the soil surface. This expression is not much used by non-native speakers, but is regularly encountered in studies on pitfalls, so the authors could decide to change the sentence using the proper English vernacular.</p></disp-quote><p>Suggestion incorporated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 322-327, this method could do with a reference</p></disp-quote><p>This method is a relatively standard calculation to calculate relative changes and to center variation around zero. Nevertheless, we added a reference to a paper that used the same method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line: 333-335. I would still like to see a reference for this method.</p></disp-quote><p>This methodology has not been described in literature to the best of our knowledge. As we compared two crops within strip cropping with their respective monoculture references, we compare one strip cropping field with two monocultural fields. Here we took a conservative approach by comparing the strip crop field with the monoculture with the highest richness and activity density, to see if strip cropped fields outperformed monocultures with diverse ground beetle communities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 364-366. references?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added references for these R packages.</p></body></sub-article></article>
