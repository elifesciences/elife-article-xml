Here, we use chemical inhibitors targeting discrete steps of translation to compare how lowering the concentration of all or only translation initiation-dependent proteins rescues <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> from proteotoxic stress. We systematically challenge proteostasis and show that pharmacologically inhibiting translation initiation or elongation elicits a distinct protective profile. Inhibiting elongation protects from heat and proteasome dysfunction independently from HSF-1 but does not protect from age-associated protein aggregation. Conversely, inhibition of initiation protects from heat and age-associated protein aggregation and increases lifespan, dependent on <italic>hsf-1</italic>, but does not protect from proteotoxicity caused by proteasome dysfunction. Surprisingly, we find that the ability of the translation initiation machinery to control the concentration of newly synthesized proteins depends on HSF-1. Inhibition of translation initiation in wild-type animals reduces the concentration of newly synthesized proteins but increases it in <italic>hsf-1</italic> mutants. Our findings suggest that the HSF-1 pathway is not only a downstream target of translation but also directly cooperates with the translation initiation machinery to control the concentration of newly synthesized proteins to restore proteostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>protein folding</kwd><kwd>mRNA translation</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS107951</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrascheck</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG067331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrascheck</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Glenn Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrascheck</surname><given-names>Michael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dorris Neuroscience Scholar Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clay</surname><given-names>Khalyd J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Carefully controlling the level of protein synthesis reduction and mode of translation inhibitor action reveal different and sometimes opposing phenotypic effects following proteostasis stress, wherein protection via initiation inhibition specifically depends on heat shock factor 1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein synthesis is a highly regulated process involving the precise orchestration of many chaperones, co-factors, enzymes, and biomolecular building blocks. It is critical at every level of the life cycle, from development through aging, and is central to stress adaptation. Protein synthesis largely determines the folding load on the proteostasis network, which regulates protein production, folding, trafficking, and degradation to maintain a functional proteome. The imbalance of the proteostasis network caused by age-associated stress or acute environmental insults leads to misfolding of proteins, accumulation of aggregates, and eventually to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balch et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A substantial body of work has revealed that the protein synthesis machinery directly participates in protein folding or aggregation. For example, in mice, point mutations in specific tRNAs or components of the ribosomal quality control pathway can lead to protein aggregation and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yonashiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nollen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nedialkova and Leidel, 2015</xref>). Similarly, early RNAi screens in the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> identified several ribosomal subunits whose knockdown increased the aggregation of polyglutamine (PolyQ) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nollen et al., 2004</xref>). These findings highlight the importance of translation in protein misfolding.</p><p>However, subsequent studies reveal a more intricate role of translation in protein aggregation. Depending on how translation is modulated, it leads to either decreased or increased protein aggregation. For example, RNAi-mediated knockdown of translation initiation factors increases lifespan, improves proteostasis, and reduces protein aggregation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McQuary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howard et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, work in yeast and cell culture shows that pharmacological inhibition of translation prior to a heat shock prevents proteins from aggregating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Medicherla and Goldberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choe et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Riback et al., 2017</xref>). While studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, cell culture, and yeast agree that inhibition of translation reduces protein aggregation, their proposed underlying mechanisms differ. Overall, the proposed mechanisms can be categorized into two broad models on how lowering translation reduces protein aggregation.</p><p>The first model, referred to as the <italic>selective translation model</italic>, proposes that inhibition of translation is selective. In the selective translation model, the increased availability of ribosomes leads to differential translation of mRNAs coding for stress response factors and thus to increased folding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McQuary et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Seo et al., 2013</xref>). In general, studies proposing a version of <italic>the selective translation</italic> model show that inhibiting translation requires HSF-1 to reduce protein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tye and Churchman, 2021</xref>). In the <italic>selective translation model</italic>, protein aggregation is reduced by an HSF-1-dependent active generation of folding capacity to remodel the proteome.</p><p>The second model, referred to as the <italic>reduced folding load model,</italic> proposes that newly synthesized proteins are the primary aggregation-prone species of proteins. Therefore, newly synthesized proteins constitute the most significant folding load on the proteostasis machinery. Inhibition of translation reduces the concentration of newly synthesized proteins and, thus, the load on the folding machinery. In contrast to the <italic>selective translation model</italic>, which proposes selective protein synthesis of HSF-1-dependent stress response factors, the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic> does not depend on specific factors but generates folding capacity by reducing the overall folding load. A problem comparing previous studies has been their use of different model organisms, different proteostatic insults, and modes of inhibition. Furthermore, previous studies did not control how much protein synthesis was reduced by different modes of translation inhibition making direct comparisons between the <italic>selective translation model</italic> and the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic> difficult.</p><p>In this study, we systematically compared these two models in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using pharmacological agents to block various steps along the protein synthesis cycle but ensured to use inhibitors that achieve comparable reductions in the concentration of newly synthesized proteins across the different interventions. We characterize how lowering translation protects <italic>C. elegans</italic> from proteotoxic insults such as proteasome inactivation, heat shock, and aging. Our data reveal that the step inhibited in mRNA translation dictates which of the two protective mechanisms is activated. Furthermore, they uncover an unexpected link between translation initiation and HSF-1 and show that inhibition of translation initiation fails to lower the concentration of newly synthesized proteins in the absence of HSF-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterizing mRNA translation inhibitors in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>We first set out to identify suitable pharmacological translation initiation (TI) and translation elongation (TE) inhibitors by screening a series of translation inhibitors for their ability to lower protein synthesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dmitriev et al., 2020</xref>). To monitor protein synthesis, we employed SUrface SEnsing of Translation (SUnSET) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2014</xref>). In this method, translating ribosomes incorporate puromycin into newly synthesized proteins. The level of puromycin incorporation serves as a quantitative measure for translation and is detected by western blotting using an anti-puromycin monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The six molecules examined all reduced puromycin incorporation relative to DMSO controls to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).

To confirm their action as TI or TE inhibitors in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we generated a bi-cistronic reporter to co-express both GFP and tdTomato under the control of the <italic>myo-3</italic> promotor and an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li and Wang, 2012</xref>). In transgenic worms carrying the <italic>myo3p::</italic>GFP-IRES<italic>-</italic>tdTomato construct, strong GFP and tdTomato fluorescence were observed primarily in the muscle tissue. Using this reporter, we measured the fluorescence of 500 L4 animals treated with one of the four translation inhibitors. As expected for the TE inhibitors, anisomycin and lycorine decreased fluorescence in both green and red channels.</p><p>On the other hand, the TI inhibitors 4E1RCat and salubrinal only decreased the fluorescence of the green channel, consistent with an initiation-dependent translation of the GFP mRNA sequence and the initiation-independent translation of the IRES-tdTomato sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, we observed a strong increase in red fluorescence in worms treated with 4E1RCat, but this is due to the red color of the molecule itself. We confirmed no change in tdTomato levels by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, inset). The above results confirm that the four translation inhibitors function in distinct translation steps, consistent with previous reports in yeast and cell culture.</p><p>We also confirmed the mechanism of translation inhibition of cycloheximide. Although cycloheximide is a widely used inhibitor of translation throughout the literature, to our knowledge, it has not been shown to specifically act as a TE inhibitor in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Using the SUnSET assay and our bi-cistronic reporter, we show that cycloheximide directly reduces the concentration of newly synthesized proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) and functions as a TE inhibitor since we observed a reduction of both the GFP and the tdTomato signal. Salubrinal, which we included as a TI inhibitor control, only reduced translation promoted by <italic>myo-3</italic> but not the IRES site as seen before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). We noted that the inhibition of translation by cycloheximide across different trials was considerably more variable compared to anisomycin and lycorine (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We therefore decided to proceed with anisomycin and lycorine as TE inhibitors as they reliably reduced the concentration of newly synthesized proteins by 40–50%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Initiation and elongation inhibitors protect from thermal stress by HSF-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms, respectively</title><p>After confirming that the four translation inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) acted as TI or TE inhibitors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as seen in mammals, we set out to investigate how pharmacologically targeting different steps of the translation cycle will affect stress-induced protein aggregation.

Similar results were obtained for the TE inhibitor cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We interpret this lifespan extension as a partial rescue of the protein folding defect in <italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>) mutants, as the increase in lifespan did not reach the lifespan of wild-type animals. Taken together, however, our data demonstrate that longevity induced by translation inhibition, whether through targeting TE or TI, subsumes several different mechanisms that lead to longevity.</p><p>We next tested the ability of all four inhibitors to reduce age-associated protein aggregation. If inhibition of translation alone is sufficient to reduce protein aggregation independently of any downstream mechanisms, all four inhibitors should reduce age-associated protein aggregation. Conversely, if the reduction of age-associated protein aggregation is closely linked to longevity, then only the TI inhibitors should reduce protein aggregation. We treated day 1, N2 animals with 100 μΜ of each of the four inhibitors and allowed the animals to age for 8 days, after which we separated proteins based on solubility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that only the two TI inhibitors that extended lifespan caused significant decreases in the amount of SDS-insoluble aggregates and that the TE inhibitors failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of TE rescues proteostasis-compromised animals by the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic> without generating additional protein folding capacity. Separately, inhibition of TI protects and improves longevity by the <italic>selective translation model</italic> that depends on HSF-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Inhibition of translation initiation increases protein concentration in <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic> mutants</title><p>The canonical model that explains the requirement of HSF-1 to induce longevity by inhibiting TI suggests that blocking TI activates the HSR via HSF-1 that then initiates the transcription of HSP chaperones to increase folding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howard et al., 2016</xref>).

Unfortunately, we could not determine the exact target for salubrinal in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>To further confirm that the lifespan extension of 4E1RCat is caused by on-target action, we measured lifespan extension in N2 and <italic>ifg-1(cxTi9279)</italic> mutants which carry a splicing defect that results in an overall reduction of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrison et al., 2014</xref>). As we previously observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>) 4E1RCat treatment of N2 animals significantly extended lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). However, no lifespan extension was observed in <italic>ifg-1(cxTi9279)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), showing that 4E1RCat extends lifespan by on-target action. Therefore, we concluded that inhibition of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> requires HSF-1 to lower the concentration of newly synthesized proteins. Consequently, the beneficial effects of 4E1RCat treatment are not observed in <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic> mutants as inhibition of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> fails to lower protein concentrations in this strain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A substantial body of genetic and biochemical work suggests that lowering the concentration of newly synthesized proteins reduces the load on the proteostasis machinery. We asked if these effects could be pharmacologically replicated to exploit them for therapeutic purposes in disease models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Solis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schubert et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We set out to study how pharmacological inhibition of TI or TE improves proteostasis and increases longevity in adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We intended to compare the <italic>selective translation</italic> model, in which the selective reduction of specific proteins and the selective translation of others protect from proteotoxicity to the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic>, in which the non-specific reduction of the concentration of newly synthesized proteins is protective.</p><p>We compared the non-selective lowering of protein concentration by TE inhibitors to the selective lowering of initiation-dependent proteins by TI inhibitors. Our studies reveal that pre-existing proteotoxicity, as might be observed in a disease state, dictates the mode of translation inhibition necessary to restore proteostasis. As a result, the mode of translation inhibition, either inhibiting TI or TE, results in distinct and sometimes opposing outcomes for the health of the animals.</p><p>The most striking dichotomy was seen when pre-existing proteotoxicity—caused by the lack of either HSF-1 or the expression of the aggregation-prone PolyQ protein—was combined with the inhibition of the proteasome. These combined insults led to increased protein aggregation, shrinking body size, and death of the animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Inhibition of TE almost entirely rescued these phenotypes. In sharp contrast, inhibition of TI exacerbated proteotoxicity and increased mortality. The effects were consistent for both TE and TI inhibitors despite structural differences and different targets of the TI inhibitors.</p><p>The second example of this dichotomy was the reciprocal ability of TI and TE inhibitors to extend the lifespan of N2 wild-type animals or <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic> mutant animals, with each mode of inhibition only able to extend the lifespan in one of the strains. Overall, TE inhibition effectively rescued proteostasis in animals with pre-existing proteotoxicities, such as a compromised HSR, reduced proteasome activity, or the expression of aggregation-prone proteins. Conversely, inhibition of TI did little to rescue pre-existing proteotoxicity or worsen it but proved effective at preventing emerging proteotoxicity, for example, with age. Notably, both anisomycin and cycloheximide have previously been reported to extend lifespan in wild type animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tarkhov et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takauji et al., 2016</xref>) but these studies were conducted in either non-fully reproductive adults or the exact conditions were not specified (i.e. temperature, whether OP50 feeding bacteria was alive/dead and developmental stage; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Takauji et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, we focused on the effects of inhibitor treatment on the lifespan of fully reproductive adult animals—thereby eliminating any partial dependency on developmental effects. Overall, our findings establish that inhibition of TI or TE has distinct consequences for proteostasis and that their mechanisms to control the concentration of newly synthesized proteins can be genetically separated.</p><p>We considered the following reasons to explain the different consequences for proteostasis. The increased mortality observed after combining bortezomib with TI inhibitors is likely to be the result of the lower expression of HSP90/<italic>daf-21</italic> and HSP70/<italic>hsp-1</italic>, whose translation depends on eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>) and the ability of both treatments to lower proteasome activity independently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The lower proteasome activity induced by the TI inhibitors is likely to enhance the proteotoxicity of bortezomib. The lowered proteasome activity observed upon inhibition of TI was surprising as the short-term inhibition of translation increases proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). However, compared to most other studies, we chose to reduce translation by only ~40%, as such a reduction is more likely to be tolerated chronically if translation inhibitors could be developed into therapeutics. In contrast, TE inhibitor treatment alone did not lower proteasome activity. More importantly, lowering the concentration of newly synthesized proteins by inhibiting TE rescued most bortezomib-induced proteotoxic effects. Thus, long-term inhibition of TI or TE differentially affects proteasomal activity and its proteotoxic effects.</p><p>The most unequivocal difference was the dependency of TI inhibitors on HSF-1, which was not observed for TE inhibitors. This dependency of the TI inhibitors on HSF-1 was initially explained by a model in which inhibition of TI activates the HSR via HSF-1. This model has been previously proposed for eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rogers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howard et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This initial model is still likely valid, but our study shows that HSF-1 has a more immediate role. HSF-1, or one of its targets, is necessary for the TI machinery to control protein synthesis. <italic>Selective translation</italic> can only occur if TI itself is inhibited. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, inhibition of TI in the absence of HSF-1 increases, rather than decreases, the amount of newly synthesized proteins. This surprising increase in newly synthesized proteins upon 4ER1Cat treatment was not an off-target effect as it was replicated by RNAi-mediated knockdown of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> in an HSF-1 mutant background. Hence, HSF-1 activity directly or indirectly modulates the ability of TI components to control the concentration of newly synthesized proteins.</p><p>At the outset, we intended to compare the <italic>selective translation</italic> model to the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic> by comparing their effects on proteostasis under conditions in which inhibition of translation resulted in the same concentration of newly synthesized proteins, irrespective of the mode of translation inhibition. We observed apparent differences in proteostasis effects, supporting the <italic>reduced folding load model</italic> for inhibiting TE and the <italic>selective translation model</italic> for inhibiting TI.</p><p>The inability of TI inhibitors to reduce the concentration of newly synthesized proteins in <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic> mutants and the inability to extend their lifespan shows that lowering the concentration of newly synthesized proteins is necessary for the beneficial effects. On the other hand, the finding that TE inhibitors protect from proteotoxic stress but do not extend lifespan shows that lowering the concentration of newly synthesized proteins is sufficient to protect from proteotoxic stress but is not sufficient to extend lifespan in wild-type, which appears to require <italic>selective translation</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our data show that HSF-1 or one of its targets controls the ability of TI to change the concentration of newly synthesized proteins. Previous work noted a surprising requirement for HSF-1 in the protection from ER stress elicited by the RNAi-mediated knockdown of eIF4G/<italic>ifg-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Howard et al., 2016</xref>). The authors note that further investigations will be required to determine the direct link between enhanced HSR amelioration of proteotoxicity and the endoplasmic reticulum. Our results provide a compelling explanation for their findings, in that the lack of HSF-1 abolishes the ability of <italic>ifg-1</italic> RNAi to lower the concentration of newly synthesized proteins and thus the protection from tunicamycin toxicity.</p><p>In the context of TI inhibition, HSF-1 (or one of its targets) may influence the concentration of newly synthesized proteins by either modulating protein degradation or synthesis. Our data show that proteasome activity and, by extension, degradation are lowered by both inhibition of TI and lack of HSF-1. Hence, combining both may indirectly increase the concentration of newly synthesized proteins through reduced degradation. However, inhibition of TI did not further decrease the already low proteasome activity in HSF-1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, salubrinal and 4ER1Cat lowered proteasome activity by the same amount, yet 4ER1Cat treatment increased the concentration of newly synthesized proteins much more in the HSF-1 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). Thus, we concluded a model in which HSF-1 promotes degradation in response to the inhibition of the TI machinery less likely.</p><p>Alternatively, HSF-1 (or one of its targets) cooperates with TI factors to form a checkpoint that prevents random unregulated translation. The TI factors are part of the checkpoint but also initiate regulated translation by giving ribosomes access to mRNA. Thus, when TI factors are inhibited or knocked down, HSF-1 or one of its targets maintains the checkpoint preventing uncontrolled translation. Without any TI activity, maintaining the checkpoint reduces protein synthesis. In the <italic>hsf-1(sy441)</italic> mutant, the TI machinery still prevents uncontrolled translation but less effectively, leading to a slight but detectable increase in newly synthesized proteins in HSF-1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Once the TI and HSF-1 are removed, ribosomes gain access to many mRNAs leading to unregulated translation and a dramatic increase in newly synthesized proteins.</p><p>Both the degradation and the cooperative checkpoint model explain the observed results but need to invoke a speculative connection between HSF-1 to either TI or protein degradation. Our results unexpectantly couple the ability of the TI machinery to control the concentration of newly synthesized proteins to HSF-1, thereby explaining its requirement. However, our results do not provide a mechanism by which HSF-1 couples the concentration of newly synthesized proteins to TI.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

The final volume in each plate was 7 mL. To prevent self-fertilization, FUDR (5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine, 0.12 mM final) (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat#: 856657) was added 42—45 hr after seeding. At the late L4 stage, either DMSO/drug treatment (100 μΜ unless otherwise stated) was added to each strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>RNAi</title><p>RNAi of <italic>ifg-1</italic> was preformed using the feeding vector L4440 to express dsRNA of the respective genes, received as a gift from the Hansen lab. HT115 bacteria were as OP50 bacteria above, with the exception that prior to harvesting, 2 mM IPTG (isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) was added, and the suspension was allowed to grow for 4 additional hours to induce dsRNA expression. Animals were grown and synchronized in liquid culture as previously described, being fed the relevant RNAi bacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>SUnSET to analyze the effectiveness of translation inhibitors in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p>Day 1 adult N2 worms were bleached, and eggs were allowed to hatch in S-complete by shaking overnight. On the next day, 12,000 L1 worms were seeded in a 15 cm plate containing a total volume of 30 mL S-complete with 6 mg/mL OP50 bacteria, 50 μg/mL carbenicillin, and 0.1 μg/mL amphotericin B. Six mL of 0.6 mM FUDR were added to worms at L4 stage in each plate. 100 μΜ translation inhibitor was added to worms 2 hr after adding FUDR. After 12 hr, worms were transferred into a 15 mL corning tube containing a total volume of 5 mL S-complete with 750 µL 6 mg/mL OP50 bacteria, 0.5 mg/mL puromycin, and 100 μΜ translation inhibitors. After rotating the corning tubes for 4 hr, worms were collected into 2 mL cryotubes by washing them with M9 once and with cold PBS three times. Worms were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently broken with a beak mill homogenizer (Fisherbrand). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay. 50 mg protein from each sample was loaded for western blot analysis using antibodies against puromycin (Millipore, MABE343) and GAPDH (Proteintech, 10494-1-AP). Antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5% non-fat milk in TBST.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Method for making bi-cistronic vector</title><p>The body wall muscle-specific promotor of the bi-cistronic vector is from 2 kb upstream of the start codon of gene myo-3.

On the next day, 12,000 L1 worms were seeded in a 15 cm plate containing a total volume of 30 mL S-complete with 6 mg/mL OP50 bacteria, 50 μg/mL carbenicillin, and 0.1 μg/mL amphotericin B. Six mL of 0.6mM FUDR was added, and two hours later, the animals were treated with the indicated translation inhibitor at a final concentration of 100 μM or DMSO only. At the L4 stage, 500 GFP-positive animals per condition were sorted using the COPAS Biosorter (Union Biometric). The integral values for fluorescence on a corresponding channel (i.e. green or red) were used to determine simultaneous red and green measurements for each animal using the standard BioSorter software. Integral values are determined automatically by the BioSorter by integrating each signal when the threshold signal is above the threshold value. In essence, it determines intensity over the length of the worm to account for variations in size.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Thermotolerance</title><p>Age-synchronized N2 or PS3551 [<italic>hsf-1(sy441</italic>)] animals were prepared as above in 6 cm culture plates and treated with water or 100 μM lycorine/anisomycin on day 1. On day 4, 25–35 animals were transferred to 6 cm NGM plates in triplicate for each condition and were transferred to the non-permissive temperature of 36°C. Every hour, survival was scored by lightly touching animals with a worm pick and scoring for movement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> insoluble protein extraction</title><p>10,000 N2 worms were sorted into a 15 cm liquid culture dish using the COPAS Biosorter (Union Biometrica). For heat shock-induced aggregation experiments, worms were treated with either DMSO or anisomycin (100 μΜ) for 12 hr on day 1 of adulthood, then subjected to a 2 hr heat shock at 36°C. After 12 hr of recovery, the animals were washed three times with S-complete buffer, once with PBS, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. 500 µL of cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris base, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4, with protease inhibitors [Roche, 11836153001]) was added, and animals homogenized mechanically. An aliquot of this total lysate was saved. In an ultracentrifuge tube, two volumes of SDS Extraction buffer (20 mM Tris base, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH = 7.4, with protease inhibitors, and 1% SDS) were added to 1 volume of total lysate and was centrifuged at 20,000 × <italic>g</italic> for 30 min. The extraction was repeated two times to remove all SDS-soluble proteins. The remaining insoluble pellet was suspended briefly in 20 µL urea buffer (8 M urea, 50 mM DTT, 2% SDS, 20 mM Tris base, pH = 7.4) and sonicated. 18 µL of the insoluble suspension was added to 6 µL 4× Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad, #161-0747) supplemented with 10% 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma, 60-24-2) and boiled for 5 min, then directly loaded onto SDS-PAGE gel (Bio-Rad, 4569033). Gels were stained with Sypro Ruby according to the manufacturer’s directions. Gels were quantified in ImageJ by dividing the integrated intensity of each full insoluble lane by the integrated intensity of the corresponding full total protein lane after subtracting a similar area background lane, then normalizing to the DMSO control.</p><p>For age-associated protein aggregation experiments, the above was repeated with the following changes: Day 1 worms were treated with 100 μΜ of each compound and allowed to age in liquid culture until day 8 of adulthood. Following lysis, worms were washed several times with PBS to remove soluble protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Proteasome dysfunction assay—survival</title><p>Animals were prepared as above in 96-well plates. At the late L4 stage, animals were pre-treated with DMSO or 100 μΜ anisomycin. After 12 hr, the animals were treated with 75 μΜ bortezomib.

On day 5, animals were collected and washed 3× with cold DPBS, then once with 1× assay buffer. Worms were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. After three biological replicates were harvested in this way, the frozen animals were broken open with a beak mill homogenizer (Fisherbrand). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford protein assay. 200 μg of sample was loaded with assay mixture into a 96-well plate and incubated for 1 hr at 37°C. Fluorescence was measured on the Tecan Safire II with a 380/460 nm filter set. Positive control: 5 µL of 20S proteasome positive control (Chemicon Part No. 90205).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Proteostasis is differentially modulated by inhibition of translation initiation or elongation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Pankaj Kapahi, and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Brian M Zid (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>After consultation with the reviewers, and based on the detailed review below, we have decided that the presented work needs significant revisions to be considered for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> and is thus not suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> in its current form. The Reviewing Editor would be glad to discuss beforehand it makes more sense to consider revision for <italic>eLife</italic> or whether you may want to consider submitting the work elsewhere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Do the authors believe that initiation inhibitors don't slow protein production in hsf-1 mutants? If so, this should be shown. Do the authors believe there is a toxic side effect from initiation inhibition in hsf-1 mutants which masks the benefit from reducing protein synthesis in this background? Either way they should discuss this and revise their conclusion for elongation inhibition, similarly to what they have done for initiation inhibition.</p><p>One potential alternative explanation for the effect of elongation inhibition in hsf-1 and on proteostasis is that as reduced elongation speed is important for nascent protein folding (Kim et al. Skach Science 2015, Zhou et al. Liu Nature 2013) and coding fidelity (Xie et al. Proud Current Biology 2019), that low doses of elongation inhibitor slow translation elongation speed leading to enhanced proteostasis, outside of just the changes in overall protein synthesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Validation of the drugs. Using different compounds to inhibit translation at different states is an interesting approach and having these compounds validated for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> community is very useful. However, the effect of the compounds used in this study should be clearly shown in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, as the whole manuscript relies on the comparison of translation inhibition at selected steps. The effectivity of the drugs to inhibit translation initiation and elongation, respectively, was shown using puromycin incorporation (Figure 1A), which measures changes in overall protein synthesis and not changes in translation rates at selected steps. The analyzed compounds were studied in other systems such as mammalian cells and yeast, however, the source given in this manuscript does not show if they were previously used and validated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. To make the claim more solid that these drugs do inhibit specific steps of translation in the nematode, the authors should have used additional ways to show how the compounds act on the translation process, such as polysome profiling. For example the proposed translation initiation inhibitor salubrinal is suggested to inhibit eIF2alpha phosphatases (hence inducing ISR and reducing translation initiation). However, to my best knowledge, its mechanism of action is unknown and, more importantly, the eIF2alpha phosphatases of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are not identified, making it speculative if salubrinal does inhibit initiation. Also, while both anisomycin and lycorine are supposed to inhibit elongation and were shown to inhibit overall translation to similar extends (Figure 1A), the strength of their effect on survival during heat shock is different between the drugs (Figure 1D; see also effect of PolyQ aggregation in Sup. Figure S2), raising the question if they indeed act similarly on translation or if they might have off-target effects. For example, anisomycin is discussed to have strong side effects (DOI: 10.1128/MCB.15.9.4930).</p><p>2) Consistency of compounds and genotypes used throughout manuscript. Comparing the effects of the inhibition of different translation steps during selected external stresses and in different genetic models is a great approach. Unfortunately, because of the inconsistent use of genotype-treatment-combinations, the lack of Wildtype controls in some assays and splitting graphs based for example on treatment types, it is hard to interpret the results in a global way and to truly compare between initiation and elongation inhibition.</p><p>3) Statement that elongation inhibitors reduce ongoing toxicity by reducing folding load independently of hsf-1. Some contradictions in the effect of elongation inhibition are not addressed. Elongation inhibition is discussed to reduce toxicity by reducing protein folding load. While it is shown that inhibition of elongation reduces protein aggregation upon heat shock (Figure 2D,E) and in a PolyQ model (Figure 4C), protein aggregation is not lowered by elongation inhibition in aged worms (Figure 5C,D,E). It is further claimed that elongation inhibition acts independently of hsf-1 in many of the observed phenotypes, but sometimes Wildtype controls are missing to rule out a partial dependency. Furthermore, there could be other factors than hsf-1 involved that are changed upon elongation inhibition and mediate the phenotypes instead of (or in addition to) the overall reduction of protein and hence the increase in folding capacity. Also the inhibition of initiation might reduce folding load (as indicated in Figure 5D,E). More direct data to compare protein aggregation upon inhibition of initiation with elongation during stresses are mainly missing. Translation itself is not compared on a molecular level between the different translation modulation modes.</p><p>4) Effects on lifespan. The lifespan assays in Figure 5 are very interesting and underline the previous observations nicely, as they directly compare two initiation and elongation inhibitors in Wildtype and hsp-1 mutant contexts. With regards to elongation inhibition, there might be contradictions to other published data that found inhibition of elongation using cycloheximide to increase lifespan (DOI: 10.1038/srep18722). One more reason why it would be great to have the effect of the elongation inhibitors on translation used here validated.</p><p>5) Given the high focus of the manuscript on the difference between the inhibition of translation initiation and elongation, translation itself could have been further analyzed using the different compounds and during selected stresses (for example polysome profiling or ribo seq). The authors claim that their results are consistent with a model proposed by Rogers et al. (2011), saying that lifespan extension through inhibition of translation initiation acts via translation of selected factors. Could the status of some of these factors be checked upon translation inhibitor treatment to verify this?</p><p>6) Figure 2D,E; Figure 4C; Figure 5C,D,E pose multiple questions that remain unanswered: What is the difference between age-associated protein misfolding on the one hand and proteotoxicity caused by heat, proteasome dysfunction, and PolyQ stretches on the other hand, and why do animals react differently to it when treated with initiation or elongation inhibitors? Why does inhibition of initiation protect from age-associated protein toxicity but not from proteasome-misfunction-induced protein toxicity? Why does inhibition of elongation protect from proteasome-misfunction-induced protein toxicity but not from age-associated protein aggregation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>hsf-1's role in EIs but not IIs protecting against proteasomal dysfunction: the data is Figure 3 make this a weak conclusion at best. In the paradigm used, the difference between WT and hsf-1 mutant survival is only 20% and the 'limited protection' vs. 'highly protective effects' of the respective chemical classes are not apparent. From the figure, the impact seems to be similar on both genotypes. The 'morphology' improvements brought about by EIs are not explained and the images in 3G cannot be used to measure 'unc' phenotypes.</p><p>In Figures 2B, C, the data for concluding hsf-1 dependence/independence of IIs and EIs thermotolerance is weak. The graphs look moderately different from each other but only one P value is provided (does it apply to both treatments? what is the comparison?) that is not very convincing (P 0.05 vs. 0.02). No details for means/SEM/number of animals and trials are provided either.</p><p>Data for lifespan (Figure 5A, B) and thermotolerance (Figures1D,E and 2B, C) survival assays are from one trial only and do not include details (mean, number of animals, SEM). Additional independent trials are critical for verification.</p><p>How were the protein quantifications performed for the Puromycin immunohistochemistry (1A) and the insoluble/soluble fractions (2D, E; 5D, E). Were specific regions or bands' intensity measured or the whole lane?</p><p>Is the inhibitor treatment for 72h (3 days) or 4 days? The article mentions 72h (eg., line 26) but figures (Figure 1, 2) show 4 days.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76465.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Do the authors believe that initiation inhibitors don't slow protein production in hsf-1 mutants?

As mentioned above and shown in the new Figure 6, initiation inhibitors do not reduce the concentration of newly synthesized proteins in hsf-1(sy441). On the contrary, they surprisingly increase it.

One of the aims of this study was to start validating chemical tools to study translation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The reviewers' point that we did not validate them far enough was on point. Addressing this point proved far more difficult and was why revising this paper took so long. We started by synthesizing photoaffinity probes that would have allowed us to pull down and identify the <italic>C. elegans</italic> targets of these compounds. However, the chemically modified versions of the inhibitors lost their activity, with only the anisomycin probe still behaving like the original molecule.</p><p>Thus we switched strategies and generated the myo-3p::GFP-IRES-tdTomato transgenic worm that allows us to distinguish initiation-dependent from initiation-independent translation. However, as shown in Figure 1F, the variability in fluorescence is large, which caused us difficulties in quantifying the effects precisely. A COPAs bio sorter then allowed us to assay enough animals to unequivocally determine that these inhibitors inhibit translation initiation or elongation as they do in mammals. For 4ER1Cat, we could also show that it no longer extends lifespan in the ifg-1 mutants and that both 4ER1Cat and ifg-1 RNAi surprisingly increase the concentration of newly synthesized proteins in hsf-1 mutants. We thank the reviewer for this criticism, as we think addressing it improved the paper considerably.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Consistency of compounds and genotypes used throughout manuscript.

All the experiments were conducted in parallel, always including N2 +/- treatment control and focusing on the 4 compounds described. We re-arranged some of the figures and hopefully addressed this point. We initially chose to split thermotolerance, proteasome, and survival graphs to make the different responses more obvious. However, these experiments were conducted in parallel. These are clearly noted as Figures 2B, 2C, 4B, 5A 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Statement that elongation inhibitors reduce ongoing toxicity by reducing folding load independently of hsf-1.

Translation itself is not compared on a molecular level between the different translation modulation modes.</p></disp-quote><p>There seem to be several points here. First: It is true that elongation inhibitors could involve other factors. However, the protein folding load model is the simplest version of the model on how elongation inhibitors exert their effect. A key question in this study was to test if we can find conditions where it does not apply. Except for age-associated aggregation, that model correctly predicted all the outcomes for elongation but not initiation inhibitors. For why elongation inhibitors may fail to reduce age-associated protein aggregation please see ANSWER 10 for a potential explanation.</p><p>Second, we are unsure where we were missing a wild-type control. The only place we could find was the missing images and length quantification for hsf-1 and Q35. There was no detectable difference, and we thus left it out. Regarding going down to the molecular level, we now show in Figure 1 that these drugs act as initiation or elongation inhibitors and establish a new and unexpected role for HSF1 in Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Effects on lifespan. The lifespan assays in Figure 5 are very interesting and underline the previous observations nicely, as they directly compare two initiation and elongation inhibitors in Wildtype and hsp-1 mutant contexts. With regards to elongation inhibition, there might be contradictions to other published data that found inhibition of elongation using cycloheximide to increase lifespan (DOI: 10.1038/srep18722). One more reason why it would be great to have the effect of the elongation inhibitors on translation used here validated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We were very pleased to find that the inhibitor data, especially the results for 4ER1Cat, agreed so well with the previous results shown by Howard et al. for ifg-1. Such a clear agreement is relatively rare, as genetic or pharmacological inhibition do not necessarily replicate each other. In contrast to knockouts or RNAi, small molecules do not remove the protein but only inhibit a site of a protein. Thus, they should be compared to alleles that affect only one aspect of a protein rather than to knockouts. However, in this case, the pharmacological and genetic results align very well, reciprocally strengthening each other. The hsf-1 dependency of initiation inhibition also aligns very well with Rieckher et al., which we now added to our citation list. The reasons why we did not use cycloheximide and why we think it is problematic to use are outlined in ANSWER 3. As outlined in ANSWER 6, we validated the inhibitor action and appreciate that the reviewer raised this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Given the high focus of the manuscript on the difference between the inhibition of translation initiation and elongation, translation itself could have been further analyzed using the different compounds and during selected stresses (for example polysome profiling or ribo seq). The authors claim that their results are consistent with a model proposed by Rogers et al. (2011), saying that lifespan extension through inhibition of translation initiation acts via translation of selected factors. Could the status of some of these factors be checked upon translation inhibitor treatment to verify this?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion and we will attempt those for at least two of the inhibitors (anisomycin and 4ER1Cat). However, after the reviewer pointed out that a better characterization of the inhibitors, their mode of action, and targets would be beneficial, we first focused on this action and established that 4ER1Cat acts by inhibiting ifg-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 2D,E; Figure 4C; Figure 5C,D,E pose multiple questions that remain unanswered: What is the difference between age-associated protein misfolding on the one hand and proteotoxicity caused by heat, proteasome dysfunction, and PolyQ stretches on the other hand, and why do animals react differently to it when treated with initiation or elongation inhibitors? Why does inhibition of initiation protect from age-associated protein toxicity but not from proteasome-misfunction-induced protein toxicity? Why does inhibition of elongation protect from proteasome-misfunction-induced protein toxicity but not from age-associated protein aggregation?</p></disp-quote><p>These are excellent questions. At the moment, we only have the observation that this seems to be the case. For example, we were surprised that the elongation inhibitors failed to dampen age-associated protein aggregation but could rescue most other forms or proteotoxic stress. We only have a speculative but probably reasonable answer that is testable. As worms age, their translation rates decline. As a result of diminishing translation, the elongation inhibitor has less of an effect with increasing age. Initiation inhibitors, through selective translation, do not only reduce translation but remodel the entire proteome, most likely leading to a less misfolding-prone proteome. While these ideas are currently speculative, we now have chemical tools to time-dependently inhibit translation to test these ideas. For example, if translation declines with age, the protective effects of elongation inhibitors on any of the proteotoxic stressors we investigated in this study should decline as well. In other words, the protective effect of an elongation inhibitor should be proportional to overall translation and thus decline with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>hsf-1's role in EIs but not IIs protecting against proteasomal dysfunction: the data is Figure 3 make this a weak conclusion at best. In the paradigm used, the difference between WT and hsf-1 mutant survival is only 20% and the 'limited protection' vs. 'highly protective effects' of the respective chemical classes are not apparent. From the figure, the impact seems to be similar on both genotypes. The 'morphology' improvements brought about by EIs are not explained and the images in 3G cannot be used to measure 'unc' phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several aspects to this paragraph. (1) The reviewer is correct in the assessment that the EI improves survival under bortezomib only for hsf-1 and not for N2. Therefore, we have changed the language and now state that the EI provides limited protection in N2.</p><p>However, we respectfully disagree concerning hsf-1 and polQ. The effects of the EI on the morphology of bortezomib hsf-1 and polQ animals are striking, especially considering that a translation inhibitor would be expected to make animals smaller. The rescue of survival for hsf-1 is also obvious when doing the experiment and reaches p&lt;0.0001. When measured against the DMSO control of the same genotype in hsf-1(sy441) the elongation inhibitors restore survival almost to the level of the hsf-1(sy441) no-bortezomib control (now Figure 4B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figures 2B, C, the data for concluding hsf-1 dependence/independence of IIs and EIs thermotolerance is weak. The graphs look moderately different from each other but only one P value is provided (does it apply to both treatments? what is the comparison?) that is not very convincing (P 0.05 vs. 0.02). No details for means/SEM/number of animals and trials are provided either.</p></disp-quote><p>To clarify this, we have amended Figure 2 and included animal numbers and P-values.</p><p>The 0.02 P-value that the reviewer mentions was inserted to show that 4ER1Cat caused a significant increase in survival only at this one-time point in the heat shock assay in the hsf-1(sy441) mutant. While we felt it correct to state that 4ER1Cat is mainly independent of hsf-1 because all other comparisons were not significant, we did not want to ignore this single point. Howard et al. (2016) suggested that the thermotolerance of the ifg-1 mutant (the target of 4ER1Cat) mainly depends on hsf-1 but not wholly. We intended to highlight that our results with a chemical inhibitor match their results with the mutant. In hindsight, this was confusing and made our data look much weaker than they are. In the new version of the figure, we added asterisks to show that the differences are highly significant or not at all. We also specifically state the number of independent experiments included in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data for lifespan (Figure 5A, B) and thermotolerance (Figures1D,E and 2B, C) survival assays are from one trial only and do not include details (mean, number of animals, SEM).

For the lifespan data (Figure 5), we provide an extensive supplementary file containing all the lifespan results with ID numbers referenced in the figure to identify the data set in the table that was used to make the figure.
