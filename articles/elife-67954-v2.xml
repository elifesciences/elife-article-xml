Early in embryonic development (prior to E13.5), SOX9+progenitors are multipotent, generating both airway and alveolar epithelium, but are selective progenitors of alveolar epithelial cells later in development. Transcription factors, including <italic>Sox9, Etv5</italic>, <italic>Irx</italic>, <italic>Mycn</italic>, and <italic>Foxp1/2</italic> interact in complex gene regulatory networks to control proliferation and differentiation of SOX9+progenitors. Molecular mechanisms by which these transcription factors and other signaling pathways control chromatin state to establish and maintain cell-type identity are not well-defined. Herein, we analyze paired gene expression (RNA-Seq) and chromatin accessibility (ATAC-Seq) data from SOX9+ epithelial progenitor cells (EPCs) during embryonic development in <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. Widespread changes in chromatin accessibility were observed between E11.5 and E16.5, particularly at distal cis-regulatory elements (e.g. enhancers). Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference identified a common SOX9+ progenitor GRN, implicating phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling in the developmental regulation of SOX9+ progenitor cells. Consistent with this model, conditional ablation of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium in mouse resulted in an expansion of the SOX9+ EPC population and impaired airway epithelial cell differentiation. These data demonstrate that PI3K signaling is required for epithelial patterning during lung organogenesis, and emphasize the combinatorial power of paired RNA and ATAC seq in defining regulatory networks in development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Studying how lungs develop has helped us understand and treat often-devastating lung diseases. This includes diseases like cystic fibrosis which result from spelling mistakes known as mutations in a person’s genetic code. However, not all lung diseases involve mutations. Many other diseases, in both adults and children, are caused by genes failing to switch on or off at some point during lung development.</p><p>DNA is surrounded by various proteins which package it into a compressed structure known as chromatin. Cells can control which genes are turned on or off by modifying how tightly packed parts of the genetic code are within chromatin. Changes in chromatin accessibility, also known as ‘epigenetic’ changes, are a normal part of development, and guide cells towards specific jobs or identities as an organ matures. However, how this happens in the developing lung is poorly understood.</p><p>Here, Khattar, Fernandes et al. set out to determine how chromatin accessibility shapes development of the tissue lining the lungs, focusing on a group of progenitor cells which produce the protein SOX9. These cells are initially found at the tips of the early lung, where they go on to develop into the cells that line the whole of the mature organ.</p><p>Initial experiments used large-scale genetic techniques to measure gene activity and chromatin accessibility simultaneously in progenitor cells extracted from the lungs of mice. Khattar, Fernandes et al. were then able to predict the signaling pathways that shape the lung lining based on which genes were surrounded by unpacked chromatin, and determine the proteins responsible for these epigenetic changes. This included the signaling pathway Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) which is involved in a number of cellular processes.</p><p>Additional experiments in mice confirmed that the PI3K pathway became active very early in lung development and remained so until adulthood. In contrast, mice lacking a gene that codes for a key part of the PI3K pathway had defective lungs which failed to develop a proper lining.</p><p>The data generated in this study will provide an important resource for future studies investigating how epigenetic changes drive normal lung development. Khattar, Fernandes et al. hope that this knowledge will help researchers to better understand the cause of human lung diseases, and identify already available ‘epigenetic drugs’ which could be repurposed to treat them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>lung development</kwd><kwd>ATAC-Seq</kwd><kwd>lung distal tip progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>epigenomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08HL130666</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swarr</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08HL140178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zacharias</surname><given-names>William</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL144774</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sinner</surname><given-names>Debora</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007172</institution-id><institution>Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Proctor Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swarr</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01HL156860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swarr</surname><given-names>Daniel T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Paired analysis of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in SOX9+ lung progenitor cells identifies a requirement for PI3K in proximal-distal patterning of the mouse lung epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenesis of the mammalian lung begins as an outpouching of a simple bud from the embryonic foregut, which branches and extends into the splanchnic mesoderm as the primitive respiratory tubules are formed.

Over the course of early lung development, SOX9<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells give rise to the entire complement of lung epithelium, from proximal airway epithelial cells to distal type I (AT1) and type II alveolar (AT2) epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laresgoiti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nichane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikolić et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miller et al., 2018</xref>). Remarkable progress has been made in understanding the signaling pathways (e.g. <italic>Wnt, Bmp</italic>, <italic>Shh</italic>, retinoic acid [RA], and FGF signaling) and transcription factors that control development, differentiation, and maturation of the lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarr and Morrisey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Whitsett et al., 2019</xref>). Present understanding of how these various signals are integrated to establish respiratory epithelial cell identity remains limited; how this ‘cellular memory’ is disrupted over the course of the human lifespan during homestasis, repair after injury, and in various lung diseases is an area of active investigation.</p><p>Chromatin state serves as a medium through which various developmental and external stimuli are integrated into comprehensive cellular programs which enable regulatory proteins access to activate or repress gene expression. Epigenetic programs controlling progenitor cell identies are maintained in spite of repeated rounds of cellular division, fluctuating transcription factor levels, or dynamic inputs from various signaling pathways, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sheikh and Akhtar, 2019</xref>). Chromatin accessibility changes dynamically throughout development, to establish and maintain cellular identity in a variety of cell types and organ systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gorkin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Trevino et al., 2020</xref>). The extent to which changes in chromatin accessibility contribute to lung development as a diversity of mature epithelial cells differentiate from embryonic progenitors remains incompletely understood.</p><p>Chromatin accessibility, or ‘the degree to which nuclear macromolecules are able to physically interact with chromatinized DNA’ can now be measured in a relatively small number of cells using Assay for Transposible-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Klemm et al., 2019</xref>), wherein Tn5 transposase inserts Illumina sequencing adapters into accessible regions of chromatin. Although accessible chromatin regions only make up a minority of the genome (2–3%), they account for a high proportion of the genomic loci bound by transcription factors, and are highly correlated with cis-regulatory elements (CREs) identified by other methods, such as promoters, enhancers, insulators, and silencers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buenrostro et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we used paired RNA-Seq and ATAC-Seq to define the chromatin accessibility landscape of developing SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitor cells at multiple development timepoints. Acessible chromatin regions in SOX9+ cells were highly correlated with lung-specific histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) found on validated cis-regulatory elements. Dynamic changes in these accessible chromatin regions were correlated with gene expression changes observed during the course of SOX9+ lung epithelial cell differeniation. Chromatin accessibility changes were observed in or near genes associated with phophatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling. Genetic ablation of PI3K signaling within the lung epithelium caused expansion of the SOX9+ progenitor cell population at the expense of mature lung epithelial cell differentiation. Our results demonstrate the power of epigenomic analysis to identify new roles for gene regulatory networks and signaling pathways in lung epithelial development, highlighting the previously unappreciated role of PI3K signaling in SOX9+ cell differentiation and proximal-distal cell fate specification.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The multi-potent SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitor cell (EPC) population</title><p>Shortly after lung specification occurs, highly proliferative distal progenitor cells marked by the expression of SOX9+ appear at the tips of the growing lung buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–I</xref>).

Several lines of evidence, including lineage tracing and 3D culture model systems, demonstrate that early in development SOX9+ progenitor cells are multi-potent, generating both airway and distal alveolar epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rawlins et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laresgoiti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nichane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nikolić et al., 2017</xref>). In order to orthogonally validate these observations and gain insight into the transcriptional changes occurring during these developmental decisions, we peformed pseudotime analysis (Monocle) of RNA-Seq data from mouse lung epithelium from E11.5 to E16.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell et al., 2019</xref>). Starting from E11.5, two distinct pseudotime branches arise from SOX9+ progenitors, terminating in airway and distal lung epithelial cells at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We used Monocle to find modules consisting of co-regulated genes during distal differentiation, revealing 26 unique gene modules. A subset of these gene modules overlap with pseudotime analysis and correspond with specific aspects of SOX9+ epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). One such gene module consists of genes highly expressed E11.5 lung and preserved the distal differential branch of the Monocle pseudotime analysis; these genes are involved in lung epithelial development and early branching, including <italic>Sox9</italic>, <italic>Wnt7b</italic>, <italic>Bmp4,</italic> and <italic>Hmga2</italic>, validating the significance of both the pseudotime analyses and gene module predictions while also identifying other coordinately expressed genes that may be involved in EPC differentiation (module 8, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L–M</xref>). Other modules highlight genes that likely regulate the proliferating progenitor cells on the same central branch to distal epithelium (module 16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, G</xref>), and genes involved in the function of differentiated airway epitheilum (modules 4 and 12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D, F</xref>).

Finally, this requirement for PI3K signaling demonstrates that careful comparative analysis using both chromatin accessibility and gene expression data provides higher sensitivity to identify novel regulators of development that may be unrecognized from expression data alone.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The mature mammalian lung is composed of dozens of specialized cell types that are necessary to permit gas exchange and facilitate terrestrial life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swarr and Morrisey, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basil and Morrisey, 2020</xref>). While many of the major transcription factors and signaling pathways that drive differentiation of lung cells during development have been defined, mechanisms by which these signals are integrated into the chromatin state to establish and maintain cellular identity remains incompletely understood. Here, we have generated a map of the chromatin accessibility landscape during SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitor cell development, which we have made readily available to the scientific community through the LGEA Web Portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/mainportal.html">https://research.cchmc.org/pbge/lunggens/mainportal.html</ext-link>), a product of the NIH LungMap Project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Du et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ardini-Poleske et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Du et al., 2017</xref>). Accessible chromatin regions identified in our study are highly correlated with histone post-translational modificiations normally associated with active, functional cis-regulatory elements, and changes in the accessibility of these regions of chromain are associated with changes in developmental gene expression. Changes in chromatin accessibility were preferentially located at putative enhancers, highlighting the importance of targeted chromatin remodeling at select enhancers in the development of the SOX9+ lung epithelial progenitors.</p><p>Our combinatorial approach to the analysis of both mRNA and chromatin accessibility data led to the observation that PI3K was a key regulator of EPC development. Accessible regions of chromation, particularly those regions that became more accessible as development proceeded, were significantly enriched nearest genes associated associated with PI3K signaling. Signaling through the PI3K pathway, as measured by pAKT immunostaining, was highest in the proximal lung epithelium throughout development. In vivo, a paucity of airways were observed in the <italic>Pik3ca cKO</italic> lungs; although the airways present were lined by SOX2+ epithelium, mature secretory and ciliated cell markers were decreased. <italic>Pik3ca cKO</italic> mice also demonstrated extensive distal cysts and simplified alveoli. Both results emphasize the need for an intact gradient of PI3K signaling during development for proper differentiation of the proximal and distal portions of the lung. Follow-up studies using inducible Cre drivers to inactivate the PI3K pathway in more specific cell populations at specific stages of development will be needed to understand the time- and context-dependency of PI3K signaling in lung development.</p><p>The markedly abnormal lung epithelium seen in <italic>Pik3ca cKO</italic> animals imply a critical role for PI3K in lung development, raising several future questions. The role of PI3K signaling in directing branching morphogenesis remains incompletely defined. Although conditional deletion of <italic>Pik3ca</italic> in the developing lung epithelium in vivo appears to lead to impaired branching morphogenesis, lung explant models employing pharmacologic inhibitors of PI3K signaling, and a recent study that conditionally deleted <italic>Pik3ca</italic> in the lung mesenchyme during mouse lung development show an increase in branching morphogenesis. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2022</xref>) The overlapping and unique roles of PI3K signaling in the epithelium and mesenchyme warrant further investigation. Second, the receptor/ligand pairs modulating PI3K signaling in the developing lung remain to be defined. FGF signaling, particularly FGF7 and FGF10 signaling through FGFR1/2 has been shown to play a key role in initial outgrowth of the lung bud and subsequent branching morphogenesis. However, abrogation of FGF7 or FGF10 signaling through FGFR1/2 causes apoptosis and failure of lung epithelial outgrowth, not expansion of SOX9+ progenitor cells as observed presently, and thus the phenotypes observed in <italic>Pik3ca cKO</italic> animals cannot simply be explained by a downstream effector of the FGF7/10-FGFR1/2 signaling axis; EGF, other FGFs, and IGF are all potential regulators to be explored. It is worth noting that the ‘bimodal’ pattern of pAKT staining early in development may be a result of FGF10-FGFR2 signaling at the branch tips, with signaling through additional receptor-ligand pairs acting to pattern and direct differentiation of the proximal epithelium.</p><p>Third, our data suggest that the PI3K pathway may regulate chromatin state during lung development. Studies from cancer, where aberrant activation of PI3K signaling is common, have shown that pAKT can directly interact with a number of key chromatin regulatory (CR) complexes to modulate chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that the PI3K signaling pathway serves as the central ‘switch-board’ integrating signals received from diverse receptor ligand-pairs during lung epithelial development, and in turn directly modulates chromatin state, including chromatin accessibility, through interactions between pAKT and key CR complexes to direct lung epithelial differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Future studies investigating the interface of PI3K signaling within the lung epithelium on chromatin state, cellular differentiation, and cell-type identity will be of significant interest in defining these mechanisms.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model of the role of PI3K signaling in the developing lung epithelium.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) During normal lung epithelial development, a proximal-to-distal gradient of PI3K signaling patterns the lung epithelium, with highest levels in the developing conducting airways and distal tips (early in development).

It remains unknown which of the dozens of proteins and complexes that are known to remodel chromatin are specifically required for development and differentiation of the lung epithelium. Studies in other tissues imply that specific CR complexes interface with major developmental transcription factors to mediate chromatin accessibility, and that chromatin accessibility changes are an integral part of cell-type identity. Given the promising progress of epigenomic therapies in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates, 2020</xref>), there is an urgent need for in vivo genetic studies targeting specific CR complexes and CRISPR-based epigenome engineering strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holtzman and Gersbach, 2018</xref>) to define the epigenomic mechanisms of lung homeostasis and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal husbandry</title><p>Experiments were performed on a mixed C57BL/6, CD-1 background.

Much of the predictions that led to identification of PI3k was not followed up, and these are missed opportunities. For example, the relationship shown in Figure 3 of PI3K link to transcription factors was not investigated. RNAseq of the mutant will be informative to reveal possible links.</p><p>2. Based on histological data in Fig7 and 8, there seem to be opposing phenotypes in the in vitro experiment with increase branch number compared to in vivo phenotype with simplified and dilated alveolar region, which typically is a result of decreased branching. The discrepancy needs to be addressed, perhaps by assaying the mutants at earlier stages to determine if there is increased branching.</p><p>3. The analysis of the in vivo phenotype is superficial. For example, the persistent of <italic>Sox9</italic> and Ki67 cell proliferation are not quantified, and the data are not of high resolution. It is not clear what is driving reduced club and ciliated cell phenotype, given that <italic>Sox2</italic> is not altered. Deeper analysis to tie together the ATACseq and RNAseq analysis as mentioned in point 1 will be important to put all findings into one cohesive study.</p><p>4. The increase in branching phenotype is unique and robust. What is the cellular mechanism behind this? Is there a change in branching signals such as Fgf10, etc?</p><p>5. Given the nature of PI3K signaling, much of the regulation in this pathway occurs via protein-level regulation. It will be useful to have a closer examination of the transcriptional regulations of both the factors that are known to be regulated post-transcriptionally, and compared to factors in the rest of the pathway.</p><p>6. Pik3ca histology is reminiscent of CPAM. Is there a connection?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67954.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting article starting with the analysis of paired gene expression and chromatin accessibility data during lung development and concluding with a proposed role for Pi3K in branching morphogenesis and proximal distal differentiation.</p><p>The in vivo data look very interesting.</p><p>Some issues with the current experiments however make them hard to interpret.</p><p>1) while the experiments in Figure 6 show an increase in branching morphogenesis after treatment with different inhibitors, it is unclear whether this is because inhibition of Pi3K in the epithelium or mesenchyme.</p><p>2) Similarly it is difficult to assess whether the effect on Sox9 epithelial progenitors is due to the inhibitor acting on the epithelium or mesenchyme.</p><p>3) The authors could try to separate the epithelium from the mesenchyme and treat their explants with the inhibitor again.</p></disp-quote><p>See response to comment #1 (public review).

It is possible that the increase in branching morphogenesis seen in our in vitro data is due to mesenchymal PI3K signaling, partial pathway inhibition (compared to complete blockade in the genetic mouse model), or timing of pathway inhibition (starting at E12.5 in the in vitro model, with earlier pathway inactivation in the mouse model).

The strongest signal is seen in the proximal airway epithelium (developing trachea), but signal is present throughout the lung epithelium and there does appear to be a second focus of increased signal intensity at the distal epithelial tips. By E18.5 pAKT signal intensity appears to be far greater within the airway epithelium than any other location in the lung. Because pAKT signal appears to be present in all of the airway epithelial cells at E18.5 and adult lungs, we did not feel there was any additional benefit to performing co-stains with additional airway epithelial markers, particularly given that pAKT staining alone is technically challenging.</p><p>With regard to additional readouts of PECA-identified targets, we performed QPCR on epithelial cells identified by bead sorting for EPCAM from E18.5 embryos and saw minimal difference in expression in PIK3ca KO vs control lungs.

Extensive prior literature has shown that transcription factor binding and other secondary regulation controls TF activity based on differential cellular state, and thus differences in the regulators themselves do not validate or invalidate the overall network given that the predicted targets. The major finding of PECA was to direct us toward PI3K signaling as an interesting regulator of proximal/distal specification, and our knockout experiments clearly show this is the case. We have adjusted the discussion of PECA in the manuscript to reflect these caveats.Finally, as the reviewer points out, there are multiple differential readouts of the upstream signaling mechanisms that drive PI3K signaling in the lung. The extensive crosstalk of these pathways is complex and beyond the scope of the current work. We focused specifically on downstream effects of PI3K signaling, and agree with the reviewer that future genetic experiments to precisely dissect the upstream signals driving these effects in different developmental compartments will be important.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mechanism for expansion of SOX9+ EPCs is unclear.

Much of the predictions that led to identification of PI3k was not followed up, and these are missed opportunities. For example, the relationship shown in Figure 3 of PI3K link to transcription factors was not investigated. RNAseq of the mutant will be informative to reveal possible links.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed QPCR on epithelial cells identified by bead sorting for EPCAM from E18.5 embryos and saw minimal difference in expression in PIK3ca KO vs control lungs. These results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>We interpret these differences in QPCR to be not surprising, as the PECA model integrates both chromatin accessibility data and target gene expression to identify core regulators within a specific cellular context. Extensive prior literature has shown that transcription factor binding, and other secondary regulation controls TF activity based on differential cellular state, and thus differences in the regulators themselves do not validate or invalidate the overall network given that the predicted targets. The major finding of PECA was to direct us toward PI3K signaling as an interesting regulator of proximal/distal specification, and our knockout experiments clearly show this is the case. We have adjusted the discussion of PECA in the manuscript to reflect these caveats.</p><p>However, we do think this is a very important area of focus for future investigation, and we hope that ongoing transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility studies with this conditional knockout mouse line (which we think is beyond the scope for the current manuscript) will help better address these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Based on histological data in Fig7 and 8, there seem to be opposing phenotypes in the in vitro experiment with increase branch number compared to in vivo phenotype with simplified and dilated alveolar region, which typically is a result of decreased branching. The discrepancy needs to be addressed, perhaps by assaying the mutants at earlier stages to determine if there is increased branching.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a time series from E12.5 to E18.5 for our core imaging data sets. We agree that there appears to be a decrease in branching morphogenesis in Pik3ca<sup>ShhCre</sup> lungs, which contrasts with the increase in branching morphogenesis observed in the in vitro explant models. One potential explanation is that the increase in branching morphogenesis observed in the in vitro explant model is due to inhibition of PI3K signaling in the mesenchyme, since pharmacologic treatment obviously results in pathway inhibition in both compartments of the lung. Recently published data from Xing Y, et al., (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022) demonstrate that aberrant activation of PI3K signaling within the lung mesenchyme increases branching morphogenesis and impairs airway epithelial differentiation. Other possible explanations about the discrepancy between the in vitro explant data and Pik3ca<sup>ShhCre</sup> mouse model would be timing (earlier pathway inhibition in in vivo model) or degree (partial versus complete in vitro versus in vivo models) of pathway inhibition. We agree that these are fascinating questions, but will be best addressed by additional in vivo studies using Cre-lox technology to both ablate as well as constitutively activate the pathway in the epithelium and mesenchyme to further delineate cell-type specific effects of PI3K signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The analysis of the in vivo phenotype is superficial. For example, the persistent of Sox9 and Ki67 cell proliferation are not quantified, and the data are not of high resolution. It is not clear what is driving reduced club and ciliated cell phenotype, given that Sox2 is not altered. Deeper analysis to tie together the ATACseq and RNAseq analysis as mentioned in point 1 will be important to put all findings into one cohesive study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a developmental time series, from E12.5 to E18.5 and have quantified cell types within these figures that we hope better illustrates the phenotype. From E12 to E16.5 there are no significant differences in the number of proliferating epithelium (or proliferating <italic>Sox9</italic>+ epithelium) or <italic>Sox9</italic>+ epithelium. At E18.5, there are significantly more <italic>Sox9</italic>+ lung epithelial cells in the Pik3ca<sup>ShhCre</sup> lungs, which is probably best described as a persistence of this progenitor cell population (rather than proliferative expansion of <italic>Sox9</italic>+ epithelium). Immunofluorescence microscopy of <italic>Sox2</italic> from E12.5 to E18.5 again shows fewer airway branches (as discussed above), but the airway epithelium otherwise appears to express <italic>Sox2</italic> in a normal fashion. At E18.5, the mean expression level of <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA in Pik3ca<sup>ShhCre</sup> lungs is modestly decreased but does not reach statistical significance. In contrast, there is a marked reduction in the secretoglobin proteins Scgb1a1 and Scgb3a2 at both the mRNA and protein level, and the ciliated cell marker Foxj1 (at mRNA level). Although we cannot exclude that there is a smaller but significant impairment in the generation of <italic>sox2</italic><sup>+</sup> epithelium, it appears that the more significant phenotype present is the differentiation of airway epithelium into mature airway epithelium. We anticipate that our follow-up studies will refine the precise molecular mechanisms by which PI3K signaling directs differentiation of the lung epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The increase in branching phenotype is unique and robust. What is the cellular mechanism behind this? Is there a change in branching signals such as Fgf10, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, the apparent conflict between the in vitro explant model (increased branching) and in vivo epithelial-specific pathway ablation (decreased branching) is interesting and raises important questions about the precise roles that PI3K signaling plays in directing branching morphogenesis. Recently published data from Xing Y, et al., (Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology, 2022) demonstrate that aberrant activation of PI3K signaling within the lung mesenchyme increases branching morphogenesis and impairs airway epithelial differentiation. It is possible that the increase in branching morphogenesis seen in our in vitro data is due to mesenchymal PI3K signaling, partial pathway inhibition (compared to complete blockade in the genetic mouse model), or timing of pathway inhibition (starting at E12.5 in the in vitro model, with earlier pathway inactivation in the mouse model). These questions will be best addressed with conditional deletion and pathway activation in both the epithelium and mesenchyme in vivo, which is beyond the scope of the current manuscript, and the suggestions from the reviewer will be useful in thinking about those experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Given the nature of PI3K signaling, much of the regulation in this pathway occurs via protein-level regulation. It will be useful to have a closer examination of the transcriptional regulations of both the factors that are known to be regulated post-transcriptionally, and compared to factors in the rest of the pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that both the inputs into the PI3K signaling pathway (e.g. FGFs, EGF, IGFs) during lung development and transcriptional output of the pathway are important open questions. While FGF10FGFR2 signaling at the distal tip during early branching morphogenesis has been well studied, and may explain the increased pAKT staining we see at the branch tips (in addition to the high level of pAKT in the proximal epithelium/airway epithelium), we feel that there is important unexplored biology in how the PI3K pathway integrates these diverse signaling pathways during development, and potentially modulates chromatin state to effect transcriptional change. We hope that ongoing transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility studies with this conditional knockout mouse line, and well as in vivo models employing constitutive pathway activation (which we think is beyond the scope of the current manuscript) will help better address these questions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Pik3ca histology is reminiscent of CPAM. Is there a connection?</p></disp-quote><p>Very interesting question. Our previous work on congenital pulmonary airway malformations implicated PI3K signaling as a pathway possibly dysregulated in CPAMs. There is an evolution of cystic lesions relatively late in lung development in the Pik3ca<sup>ShhCre</sup> lungs, but the other most notable aspect of the phenotype observed in these animals is an impairment in airway epithelial differentiation, with a marked decrease in ciliated and secretory cells markers. In contrast, there is a significant increase in the number of airway epithelial cells with increased expression levels of ciliated and secretory cell markers in CPAM lesions. Somatic mosaic mutations in PIK3CA are seen in a number of pediatric disorders (referred to as the Pik3ca-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS)). It is conceivable that activating somatic mutations in Pik3ca (or other PI3K pathway components) within the developing lung could underly the pathogenesis of CPAM, but this warrants further investigation in human samples (whole-exome sequencing) and a constitutive pathway activation mouse model (which will complement the pathway inactivation model presented in this manuscript).</p></body></sub-article></article>
