potential therapeutic applications. We investigated this relationship in <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic>, a model organism capable of regenerating any and all of its adult tissues. Microbiome characterization revealed a high Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria ratio in healthy animals. Perturbations eliciting an expansion of Proteobacteria coincided with ectopic lesions and tissue degeneration. The culture of these bacteria yielded a strain of Pseudomonas capable of inducing progressive tissue degeneration. RNAi screening uncovered a TAK1 innate immune signaling module underlying compromised tissue homeostasis and regeneration during infection. TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling mediated opposing regulation of apoptosis during infection versus normal tissue regeneration. Given the complex role of inflammation in either hindering or supporting reparative wound healing and regeneration, this invertebrate model provides a basis for dissecting the duality of evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling in complex, multi-organ adult tissue regeneration.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16793.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16793.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16793.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Regeneration, the ability to replace missing or damaged tissue, has fascinated biologists for years and has inspired a new direction for the medical field. Figuring out how some animals easily accomplish this while others do not may help us to develop new therapies that enhance regeneration in humans.</p><p>Previous work has indicated that the immune system, which is normally used to defend the body against bacteria, plays an important but complicated role in regeneration. By studying the relationships between bacteria, the immune system and regeneration in simple systems, it may be possible to see how their interactions either support or prevent the replacement of lost tissues.</p><p>Flatworms called planaria can regenerate all of their tissues. Arnold et al. have now investigated what bacteria exist in planaria, how the planarian immune system responds to these bacteria, and how this response affects regeneration. The results reveal that the two main types of bacteria that are present in planaria are also found in humans. In fact, conditions that encourage the growth and spread of one of these types of bacteria (called Proteobacteria, many of which can make humans ill) damaged the worms and prevented them from regenerating.</p><p>Arnold et al. then looked to see if the worms had genes that were similar to human genes that control the key immune process of inflammation, and found evidence of several such genes. Reducing the activity levels of these genes enabled worms that had been infected with Proteobacteria to regenerate again. However, these genes only seem to be responsible for regeneration when the planaria are infected with bacteria. Thus, planaria could be used as a simple model to discover how changes in resident bacteria can be detected by the immune system and affect the ability to regenerate tissues.</p><p>Future studies could use planaria to identify even more genes that control regeneration during infection. Also, since the main types of bacteria in planaria are similar to those in humans, planaria may help us to learn how animals can properly balance the levels of these bacteria in order to remain healthy.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16793.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16793.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>planaria</kwd><kwd>microbiome</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>dysbiosis</kwd><kwd>innate immune system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37GM057260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007795</institution-id><institution>Stowers Institute for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sánchez Alvarado</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An innate immune system signaling pathway in planarians has a dual role: it enhances apoptosis during bacterial infection, but represses apoptosis during tissue regeneration in the absence of infection.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Host and resident microorganism interactions are not only integral to the maintenance of normal physiological functions, but also to the development of pathology. Microbial dysbiosis, for example, underlies persistent inflammatory disorders, chronic non-healing wounds, and scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowd et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carvalho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scales and Huffnagle, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brothers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Shin et al., 2015</xref>). Long-term management of these conditions constitutes a substantial and sharply rising burden on our healthcare system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sen et al., 2009</xref>). Significant evidence spanning a diverse array of organisms and tissues indicates that the immune response can play a central role in either promoting or hindering wound healing and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eming et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karin and Clevers, 2016</xref>). The precise determinants facilitating these diametrically opposed outcomes is an area of intense investigation. As such the development of diverse and robust model systems capable of elucidating basic molecular mechanisms governing the interplay of the immune response and tissue regeneration should provide new insights for the design of novel therapies to combat this rising medical issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Planaria are a classic model system for studying adult wound healing and tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reddien et al., 2004</xref>). These free living members of the phylum Platyhelminthes contain a persistent pool of adult pluripotent stem cells, termed neoblasts, capable of regenerating all of the tissues and cell types of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>). Ablation of this population of mitotic cells via irradiation eliminates regenerative capabilities, resulting in regression of anterior structures and eventual tissue lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>). Development of RNAi methodologies has enabled the interrogation of genes involved regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sanchez Alvarado and Newmark, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>). These studies have informed our understanding of how wound responses, the recognition of lost tissues, dynamic establishment of positional identity, and activation of appropriate stem cell and differentiation programs all serve to accomplish large-scale complex tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Petersen and Reddien, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wenemoser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scimone et al., 2014</xref>). While wounding is the stimulus for regeneration across all organisms studied to date, its incidence also presents an additional challenge. Disruption of barrier epithelia and exposure of mucosal surfaces poses an increased risk for bacterial invasion of internal tissues. Yet the role to which, if any, changes in endogenous microbiota or the planarian immune response have in regeneration is entirely unknown.</p><p>The exemplary regenerative capabilities and conservation of multiple immune signaling genes in planarians make this organism an attractive model for understanding how robust tissue regeneration capabilities can be balanced with an effective immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peiris et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies in planaria have uncovered components of the immune system conserved in humans, but absent from the well-studied innate immunity models of ecdysozoa (<italic>e.g.</italic>, flies and nematodes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abnave et al., 2014</xref>). This indicates that planaria can serve as a complement to previously established invertebrate models to inform our understanding of the human immune response. While their potent regenerative capabilities and robust capacity for pathogen clearance render them quite resilient, planaria are not invincible. Planaria reared using traditional static culture methods can exhibit features of declining health including decreased appetite, loss of motility, dorsal tissue lesions, tissue degeneration, and lysis. Many of these symptoms can be temporarily alleviated and managed with antibiotics, suggesting that endogenous bacteria can play an antagonistic role in normal regenerative and tissue homeostatic functions. To date much of the planarian immune system and its potential integration with tissue regenerative processes are still a mystery. Importantly, the composition of the planarian microbiome is still unresolved and no direct link between microbiota, the immune system, and tissue regeneration has been established.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the relationship between endogenous microbiota, host response, and regeneration. We performed deep sequencing of bacterial 16 s rDNA under various perturbations to elucidate the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. Importantly, we found that transitions in culture conditions or tissue amputation elicited a robust Proteobacteria expansion that coincided with an increase in the susceptibility of intact worms to develop ectopic tissue lesions. Isolation and identification of bacteria that expanded during this time yielded a strain of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> capable of inducing progressive tissue degeneration that resulted in either total lysis or resolved to permit regeneration of lost structures. The development of novel low septic culture methods facilitated a candidate RNAi screen examining the mediators of this pathological progression in planaria. We successfully identified a conserved TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module that both mediated infection-induced tissue degeneration and specifically impeded regeneration during infection. In situ phospho-signaling analyses permitted us to identify tissue and cell types that activate p38 signaling in response to infection, revealing a role in the initiation of localized apoptosis preceding tissue degeneration. This apoptotic and tissue degeneration response coincided with an immune response mediated by <italic>jun D</italic>, an AP-1 family homolog downstream of TAK1 signaling. Finally, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling facilitates apoptosis during infection, it plays a contrasting role in the inhibition of apoptosis during normal regeneration. Altogether, our study uncovered potential mechanisms by which immunity and regeneration intersect to mediate distinct tissue regeneration outcomes, and introduces planarians as the first animal model linking the expansion of endogenous Proteobacteria to inhibition of complex tissue regeneration via the activation of distinct TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> microbiome is dynamic and responds to changes in culture conditions</title><p>To increase the scale and efficiency planarian husbandry, we developed a novel recirculation culture system for co-cultivation of massive numbers of worms. In brief, this system enables the constant recirculation and UV sanitization of planarian water to mitigate pathogenic levels of bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The result is a permissive context for rearing large biomass levels of healthy, fissioning, lesion-free planarians. Adoption of this culture system offered a unique opportunity to study the heretofore unknown composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. We hypothesized that bacteria tightly associated with the physiology of healthy worms would be preserved within this recirculation culture while additional, potentially harmful species may accumulate upon exit to traditional static culture conditions. Previously, declining worm health within the static culture was remedied by administration of antibiotic. We assayed parallel cohorts of worms transitioned from recirculation to static culture with or without the antibiotic gentamycin for characterization of the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16793.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The planaria microbiome dynamically responds to changes in culture conditions and regeneration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of transition of planaria from recirculation to static culture.

The most prevalent bacterial phyla within planaria cultured in the recirculation system was Bacteroidetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Bacteroidetes comprised 78% of the bacterial phyla of planaria from the recirculation system (static culture day 0), but this proportion declined to 57% after 3 days of static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The most abundant bacterial genera present in recirculation-cultured worms largely belonged to the phylum Bacteroidetes (<italic>Candidatus Amoebophilus, Segetibacter</italic>, and <italic>Chitinophaga</italic>) and declined in relative abundance in static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The genera <italic>Oxalobacter, Rhodoferax</italic>, and <italic>Vogesella,</italic> belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria, exhibited proportional increases ranging from 6 to 200 fold in worms transferred to static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Two genera of the phylum Bacteroidetes, <italic>Chryseobacterium</italic> and <italic>Pedobacter</italic>, also increased dramatically after transfer despite the net decrease in the phylum overall. Members of the genus <italic>Chryseobacterium</italic> are potential pathogens in immune-compromised individuals and newborns undergoing prolonged antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bloch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calderón et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that dramatic shifts in abundance may constitute an opportunistic infection. All of the aforementioned genera were largely gentamycin sensitive. In contrast, proportional increases of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in static culture were exacerbated by gentamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), consistent with its adept nature to adapt to the selective pressure of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Price et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, accumulation of <italic>Delftia, Arthrospira, Elizabethkingia</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter</italic> was largely gentamycin dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that enrichment of a particular cohort of bacterial species may be more conducive to optimal planarian health and destabilization of this microbiota permits amplification of potentially harmful species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Regeneration shifts the composition of the <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> microbiome</title><p>Planaria exhibit a robust capacity to replace and integrate missing tissues through a regenerative process combining morphogenesis with the remodeling of pre-existing tissues. The extent to which this process impacts the resident microbiome is heretofore unknown. We transferred worms from recirculating into static culture conditions and amputated the animals above and below the pharynx 3 days later. To mitigate bacterial bloom after exit from recirculation culture, worms were starved for 2 weeks prior to transfer and cultured at low density with frequent water changes. Amputated head, trunk, and tail fragments were separated and 16 s sequences were analyzed at 0dpa, 3dpa, 7dpa, and 14dpa. Un-amputated worms were analyzed in parallel as a control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of planarian bacterial phyla during regeneration revealed dramatic shifts in composition that mirrored those seen during the transition from recirculation to static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,E</xref>). Prolonged starvation and additional water changes successfully mitigated the Proteobacteria bloom, with Bacteroidetes comprising 75 to 81% of the bacterial phyla of intact worms and freshly amputated worm fragments on day 0. Three days after amputation, worms exhibited a reciprocal decrease of Bacteroidetes and amplification of Proteobacteria phyla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). In contrast, un-amputated worms cultured in parallel maintained a relative abundance of Bacteroidetes until the final 2-week time point. This eventual shift is likely the result of prolonged static culture conditions. Next, we analyzed proportional changes in the top genera of intact and regenerating worms. The genera <italic>Candidatus Amoebophilus</italic> and <italic>Segetibacter</italic>, both members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, decreased in abundance 3 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In parallel, the genera <italic>Acidovorax, Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas, Vogesella</italic>, and <italic>Oxalobacter</italic> exhibited transient or sustained increases in regenerating worm fragments 3 to 7 days after amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Thus, the expansion of Proteobacteria observed in both regeneration and static culture time courses can be traced to common genera amplified under both conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The microbiomes of wild and lab-raised planaria share many genera</title><p>To determine how the bacterial composition of the asexual CIW4 lab strain compared to that of wild planaria, we performed 16 s sequencing on individual sexual <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> samples collected from multiple sites in Sardinia. Negative controls were performed in tandem during sample and library preparation to exclude contamination from resident lab strains. We succeeded in amplifying and sequencing 16 s libraries from 5 out of 8 worms covering 2 collection sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Phyla composition varied between individual animals. Proteobacteria was either the most abundant (3 out of 5 worms) or the second most abundant (2 out of 5 worms) phyla across all worm samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). Bacteroidetes or Firmicutes were the dominant phyla in the two cases in which Proteobacteria was not the most abundant. These differences in phyla composition were also reflected in the most abundant bacterial genera across individuals. The genera in the highest proportion was <italic>Rhodoferax, Lactococcus, Plesiomonas, Giesbergeria</italic>, and <italic>Candidatus amoebophilus</italic> in worms 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This level of variation in endogenous bacterial composition amongst individuals is consistent with previous observations in other animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caporaso et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the phylum Proteobacteria was proportionally higher in wild collected versus lab-raised worms consistent with observations flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, we found that the genera that increased during transitions in culture conditions and regeneration, (<italic>Chryseobacterium, Vogesella</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>), were detectable in wild planaria samples but present at relatively low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>Despite this heterogeneity in bacterial composition, more bacterial genera were common across all four worms collected from site#1 in Sardinia than were unique to any individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Furthermore, greater than 90% of the bacterial genera detected among all of our CIW4 lab strain planaria samples were also detected among our wild worm samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). With respect to wild worms, this level of overlap was ~46%, suggesting that a significant proportion of bacterial genera is distinct in our wild sexual samples. To determine possible differences between asexual versus sexual biotypes, we sampled prominent culturable bacteria from lab raised sexual planaria. We utilized sexual S2F2 genome strain planaria from a fill and drain culture system that were transitioned to traditional static culture. We detected abundant <italic>Vogesella, Pseudomonas, Aminobacter</italic>, and <italic>Hafnia</italic> bacterial colonies from sexual worms at day 3 of static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). This limited sampling demonstrates that asexual and sexual lab cultured planaria have both similar and distinct bacterial composition. Therefore, with respect to wild sexual bacteria, it is unclear to what extent the observed differences with asexual lab planaria are attributable to (1) intrinsic microbiome differences between the asexual and sexual biotypes, (2) region-specific bacterial genera, and/or (3) shifts in genera during lab culture. Importantly, our analyses demonstrate that the vast majority of genera from CIW4 lab strain planaria are common to those of wild type sexual worms.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id

Removal of animals from the recirculation culture system elicited a 17-fold expansion in 16 s rDNA over three days that was largely mitigated by gentamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N</xref>). Additionally, both removal from the recirculation culture system and amputation elicited a 2- to 3-log fold increase in score-able bacterial species per worm within 3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1O,P</xref>). Representative colony 16 srDNA amplification and sequencing revealed that the observed bacterial bloom was dominated by three bacterial species belonging to the following genera: <italic>Vogesella, Chryseobacterium</italic>, and <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). The expansion of these bacteria during culture transition was highly reproducible in multiple withdrawals from two independent recirculation culture systems (data not shown). These findings are consistent with our 16 s rDNA sequencing data showing proportional increases of these genera within worms upon exit from recirculation culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).

We hypothesized the etiology of this tissue degeneration lie in the observed bacterial bloom upon exit from recirculation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). To determine whether this bacteria was sufficient to induce tissue homeostatic defects we introduced emergent <italic>Vogesella, Chryseobacterium</italic>, or <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> bacterial strains to planaria water immediately upon transition to static culture. Worms were infected at a concentration of 1E8 CFU/ml and washed every 3–4 days for administration of fresh planaria water containing bacteria. This method of infection lead to a dose dependent increase in endogenous bacterial levels over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) similar to those observed in the worms following removal from the recirculation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In comparison feeding of bacteria mixed with beef liver paste elicited an initial spike and steady decline in bacterial levels as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abnave et al., 2014</xref>), but the endogenous bacterial levels of control fed worms also increased to match that of bacteria fed worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This expansion of endogenous bacteria complicates analysis and obfuscates effects of tested bacterial strains on host biology. We therefore utilized supplementation of bacteria directly in planaria water to determine effects on tissue homeostasis.</p><p>In response to infection, worms exhibited pathological defects largely resembling planaria of declining health in static culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We categorized the observed pathologies into the following discrete categories: normal, posterior lesions, anterior lesions, head regression, partial lysis, and full lysis. Infected worms exhibited a consistent development of tissue defects over time varying in the rate of progression by bacterial strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Generally phenotypically normal worms initially developed either posterior or anterior dorsal lesions, anterior lesions increased in severity to result in full head regression, and worms exhibiting head regression ultimately initiated full tissue lysis. The notable exception was the incidence of anterior blastema formation and regeneration as opposed to lysis in a subset of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infected worms with regressed heads. These data demonstrate that both the rate of pathological progression and eventual outcome of the infection in planaria varies by bacterial strain.</p><p>We were able to infer a chronological hierarchy and assigned specific stages to the observed progressive tissue degeneration: Normal = 0, Posterior Lesion = 1, Anterior Lesion = 2, Head regression = 3, Partial Lysis = 4, Full Lysis = 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Worms that regenerated lost anterior structures were assigned stage 2.5, reflecting tissue restoration following stage 3 head regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Using these stages we plotted tissue degeneration over time, highlighting differential effects of tested strains on planarian tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We chose <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> for subsequent analyses based on the following criteria: it offered the opportunity to study loss and regeneration of tissues during infection, it is the most well studied of the tested strains, and members of this genus are relevant human pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>Pseudomonas</italic> localizes to barrier epithelia during the initial stages of infection</title><p>We used a validated anti-<italic>Pseudomonas</italic> antibody and histological sections in order to determine tissues likely affected by infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

By 3 days some <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> appear to have crossed epithelial barriers and localize to the mesenchyme. In order to study the effects on the mucosal epithelia, we performed Alcian Blue/ Periodic Acid-Schiff staining of histological sections following infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Infected worms exhibited a gradual apical compression of the morphology of outer epithelial cells with a slight distortion in the organization of the basement membrane. In the intestine, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection resulted in a pronounced lumenal constriction with changes in epithelial organization and morphology over time.

While infected worms exhibited abundant numbers of <italic>piwi</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts both prior to and following tissue degeneration, the frequency of neoblasts within the interior of the animal relative to the periphery appeared to progressively decrease during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To determine how bacterial challenge altered regeneration potential, we infected worms with increasing dosages of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and amputated above and below the pharynx one day after exposure to bacteria. Phenotypic effects on resulting head, trunk, and tail fragments were documented one week later. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection inhibited tissue regeneration of amputated fragments in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that segments of the worm along the A/P axis had different tolerances for bacterial infection. Head fragments were the most susceptible, tail fragments exhibited intermediate sensitivity, and trunk fragments were the most resistant. These data suggest that differences in tissue composition along the A/P axis and/or the extent of tissue generation versus remodeling required for re-establishment of the body plan confer resistance or susceptibility to infection.

This transition results in an increase in absolute bacterial levels characterized by a relative decrease in the phyla Bacteroidetes, a proportional increase in the phyla Proteobacteria, and the emergence of newly dominant bacterial genera and species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B,C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1N,O</xref>). Clustering of the 1,218 genes significantly altered relative to static culture at day 0 revealed transcriptional patterns that were either dependent (clusters 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8,and 9) or independent (clusters 3 and 6) of antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Gene clusters sensitive to antibiotic treatment could be divided based on up-regulation (clusters 1, 4, 8, 9) or down-regulation (clusters 2, 5, 7), and then further subdivided into phases of early (clusters 4 and 7), mid (cluster 8), late (clusters 1 and 5), or sustained (clusters 2 and 9) expression changes. Of particular interest was cluster 1, consisting of genes upregulated gradually after exit from the recirculation system in the absence of antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This cluster had clear potential enrichment in genes that correlated with increased bacterial levels over time. Interestingly, this gene cohort contained two transcripts with homology to peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps), upstream receptors of the IMD pathway in <italic>D. melanogaster.</italic> Along with Toll signaling, the IMD pathway represents a conserved branch of the innate immune system with analogous architecture to the inflammatory signaling pathways in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panayidou and Apidianakis, 2013</xref>). RT/qPCR and WISH analysis confirmed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection significantly induced one of these homologous receptors, that we designated <italic>pgrp-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). These data suggest that conserved components of the innate immune and inflammatory signaling pathways may dynamically respond to shifts in the microbial composition in planaria.

Given their low levels of Proteobacteria and in particular the emergent pathogenic strains we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>), planaria from the recirculation culture system presented the greatest opportunity for studying the maximal differential effect caused by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection in terms of phenotypic and underlying molecular responses. However, in order to use these animals and conditions for an RNAi screen to identify immune response mediators, we needed to devise a way to reduce the bacterial bloom observed after removal from recirculation culture without using antibiotics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As we observed in our experiments, the antibiotic gentamycin substantially altered endogenous microbiota composition, diminishing the phylum Bacteroidetes while enriching for Proteobacteria, including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Its usage would preclude analysis of phenotypes that are dependent on dynamic shifts in endogenous microbiota. Additionally, a shared recirculation culture system precludes the delivery of multiple, distinct dsRNAs to separate experimental cohorts of planaria.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we developed a unidirectional flow system in which worms were maintained in multiple individual containers and steadily flushed with fresh planaria water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

Additionally, introduction of static worms to flow vessels resulted in a nearly 2 log reduction in culturable bacterial levels over 5 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>), and worms administered 3 feedings of control dsRNA mixed with beef liver paste maintained levels comparable to those observed in recirculation culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

By taking the average score of the worms on each day and converting that average to a color-based scale from blue to red to denote pathological severity, we were able to reduce the complexity of the data to facilitate its visualization. For each RNAi condition, color-coded average scores for each day were stacked along the y-axis in ascending order from top to bottom forming a column.

Worms were analyzed at a tissue degeneration 'tipping point' at which point the following occurred: infected control worms developed anterior lesions (stage 2, Mild), RNAi of single activators resulted in posterior or no lesions (stage 0–1, None), and RNAi of single inhibitors produced head regression and/or lysis (stage 3–5, Severe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

While mRNA analysis is useful in identifying structures competent to respond to stimulation, it fails to resolve those cells or tissues dynamically responsive to infection. Fortunately, the phosphorylation-dependent signal transduction of the TAK1/MKK/p38 pathway presented an opportunity to analyze dynamic activation via phospho-antibody based detection of the downstream target, p38. The human homolog of the kinase p38 is activated via phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182, a region highly conserved in planaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 1994</xref>). We tested one polyclonal and one monoclonal phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182) antibody for reactivity against the planarian phospho-epitope. UV treatment is a common inducer of P-p38 and western blot analysis revealed both tested antibodies reacted to an induced band at 45kDa corresponding to the size of planarian p38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Previous research has demonstrated that tissue amputation elicits a robust induction of both proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wenemoser and Reddien, 2010</xref>). We analyzed the effects of RNAi of both activators and inhibitors of the TAK1/MKK/p38 pathway on amputated tail fragments in the absence of infection. We observed no effects of RNAi of any TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling component on the proliferative burst following amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1G</xref>).

This stands in direct contrast to the observed effects of ectopic activation of this pathway in enhancing infection-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,F</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>tak1</italic> and <italic>p38-1</italic> rnai worms all exhibited phenotypically normal regeneration in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that the observed enhancement in apoptosis is relatively innocuous during normal regeneration.

Sequencing of the planarian microbiome revealed a high Bacteroidetes to Proteobacteria ratio in healthy animals. Perturbation such as tissue amputation or changes in culture conditions resulted in a reciprocal contraction of the Bacteroidetes and an expansion of the Proteobacteria populations. Coincident with these microbial shifts, intact worms displayed increased susceptibility to the development of visible tissue homeostatic defects. Isolation of emergent bacteria during this period yielded a strain of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> which itself was sufficient to induce tissue degeneration in a morphologically stereotypical progression. Development of novel anti-septic culture methods permitted a candidate RNAi screen focusing on the role of conserved mediators of innate immunity and inflammation in mediating this response to infection. We identified TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling components underlying tissue degeneration and compromised regeneration capacity during infection. Interestingly, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling enhanced apoptosis during infection, it repressed apoptosis during tissue regeneration in the absence of infection. Additionally, these tissue degeneration responses were independent of an immune response mediated by <italic>jun D</italic>, an AP-1 family homolog downstream of TAK1. Taken together, this study demonstrates that Proteobacteria expansion elicits distinct activation of TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling which in turn acts as an impediment to complex tissue regeneration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>An invertebrate microbiome with composition and dynamics analogous to the mammalian lower intestinal tract</title><p>This study elucidates the heretofore unknown <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> microbiome.

This phyla composition is not observed in other invertebrate (<italic>e.g., C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) or even vertebrate (<italic>e.g., D. rerio</italic>) model systems that are amenable to large scale genetic screens and have played a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of immunity and host-microbe interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Apidianakis and Rahme, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roeselers et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Novoa and Figueras, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Brey, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ermolaeva and Schumacher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berg et al., 2016</xref>). An enrichment in Bacteroidetes in <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> is significant, as this phylum represents a diverse array of key symbionts known to support proper tissue homeostasis, the development of the immune system, as well as the prevention of inflammatory diseases in mammals, and, intriguingly, have even been linked to the early evolution of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rakoff-Nahoum et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mazmanian et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alegado et al., 2012</xref>).

Maintenance and care of planarians using traditional static methods can yield variable bacterial levels and composition over time, potentially influencing experimental outcomes. Furthermore, prolonged use of antibiotics can lead to the gradual accumulation of resistant pathogenic strains, such as <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>. Given that many published phenotypes describing gene knockdowns mirror some of the observed effects of bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Reddien et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forsthoefel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbé et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tu et al., 2012</xref>), it will be important to examine the extent to which alterations in endogenous bacteria or stimulation of immune signaling underlie these phenotypes. This issue is particularly relevant to the common practice of feeding worms <italic>E. coli</italic> producing dsRNA as a means of gene function interrogation. As we have demonstrated, this method of RNAi elicits robust P-p38 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2E</xref>). To mitigate the issues of inconsistent bacterial composition and variable immune stimulation across experiments, we have developed an RNAi workflow using recirculation and flow culture systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Previous screens examining genes involved in planarian regeneration have utilized either static cultured or <italic>E. coli</italic> fed worms of indeterminate bacterial content.

Hyper activation of TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling via <italic>pp6</italic> or <italic>cyld-1</italic> RNAi elevated basal apoptotic rates and increased stem cell proliferation prior to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). In contrast, TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling repressed apoptosis during regeneration in the absence of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G–J</xref>). Importantly, <italic>tak1, mkk6-1, p38-1</italic>, and <italic>jun D</italic> RNAi worms exhibited phenotypically normal regeneration in the absence of infection, suggesting that this alteration in apoptosis did not ultimately hinder overall tissue morphogenesis and remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is unclear at this point whether these divergent outcomes of TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling are the result of unique co-stimulation or the activation of discrete cell types induced during infection versus amputation. Nevertheless, our study provides further evidence that TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling is multifaceted and can play supportive or antagonistic roles in tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zarubin and Han, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cuenda and Rousseau, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karin and Clevers, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The role of TAK1/MKK/p38 in apoptosis during infection is not unique to planaria.

One explanation is that the persistence of a population of adult pluripotent stem cells capable of regenerating all missing tissues uniquely endows planaria with a resilience to somatic tissue damage. Planaria may utilize TAK1 innate immune signaling for a coordinate mounting of antibacterial responses while actively clearing infected tissue via apoptosis prior to the initiation of regeneration. Under our sustained infection protocol, pathogen levels were constantly maintained, resulting in failure of complete bacterial clearance and continuous TAK1/MKK/p38 mediated apoptosis. Once this level of tissue turnover outpaces the ability of neoblasts to replace these cells, tissue homeostasis and regeneration capabilities are compromised. Under this context attenuation of infection-induced TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling rescued tissue degeneration and restored regenerative potential.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A case of tissue regeneration during chronic infection</title><p>The management and care of chronic non-healing wounds poses a substantial and sharply rising burden to our healthcare system and economy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sen et al., 2009</xref>).

We took advantage of the amenability of planarians to RNA-mediated genetic interference to identify mediators of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>-induced tissue degeneration and its lytic versus regenerative outcomes. We identified a TAK1 innate immunity signaling module underlying tissue degeneration and compromising regeneration capacity during infection. Interestingly, while TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling enhanced apoptosis during infection, it repressed apoptosis during tissue regeneration in the absence of infection. Our data indicate that activation of this pathway has discrete and seemingly opposite roles in host immunity versus normal regeneration. Given the complex role of inflammation in either the hindrance or support of reparative wound healing and regeneration, <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> provides a basis for dissecting the duality of this evolutionarily conserved inflammatory signaling module in complex, multi-organ adult tissue regeneration. Furthermore, the conservation of bacterial phyla composition and dynamics we uncovered in this invertebrate make it the first non-murine model organism for the study of pathological shifts in endogenous bacteria with relevance to human disease. In summation, our work not only advances planarians as a unique and tractable in vivo model system for the molecular dissection of regeneration, but also opens the door to the identification and characterization of conditions that promote or inhibit the natural execution of regenerative processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Planarian care in static or recirculation culture</title><p><italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> clonal CIW4 strain was maintained in 1X Montjuic salt as previously described for traditional static culture methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newmark and Sánchez Alvarado, 2000</xref>), supplemented with 50 μg/ml gentamycin where indicated.</p><p>A novel recirculation culture system was the predominant source of CIW4 planaria used in this study.

Samples were spun at 4°C 1600 g for 5 min to get phase separation. The top layer was transferred to a new tube and 1 ml chloroform was added. Samples were spun again for phase separation and the top layer was transferred to a new tube. Samples were precipitated by adding 12% volume of 2.5 M NaAc and 1 volume isopropanol. After 1 hr incubation at −20°C, samples were pelleted by centrifugation and rinsed 3 times with 70% EtOH. The pellet was dried and resuspended in H<sub>2</sub>O. Samples were RNAse treated in a solution of 5 mM Tris pH 8.0 and 1 μg/ml RNAse A for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were precipitated with 12.5% NaAc, 2.5 volumes of EtOH and incubation at −80°C for 1 hr. Samples were pelleted by centrifugation and washed 3 times with 70% EtOH.

In brief, the V3 and V4 primer pair was used for template amplification using 2X KAPA HiFi Hotstart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) in PCR strip vials. Reactions were placed in a thermal cycler at 95°C 3 min, followed by 25 to 35 cycles of 95°C 30 s, 55°C 30 s, and 72°C 30 s with a 5 min 72°C extension. For static culture timecourse and regeneration timecourse, 35 and 32 cycles were used respectively. For wild Sardinia worm material, 25 cycles were initially used for all samples. Those that failed to amplify in addition to a control successfully amplified sample were rerun with 35 cycles. Negative controls of H<sub>2</sub>O were run in parallel from the start of library preparation for static time course sample set. Negative controls from the start of the DNA isolation were run for wild worm and regeneration sample sets. Following the initial PCR amplification, the template was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads and a magnetic stand. Next, indexing pcr was performed using the Nextera XT index kit (Illumina). Reactions were placed in a thermal cycler using the identical PCR program with only 8 cycles. A final round of cleanup with Agencourt AMPure XP beads was performed and libraries were pooled, requantified, and sequenced as 2 × 250 cycle paired reads on the Illumina MiSeq, using MiSeq Control Software v2.5.0.5. Following sequencing, the MiSeq Reporter v2.5.1.3 (recirculation to static time course experiment) or v2.6.2.3 (regeneration time course and individual wild worm experiments) Metagenomics workflow was used to de-multiplex reads for all libraries, generate FASTQ files, and perform taxonomic classification of the reads. Reads of negative controls were used to determine background bacterial amplification. After elimination of background levels, a low signal threshold was set at 10 reads per OTU.</p><p>For wild worms, 16 s rDNA was successfully amplified and sequenced for 4 out of 6 worms from Sardinia collection site#1 (wild worm#1 jj04-9, wild worm#2 jj04-11, wild worm#3 jj04-11, wild worm#4 jj04-13) and 1 out of 1 worms from collection site#2 (wild worm#5 jj08-1). A 5<sup>th</sup> worm from collection site #1 was also amplified and sequenced (jj04-10), but since this sample did not have a negative control run in tandem during DNA isolation (as was performed for the other wild samples), it was not possible to determine potential contamination of the sample with bacteria from the lab. Therefore, this sample was not used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data visualization</title><p>Graphs were generated using Prizm software. Heatmaps were made using TM4 MeV.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Losick (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Arnold et al. demonstrate that planarians serve as a tractable model to study the relationship between the microbiome, immune system, and tissue regeneration due to their prolific regenerative abilities and the high degree of conservation of multiple immune-signaling genes. Arnold and colleagues take advantage of a novel low-septic culturing method they have developed in which planarians are first reared in a circulating water culture system and then transferred to traditional static cultures. This transition results in declining planarian health, triggered by bacterial pathogens, and manifests in easy-to-score tissue lesions, degeneration of tissue, and eventual lysis. The authors perform bacterial 16s rDNA deep sequencing under different culturing conditions to elucidate the composition and dynamics of the planarian microbiome. Interestingly, transition in culture conditions or tissue amputation elicits a reduction of Bacteroidetes and expansion of Proteobacteria (e.g., <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>) that correlates with susceptibility of worms to develop lesions. The strength of the paper lies in the methodology that Arnold et al. have devised for harnessing the shift in microbiome composition (caused by transitioning worms from circulating, low-septic culture methods to static culture) to identify host transcriptional changes by RNA Sequencing. The authors then use a candidate-based approach as proof of principle to examine conserved immune regulators and identify the TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module as an important mediator of pathological progression.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – By 16s rDNA deep sequencing, the authors find that the microbiomes of wild-type and lab-grown planarians share many genera. The authors state that a significant proportion of bacterial genera is distinct in the wild-type samples, which could be attributed to either region-specific bacterial genera or the loss of certain genera during lab culture. To determine if the differences in microbiota are due to loss of certain genera during lab culture it would be more appropriate to compare the wild-type sexual planarians from Sardinia to the sexual lab strain instead of the asexual CIW4 strain. Are the wild-type sexuals more divergent in their microbiome than the two lab strains?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> – Clustering analysis identified various transcriptional patterns, including one in which genes (e.g., <italic>pgrp-1</italic> and <italic>pgrp-4</italic>) were significantly upregulated when planarians transitioned to static culture. The authors should validate that the <italic>pgrp</italic> genes are induced by <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection by quantitative real-time PCR. WISH is not quantitative and the qualitative increase in <italic>pgrp-4</italic> expression in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> is not convincing. Is <italic>pgrp-1</italic> expression also upregulated? Based on how this manuscript is organized, many readers may well expect to see results from unbiased screening of some genes in this important data set. In fact, the IMD candidate lists could have been obtained without any of these transcriptomic data, so some readers may wonder why these data are included here if they will not be subject to more in-depth analysis. Are any of the other 32 IMD pathway homologs from the candidate RNAi screen present in this (or other) gene cluster(s)?</p><p>3) By RNAi, the authors convincingly demonstrate that certain genes are activators/inhibitors of the conserved IMD pathway by reducing/enhancing pathological progression in response to infection. However, the epistasis analysis performed by combinatorial RNAi experiments is confounding and certain aspects of the pathway are quite different from what has already been worked out in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian models. For example, the authors place planarian <italic>cyld-1</italic> epistatically downstream of Tak1, whereas in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mouse models it acts upstream (CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that physically interacts with Tak1 and regulates its ubiquitination). There is also equivalent evidence for placing Mkk4 upstream of PP6 rather than in parallel to the other genes, just as the other double RNAi outcomes were interpreted as indicative of a linear pathway. An explanation for such discrepancies could be that epistasis analysis using anything other than null alleles can be fraught with difficulties, especially when genes play roles in other developmental processes or if genetic redundancy is involved. Given the pitfalls of performing epistasis analysis by reduced-penetrance RNAi, the authors should either provide additional evidence supporting their divergent pathway or remove these data and the problematic pathway interpretations from the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>4) The identified activators/inhibitors could either influence infection clearance through an immune process or the host's ability to repair the damage caused by infection. Does inhibition of critical activators/inhibitors affect the levels of bacteria within the host during infection (for example, at early times in the progression of the pathology phenotypes)?</p><p>5) Are neoblasts depleted during normal infection-induced death or does the pathology mainly involve preventing neoblasts from repairing tissue quickly enough for recovery? This experiment would provide information about the mechanism of tissue pathology from infection.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> – The authors should perform double FISH to show that components of the TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module are expressed in the same cells in the gut and mesenchyme.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – p38 signaling dynamics data should be quantified and statistically analyzed. For example, it is not clear from the figures shown that the &quot;increase in punctate p38<sup>+</sup> cells&quot; in response to infection (3dpi) is a significant change. Also, the authors should verify whether the &quot;large nuclear dense mounds&quot; they observe in the gut lumen consist of &quot;P-p38<sup>+</sup> cells&quot; and not cellular debris. Should the cellular localization of P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal be nuclear? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> (5mpa), two of the three puncta (top- and bottom-most) do no co-localize with either nuclear DAPI or cytoplasmic mat1 staining. What does this P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal represent? The authors should perform double immunofluorescence with a gut antibody and anti-P-p38 to analyze the P-p38<sup>+</sup> cells at high resolution. It may be helpful for the readers if arrows are placed in each panel to show the location of P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal. What does the intense <italic>mat1</italic><sup>+</sup> signal represent in the gut lumen post-amputation (5mpa)? Is this cellular debris or non-specific staining?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16793.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> – By 16s rDNA deep sequencing, the authors find that the microbiomes of wild-type and lab-grown planarians share many genera.

To address this, we have sampled prominent culturable bacterial colonies from lab reared sexual worms. As no sexual strains are currently housed in recirculatory culture, we have taken worms from a fill and drain system which houses planaria strains in individual vessels and cycles planarian water. We sampled the culturable bacteria from worms 3 days after transition to static culture and found that they contained bacteria both similar to and distinct from those of asexuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>).

We have therefore performed qPCR for <italic>pgrp-1</italic> and <italic>pgrp-4</italic>, confirming significant up-regulation of <italic>pgrp-4</italic> following <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>). We have also further clarified our rationale for our choice of the IMD pathway and homologous pathway components for our screen. In our RNAseq data the cluster with the clearest enrichment in genes that correlated with increase in bacteria (cluster 1) also contained upstream components of this pathway. This, in combination with published data, lead us to a characterization of this pathway in this process. From our RNAseq we did not observe significant transcriptional changes in the other members of this pathway at the sampled time points, but the reviewers attest that we have identified many of these genes are functionally involved in and/or post-transcriptionally modified (p38-1 phosphorylation) in response to bacterial infection. Therefore, the section has been changed to the following:</p><p>“Of particular interest was cluster 1, consisting of genes upregulated gradually after exit from the recirculation system in the absence of antibiotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). […] This data as well as the established role of this pathway in immunity and apoptosis lead us to take a candidate based investigation of the role of inflammatory signaling pathways in altered tissue homeostasis and regeneration during infection.”</p><p><italic>3) By RNAi, the authors convincingly demonstrate that certain genes are activators/inhibitors of the conserved IMD pathway by reducing/enhancing pathological progression in response to infection. However, the epistasis analysis performed by combinatorial RNAi experiments is confounding and certain aspects of the pathway are quite different from what has already been worked out in Drosophila and mammalian models. For example, the authors place planarian cyld-1 epistatically downstream of Tak1, whereas in Drosophila and mouse models it acts upstream (CYLD is a deubiquitinating enzyme that physically interacts with Tak1 and regulates its ubiquitination). There is also equivalent evidence for placing Mkk4 upstream of PP6 rather than in parallel to the other genes, just as the other double RNAi outcomes were interpreted as indicative of a linear pathway. An explanation for such discrepancies could be that epistasis analysis using anything other than null alleles can be fraught with difficulties, especially when genes play roles in other developmental processes or if genetic redundancy is involved. Given the pitfalls of performing epistasis analysis by reduced-penetrance RNAi, the authors should either provide additional evidence supporting their divergent pathway or remove these data and the problematic pathway interpretations from the manuscript</italic> (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref></italic>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the evidence used to demonstrate epistasis in other more genetically tractable organisms and cell culture systems is more robust than our current methodologies. Therefore, it is difficult to resolve to what extent the differences relative to other species that we find in our analysis are attributable to distinct organization of this pathway in planaria versus the limitations of RNAi to effectively resolve these relationships. With respect to <italic>cyld-1</italic>, planaria in fact have four different <italic>cyld</italic> homologs. Therefore, while <italic>cyld-1</italic> was placed downstream of <italic>tak1</italic> and <italic>jnk</italic>, the position of <italic>cyld-2, cyld-3</italic>, or <italic>cyld-4</italic> could be more analogous to their hierarchy in Homo sapiens. Furthermore, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> CYLD functions in distinct manner relative to Homo sapiens. Rather than deubiquitinating TAK1 to regulate signaling, dCYLD deubiquitinates dTRAF2 to prevent proteolysis (Xue, Igaki, et.al. 2007). Given these differences between the roles of CYLD in Homo sapiens and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and the additional CYLD homologues in planaria, we cannot conclude that the placement of <italic>cyld-1</italic> relative to the other components is inherently flawed. Additionally, we did acknowledge in the manuscript text that mkk4 could be placed either upstream or lateral to the other pathway components but realize this could be further clarified and emphasized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>To address these concerns we have altered this section and figure to more accurately reflect the appropriate conclusions we can draw from this analysis. Rather than designate this as an epistatic demonstration of the planarian TAK1 pathway, we have changed it to a combinatorial RNAi experiment to uncover the Phenotype Hierarchy of RNAi effects. Additionally, we have reorganized <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to clarify to what extent this Phenotype Hierarchy is similar to or distinct from that of Homo sapiens.</p><p>The text now reads:</p><p>“The results of our analyses allowed us to order these components with respect to their roles in mediating anterior tissue in response to infection: <italic>mkk4, pp6, tak1, jnk, ppm1b, cyld-1, jun D, mkk6-1</italic>, and <italic>p38-1</italic>. […] Thus, it remains to be determined to what extent the phenotype hierarchy uncovered here reflects the true <italic>S. mediterranea</italic> TAK1 signaling cascade.”</p><p><italic>4) The identified activators/inhibitors could either influence infection clearance through an immune process or the host's ability to repair the damage caused by infection. Does inhibition of critical activators/inhibitors affect the levels of bacteria within the host during infection (for example, at early times in the progression of the pathology phenotypes)?</italic></p><p>To address the potential roles of activators/inhibitors in the immune response we infected worms with <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> and tracked both bacterial levels and pathological progression over time for both control, and candidate activator/inhibitor RNAi. This analysis revealed that (1) the planarian immune response is coordinated with but not the result of induced tissue degeneration and apoptosis, and (2) jun D (part of the downstream branch of our Phenotype Hierarchy) has a role in immune defense. We have added a new section and figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) to the manuscript:</p><p>“Downstream TAK1 signaling components have a role in the planarian immune response</p><p>We evaluated the potential role of TAK1 signaling pathway homologs in the planarian immune response. […] Thus, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infectioninduces a <italic>jun D</italic> and <italic>p38-1</italic> dependenttissue degeneration response in conjunction with a <italic>jun D</italic> dependent, <italic>p38-1</italic> independent immune response.”</p><p><italic>5) Are neoblasts depleted during normal infection-induced death or does the pathology mainly involve preventing neoblasts from repairing tissue quickly enough for recovery? This experiment would provide information about the mechanism of tissue pathology from infection.</italic></p><p>To address this we analyzed neoblast levels via WISH of the marker piwi during a time course of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection to look for overt effects on neoblast numbers over time. We found that while there was no obvious decrease in neoblast numbers we did observe some evidence that neoblast localization was altered during infection (less near the interior gut and more towards the periphery). We are following up on these results and have made the appropriate additions and modifications to the manuscript to reflect these findings.</p><p>Results section:</p><p>“Given that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> infection progressively compromised tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, E</xref>), we next determined whether neoblasts and regeneration potential were similarly affected. We analyzed neoblast levels and distribution using WISH analysis. While infected worms exhibited abundant numbers of <italic>piwi</italic><sup>+</sup> neoblasts both prior to and following tissue degeneration, the frequency of neoblasts within the interior of the animal relative to the periphery appeared to progressively decrease during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>).”</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>“Planaria may utilize TAK1 innate immune signaling for a coordinately mounting of antibacterial responses while actively clearing infected tissue via apoptosis prior to the initiation of regeneration. […] Under this context attenuation of infection-induced TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling rescued tissue degeneration and restored regenerative potential.”</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> – The authors should perform double FISH to show that components of the TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling module are expressed in the same cells in the gut and mesenchyme.</italic></p><p>We have performed double fluorescent WISH experiments and the results provide further evidence of the co-expression of TAK/MKK/p38 signaling components in the gut and mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>“WISH analysis of members of the TAK1/MKK/p38 signaling pathway revealed that these components were expressed in largely overlapping patterns of tissues along the planarian body axis. […] Weaker staining was also visible in the mesenchymal space between the gut and the epidermis with a slight anterior enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>—figure supplement C).”</p><p><italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> – p38 signaling dynamics data should be quantified and statistically analyzed. For example, it is not clear from the figures shown that the &quot;increase in punctate p38<sup>+</sup> cells&quot; in response to infection (3dpi) is a significant change. Also, the authors should verify whether the &quot;large nuclear dense mounds&quot; they observe in the gut lumen consist of &quot;P-p38<sup>+</sup> cells&quot; and not cellular debris. Should the cellular localization of P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal be nuclear? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> (5mpa), two of the three puncta (top- and bottom-most) do no co-localize with either nuclear DAPI or cytoplasmic mat1 staining. What does this P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal represent? The authors should perform double immunofluorescence with a gut antibody and anti-P-p38 to analyze the P-p38<sup>+</sup> cells at high resolution. It may be helpful for the readers if arrows are placed in each panel to show the location of P-p38<sup>+</sup> signal. What does the intense mat1<sup>+</sup> signal represent in the gut lumen post-amputation (5mpa)? Is this cellular debris or non-specific staining?</italic> </p><p>We have quantified and statistically analyzed P-p38 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>). We have also provided a higher resolution Z-series of the anterior gut demonstrating the co-localization of P-p38 signal with nuclei in the gut at 5 minutes post amputation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). The evidence of intact nuclei in close proximity to the observed signal is inconsistent with the reviewer’s hypothesis that this represents cellular debris. Additionally, previous studies have demonstrated that cytoplasmic p38 can localize to the nucleus in response to certain stimuli such as DNA damage (Wood, Thornton, et. Al 2009). As planarian gut specific antibodies are not commercially available and we do not currently have one that is compatible with our P-p38 staining protocol, we have instead performed P-p38 staining in combination with FISH of 4 independent gut RNA probes (<italic>mat1, porc, hnf4</italic>, and <italic>nkx-2.2</italic>) to address the reviewer’s concern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Arrows have been placed as a visual aid.</p><p>“We compared the kinetics of P-p38 activation in response to injury versus bacterial infection. […] Quantitative image analysis confirmed that while infection resulted in an increase in P-p38 fraction volume over time, amputation induced a sharp increase in both P-p38 fraction volume and average intensity followed by a gradual decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F, G</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
