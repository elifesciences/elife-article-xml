An influential but controversial idea is that a crucial function of sleep is to drive widespread downscaling of excitatory synaptic strengths. Here we used real-time sleep classification, <italic>ex vivo</italic> measurements of postsynaptic strength, and <italic>in vivo</italic> optogenetic monitoring of thalamocortical synaptic efficacy to ask whether sleep and wake states can constitutively drive changes in synaptic strength within the neocortex of juvenile rats. We found that miniature EPSC amplitudes onto L4 and L2/3 pyramidal neurons were stable across sleep and wake dense epochs in both primary visual (V1) and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Further, chronic monitoring of thalamocortical synaptic efficacy in V1 of freely behaving animals revealed stable responses across even prolonged periods of natural sleep and wake. Together these data demonstrate that sleep does not drive widespread downscaling of synaptic strengths during the highly plastic critical period in juvenile animals. Whether this remarkable stability across sleep and wake generalizes to the fully mature nervous system remains to be seen.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY025613</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turrigiano</surname><given-names>Gina G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group></article-meta></front><back><sec id="s1" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interest</title><fn fn-type="conflict" id="conf1"><p>The authors declare that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.
