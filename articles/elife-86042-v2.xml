adenocardinoma (PDAC) tumours. In this study, we characterised previously unexplored endogenous RELA-GFP dynamics in PDAC cell lines through live single-cell imaging. Our observations revealed that TNFα stimulation induces rapid, sustained, and non-oscillatory nuclear translocation of RELA. Through Bayesian analysis of single-cell datasets with variation in nuclear RELA, we predicted that RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cell lines is dependent on F-actin dynamics. RNA-seq analysis identified distinct clusters of RELA-regulated gene expression in PDAC cells, including TNFα-induced RELA upregulation of the actin regulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31. Further, siRNA-mediated depletion of ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 altered TNFα-stimulated nuclear RELA dynamics in PDAC cells, establishing a novel negative feedback loop that regulates RELA activation by TNFα. Additionally, we characterised the NF-κB pathway in PDAC cells, identifying how NF-κB/IκB proteins genetically and physically interact with RELA in the absence or presence of TNFα. Taken together, we provide computational and experimental support for interdependence between the F-actin network and the NF-κB pathway with RELA translocation dynamics in PDAC.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The prognosis for the most common type of pancreatic cancer, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, also known as PDAC, remains poor. Only around 4% of PDAC patients are likely to live 5 years after being diagnosed. The immune system plays a part in the progression of PDAC, as increased inflammation contributes to the growth of the tumour and its ability to resist treatment.</p><p>The NF-κB proteins of the immune system are transcription factors that control when and how much certain other proteins are produced. The protein RELA is an important member of the NF-κB family. It is known to be overactivated in PDAC tumours and may be responsible for the high levels of inflammation found in this type of pancreatic cancer. A better understanding of how RELA is activated in PDAC cells will help develop medicines targeting this process.</p><p>Butera et al. combined experimental and computational approaches to model a network of interactions between key molecules in lines of human PDAC cells grown in the laboratory to investigate how RELA is controlled. Usually, when the RELA protein is activated, it is located in the cell’s nucleus, this means that tracking the location of RELA within the cell can reveal its activated form. To follow RELA, it was labelled with a fluorescent marker and visualised using live, high-throughput fluorescence microscopy.</p><p>When RELA was activated with a pro-inflammatory molecule TNFα, it changed how it moved in and out of the cell’s nucleus. Using computational modelling approaches, Butera et al. could build a statistical model that revealed that the location and activity of RELA is affected by actin, a key component of the cell’s molecular scaffolding called the cytoskeleton.</p><p>When actin was disrupted, RELA's activity was altered. Moreover, profiling targets of RELA using RNA sequencing revealed two genes that encode proteins related to the regulation of actin. This indicates that RELA activity – which is itself affected by actin organisation – can feed back to regulate actin.</p><p>Butera et al. have identified genes regulated by RELA in PDAC cells that could be used as targets for anti-cancer drug development. Further research into the feedback between RELA and actin will help untangle the complex network that causes inflammation in pancreatic cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>NF-κB</kwd><kwd>RELA</kwd><kwd>PDAC</kwd><kwd>single-cell dynamics</kwd><kwd>TNF</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S_3567</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Butera</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK (CRUK) supported by Stand Up to Cancer UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C37275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakal</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Research UK (CRUK) supported by Stand Up to Cancer UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A20146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bakal</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A live imaging and computational approach reveals feedback loops involving F-actin dynamics that regulate the NF-κB transcription factor RELA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The NF-κB transcription factor RELA is an essential mediator of the inflammatory and immune responses in all mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayden et al., 2006</xref>) and is central to the canonical NF-κB signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghosh et al., 1998</xref>). As a transcription factor, RELA activation is controlled in large part through its localisation. Inactive RELA is sequestered in the cytoplasm by IκB proteins and IκB degradation by upstream cues, such as the potent inflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα), enables RELA translocation to the nucleus where RELA regulates gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DiDonato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zandi et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Live imaging experiments of fluorescently labelled RELA and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have shown that RELA oscillates between the nucleus and cytoplasm in response to TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zambrano et al., 2016</xref>). Oscillations are driven by a negative feedback loop between RELA and particular IκB isoforms since the genes encoding IκB proteins are RELA transcriptional targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref>). The pattern of RELA translocation has been shown to dictate the specificity and timing of RELA target gene expression, including the genes encoding IκBα, IκBε, and the chemokine RANTES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zambrano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lane et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we showed that cell shape is a regulator of RELA dynamics in breast cancer cell lines and that breast cancer cells with mesenchymal cell shape (protrusive with low cell–cell contacts) have higher RELA nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>). We also identified that RELA activity, coupled to cell shape, is predictive of breast cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sailem and Bakal, 2017</xref>). Although the mechanistic basis for how cell shape regulates RELA remains poorly understood, studies have shown that chemically inhibiting actin or tubulin dynamics can increase RELA binding to DNA and RELA-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosette and Karin, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Németh et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Despite frequent upregulation of both TNFα and RELA in PDAC tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weichert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>), the dynamics and regulation of single-cell RELA translocation, as well as RELA transcriptional output, are poorly understood for PDAC cells. Here, we used CRISPR-CAS9 to tag RELA with GFP in the human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 and identified rapid, non-oscillatory, and heterogeneous RELA dynamics by live imaging. To explore potential cytoskeletal or cell shape regulation of RELA in PDAC, we constructed Bayesian models using single-cell datasets from TNFα-stimulated PDAC cells with variation in RELA, actin, and tubulin measurements for hypothesis generation: one dataset with five PDAC cell lines and another with diverse small molecules targeting cytoskeletal components. Notably, nuclear RELA was statistically predicted as dependent on actin features across Bayesian models. Finally, we used RNA-seq to identify genes with distinct patterns of expression based on dependence on TNFα dose and RELA activation. Using live imaging with knockdown of selected targets, our results uncover novel mechanisms regulating inflammation-associated RELA dynamics in PDAC, including negative feedback loops between RELA and the actin modulators NUAK2 and ARHGAP31, and between RELA and the non-canonical NF-κB protein RELB.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-cell endogenous RELA responses to TNFα are non-oscillatory and sustained in PDAC cells</title><p>To study PDAC biology, we used the frequently studied human PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2 and PANC1, which harbour key genomic alterations in PDAC, including KRAS and p53 mutations and homozygous deletions in CDKN2A/p16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deer et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells are epithelial in origin but have distinct cell morphologies and are therefore useful for analysis of cell shape interaction with RELA. To study dynamic RELA localisation changes, we used CRISPR-CAS9 gene editing to fluorescently tag endogenous RELA at the C-terminus with eGFP (abbreviated as RELA-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). The C-terminus was selected to avoid interference with the N-terminal Rel homology domain, which contains the transactivation, nuclear import and DNA-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kieran et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nolan et al., 1991</xref>).

MIA PaCa2 cells responded with higher nuclear RELA compared to PANC1 cells at each TNFα dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Peak nuclear RELA, quantified as the first timepoint at which the slope of the single-cell RELA track ≤ 0, was statistically significantly different between 0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml for MIA PaCa2 but not for PANC1 cells, suggesting that MIA PaCa2 cells are more sensitive to TNFα dose in terms of RELA activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 10 ng/ml TNFα elicited a significantly higher nuclear RELA localisation amplitude in both cell lines compared to lower TNFα doses (0.01 and 0.1 ng/ml). In contrast, TNFα dose did not affect the time to peak RELA in MIA PaCa2 cells, while PANC1 cells displayed a slower time to peak at 0.01 ng/ml TNFα compared to higher doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We also compared RELA measurements within each single-cell track to assess the stability of nuclear RELA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In MIA PaCa2 cells, there is a high correlation between nuclear RELA at later timepoints (180, 300, or 600 min) compared to an early timepoint (60 min) following TNFα addition. PANC1 cells have high correlation between nuclear RELA measurements at 60 min RELA and 180 min, while there is weak correlation between RELA levels at 60 and 600 min. Thus, in MIA PaCa2, but not PANC1, RELA translocation at 60 min is largely predictive of the long-term response to TNFα and MIA PaCa2 cells maintain TNFα-induced nuclear RELA levels for an extended duration (10 hr) following exposure.</p><p>Overall, our data show that RELA nuclear translocation occurs rapidly, and with non-oscillatory dynamics in both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells in response to TNFα. Nuclear RELA translocation is largely sustained for hours in MIA PaCa2 cells, while damped in PANC1 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>RELA translocation responses to TNFα are cell cycle independent</title><p>To identify whether cell cycle progression contributes to heterogeneity in RELA responses to TNFα in PDAC cells, we categorised each tracked cell by cell cycle stage at the time of TNFα addition, using changes in the appearance and intensity of endogenous PCNA-Scarlet to mark cell cycle transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). For each cell, we calculated the amplitude and timing of peak nuclear RELA, in addition to the mean nuclear RELA intensity across all timepoints. Largely, there were minimal differences between cells by cell cycle stage in terms of peak RELA measurements (amplitude or timing) in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), with the exception of statistically significant lower peak RELA amplitude detected in G2 cells compared to S phase cells only, and exclusively for the MIA PaCa2 cell line at 10 ng/ml TNFα. Conversely, we identified statistically significant higher (whole track) mean nuclear RELA in G2 cells in the PANC1 cell line alone in response to 10 ng/ml TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Overall, nuclear RELA translocation in response to TNFα in PDAC cells appears to be largely cell cycle independent.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TNFα-mediated RELA heterogeneity in PDAC cells is predicted to be dependent on actin dynamics</title><p>Because the same TNFα concentration can lead to variable responses, we proposed that there are cell-intrinsic mechanisms that dictate the extent of RELA translocation in PDAC cells. Having previously identified relationships between cell shape and RELA localisation in breast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesised that differences in actin and tubulin organisation, which regulate cell shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machesky and Hall, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>), may explain differences in RELA dynamics. To test this, we expanded our dataset to include immunofluorescence images of the human immortalised PDAC cell lines MIA PaCa2, PANC1, Capan1, SW1990, and PANC05.04. We treated cells with TNFα (1 hr), or with solvent control, and stained for DNA, RELA, F-actin, and α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We used automated image analysis to segment cell regions and measured 35 geometric, cytoskeletal, and Hoechst features, as well as nuclear RELA, in approximately 130,000 cells. The 35 cell features were then reduced by hierarchical clustering to a subset of 10 features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Selected features include classical measurements of cell shape (‘cell area’, ‘cell roundness’, and ‘nucleus roundness’), mean measurements and texture analysis of actin and tubulin intensity in the cytoplasm, and the ratio of ‘actin filament area’ to ‘cell area’ which assays actin stress fibre abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We used principal component analysis (PCA) to assess the morphological diversity of the five PDAC cell lines using normalised data for cells under control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). PCA largely clustered data by cell line, indicating distinct cell morphology and cytoskeletal organisation between PDAC cell lines. PCA also validated that the reduced cell feature set is sufficient to capture the morphological heterogeneity in the PDAC lines. Notably, MIA PaCa2 cells scored low on several cell features due to these cells having particularly small cell area, distorted nuclei (low nucleus roundness), and low actin abundance. Moreover, in MIA Paca2 cells, actin is localised in areas of the cytoplasm distal to the membrane. In contrast, PANC1 cells have a notably high cell and nucleus roundness, as well as high membrane/cyt actin, indicating that actin in PANC1 cells is localised predominantly at the cortex.</p><p>Distributions of nuclear RELA in the five PDAC cell lines by immunofluorescence revealed highly heterogeneous RELA responses within and across the PDAC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To identify features that predict RELA localisation differences, we collated and incorporated normalised single-cell measurements across all PDAC cell lines and TNFα treatments into Bayesian networks, harnessing the observed variation in RELA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Bayesian network models apply statistical inference to heterogeneous experimental data to predict the conditional dependence of components on each other. Bayesian network models appear as influence diagrams consisting of nodes, each representing a measured feature, and arcs that depict predicted dependencies between the nodes. These dependencies represent linear and non-linear relationships, direct and indirect interactions, and illustrate multiple interacting nodes simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sachs et al., 2005</xref>).

This model indicated that nuclear RELA measurements are correlated to and predicted to be dependent on cytoplasmic actin and tubulin intensity, suggesting that cytoskeletal dynamics influence heterogeneity in nuclear RELA translocation with TNFα. Nuclear RELA is also predicted to be dependent on cell area, although with a lower strength of the probabilistic relationship compared to actin/tubulin, while nucleus roundness is predicted to be dependent on nuclear RELA. Interestingly, both actin texture and the ratio of membrane to cytoplasm actin are also predicted to be dependent on RELA, suggesting that RELA and actin dynamics are interdependent. Altogether, our data suggest that the influence of cell shape on RELA translocation we have previously described in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sailem and Bakal, 2017</xref>) is likely mediated through cytoskeletal changes.</p><p>To understand how inter-line differences in cytoskeletal organisation may influence RELA translocation dynamics, we additionally generated Bayesian network models by subsetting data by cell line and TNFα concentration.

Using live imaging and automated image analysis, we characterised RELA responses to the cytokine TNFα, which is upregulated with PDAC progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Strikingly, PDAC cells show atypical RELA dynamics compared to reports in cells from other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>), as we observed that PDAC cells maintain prolonged nuclear RELA localisation and RELA responses are cell cycle independent. However, we identified that a key difference between MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells is that MIA PaCa2 cells respond with higher and sustained RELA nuclear localisation compared to PANC1 cells, while PANC1 cells have a damped RELA response over time. Similar to other cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>), we found that RELA nuclear translocation in PDAC cells occurs immediately following TNFα addition and peak nuclear RELA localisation occurs around 1 hr post-TNFα.</p><p>The distinct RELA dynamics between PDAC cells with reports from other tissues may be attributed to the use of knock-in RELA-GFP in this study since many studies used exogenous RELA fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashall et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>). As RELA upregulates several genes involved in positive and negative feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collart et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Libermann and Baltimore, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scott et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sun et al., 1993</xref>), which we observed in the present study using RNA-seq, RELA overexpression could interfere with its intrinsic dynamics. Nonetheless, other studies that have tagged RELA endogenously did detect oscillations, including MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zambrano et al., 2016</xref>) and MCF7 breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Stewart-Ornstein and Lahav, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we identified that MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells in all cell cycle stages are responsive to 0.1 and 10 ng/ml TNFα, with minimal dissimilarities in RELA translocation responses between cell cycle stages in terms of mean nuclear RELA or the amplitude and timing of peak RELA. In contrast, RELA translocation responses to TNFα were identified in HeLa cells by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ankers et al., 2016</xref> as dependent on the cell cycle phase at the time of TNFα addition in a study using double thymidine block to synchronise cells, or Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) labelling to infer cell cycle phase. HeLa cells treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα in late G1 displayed a stronger response than the population average, while S-phase cells showed a suppressed or delayed response. Furthermore, RELA was found to interact with E2F1, a transcription factor regulating the G1 to S transition, in late G1 when E2F1 levels are highest during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ankers et al., 2016</xref>). Conflicting reports of whether TNFα-induced RELA translocation is cell cycle regulated may be due to cancer cell type-specific deregulation of cell cycle proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cordon-Cardo, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Otto and Sicinski, 2017</xref>) or RELA may not physically interact with E2F1 in PDAC cells in general or specifically in unsynchronised cells.</p><p>The high sensitivity of PDAC cells to TNFα and lack of oscillations suggest that PDAC cells may suppress negative feedback imposed by IκBα, as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hoffmann et al., 2002</xref> demonstrated that oscillations in NF-κB DNA binding are due to negative feedback with IκBα, which is encoded by a gene (<italic>NFKBIA</italic>) upregulated by NF-κB factors. Hoffman et al. also identified that cells with high IκBβ and IκBε expression, or absence of IκBα, lose oscillations stimulated by TNFα. These findings motivated our inspection into RELA interaction with IκB proteins and upregulation of IκB genes by TNFα in PDAC cells. Using co-immunoprecipitation of RELA with MIA PaCa2 cells, we found that RELA binds to IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε and binding to each is suppressed in high TNFα concentrations. However, contrary to our expectations based on the findings by Hoffmann et al., we did not observe RELA oscillations with <italic>NFKBIB</italic> or <italic>NFKBIE</italic> depletion in MIA PaCa2 or PANC1 cells, suggesting that the lack of RELA oscillations in these cell lines may be due to enhanced positive feedback and/or insufficient <italic>NFKBIA</italic> expression.</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation also revealed that the NF-κB protein REL had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα. This is in line with a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>) that endogenously fluorescently labelled RelA and c-Rel in double knockin mice and used fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy to probe for binding/dimerisation in primary ear fibroblasts to quantify the abundance of RelA:c-Rel heterodimers pre- and post-TNFα. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rahman et al., 2022</xref> identified that the relative abundance of the RelA:c-Rel dimer was higher in the nucleus of resting cells then higher in the cytoplasm of TNFα-stimulated cells, despite the individual concentrations of RelA and c-Rel increasing in the nucleus with TNFα. Our combined results suggest that binding of RELA and REL is reduced with TNFα in multiple cell types and in both human and mouse models.</p><p>We used Bayesian modelling as an unbiased and high dimensional approach to determine whether descriptors of cell shape and the cytoskeleton correlate with the observed heterogeneity in RELA localisation, having previously used Bayesian modelling to show that RELA localisation in breast cells is strongly dependent on neighbour contact, cell area, and protrusiveness in the presence and absence of TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sero et al., 2015</xref>). In the present study, we extended the analysis to include measurements of actin and tubulin organisation. Since Bayesian modelling relies on heterogeneity in measurements to make predictions, we used a dataset with five PDAC cell lines with high intra- and inter-line variability in RELA, as well as distinct cell shape and cytoskeleton features between the cell lines. We independently ran Bayesian modelling with a dataset of cells with perturbation of the cytoskeleton using small molecules, based on the seminal study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sachs et al., 2005</xref> that used Bayesian inference to derive cell signalling networks. Consistently among our models, differences in cytoplasmic actin intensity, as well as measures of actin localisation (cortical versus cytoplasmic actin), were predictive of differences in nuclear RELA between single PDAC cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the Bayesian-inferred arrows in the RELA network generated from TNFα-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) sometimes point in opposite directions compared to the network from cells treated with biochemical inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This arises from the inherent properties and flexibility of Bayesian networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scutari et al., 2018</xref>). These networks use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent global probability distributions broken down into smaller local distributions, ensuring no loops or cycles. Multiple valid DAG configurations can exist, so the dependence between two variables A and B can be represented as either A→B or B→A if both are probabilistically equivalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heckerman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Scutari, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Scutari et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, reversing an arc can leave the overall network structure unchanged as long as local distributions remain consistent with the data.</p><p>One route through which cytoskeletal structures may influence RELA dynamics is by inducing changes in TNF receptor turnover or conformation. In the literature, evidence exists for the modulation of nuclear RELA by actin and tubulin inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Németh et al., 2004</xref>), in addition to TNFα/RELA regulation of the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Georgouli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huber et al., 2004</xref>). However, there is limited evidence for cytoskeletal regulation of TNF receptors. One example is that the actin-binding protein Filamin interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), which is not itself a TNF receptor but is involved in TNF receptor intracellular signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonardi et al., 2000</xref>). On a related topic, a recently published study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alraies et al., 2024</xref>) subjected dendritic cells to space confinement and found upregulation of the chemokine receptor <italic>Ccr7</italic>, in a manner dependent on expression and function of IKKβ and the lipid metabolism enzyme cPLA<sub>2</sub>. In turn, the prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptor (PGE<sub>2</sub>) receptor, which is in the cPLA<sub>2</sub> pathway, induces NF-κB nuclear translocation. This study also identifies the role of ARP2/3 activity in regulating cPLA<sub>2</sub> activation via nuclear envelope tensioning. Interestingly, transcriptomics of confined cPLA<sub>2</sub><sup>WT</sup> and cPLA<sub>2</sub> <sup>KO</sup> dendritic cells revealed correlated expression between <italic>Ccr7</italic>, the gene encoding IKKβ (<italic>Ikbkb</italic>), and the major subunits of ARP2/3 (<italic>Actr2</italic> and <italic>Actr3</italic>). Overall, the impact of cytoskeletal dynamics on TNF receptors remains a source for further study.</p><p>To identify potential regulatory loops involving RELA in PDAC, we used RNA-seq analysis with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells treated with varying TNFα doses +/-IκB-SR. We identified 254 genes significantly regulated by TNFα, which may be viewed as candidates for targeting NF-κB signalling or output in PDAC. Identifying novel targets for PDAC is important as the 5-year survival rate of non-resected PDAC patients has remained unchanged from 1975 to 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bengtsson et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, RELA is hyperactive in 50–70% of PDAC tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Weichert et al., 2007</xref>) and contributes to both cancer progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujioka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Melisi et al., 2009</xref>) and resistance to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kunnumakkara et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Of note, we present the first evidence that <italic>ARHGAP31</italic> is a transcriptional target of TNFα or RELA. Moreover, ARHGAP31 is not previously associated with pancreatic cancer, but has well-studied roles in actin modulation, since ARHGAP31 is the human orthologue for the mouse protein CdGAP (mCdc42 GTPase-activating protein) and ARHGAP31 inactivates the GTPases CDC42 and RAC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lamarche-Vane and Hall, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tcherkezian et al., 2006</xref>). CDC42 is involved in the formation of premigratory filopodia in PDAC cells and promotes invasiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Razidlo et al., 2018</xref>), while RAC1 expression is required for the development of PDAC tumours, in addition to the formation of the ADM and PanIN precursors in KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heid et al., 2011</xref>), indicating that RAC1 may play a role in actin remodelling during PDAC initiation.</p><p>Our results also demonstrate that TNFα upregulates RNA expression of the kinase-encoding gene <italic>NUAK2</italic> (SNARK), while <italic>NUAK2</italic> expression is abrogated in the presence of IκB-SR. Our identification of a feedback loop between RELA nuclear translocation and <italic>NUAK2</italic> expression is analogous to prior findings that NUAK2 increases the activity of the mechanosensitive transcriptional coactivator YAP through stimulation of actin polymerisation and myosin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan et al., 2018</xref>). A potential source for further study could consider myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), a substrate for NUAK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>) that is reported to mediate NUAK2 regulation of actin stress fibres in growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vallenius et al., 2011</xref>). From a therapeutic perspective, NUAK2 may be a promising target to follow-up for potential use in PDAC therapy as kinases contain an ATP-binding cleft that is a druggable pocket and can contain additional druggable sites distal to the ATP or substrate binding pockets conferring inhibitor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lamba and Ghosh, 2012</xref>). However, NUAK2 is a prognostic marker for PDAC and is associated with a favourable prognosis according to The Human Protein Atlas, which proposes a potential tumour suppressor role for NUAK2 in PDAC, suggesting that enhancing NUAK2 may be a favourable strategy for PDAC. Therefore, our data provide an incentive for the exploration of a RELA-NUAK2 signalling axis in PDAC progression and response to therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Further information and requests for resources should be directed to and will be fulfilled by Chris Bakal (chris.bakal@icr.ac.uk).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>Cell lines were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).

Image analysis was performed using custom image analysis scripts created and executed on PerkinElmer’s Columbus 2.6.0 software platform. Scripts detected and segmented individual nuclei using Hoechst and the cytoplasm using tubulin, or RELA when tubulin is not included in the staining set. Cells touching the image border are filtered out and neighbour contact (% cell border touching another cell) for each remaining cell is calculated. The nuclear region is reduced by 1 px from the nuclear outer border from Hoechst segmentation and the ring region is set as the area 2 px to 6 px outside of the nuclear outer border. Intensities of all stains are calculated in all segmented regions on a single-cell level. Nuclear RELA measurements refer to the mean RELA signal (mean pixel intensity) in the nucleus, that is, the total RELA signal divided by the area of the nucleus.</p><p>A total of 32 geometric, cytoskeletal, and Hoechst features were measured in addition to measurements of RELA/RELA-GFP. Texture features were calculated using SER methods with region normalisation. Bright and Spot textures were smoothed to a kernel of 4 px to detect large patches (bundles) of actin/tubulin. Ridge texture was non-smoothed to detect sharp ridges (filaments) of actin/tubulin. Elongatedness was calculated as ((2 * Cell Length)<sup>2</sup>/Cell Area). Actin filament area was measured using Columbus’s ‘Find Spots’ function applied to the actin channel. Neighbour contact was calculated using an inbuilt Columbus algorithm calculating the percentage of a cell’s border in contact with other cell borders. Grouped neighbour contact measurements were generated from non-normalised data rounded to the nearest multiple of 10.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live cell imaging and analysis</title><p>MIA PaCa2 RELA-GFP PCNA-Scarlet and PANC1 RELA-GFP PCNA-Scarlet cells were seeded (1000 cells/well) in a 384-well plate 1 day prior to imaging.

Nuclear RELA and PCNA intensities were measured using Nuclitrack software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barr et al., 2017</xref>), with 50–60 cells tracked per treatment, cell line, and biological replicate (n = 2). Nuclear intensity (RELA or PCNA) is calculated as the total intensity in the nucleus region divided by the nucleus area. Cells were tracked for 10 hr following TNFα treatment while the total 48 hr imaging period was used to ascertain cell fate (division or death). Each biological replicate consisted of eight technical (well) replicates per cell line and treatment.

Solid evidence is provided using quantitative live-cell imaging of pancreatic cancer cell lines. These analyses better establish the connection of cell shape to the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, highlighting the importance of the actin network and several specific regulators in a feedback loop controlling NF-kappaB activity. Because NF-κB controls inflammation and cell survival, this study will be of interest in the fields of cancer and immune signaling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86042.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Albeck</surname><given-names>John G</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05rrcem69</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Sung</surname><given-names>Myong-Hee</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/049v75w11</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Actin networks modulate heterogenous NF-κB dynamics in response to TNFα&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including John G Albeck as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Myong-Hee Sung (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication in its current form by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, while the reviewers found the approach and overall message of the paper to be potentially of significant interest, a number of concerns were raised about the methodology and inconsistencies within the data. After consultation, the reviewers came to the consensus that the results as they currently stand are insufficient to support the main conclusion of the paper. The main concerns are as follows:</p><p>1. The &quot;cytoplasmic ring&quot; method is not an appropriate approach to quantifying the nuclear/cytosolic ratio of RelA in this study. Although this approach is commonly used in the field, it is sensitive to changes in cell shape, raising the possibility that associations based on this measure could be artifacts. The reviewers have made a number of suggestions for how this issue could be mitigated and controlled.</p><p>2. The overall evidence for a causal relationship between actin morphology and NF-κB signaling is insufficient to support the main conclusion. Bayesian network analysis is useful for uncovering statistical relationships, but it cannot be used to make hard conclusions about causality. While pharmacological perturbations could in principle be used to support the associations identified by the Bayesian network analysis, the results from these experiments were inconsistent and seemingly contradictory: in some cases where the drug treatments modified the actin structures implicated by the network analysis, no clear effect on NF-κB was observed.</p><p>3. The differences in NF-κB signaling in the two PDAC cell types examined by live-cell imaging, both between the lines and between these lines and other cell types in the literature, raise significant questions that are not addressed in adequate detail to conclude that negative feedback is simply weaker in these cells. The data suggest that these cells diverge significantly from how the pathway works in other cells types. At a minimum, this difference must be presented more carefully, and it would greatly strengthen the paper if negative feedback genes could be analyzed to provide an explanation for the unusual behavior of the pathway in these cells.</p><p>While these issues prevent <italic>eLife</italic> from further considering this paper in its current form, we would be open to considering a new submission in which these issues are addressed, attempting to reach the same reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors set out to profile the kinetics of RELA translocation in pancreatic cancer cells. RELA translocation is a widely studied event that occurs in response to a number of inflammatory stimuli, and the authors begin by profiling RELA translocation kinetics in two PDAC cell lines. Relative to other cell lines where this analysis has been performed, the two PDAC cell lines show more sustained signaling (to different extents), rather than oscillatory nuclear localization. Like many other cell lines that have been studied, the authors observe a large degree of heterogeneity in RELA translocation within cells stimulated with physiological doses of TNF. A thorough analysis based on a knock-in PCNA marker reveals that this heterogeneity is not linked to the cell cycle. The authors then hypothesize the connection between actin morphology based on their previous work, and turn to an analysis of 5 PDAC cell lines, using a fixed-cell immunofluorescence assay to quantify RELA translocation, F-actin, and tubulin in each cell. From images of thousands of fixed cells, a series of statistical analyses are used to identify correlations between cytoskeletal morphology and RELA nuclear abundance. This approach reveals clear associations between certain cytoskeletal features and RELA translocation, with substantial differences between cell lines. A follow-up experiment correlates live-cell RELA kinetics with fixed-cell cytoskeletal stains, which provides further support for their associations. Finally, they perturb actin and tubulin function with a variety of chemical agents and quantify the resulting effects on live-cell RELA kinetics. This again shows variation between cell lines but confirms that direct perturbation of cytoskeletal processes can modulate the ability of TNF to stimulate RELA translocation. Together, these lines of evidence provide substantial support for the hypothesis that NF-κB signaling can be modulated downstream of changes in actin dynamics. While there is significant variation in how this works between cell lines, which suggests that a broader exploration of other cell lines will be needed in the future, the data shown here are, with some limitations noted below, adequate to support the authors' hypothesis.</p><p>A major strength of this manuscript is its use of quantitative imaging to exploit the existing heterogeneity between cells at a physiological dose of TNF. A series of clever analysis methods are used to draw out correlations that can be found between actin morphology (immunostained) and RELA translocation (either immunostained or by live-cell microscopy). Also important is the careful characterization of NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells, where this pathway is known to play a role. Importantly, RELA kinetics are assessed using a knock-in fluorescent protein tag, avoiding potential artifacts from overexpression. An interesting feature of this analysis is the use of Bayesian networks to model the dependencies of actin features; to my knowledge, this is a novel use of this algorithm. The drug perturbation data are also beautifully presented, in a way that reveals the full complexity of the cellular responses. In general, the data and conclusions are very clearly presented, and the authors do not shy away from describing the context-dependent intricacies of their observations. The main conclusion that NF-κB signaling is strongly affected by actin dynamics ties together two major signaling axes in cancer cells, and would be of interest to the many researchers working in these two areas. The methods used to show associations at the single-cell level will also have a significant impact on others working with mixtures of live and fixed single-cell data.</p><p>There are several weaknesses that limit the interpretability of the findings:</p><p>1. It is not clear how the effects of cell shape changes on the recorded nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio are controlled for. Cell shape is a major variable in this study and can alter the apparent (recorded) intensity of nuclear and cytoplasmic stains in many imaging and analysis pipelines, independent of any actual changes in a marker's localization. Without such an assessment, it isn't clear whether differences in RELA behavior (the main observation in the paper) are influenced by how the detection process treats cells with different morphologies.</p><p>2. It is not clear whether the cytoskeleton-linked effects are specific to RELA, or rather reflect more widespread changes in nuclear import/export rates. There are reports that changes in actin function can alter nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation (for example, PMIDs 16120220, 31444357). Understanding whether the observed actin-dependent effect on NF-κB localization is unique to this signaling pathway, or a non-specific effect on multiple pathways is important to the interpretation of the findings.</p><p>3. It is difficult to assess the importance of the observed differences in RELA translocation without additional information on the pathway's output. Translocation of RELA is an important marker and is known to modulate many downstream genes involved in inflammation. However, given the differences in RELA behavior observed here in PDAC cells, it is difficult to extrapolate from previous work to evaluate whether the actin-modulated changes impact RELA's transcriptional effects. Establishing that such differences exist would be important to conclude that actin shape changes have a biologically significant effect on NF-κB signaling with the potential to alter cellular behavior.</p><p>Suggestions that would have a major impact on the interpretability of the study:</p><p>1. NF-κB target gene expression, either at the RNA or protein level, should be assessed using a method of the authors' choice. Immunofluorescence for known NF-κB targets could be performed and coupled to the single-cell analysis, comparing expression levels between cells with different actin morphological features. Alternatively, bulk RNA or protein measurements for NF-κB targets could be made on cells treated vs. untreated with actin-perturbing agents.</p><p>2. It should also be established whether actin-mediated changes in nuclear import/export are restricted to RelA or occur more generally. Changes in overall nuclear import/export could be assessed using an NLS/NES-containing fluorescent protein reporter, followed by leptomycin B treatment, in a similar setup to the RelA translocation assay. A number of other methods would also be possible, such as testing whether other nuclear localization-based signaling reporters show differences in cells with different actin parameters.</p><p>3. The effects of cell shape on the recorded nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio should be quantified. This could be done using generic cytoplasmic and nuclear markers (ideally ones that do not translocate significantly), and testing whether their N/C ratio varies between cells of different shapes/morphological classes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The work by Butera et al. investigates the relationship between the cellular cytoskeleton and NFkB dynamic response to TNF. The authors use single-cell fixed and live cells measurements of RelA dynamics and cellular morphology, pharmacological perturbations, and extensive statistical analysis to draw specific conclusions on what aspects of the actin cytoskeleton modulate TNF-dependent NFkB response. I have identified multiple issues that raise concerns that the conclusions of this paper are not supported by the data presented.</p><p>1. The possibility of confounding factors between cell morphology and the approach used by the authors to analyze NFkB dynamics (Figure 1D). The analysis of NFkB dynamics presented here is based on an image segmentation strategy that relies on a single marker, PCNA, and segmentation of the nucleus and &quot;ring&quot; around the nucleus. This strategy should only be applied in contexts where cell shape is not changing and is not a key factor in the investigation and it cannot be used to investigate the dependency of NFkB on cell shape. The main issue is that the &quot;ring&quot; is not a good proxy for the actual concentration of the fluorescent marker in the cytoplasm. For example, in a case where the marker (RelA-GFP in this case) is not changing, the measurement of the &quot;cytoplasmic&quot; signal can change as the cell spreads from a rectangular shape with limited lamellipodia to a cell that is very spread with thin lamellipodia. This change does not mean that the concentration of the marker in the cytoplasm changed, it just reveals the use of &quot;ring&quot; as a proxy is limited. This puts the key measurement of this work in doubt as it is the key theme throughout this paper. To give just one example, as the number of &quot;neighbor contact&quot; increases, cells tend to have thicker and less spread morphology (i.e. they are just denser in culture). Thicker cells will have more cytoplasm in the &quot;ring&quot; compared to very spread cells and therefore the denominator of RelA will be bigger that will cause the overall RelA ratio to be smaller which is exactly what the authors show in Figure 4D. Just to be clear, this is not just an issue with cell thickness, the estimation of total cytoplasmic intensity from a &quot;ring&quot; inherently depends on cell morphology. Therefore, one simply cannot state that RelA activation itself depends on cell morphology using this analysis method.</p><p>2. Bayesian network analysis does not provide a causal relationship. The authors make extensive use of Bayesian networks (BN) for inferences of dependencies (Figures 3 and 4). In this analysis, the authors aim to identify the direction of dependency between different nodes in the BN. This is problematic for two reasons. First, The direction of arrows in bayesian networks does not imply causations (i.e. modulation). The direction of arrows in BN only represents correlation and the directionality should not be interpreted as causative. Yet the authors clearly make a key distinction whether RelA depends on a morphological feature or whether the feature depends on RelA. In the literature that the authors cite (e.g. Sachs et al. 2005) pharmacological perturbation is used to infer causation, not the inference of the structure of the BN. Second, the authors did not consider that other factors, not included in the model, could influence both RelA and morphology. For example, if an unknown kinase changes both NFKB and a specific cellular feature the inferred network will still look the same. Therefore, the conclusion that actin-based cellular features modulate (i.e. cause) differences in RelA dynamics is simply unsupported by the BN analysis.</p><p>3. Lack of support by pharmacological data. Beyond correlation analysis, the authors used a pharmacological approach to show that manipulation of the cytoskeleton causes changes in RelA dynamics. The data presented in Figures 1-5 makes specific predictions. If one is to interpret the arrows in the BN as the authors present them, one will conclude that perturbations of features like &quot;nuclear roundness&quot; that was presented as key &quot;modulator&quot; of RelA dynamics will cause a change in RelA dynamics. The vast majority of the pharmacological perturbations used by the authors, even those that caused &gt;2 SD change in &quot;nuclear roundness&quot;, had very little impact on RelA dynamics. In my reading, this directly invalidates the core conclusion made by the authors on the ability of the actin cytoskeleton to modulate RelA dynamics.</p><p>The only drug that seemed to show a meaningful impact (my interpretation as rigorous statistical analysis of this that includes correction of multiple hypotheses is missing) was SMIFH2 which downregulates Formin activity. Naively, I googled &quot;SMIFH2 off target&quot; and found multiple publications suggestions that SMIFH2 has putative off target effects on other proteins such as Myosin (PMID: 33589498) but also completely unrelated targets such as P53 (PMID: 25925024). Therefore I find that the data presented in Figure 6, rather than supporting the authors' conclusion effectively invalidate it.</p><p>4. The values of RelA nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio are different across the figures in ways that I was unable to follow. In figures 1-2 the values are ~0.9-1.4. In figures 3B and 4D the same cell lines show a range of 0-3, and 0-5. Figure 3D shows RelA on a log10 scale with values are from -0.5 to 1.5 (3-33 on a linear scale). As it is presented now, this data limits the ability to draw conclusions based on RelA values across figures.</p><p>5. The authors perform cluster analysis followed by ANOVA between the clusters. This is problematic and is known as &quot;double-dipping&quot; and it could invalidate the statistical inference (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02936). As the authors don't really use the clusters for any of their conclusions, the grouping can be avoided and analysis done directly on RelA values using correlation analysis with key features. As the authors effectively show in Figure 5A that a simple measure (RelA at 60min) is basically equivalent to cluster identity, this could substantially simplify the work and many of the panels in Figure 2 could be removed.</p><p>6. The statement made by the authors about the differences in negative feedback signaling between the two cell lines (line 153) is presented as a conclusion when in fact it is a reasonable hypothesis that is not supported by any of the data shown in the manuscript.</p><p>7. The features selected after feature selection are referred to as &quot;independent features&quot;, yet the PCA data shown by the authors clearly show that they are not independent of each other.</p><p>8. The statement regarding the tSNE analysis (lines 279-282 and Figure 5B) is incorrect as tSNE does not preserve distance metrics and therefore proximity of points in tSNE space is not indicative of actual similarity (see: https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/).</p><p>9. A more subtle version of the &quot;double-dipping&quot; problem mentioned in point 5 above exists in Figure 5CD. When the features tested are correlated with the features used to create the clusters, one cannot simple ANOVA between the clusters for statistical inference.</p><p>10. The inferred strengths of the arcs in the BN analysis don't fully support the authors' interpretations. For example, in Figure 4C the connection between all morphological features and RelA is very low (2-50) compared to other arcs in the same network (arc lengths are around a few hundreds with max at 4095).</p><p>11. The statistical significance of the pharmacological perturbation on RelA should be presented including controls for multiple hypothesis testing.</p><p>Specific recommendations:</p><p>The dynamic of NFkB can be assessed directly by the nuclear fraction without the cytoplasmic values. This could avoid many of the challenges related to issue 1. Care should still be taken to verify that nuclear signal doesn't vary and creates dependency, but this is much easier compared to the &quot;ring&quot;. This is especially true for knock-ins used by the authors where there is no need to &quot;normalized out&quot; ectopic high overexpression levels.</p><p>Cluster analysis followed by statistical inference should be avoided and direct inference on the features used for analysis should be done instead.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors present a deep investigation of the relationship between cell morphology, actin cytoskeletal features and NF-kappaB RELA signaling dynamics. Quantitative live-cell imaging of endogenous RELA (using CRISPR knock-in) and data analyses are leveraged to provide insight into the little-understood roles of actin networks in inflammatory responses of PDAC cells to TNF-α. While the focus is clearly on cell shapes and cytoskeletal features, it will help put the study in the context of others if the PDAC cells are better characterized in terms of the negative feedback loops of NF-kappaB, such as IkappaB α or IkappaB epsilon proteins. As the authors indicated, these results altogether may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions for PDAC.</p><p>1. As the authors mentioned in Discussion (lines 370-373 &quot;…, other studies reported more rapid cytoplasmic REL relocalisation…&quot;), the rapid fall of nuclear RelA (around 40 minutes after TNF-α) has widely been reported by several groups (Alexander Hoffmann, Michael White, Markus Covert, Myong-Hee Sung, Savas Tay and their colleagues), but is absent in both PDAC lines. This indicates that the negative feedback genes such as IkappaB α/epsilon or A20 may have very different kinetics if they are induced at all in these cells. It seems important to determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines. RTqPCR of a few key negative feedback genes in the parental and derived reporter cells, as well as a control cell line (HeLa, MCF10, or THP-1) would be a straightforward way to answer this question. While this is not the focus of the study, I think that understanding which feedback is dysfunctional is probably relevant for therapeutic strategies against PDAC. It would also help the NF-kappaB signaling community understand the common and distinct features of dynamics observed in different cell systems.</p><p>2. On page 7 lines 154-155 &quot;… negative feedback regulation is intact in PANC1…&quot; is too simplistic, given the very slow fall of nuclear RELA even in PANC1. See comment #1 above. It looks like IkappaB feedback genes are strongly compromised in both PDAC lines. Again, this could be an important feature of PDAC and needs to be verified as suggested above. The evaluation of gene induction by RTqPCR would also be reassuring that the C-terminal fusion of RELA is transcriptionally as active as the native RELA protein, even though the EGFP is tagging the transactivation domain (important for NF-kappaB recruitment of co-factors and transcriptional machinery to the target chromatin).</p><p>3. Figure 5 has data that will be of broad interest to the community, and I was hoping to glean some recurring theme about what features may affect NF-kappaB signaling. The key results seem to be in 5C-E, but it is not easy to read off which relationships may be shared between the two PDAC lines. It will be helpful if all the ten features are shown for each cell line to see an overall pattern, even though some may fall below statistical significance. 'Actin filament/cell area' shows opposite trends in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1. It seems like 'neighbor contact' was the only feature shared by the two cell lines based on the Bayesian analysis. This was somewhat dissatisfying because it complicates any extrapolating speculations of these findings to other cell systems. But the authors seem to have done a thorough analysis using both ANOVA and Bayesian methods.</p><p>4. Cytoskeletal structures may influence rates of oligomerization or recycling of the cell surface receptors for TNF-α. Any thoughts on such indirect effects through the upstream signaling events of NF-kappaB activation?</p><p>5. The color scheme used in heatmaps (e.g. Figure 2 panels C and I) is problematic because the white is for both the strongest RelA ratio and NAs (missing values). Please use a different color scheme.</p><p>6. Figure 2-supplement 1E seems to show M1-M4 labels mixed up. Please check.</p><p>7.

The authors have made significant changes to their image processing methods and Bayesian network modeling presentation, which in my opinion are adequate to answer the critiques raised on these points. Perhaps the largest change to the manuscript is the inclusion of an RNA-seq experiment and follow-up with knockdowns of genes of interest found in this dataset. The strongest point of this addition is that it is used to investigate the mediators of negative feedback and their differences between the two cell lines analyzed. The RNA-seq data are also used to make a connection between NF-κB activity and actin regulation, which as discussed below, makes less of an impact on the overall conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Overall, the changes do significantly strengthen the manuscript, but some revisions are still needed to fully integrate the new data.</p><p>1. By displaying NF-κB localization strictly as nuclear intensity, they avoid the difficulty of using a cytoplasmic ring to calculate nuclear/cytoplasmic intensity, a measurement that can be affected by the cell shape changes induced in their study. However, their description of the method lacks a few details – in particular, is the nuclear intensity calculated as the total RELA signal per nucleus, or the average pixel intensity over the nuclear region (line 567)? Also, the ring method is still used in the fixed cell measurements; it would be helpful to comment in more detail on the previous work that supports the insensitivity of this measurement to cell shape changes (the authors refer to Sero 2015 in their response, but it isn't clear to me where in that manuscript the ring method's response to cell shape is evaluated).</p><p>2. The addition of RNA-seq analysis provides a significant amount of new data, and the inclusion of the IkB super repressor is a nice feature of this dataset that helps increase its interpretability. However, overall this addition feels incomplete. There doesn't appear to be any description of the relevant experimental procedures in the methods section. Also, the conclusions from these experiments seem somewhat indistinct. Two actin-regulating genes, NUAK1 and ARHGEF31, are identified as targets of NF-κB, and it is shown that their knockdown modestly changes RELA translocation kinetics. However, this finding doesn't address the question of whether the actin-mediated modulation of NF-κB, which is the focus of the first part of the paper, has a functional role in altering gene expression. Thus, the last section is potentially useful, but a bit confusing in juxtaposition to the first part of the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have improved the manuscript extensively both in terms of re-analysis and re-organization of the original data and newly added experimental data and results. I appreciate the effort invested in carrying out such a major revision in response to the original comments from me and other reviewers. Many of my comments have been addressed fully or are no longer relevant in the revised version. The authors performed RNA-seq and GFP-trap experiments partly to address my concern about understanding the core regulatory circuit of NF-kappaB in these PDAC cells. However, some details are missing, and clarifications are needed in several places. While there are numerous points to commend about in this much improved version, in the interest of space, I focus here on remaining issues that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>New comments:</p><p>1. The authors note that &quot;the time to peak RELA was highly heterogenous&quot; (line 103). It seems like their definition is different from what other groups have been using. Instead of detecting the *time to the first peak*, it seems like the reported time to peak is catching the *time to maximum value* of nuclear RELA. This is apparent in Figure 1C (easier to see on the right side, e.g. dose response plot of MIA PaCa), where the first peak occurs earlier for the higher TNF dose (which many groups have reported to be valid in multiple cell types. For example, shown by Markus Covert, MH Sung, Michael White, etc). But the panel 1E shows the time to peak is more than 100 minutes (unit is missing in the y axis, by the way), while panel 1C shows a rapid first peak (e.g. &lt; 30 min for 10 ng/ml TNF). I suggest the authors update their definition of time to peak and provide a more accurate quantification of the dose-dependent timing of first peak (well established in the field). With the revised definition, the time to peak may be actually not so heterogenous between individual cells (based on the data spread in panel 1C time course plots). Moreover, the time to peak of 100 minutes is not compatible with the choice of 1 hour TNF treatment in the subsequent immunofluorescence analysis. This needs to be corrected.</p><p>2. There are a few puzzling disconnects between Figure 3 Supplement panels 1A and 1A'-A'. For example, the authors interpret the data in these statements: &quot;<italic>NFKB2</italic> is only affected by IκB-SR induction in PANC1 cells (Figure 3 – Supplement 1A).&quot;, &quot;NFKB1 is unaffected by RELA-inactivation by IκB-SR in both cell lines&quot;, &quot;NFKBIA and NFKBIB were not significantly impacted by RELA inactivation in either cell line, while NFKBIE expression was reduced with IκB-SR in PANC1&quot;. But looking at panel 1A, <italic>NFKB2</italic> induction is absent in MiaPaCa with IkB-SR; NFKB1 induction is also affected at 5h in both cell lines; NFKBIA induction is off but instead, the constitutive expression is higher (which indicates a high basal transcriptional activity either by NFkB or other TFs like glucocorticoid receptor). Are these simply an outcome of the statistical testing criteria? The discrepancy seems too numerous and pronounced to warrant some double-checking and/or explanation.</p><p>3. How was knockdown efficiency assessed (other than RELA) in the data of Figure 4? Individual cells may show significant heterogeneity in siRNA knockdown (which is different from the RELA siRNA), so I wonder if some of the single cell traces may be from those that didn't have a reduced abundance of the target protein (as well as the mRNA).</p><p>4. In line 122 &quot;…no differences between cells by cell cycle stage in terms of peak RELA measurements…&quot;, it will be good to note that this is in contrast to Michael White's report on cell cycle dependence (Ankers et al. https://elifesciences.org/articles/10473). It is important to note that the crosstalk between cell cycle and NFkB is cell type specific.</p><p>5. Regarding the result &quot;Interestingly, the NF-κB protein REL also had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα.&quot;, there is a recent publication (Rahman SMT et al. https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)01556-X) reporting that the RelA:c-Rel heterodimer was depleted in the nucleus of TNF-α activated fibroblasts. This reviewer, being the senior author of the study, can't help but find this quite remarkable, and I think that the corroboration might be noteworthy in interpreting the GFP-Trap data.</p><p>6. Figure 2: The Bayesian-inferred arrows are sometimes in opposite directions between panel C and panel F (drug treatment data). Any explanations that can help readers understand would be good.</p><p>7. Figure 1-Supplement 1 panel A: Please specify that these images are from PCNA.</p><p>8.

As the authors mentioned in Discussion (lines 370-373 &quot;…, other studies reported more rapid cytoplasmic REL relocalisation…&quot;), the rapid fall of nuclear RelA (around 40 minutes after TNF-α) has widely been reported by several groups (Alexander Hoffmann, Michael White, Markus Covert, Myong-Hee Sung, Savas Tay and their colleagues), but is absent in both PDAC lines. This indicates that the negative feedback genes such as IkappaB α/epsilon or A20 may have very different kinetics if they are induced at all in these cells. It seems important to determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines. RTqPCR of a few key negative feedback genes in the parental and derived reporter cells, as well as a control cell line (HeLa, MCF10, or THP-1) would be a straightforward way to answer this question. While this is not the focus of the study, I think that understanding which feedback is dysfunctional is probably relevant for therapeutic strategies against PDAC. It would also help the NF-kappaB signaling community understand the common and distinct features of dynamics observed in different cell systems.</p><p>and</p><p>In response to this comment, the authors &quot;carried out RNAseq with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells with endogenously tagged RELA-eGFP&quot;. However, no methods are described in the manuscript itself regarding RNA-seq, either in the Methods or figure legends. Therefore, the readers would be left guessing if the samples were from the parental PDAC or the imaged cell lines. This might be an oversight; regardless, authors need to provide the method section on RNA-seq, including sample source, replicates, sequencing platform, data processing and analysis. Also, an accession ID for the RNA-seq data should be provided after depositing the dataset to a public data repository such as GEO, which is a standard requirement, I believe.</p><p>If the RNA-seq was done on the knockin reporter cells (as stated in the response), then the analysis does not directly address the question I raised in the original comment (&quot;…determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines&quot;). Barring another round of RNA-seq analysis on the parental cell lines, for a minimum effort, the authors can perform RTqPCR of NFKBIA, NFKBIE, REL, RELB, <italic>NFKB2</italic> (those found to be regulated by RelA in the reporter cells) in both the parental and the reporter cells.

However, the manuscript suffers from some ambiguities regarding sample sizes and statistical analyses. Firstly, most if not all data is not triplicated, instead duplicates while some technical replicates are presented (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 3 S1, Figure 4) -sometimes no information at all is provided (Figure 4C, Figure 4 S1). While part of this info is provided in methods, these should be included in appropriate captions. Secondly, there are limited details in terms of the statistical analyses, typically t-tests are performed (with corrections for multiple testing), often in the case of seemingly small sample sizes.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this study, the authors set out to profile the kinetics of RELA translocation in pancreatic cancer cells. RELA translocation is a widely studied event that occurs in response to a number of inflammatory stimuli, and the authors begin by profiling RELA translocation kinetics in two PDAC cell lines. Relative to other cell lines where this analysis has been performed, the two PDAC cell lines show more sustained signaling (to different extents), rather than oscillatory nuclear localization. Like many other cell lines that have been studied, the authors observe a large degree of heterogeneity in RELA translocation within cells stimulated with physiological doses of TNF. A thorough analysis based on a knock-in PCNA marker reveals that this heterogeneity is not linked to the cell cycle. The authors then hypothesize the connection between actin morphology based on their previous work, and turn to an analysis of 5 PDAC cell lines, using a fixed-cell immunofluorescence assay to quantify RELA translocation, F-actin, and tubulin in each cell. From images of thousands of fixed cells, a series of statistical analyses are used to identify correlations between cytoskeletal morphology and RELA nuclear abundance. This approach reveals clear associations between certain cytoskeletal features and RELA translocation, with substantial differences between cell lines. A follow-up experiment correlates live-cell RELA kinetics with fixed-cell cytoskeletal stains, which provides further support for their associations. Finally, they perturb actin and tubulin function with a variety of chemical agents and quantify the resulting effects on live-cell RELA kinetics. This again shows variation between cell lines but confirms that direct perturbation of cytoskeletal processes can modulate the ability of TNF to stimulate RELA translocation. Together, these lines of evidence provide substantial support for the hypothesis that NF-κB signaling can be modulated downstream of changes in actin dynamics. While there is significant variation in how this works between cell lines, which suggests that a broader exploration of other cell lines will be needed in the future, the data shown here are, with some limitations noted below, adequate to support the authors' hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 1 for the detailed reading of our manuscript and for their positive and insightful evaluation of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major strength of this manuscript is its use of quantitative imaging to exploit the existing heterogeneity between cells at a physiological dose of TNF. A series of clever analysis methods are used to draw out correlations that can be found between actin morphology (immunostained) and RELA translocation (either immunostained or by live-cell microscopy). Also important is the careful characterization of NF-κB signaling in pancreatic cancer cells, where this pathway is known to play a role. Importantly, RELA kinetics are assessed using a knock-in fluorescent protein tag, avoiding potential artifacts from overexpression. An interesting feature of this analysis is the use of Bayesian networks to model the dependencies of actin features; to my knowledge, this is a novel use of this algorithm. The drug perturbation data are also beautifully presented, in a way that reveals the full complexity of the cellular responses. In general, the data and conclusions are very clearly presented, and the authors do not shy away from describing the context-dependent intricacies of their observations. The main conclusion that NF-κB signaling is strongly affected by actin dynamics ties together two major signaling axes in cancer cells, and would be of interest to the many researchers working in these two areas. The methods used to show associations at the single-cell level will also have a significant impact on others working with mixtures of live and fixed single-cell data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to Reviewer 1 for their accurate summary of our manuscript and comments on the manuscript’s wider significance. We agree that our manuscript will be of particular interest to the large communities of researchers working on the cytoskeleton or NF-κB, as well as the single cell dynamics audience researching alternative pathways.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several weaknesses that limit the interpretability of the findings:</p><p>1. It is not clear how the effects of cell shape changes on the recorded nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio are controlled for. Cell shape is a major variable in this study and can alter the apparent (recorded) intensity of nuclear and cytoplasmic stains in many imaging and analysis pipelines, independent of any actual changes in a marker's localization. Without such an assessment, it isn't clear whether differences in RELA behavior (the main observation in the paper) are influenced by how the detection process treats cells with different morphologies.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern that signal intensity in the cytoplasm could be affected by cell morphology, e.g. thicker cells could generate higher cytoplasmic intensity. We justified use of the ring region to account for potential issues with cytoplasmic measurements, since we previously showed that the RELA signal in the ring region of the cytoplasm is not affected by cell morphology (Sero et al., 2015).</p><p>Nonetheless, as we have generated endogenously tagged RELA-GFP in the present study with minimal cell-to-cell variability in RELA-GFP expression in basal conditions, we have altered our manuscript to present the raw nuclear RELA-GFP intensity measurements without normalisation to ring or cytoplasmic measurements. Importantly, removal of normalisation to the ring region has not affected any of the major conclusions in this manuscript and raw RELA measurements with TNFα still portray sustained and non-oscillatory single cell dynamics (revised Figure 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is not clear whether the cytoskeleton-linked effects are specific to RELA, or rather reflect more widespread changes in nuclear import/export rates. There are reports that changes in actin function can alter nuclear-cytoplasmic translocation (for example, PMIDs 16120220, 31444357). Understanding whether the observed actin-dependent effect on NF-κB localization is unique to this signaling pathway, or a non-specific effect on multiple pathways is important to the interpretation of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We are also interested in whether actin regulation of RELA is specific to RELA or applicable to transcription factors in general. We have previously shown that nuclear to ring region measurements of the transcription co-activator YAP correlate with cell shape features that did not also correlate with the transcription factor JUN (Sero et al., 2015), however, these analyses did not include actin measurements. This could be tested by co-staining for other transcription factors, e.g. p53 or STATs, and assessing dependencies of the transcription factor localisation on actin features. However, these experiments are not necessary to draw conclusions about RELA regulation by actin, which is one of the major focuses of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It is difficult to assess the importance of the observed differences in RELA translocation without additional information on the pathway's output. Translocation of RELA is an important marker and is known to modulate many downstream genes involved in inflammation. However, given the differences in RELA behavior observed here in PDAC cells, it is difficult to extrapolate from previous work to evaluate whether the actin-modulated changes impact RELA's transcriptional effects. Establishing that such differences exist would be important to conclude that actin shape changes have a biologically significant effect on NF-κB signaling with the potential to alter cellular behavior.</p></disp-quote><p>We approached whether cell shape or cytoskeletal features regulate RELA signalling using image-based analysis of nuclear RELA intensity as RELA subcellular localisation is a major determinant of its transcriptional output. We agree with Reviewer 1 that assay of RELA transcriptional output in PDAC cells is both interesting and necessary to understand the output of RELA in PDAC. We have carried out RNA-seq with PDAC cells under various TNFα concentrations, in the presence or absence of non-degradable IκB, to identify potential RELA transcriptional targets in PDAC. These data are included in our revised manuscript (below).</p><p>‘As RELA is known to be involved in feedback loops with transcriptional targets, with the best studied example being IκBα, we sought to identify what the transcriptional targets of RELA are in PDAC and which influence RELA in actin dependent and independent ways.</p><p>To this end, we carried out RNA-seq analysis of PDAC cells at an early (1 hr) and late (5 hr) timepoint with varying TNFα doses (0.01, 0.1 or 10 ng/ml TNFα) using MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells. TNFα treatments were in the presence or absence of dox-induction of IκB super repressor (IκB-SR) to determine which genes require RELA nuclear translocation. 254 genes were differentially expressed in high TNFα (0.1 or 10 ng/ml) versus basal conditions, with the majority of genes (186) upregulated by TNFα (Figure 3A and 3B). To identify patterns of gene expression across TNFα doses and durations, the 254 TNFα-regulated genes were organised by hierarchical clustering into seven clusters, each with distinct expression dynamics or dependence on RELA (Figure 3C and 3D).’</p><p>Although we have not assayed differences in gene expression with actin interference, our revised manuscript does include identification of two RELA targets (NUAK2 and ARHGAP31) that are involved in actin modulation and also perturb RELA dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), therefore identifying components of regulatory network actin and RELA in PDAC. However, we agree that gene expression analysis would certainly add to our findings by live imaging.</p><p>‘We then focused on the effect of siRNA knockdown of the putative actin regulators and TNFα/RELA-dependent genes ARHGAP31 and NUAK2 on early (1 hr post-TNFα) and late (12 hr post-TNFα) nuclear RELA in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells, in order to explore the dependence of RELA on actin dynamics computationally predicted by Bayesian modelling. Strikingly, ARHGAP31 depletion significantly increased the early (1 hr) response of PANC1 cells to TNFα and the late (5 hr) response of MIA PaCa2 to TNFα, while NUAK2 depletion increased nuclear RELA with TNFα in MIA PaCa2 cells (Figure 4B and 4C). Thus, NUAK2/ARHGAP31 expression impacts TNFα-mediated RELA dynamics in PDAC cells.’</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86042-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The work by Butera et al. investigates the relationship between the cellular cytoskeleton and NFkB dynamic response to TNF. The authors use single-cell fixed and live cells measurements of RelA dynamics and cellular morphology, pharmacological perturbations, and extensive statistical analysis to draw specific conclusions on what aspects of the actin cytoskeleton modulate TNF-dependent NFkB response. I have identified multiple issues that raise concerns that the conclusions of this paper are not supported by the data presented.</p><p>1. The possibility of confounding factors between cell morphology and the approach used by the authors to analyze NFkB dynamics (Figure 1D). The analysis of NFkB dynamics presented here is based on an image segmentation strategy that relies on a single marker, PCNA, and segmentation of the nucleus and &quot;ring&quot; around the nucleus. This strategy should only be applied in contexts where cell shape is not changing and is not a key factor in the investigation and it cannot be used to investigate the dependency of NFkB on cell shape. The main issue is that the &quot;ring&quot; is not a good proxy for the actual concentration of the fluorescent marker in the cytoplasm. For example, in a case where the marker (RelA-GFP in this case) is not changing, the measurement of the &quot;cytoplasmic&quot; signal can change as the cell spreads from a rectangular shape with limited lamellipodia to a cell that is very spread with thin lamellipodia. This change does not mean that the concentration of the marker in the cytoplasm changed, it just reveals the use of &quot;ring&quot; as a proxy is limited. This puts the key measurement of this work in doubt as it is the key theme throughout this paper. To give just one example, as the number of &quot;neighbor contact&quot; increases, cells tend to have thicker and less spread morphology (i.e. they are just denser in culture). Thicker cells will have more cytoplasm in the &quot;ring&quot; compared to very spread cells and therefore the denominator of RelA will be bigger that will cause the overall RelA ratio to be smaller which is exactly what the authors show in Figure 4D. Just to be clear, this is not just an issue with cell thickness, the estimation of total cytoplasmic intensity from a &quot;ring&quot; inherently depends on cell morphology. Therefore, one simply cannot state that RelA activation itself depends on cell morphology using this analysis method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for their critical assessment of the segmentation and image analysis strategies used in this manuscript and their fit for morphological data. Given the use of endogenously tagged RELA in this study, we agree that normalisation to the ring region is not needed, and have changed all figures to present nuclear RELA measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Bayesian network analysis does not provide a causal relationship. The authors make extensive use of Bayesian networks (BN) for inferences of dependencies (Figures 3 and 4). In this analysis, the authors aim to identify the direction of dependency between different nodes in the BN. This is problematic for two reasons. First, The direction of arrows in bayesian networks does not imply causations (i.e. modulation). The direction of arrows in BN only represents correlation and the directionality should not be interpreted as causative. Yet the authors clearly make a key distinction whether RelA depends on a morphological feature or whether the feature depends on RelA. In the literature that the authors cite (e.g. Sachs et al. 2005) pharmacological perturbation is used to infer causation, not the inference of the structure of the BN. Second, the authors did not consider that other factors, not included in the model, could influence both RelA and morphology. For example, if an unknown kinase changes both NFKB and a specific cellular feature the inferred network will still look the same. Therefore, the conclusion that actin-based cellular features modulate (i.e. cause) differences in RelA dynamics is simply unsupported by the BN analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for outlining the roles and limitations of Bayesian network analysis and for pointing out the necessity for clear language when describing results from Bayesian networks. We acknowledge that arcs presented in Bayesian networks are indicative of probabilistic causality, and we did not intend to imply that these are direct mechanistic biological interactions, but sought to present statistically likely dependencies that generate hypotheses. Based on reviewer 2’s comments, we have challenged the interactions between RELA and actin, tubulin and cell shape features identified our original Bayesian models by constructing Bayesian networks using systematic perturbation of PDAC cells with diverse small molecule inhibitors targeting the cytoskeleton (revised Figure 3B):</p><p>‘When using datasets of sufficient size, deriving Bayesian models based on largely stochastic and relatively small fluctuations in variables can provide insight into the influence of cytoskeletal components, shape, and RELA on each other (Figure 2C). But molecular interventions provide a means to further drive ordering of connections by identifying regions in state where normally correlated variables become conditionally independent (Pe’er et al., 2001, Sachs et al., 2005). Consequently, we created an additional dataset where cells were imaged following perturbations of tubulin, actin, myosin, or focal adhesion (FA) dynamics (Figure 2E). Such perturbations are intended to alter the value of variables/features (i.e. measures of actin organization) beyond those observed in normal populations.’</p><p>‘We generated a single cell dataset for use in Bayesian modelling by treating MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells with selected drug doses for 2 hr then simultaneously with TNFα (0, 0.01, 0.1 and 10 ng/ml) for 1 hr and input these data into the same Bayesian algorithm as above (rsmax2) (Figure 2F). Interestingly, the Bayesian network following perturbations revealed that 5/6 of the variables observed to correlate with RELA (whether they influenced RELA or were influenced by RELA) in untreated cells were independent of RELA in the drug-treated network. Only ‘Cytoplasmic Actin Mean’ remained as a influencing variable following drug-treatment, suggesting that actin abundance is a key regulator of RELA nuclear localisation. While other variables (i.e. tubulin and cell shape) can indirectly influence RELA, they do so via regulating actin network organisation.’</p><p>We have additionally revised the text in our manuscript to make our original conclusions more clear and emphasised the need for heterogeneity in order to make computational predictions:</p><p>‘In order to provide the greatest heterogeneity in nuclear RELA and cytoskeletal/cell shape features for Bayesian model generation, we collated data from all five PDAC lines and TNFα doses (0, 0.01, 0.1 and 10 ng/ml), shown in Figure 2C. This model indicated that nuclear RELA measurements are correlated to and predicted to be dependent on cytoplasmic actin and tubulin intensity, suggesting that cytoskeletal dynamics influence heterogeneity in nuclear RELA translocation with TNFα. Nuclear RELA is also predicted to be dependent on cell area, although with a lower strength of the probabilistic relationship compared to actin/tubulin, while nucleus roundness is predicted to be dependent on nuclear RELA. Interestingly, both actin texture and the ratio of membrane to cytoplasm actin are also predicted to be dependent on RELA, suggesting that RELA and actin dynamics are interdependent.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Lack of support by pharmacological data. Beyond correlation analysis, the authors used a pharmacological approach to show that manipulation of the cytoskeleton causes changes in RelA dynamics. The data presented in Figures 1-5 makes specific predictions. If one is to interpret the arrows in the BN as the authors present them, one will conclude that perturbations of features like &quot;nuclear roundness&quot; that was presented as key &quot;modulator&quot; of RelA dynamics will cause a change in RelA dynamics. The vast majority of the pharmacological perturbations used by the authors, even those that caused &gt;2 SD change in &quot;nuclear roundness&quot;, had very little impact on RelA dynamics. In my reading, this directly invalidates the core conclusion made by the authors on the ability of the actin cytoskeleton to modulate RelA dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 raises several excellent points regarding the limitations of the interpretations of Bayesian networks. We agree that the small molecules used to perturb the cytoskeleton have varied and limited impact on RELA dynamics, and recognise that the small molecules used target several pathways/cell shape components, which may contribute to the confounded effect on RELA. Therefore, we have removed any focus of individual small molecules on nuclear RELA and have collated the small molecule perturbation data into a Bayesian network model, in line with Reviewer 2’s other comments. In addition to inhibitor treatments, we have carried out an orthogonal experiment to test the effect of depletion by siRNA of specific genes (ARHGAP31 and NUAK2) involved in actin modulation to test potential regulation of RELA by actin dynamics, as hinted computationally by our computational analysis. We believe that this experiment provides more conclusive evidence for a regulatory network between actin and RELA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only drug that seemed to show a meaningful impact (my interpretation as rigorous statistical analysis of this that includes correction of multiple hypotheses is missing) was SMIFH2 which downregulates Formin activity. Naively, I googled &quot;SMIFH2 off target&quot; and found multiple publications suggestions that SMIFH2 has putative off target effects on other proteins such as Myosin (PMID: 33589498) but also completely unrelated targets such as P53 (PMID: 25925024). Therefore I find that the data presented in Figure 6, rather than supporting the authors' conclusion effectively invalidate it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for outlining potential issues with the use of the formin inhibitor SMIFH2. Following revision of our manuscript, we have omitted emphasis on formin and RELA as we have used the small molecule data to provide perturbation and heterogeneity for Bayesian modelling of RELA and cell feature interactions. Our repurposing of these date removes the importance of any single small molecule effects on nuclear RELA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The values of RelA nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio are different across the figures in ways that I was unable to follow. In figures 1-2 the values are ~0.9-1.4. In figures 3B and 4D the same cell lines show a range of 0-3, and 0-5. Figure 3D shows RelA on a log10 scale with values are from -0.5 to 1.5 (3-33 on a linear scale). As it is presented now, this data limits the ability to draw conclusions based on RelA values across figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have amended figures to present RELA quantification on the same scale (unlogged).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors perform cluster analysis followed by ANOVA between the clusters. This is problematic and is known as &quot;double-dipping&quot; and it could invalidate the statistical inference (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02936). As the authors don't really use the clusters for any of their conclusions, the grouping can be avoided and analysis done directly on RelA values using correlation analysis with key features. As the authors effectively show in Figure 5A that a simple measure (RelA at 60min) is basically equivalent to cluster identity, this could substantially simplify the work and many of the panels in Figure 2 could be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 2 is correct in that clustering does not provide additional information to this dataset. We have omitted clustering from analysis of the RELA ratio tracks, which is now categorised by TNFα treatment alone (Figure 1C from the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The statement made by the authors about the differences in negative feedback signaling between the two cell lines (line 153) is presented as a conclusion when in fact it is a reasonable hypothesis that is not supported by any of the data shown in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment that data on negative feedback proteins is necessary to make conclusions regarding the two cell lines. To this end, we have carried out Co-IP to assess RELA interaction with IκB proteins (the key negative regulators of RELA) and additionally performed RNA-seq to assess the expression of IκB genes in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells. Furthermore, we have depleted IκB genes in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells and assessed the effects on RELA dynamics. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The features selected after feature selection are referred to as &quot;independent features&quot;, yet the PCA data shown by the authors clearly show that they are not independent of each other.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose cell features based on lack of intercorrelation (revised Figure 2 – Supplement 1B) but appreciate the reviewer’s comment that this is insufficient to refer to the as features ‘independent’ when they have dependencies shown in the Bayesian network models. Accordingly, we have removed the term ‘independent’ when referring to the features selected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The statement regarding the tSNE analysis (lines 279-282 and Figure 5B) is incorrect as tSNE does not preserve distance metrics and therefore proximity of points in tSNE space is not indicative of actual similarity (see: https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to Reviewer 2 for highlighting this. We have omitted the tSNE analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. A more subtle version of the &quot;double-dipping&quot; problem mentioned in point 5 above exists in Figure 5CD. When the features tested are correlated with the features used to create the clusters, one cannot simple ANOVA between the clusters for statistical inference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing attention to the double dipping in the original Figure 5C/D. We have removed all clustering of RELA data and associated statistical analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The inferred strengths of the arcs in the BN analysis don't fully support the authors' interpretations. For example, in Figure 4C the connection between all morphological features and RelA is very low (2-50) compared to other arcs in the same network (arc lengths are around a few hundreds with max at 4095).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has drawn attention to an important discussion point regarding Bayesian modelling and the significance of arc strengths. We agree that the connections involving RELA in our Bayesian models have low arc strengths when compared to arcs in the same network. However, we expected that the arc strengths between cytoskeletal and cell shape features would be exceptionally high, given how linked they are biologically. We therefore did not aim to compare the arc strengths involving RELA to the arc strengths only involving cytoskeletal and cell shape features, and aimed to use a relatively stringent algorithm to construct our Bayesian models (rsmax2). Nonetheless, we hope that our revised text reflects more considerate language when referring to the conclusions made from Bayesian networks in general, as encouraged by Reviewer 2’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The statistical significance of the pharmacological perturbation on RelA should be presented including controls for multiple hypothesis testing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the important reminder to present statistical significance and highlight use of multiple test correction. As mentioned, we have omitted these figure sections altogether, however, they can be re-included (with statistical significance) as a part of the main figure or as a supplement, if the reviewers request.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors present a deep investigation of the relationship between cell morphology, actin cytoskeletal features and NF-kappaB RELA signaling dynamics. Quantitative live-cell imaging of endogenous RELA (using CRISPR knock-in) and data analyses are leveraged to provide insight into the little-understood roles of actin networks in inflammatory responses of PDAC cells to TNF-α. While the focus is clearly on cell shapes and cytoskeletal features, it will help put the study in the context of others if the PDAC cells are better characterized in terms of the negative feedback loops of NF-kappaB, such as IkappaB α or IkappaB epsilon proteins. As the authors indicated, these results altogether may provide new ideas for therapeutic interventions for PDAC.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to Reviewer 3 for this concise summary of our manuscript. We agree that further enquiry into IκB proteins is necessary to fully characterise RELA signalling in PDAC cells and to aid comparison with other cell lines.</p><p>Inspired by the reviewers’ comments, we performed RNA-seq assessment of genes encoding IκB proteins (revised Figure 3 – Supplement 1A).</p><p>In addition, we used GFP-Trap in PDAC cells expressing endogenously tagged RELA-GFP to identify the binding partners of RELA in PDAC cells and analysed changes in protein abundance with TNFα addition by mass spectrometry:</p><p>‘Lastly, we checked which NF-κB/IκB proteins interact with RELA in PDAC cells. GFP-Trap followed by mass spectrometry with MIA PaCa2 cells expressing endogenously tagged RELA-GFP pulled down six NF-κB/IκB proteins (Figure 3 – Supplement 1B). IκBα/NFKBIA, IκBβ/NFKBIB and IκBε/NFKBIE were pulled down at lower abundance with increasing TNFα dose, in line with the well-studied degradation of IκB proteins downstream of TNFα stimulation (Chen et al., 1995). Interestingly, the NF-κB protein REL also had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα. In contrast, NFKB1 and <italic>NFKB2</italic> showed increased interaction with RELA with TNFα. RELA therefore appears to form NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1 and <italic>NFKB2</italic> in PDAC cells.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. As the authors mentioned in Discussion (lines 370-373 &quot;…, other studies reported more rapid cytoplasmic REL relocalisation…&quot;), the rapid fall of nuclear RelA (around 40 minutes after TNF-α) has widely been reported by several groups (Alexander Hoffmann, Michael White, Markus Covert, Myong-Hee Sung, Savas Tay and their colleagues), but is absent in both PDAC lines. This indicates that the negative feedback genes such as IkappaB α/epsilon or A20 may have very different kinetics if they are induced at all in these cells. It seems important to determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines. RTqPCR of a few key negative feedback genes in the parental and derived reporter cells, as well as a control cell line (HeLa, MCF10, or THP-1) would be a straightforward way to answer this question. While this is not the focus of the study, I think that understanding which feedback is dysfunctional is probably relevant for therapeutic strategies against PDAC. It would also help the NF-kappaB signaling community understand the common and distinct features of dynamics observed in different cell systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is necessary to show functionality of RELA following C-terminal addition of eGFP and also interesting to identify which negative feedback genes are important in PDAC cells. To this end, we carried out RNAseq with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells with endogenously tagged RELA-eGFP and checked upregulation of IκB-encoding genes, in addition to NF-κB family genes, which we are in revised Figure 3 – Supplement 1A. Interestingly, we find that expression of the IκBε-encoding gene <italic>NFKBIE</italic> is dependent on TNFα dose and on RELA nuclear translocation, since <italic>NFKBIE</italic> expression is abrogated in the presence of non-degradable IκBα (IκB-SR) in both PDAC cell lines.</p><p>‘RNA-seq in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells revealed that expression of <italic>RELA</italic> itself did not significantly scale with TNFα dose, while <italic>RELB</italic> and the transcriptionally incompetent NF-κB proteins <italic>NFKB1</italic> and <italic>NFKB2</italic> showed increasing expression with increasing TNFα (Left graph in Figure 3 – Supplement 1A). TNFα addition significantly altered the expression of a subset of IκB protein-encoding genes, which display distinct expression dynamics: <italic>NFKBIA</italic> (Figure 3: Cluster 5), <italic>NFKBIB</italic> (Figure 3: Cluster 4), <italic>NFKBIE</italic> (Figure 3: Cluster 3), <italic>NFKBID</italic> (Figure 3: Cluster 6) and <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> (Figure 3: Cluster 6). Of these, <italic>NFKBIA</italic> has the highest absolute RNA expression in MIA PaCa2 cells and <italic>NFKBIB</italic> has the highest abundance in PANC1 cells, while <italic>NFKBID</italic> and <italic>NFKBIZ</italic> have the lowest RNA expression in both cell lines (right graph in Figure 3 – Supplement 1A).</p><p>T-test comparison with multiple test correction of RNA expression in TNFα-treated cells revealed that <italic>RELB</italic> and <italic>REL</italic> have significantly reduced expression with IκB-SR presence versus absence in both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells, while <italic>NFKB2</italic> is only affected by IκB-SR induction in PANC1 cells (Figure 3 – Supplement 1A’).</p><p>Furthermore, expression of the canonical RELA binding partner <italic>NFKB1</italic> is unaffected by RELA-inactivation by IκB-SR in both cell lines. Similarly, expression of the IκB family protein-encoding genes <italic>NFKBIA</italic> and <italic>NFKBIB</italic> were not significantly impacted by RELA inactivation in either cell line, while <italic>NFKBIE</italic> expression was reduced with IκB-SR in PANC1. Therefore, of the core NF-κB signalling components, <italic>RELB</italic>, <italic>REL</italic> and <italic>NFKBIE</italic> expression appear to be dependent on TNFα-stimulated RELA nuclear translocation in PDAC cells. We also considered how expression of NF-κB and IκB genes are affected by the treatment duration of TNFα (Figure 3 -Supplement 1A’’), combining data from 0.1 ng/ml and 10ng/ml TNFα. In both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells, <italic>RELB</italic> expression was significantly higher with 5 hr compared to 1 hr TNFα, which was also the case for <italic>NFKB2</italic> and <italic>NFKBIE</italic> in the PANC1 cell line alone.’</p><p>Using RNAseq, we also identified multiple known RELA targets as upregulated by TNFα only in the absence of IκB-SR in the PDAC cell lines, including <italic>RELB</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, <italic>NFKBIE</italic>, and <italic>TNFAIP3</italic> (A20), which we have included in the revised manuscript (Cluster 3 genes in Figure 3):</p><p>We believe these data in our revised manuscript verify intact functioning of RELA in the two RELA reporter PDAC cell lines and provide previously unknown data on negative feedback signalling in PDAC cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. On page 7 lines 154-155 &quot;… negative feedback regulation is intact in PANC1…&quot; is too simplistic, given the very slow fall of nuclear RELA even in PANC1. See comment #1 above. It looks like IkappaB feedback genes are strongly compromised in both PDAC lines. Again, this could be an important feature of PDAC and needs to be verified as suggested above. The evaluation of gene induction by RTqPCR would also be reassuring that the C-terminal fusion of RELA is transcriptionally as active as the native RELA protein, even though the EGFP is tagging the transactivation domain (important for NF-kappaB recruitment of co-factors and transcriptional machinery to the target chromatin).</p></disp-quote><p>As above, we checked that C-terminal fusion eGFP to RELA does not impact the transcriptional functionality of RELA using RNAseq (Figure 3 in revised manuscript). We also checked using co-immunoprecipiation that RELA-eGFP binds to NF-κB and IκB proteins (Figure 3 – Supplement 1B):</p><p>‘GFP-Trap followed by mass spectrometry with MIA PaCa2 cells expressing endogenously tagged RELA-GFP pulled down six NF-κB/IκB proteins (Figure 3 – Supplement 1B). IκBα/NFKBIA, IκBβ/NFKBIB and IκBε/NFKBIE were pulled down at lower abundance with increasing TNFα dose, in line with the well-studied degradation of IκB proteins downstream of TNFα stimulation (Chen et al., 1995). Interestingly, the NF-κB protein REL also had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα. In contrast, NFKB1 and <italic>NFKB2</italic> showed increased interaction with RELA with TNFα. RELA therefore appears to form NF-κB heterodimers with REL, NFKB1 and <italic>NFKB2</italic> in PDAC cells.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 5 has data that will be of broad interest to the community, and I was hoping to glean some recurring theme about what features may affect NF-kappaB signaling. The key results seem to be in 5C-E, but it is not easy to read off which relationships may be shared between the two PDAC lines. It will be helpful if all the ten features are shown for each cell line to see an overall pattern, even though some may fall below statistical significance. 'Actin filament/cell area' shows opposite trends in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1. It seems like 'neighbor contact' was the only feature shared by the two cell lines based on the Bayesian analysis. This was somewhat dissatisfying because it complicates any extrapolating speculations of these findings to other cell systems. But the authors seem to have done a thorough analysis using both ANOVA and Bayesian methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to reviewer 3 for their interest in the features correlated with nuclear RELA in PDAC cells. We have summarised the relationships between cytoskeletal/cell shape features and RELA, identified by Bayesian modelling, in revised Figure 2D. As requested, each facet of this figure shows a cell feature and the top row of each facet uses data from all PDAC cell lines, which informs on whether the relationship between the cell feature and RELA is shared among the five PDAC cell lines tested. Notably, Bayesian modelling identifies that heterogeneity in nuclear RELA intensity is dependent on cytoplasm actin intensity and cytoplasm tubulin intensity across PDAC cell lines, suggesting that cytoskeletal regulation of RELA is a recurring phenomenon.</p><p>‘In order to provide the greatest heterogeneity in nuclear RELA and cytoskeletal/cell shape features for Bayesian model generation, we collated data from all five PDAC lines and TNFα doses (0, 0.01, 0.1 and 10 ng/ml), shown in Figure 2C. This model indicated that nuclear RELA measurements are correlated to and predicted to be dependent on cytoplasmic actin and tubulin intensity, suggesting that cytoskeletal dynamics influence heterogeneity in nuclear RELA translocation with TNFα. Nuclear RELA is also predicted to be dependent on cell area, although with a lower strength of the probabilistic relationship compared to actin/tubulin, while nucleus roundness is predicted to be dependent on nuclear RELA. Interestingly, both actin texture and the ratio of membrane to cytoplasm actin are also predicted to be dependent on RELA, suggesting that RELA and actin dynamics are interdependent.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Cytoskeletal structures may influence rates of oligomerization or recycling of the cell surface receptors for TNF-α. Any thoughts on such indirect effects through the upstream signaling events of NF-kappaB activation?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer 3 raises an interesting question that highlights the current gap in understanding of cytoskeletal regulation of TNF receptor stability and conformation. In literature, there is evidence for modulation of nuclear RELA by actin and tubulin inhibitors (Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001, Molecular Pharmacology; Németh et al., 2004, Journal of Cellular Physiology), in addition to TNFα/RELA regulation of the cytoskeleton (Huber et al., 2004, Journal of Clinical Investigation; Georgouli et al., 2019, Cell). However, there is limited evidence for cytoskeletal regulation of TNF receptors. One example is that the actin-binding protein Filamin interacts with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (<italic>TRAF2</italic>), which is not itself a TNF receptor but is involved in TNF receptor intracellular signal transduction (Leonardi et al., 2000, Journal of Biological Chemistry). The publishing of these results over 20 years ago emphasises the lack of progression on this topic.</p><p>To study cytoskeletal regulation of TNF receptors, we have attempted immunofluorescence visualisation of TNF receptors but found little dynamic range with TNFα treatment. Follow up would require antibody validation or employment of other techniques, which we are interested in but do not believe are necessary for the conclusions of this manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 3 may find of interest that we identified TNFR signalling components as regulated by TNFα in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 pancreatic cells by RNAseq, which are shown in the revised manuscript (Figure 3C). Notably, we identified that the expression of the gene encoding the signalling adaptor Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) associated factor 1 <italic>(TRAF1)</italic> is regulated by TNFα in a TNFα dose and duration manner, and <italic>TRAF1</italic> expression is also dependent on RELA nuclear translocation (Figure 3 Cluster 3). We also found that the TNF receptor superfamily members <italic>TNFRSF25</italic> (Figure 3 Cluster 7) and <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic> (Figure 3 Cluster 4) are TNFα-regulated, with <italic>TNFRSF10B</italic> expression dependent on TNFα duration, displaying higher expression at 5 hr TNFα treatments compared to respective 1 hr TNFα treatments. Future experiments could investigate whether these genes are also regulated by modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors have made significant changes to their image processing methods and Bayesian network modeling presentation, which in my opinion are adequate to answer the critiques raised on these points. Perhaps the largest change to the manuscript is the inclusion of an RNA-seq experiment and follow-up with knockdowns of genes of interest found in this dataset. The strongest point of this addition is that it is used to investigate the mediators of negative feedback and their differences between the two cell lines analyzed. The RNA-seq data are also used to make a connection between NF-κB activity and actin regulation, which as discussed below, makes less of an impact on the overall conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Overall, the changes do significantly strengthen the manuscript, but some revisions are still needed to fully integrate the new data.</p><p>1. By displaying NF-κB localization strictly as nuclear intensity, they avoid the difficulty of using a cytoplasmic ring to calculate nuclear/cytoplasmic intensity, a measurement that can be affected by the cell shape changes induced in their study. However, their description of the method lacks a few details – in particular, is the nuclear intensity calculated as the total RELA signal per nucleus, or the average pixel intensity over the nuclear region (line 567)? Also, the ring method is still used in the fixed cell measurements; it would be helpful to comment in more detail on the previous work that supports the insensitivity of this measurement to cell shape changes (the authors refer to Sero 2015 in their response, but it isn't clear to me where in that manuscript the ring method's response to cell shape is evaluated).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for acknowledging the change of our analyses to nuclear RELA intensity from nuc/ring intensity based on the first round of reviewer comments provided.

The addition of RNA-seq analysis provides a significant amount of new data, and the inclusion of the IkB super repressor is a nice feature of this dataset that helps increase its interpretability. However, overall this addition feels incomplete. There doesn't appear to be any description of the relevant experimental procedures in the methods section. Also, the conclusions from these experiments seem somewhat indistinct. Two actin-regulating genes, NUAK1 and ARHGEF31, are identified as targets of NF-κB, and it is shown that their knockdown modestly changes RELA translocation kinetics. However, this finding doesn't address the question of whether the actin-mediated modulation of NF-κB, which is the focus of the first part of the paper, has a functional role in altering gene expression. Thus, the last section is potentially useful, but a bit confusing in juxtaposition to the first part of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added details of the RNA-seq experiments to the Methods, including the experimental procedure (cell culture and treatment) as well as the sequencing details and analysis.</p><p>Our paper concludes that nuclear RELA is linked to heterogeneity in actin features, and that the RELA-regulated genes <italic>NUAK</italic> and <italic>ARHGEF31</italic> play a role in regulating RELA nuclear translocation.

I appreciate the effort invested in carrying out such a major revision in response to the original comments from me and other reviewers. Many of my comments have been addressed fully or are no longer relevant in the revised version. The authors performed RNA-seq and GFP-trap experiments partly to address my concern about understanding the core regulatory circuit of NF-kappaB in these PDAC cells. However, some details are missing, and clarifications are needed in several places. While there are numerous points to commend about in this much improved version, in the interest of space, I focus here on remaining issues that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication.</p><p>New comments:</p><p>1. The authors note that &quot;the time to peak RELA was highly heterogenous&quot; (line 103). It seems like their definition is different from what other groups have been using. Instead of detecting the *time to the first peak*, it seems like the reported time to peak is catching the *time to maximum value* of nuclear RELA. This is apparent in Figure 1C (easier to see on the right side, e.g. dose response plot of MIA PaCa), where the first peak occurs earlier for the higher TNF dose (which many groups have reported to be valid in multiple cell types. For example, shown by Markus Covert, MH Sung, Michael White, etc). But the panel 1E shows the time to peak is more than 100 minutes (unit is missing in the y axis, by the way), while panel 1C shows a rapid first peak (e.g. &lt; 30 min for 10 ng/ml TNF). I suggest the authors update their definition of time to peak and provide a more accurate quantification of the dose-dependent timing of first peak (well established in the field). With the revised definition, the time to peak may be actually not so heterogenous between individual cells (based on the data spread in panel 1C time course plots). Moreover, the time to peak of 100 minutes is not compatible with the choice of 1 hour TNF treatment in the subsequent immunofluorescence analysis. This needs to be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for these comments. The prior submissions of our manuscript defined peak RELA as the maximum nuclear RELA intensity, which is a valid method for quantifying peak RELA, e.g. Sung et al., 2009 (PLOS ONE): ‘The magnitude of first peak response was defined as the maximum nuclear p65 level within 1 hr after TNF-a treatment for each time lapse profile’.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have revised our analysis to the first timepoint at which the slope of RELA intensity ≤ 0. We have clarified the method for peak detection in the Methods:</p><p>‘Nuclear RELA peaks were detected in R by track following Savitzky-Golay filtering using the ‘Signal’ package (filter order p = 3, filter length n = 11) by finding the first timepoint at which the slope of the nuclear RELA curve is ≤ 0.’</p><p>We have updated Figure 1 and Figure 1 Supplement 1 and associated text accordingly:</p><p>The change in peak analysis does not change our conclusions about the amplitude of peak RELA at varying TNFα dose but does alter our estimation of the timing of peak nuclear RELA in PDAC cells, which we have revised to a lower timepoint following TNFα addition, in line with Reviewer 2’s suggestion.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the discrepancy in the initial peak quantification and what is observable from the single cell RELA tracks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There are a few puzzling disconnects between Figure 3 Supplement panels 1A and 1A'-A'. For example, the authors interpret the data in these statements: &quot;NFKB2 is only affected by IκB-SR induction in PANC1 cells (Figure 3 – Supplement 1A).&quot;, &quot;NFKB1 is unaffected by RELA-inactivation by IκB-SR in both cell lines&quot;, &quot;NFKBIA and NFKBIB were not significantly impacted by RELA inactivation in either cell line, while NFKBIE expression was reduced with IκB-SR in PANC1&quot;. But looking at panel 1A, NFKB2 induction is absent in MiaPaCa with IkB-SR; NFKB1 induction is also affected at 5h in both cell lines; NFKBIA induction is off but instead, the constitutive expression is higher (which indicates a high basal transcriptional activity either by NFkB or other TFs like glucocorticoid receptor). Are these simply an outcome of the statistical testing criteria? The discrepancy seems too numerous and pronounced to warrant some double-checking and/or explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>Dissimilarities between the reviewer’s observation of the data in Figure 3 Supplement 1A and the statistical results are due to the analysis method used, which relied on collating data from varying doses/timepoints as pseudo-replicates in the absence of biological replicates (detailed in the figure legend), although two technical replicates were processed for RNA-seq per cell line and treatment.</p><p>We have reanalysed these data with the Wilcoxon test (previously analysed with a t-test), comparing 5 hr to 1 hr TNFα treatment or the absence and presence of IκB-SR, collating data from 0.01, 0.1 and 10 ng/ml doses in both comparisons. The new statistical significance with the Wilcoxon test and updated text are more consistent with observations by Reviewer 2, including the observation that IκB-SR induction affects <italic>NFKB2</italic> expression:</p><p>‘We compared RNA expression in TNFα-treated cells between cells with or without IκB-SR induction (Wilcoxon tests with multiple test correction), which revealed that <italic>RELB</italic>, <italic>REL</italic>, <italic>NFKB2</italic>, and <italic>NFKBIE</italic> have reduced expression with IκB-SR induction in both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells (Figure 3 – Supplement 1A’). These findings indicate that expression of these genes rely on nuclear translocation of RELA, while the other NF-κB and IκB genes, including the canonical RELA binding partner <italic>NFKB1</italic>, do not require RELA activation for expression.</p><p>We also considered how expression of NF-κB and IκB genes are affected by the treatment duration of TNFα (Figure 3 – Supplement 1A’’), combining data from 0.01, 0.1 and 10ng/ml TNFα. In both MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells, the expression of no NF-κB or IκB genes were statistically different at 1 hr compared to 5 hr TNFα treatment. These results are in line with previous findings that NF-κB and IκB genes are ‘early’ genes upregulated rapidly and consistently following TNFα treatment (Tian et al., 2005; Tay et al., 2010).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How was knockdown efficiency assessed (other than RELA) in the data of Figure 4? Individual cells may show significant heterogeneity in siRNA knockdown (which is different from the RELA siRNA), so I wonder if some of the single cell traces may be from those that didn't have a reduced abundance of the target protein (as well as the mRNA).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there likely exists heterogeneity in the knockdown of target genes, but we are unable to check this by immunofluorescence due to the quality of available antibodies and discrepancy between RNA and protein abundance. Single cell heterogeneity in siRNA knockdown could certainly be confirmed with single cell RNA-seq, however, this is beyond the financial scope of this project. Nonetheless, we have thoroughly considered Reviewer 2’s feedback and carried out qPCR analysis to confirm that the siRNAs are highly effective in depleting target gene expression with TNFα on the population level:</p><p>‘We used non-targeting (NT) siRNA as a negative control for comparison and verified transfection efficacy using RELA siRNA, which abrogated the nuclear RELA signal (Figure 4A), in addition to qRT-PCR (Figure 4 – Supplement 1), which showed reduction of the RNA expression of the targeted gene by each siRNA.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In line 122 &quot;…no differences between cells by cell cycle stage in terms of peak RELA measurements…&quot;, it will be good to note that this is in contrast to Michael White's report on cell cycle dependence (Ankers et al. https://elifesciences.org/articles/10473). It is important to note that the crosstalk between cell cycle and NFkB is cell type specific.</p></disp-quote><p>It is interesting that our results in PDAC cells differ from those observed in Michael White’s study using HeLa cells. We have updated the Discussion section to reflect these findings:</p><p>‘Here, we identified that MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells in all cell cycle stages are responsive to 0.1 and 10 ng/ml TNFα, with minimal dissimilarities in RELA translocation responses between cell cycle stages in terms of mean nuclear RELA or the amplitude and timing of peak RELA. In contrast, RELA translocation responses to TNFα were identified in HeLa cells by Ankers et al. (2016) as dependent on the cell cycle phase at the time of TNFα addition in a study using double thymidine block to synchronise cells or Fluorescent Ubiquitination-based Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) labelling to infer cell cycle phase. HeLa cells treated with 10 ng/ml TNFα in late G1 displayed a stronger response than the population average, while S-phase cells showed a suppressed or delayed response. Furthermore, RELA was found to interact with E2F1, a transcription factor regulating the G1 to S transition, in late G1 when E2F1 levels are highest during the cell cycle (Ankers et al., 2016). Conflicting reports of whether TNFα-induced RELA translocation is cell cycle regulated may be due to cancer cell type specific deregulation of cell cycle proteins (Cordon-Cardo, 1995; Otto and Sicinski, 2017) or RELA may not physically interact with E2F1 in PDAC cells in general or specifically in unsynchronised cells.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Regarding the result &quot;Interestingly, the NF-κB protein REL also had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα.&quot;, there is a recent publication (Rahman SMT et al. https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(22)01556-X) reporting that the RelA:c-Rel heterodimer was depleted in the nucleus of TNF-α activated fibroblasts. This reviewer, being the senior author of the study, can't help but find this quite remarkable, and I think that the corroboration might be noteworthy in interpreting the GFP-Trap data.</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased to see that our findings corroborate those published by Rahman et al. and have emphasised these shared results in the Discussion:</p><p>‘Co-immunoprecipitation also revealed that the NF-κB protein REL had reduced interaction with RELA with TNFα. This is in line with a recent study (Rahman et al., 2022) that endogenously fluorescently labelled RelA and c-Rel in dual knockin mice and used fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FFCS) to probe for binding/dimerisation in primary ear fibroblasts to quantify abundance of RelA:c-Rel heterodimers pre- and post-TNFα. Rahman et al., 2022 identified that the relative abundance of the RelA:c-Rel dimer was higher in the nucleus of resting cells then higher in the cytoplasm of TNFα-stimulated cells, despite the individual concentrations of RelA and c-Rel increasing in the nucleus with TNFα. Our combined results suggest that binding of RELA and REL is reduced with TNFα in multiple cell types and in both human and mouse models.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 2: The Bayesian-inferred arrows are sometimes in opposite directions between panel C and panel F (drug treatment data). Any explanations that can help readers understand would be good.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a noteworthy aspect of Bayesian networks, which we have elaborated on in the updated Discussion to help interpretation of our networks:</p><p>‘Interestingly, the Bayesian-inferred arrows in the RELA network generated from TNFα-treated cells (Figure 2C) sometimes point in opposite directions compared to the network from cells treated with biochemical inhibitors (Figure 2F). This arises from the inherent properties and flexibility of Bayesian networks (Scutari et al., 2018). These networks use a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent global probability distributions broken down into smaller local distributions, ensuring no loops or cycles. Despite these constraints, the direction of arrows can change without altering the underlying dependence structure. Multiple valid DAG configurations can exist, so the dependence between two variables A and B can be represented as either A→B or B→A if both are probabilistically equivalent (Heckerman et al., 1995; Scutari, 2010; Scutari et al., 2019). Thus, reversing an arc can leave the overall network structure unchanged, as long as local distributions remain consistent with the data.’</p><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for greatly strengthening the manuscript Discussion with their feedback (points 4-6 and previous point 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

As the authors mentioned in Discussion (lines 370-373 &quot;…, other studies reported more rapid cytoplasmic REL relocalisation…&quot;), the rapid fall of nuclear RelA (around 40 minutes after TNF-α) has widely been reported by several groups (Alexander Hoffmann, Michael White, Markus Covert, Myong-Hee Sung, Savas Tay and their colleagues), but is absent in both PDAC lines. This indicates that the negative feedback genes such as IkappaB α/epsilon or A20 may have very different kinetics if they are induced at all in these cells. It seems important to determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines. RTqPCR of a few key negative feedback genes in the parental and derived reporter cells, as well as a control cell line (HeLa, MCF10, or THP-1) would be a straightforward way to answer this question. While this is not the focus of the study, I think that understanding which feedback is dysfunctional is probably relevant for therapeutic strategies against PDAC. It would also help the NF-kappaB signaling community understand the common and distinct features of dynamics observed in different cell systems.</p><p>and</p><p>In response to this comment, the authors &quot;carried out RNAseq with MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells with endogenously tagged RELA-eGFP&quot;. However, no methods are described in the manuscript itself regarding RNA-seq, either in the Methods or figure legends. Therefore, the readers would be left guessing if the samples were from the parental PDAC or the imaged cell lines. This might be an oversight; regardless, authors need to provide the method section on RNA-seq, including sample source, replicates, sequencing platform, data processing and analysis. Also, an accession ID for the RNA-seq data should be provided after depositing the dataset to a public data repository such as GEO, which is a standard requirement, I believe.</p><p>If the RNA-seq was done on the knockin reporter cells (as stated in the response), then the analysis does not directly address the question I raised in the original comment (&quot;…determine if this is a property of the parental PDAC cells or an acquired feature in the CRISPR knock-in reporter cells during the generation of the two reporter lines&quot;). Barring another round of RNA-seq analysis on the parental cell lines, for a minimum effort, the authors can perform RTqPCR of NFKBIA, NFKBIE, REL, RELB, NFKB2 (those found to be regulated by RelA in the reporter cells) in both the parental and the reporter cells. This would confirm that the observed NF-κB pathway gene expression patterns are indeed a property of PDAC cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for indicating the omission of RNA-seq methodology.

We have uploaded the RNA-seq data (FASTQ files and processed counts) to GEO under accession GSE268743. These data will be made immediately available upon publication of this manuscript. To confirm, RNA-seq was carried out using MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells with endogenously tagged RELA-GFP.</p><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s insight that the kinetics of NF-κB signalling may be altered in the generation of reporter cell lines. To address the reviewer’s query in differences between RNA expression in parental cells and cells expressing RELA-GFP, we have compared our RNA-seq results in MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells expressing RELA-GFP (x-axis) with publicly available RNA abundance data from the Expression Atlas (y-axis) from parental (WT) MIA PaCa2 and PANC1 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>). There is a strong correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89) between the RNA expression of NF-κB genes, as well as the negative regulators IκB and A20 (<italic>TNFAIP3</italic>), between WT cells and RELA-GFP-expressing cells.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-86042-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Expression Atlas data obtained from: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/experiments/E-MTAB-2706We did not have the resources or time to perform new qPCR experiments of these genes directly but believe the increased number of pathway genes compared by RNA seq data (10 genes), and the comparison to parental data from other labs, demonstrate the similarity of both RELA-GFP tagged pancreatic cancer lines to the parental cell lines.</p><p>In the literature, it is not generally the case that RNA expression in parental and derived lines are compared.

Such a bigger picture discussion might encourage readers to explore open topics in their own studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an amended version of the previous reviewer response on the cytoskeleton and TNF surface receptors to the manuscript Discussion:</p><p>‘One route through which cytoskeletal structures may influence RELA dynamics is by inducing changes in TNF receptor turnover or conformation. In the literature, evidence exists for the modulation of nuclear RELA by actin and tubulin inhibitors (Bourgarel-Rey et al., 2001; Németh et al., 2004), in addition to TNFα/RELA regulation of the cytoskeleton (Georgouli et al., 2019; Huber et al., 2004). However, there is limited evidence for cytoskeletal regulation of TNF receptors. One example is that the actin-binding protein Filamin interacts with Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 2 (<italic>TRAF2</italic>), which is not itself a TNF receptor but is involved in TNF receptor intracellular signal transduction (Leonardi et al., 2000). On a related topic, a recently published study (Alraies et al., 2024) subjected dendritic cells to space confinement and found upregulation of the chemokine receptor Ccr7, in a manner dependent on expression and function of IKKβ and the lipid metabolism enzyme cPLA2. In turn, the prostaglandin E2 receptor (PGE2) receptor, which is in the cPLA2 pathway, induces NF-κB nuclear translocation. This study also identifies a role for ARP2/3 activity in regulating cPLA2 activation via nuclear envelope tensioning. Interestingly, transcriptomics of confined cPLA2 WT and cPLA2 KO DCs revealed correlated expression between Ccr7, the gene encoding IKKβ (Ikbkb), and the major subunits of ARP2/3 (Actr2 and Actr3). Overall, the impact of cytoskeletal</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A revised manuscript presents the study of NF-κB signalling in PDAC tumours.

However, the manuscript suffers from some ambiguities regarding sample sizes and statistical analyses. Firstly, most if not all data is not triplicated, instead duplicates while some technical replicates are presented (e.g., Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 3 S1, Figure 4) -sometimes no information at all is provided (Figure 4C, Figure 4 S1). While part of this info is provided in methods, these should be included in appropriate captions. Secondly, there are limited details in terms of the statistical analyses, typically t-tests are performed (with corrections for multiple testing), often in the case of seemingly small sample sizes. E.g. Figure 3 S1 A' A'- t-test based on 2 samples (as far I understand). T critical he siRNa KO experiment (Figure 4) seems to involve 6 or 8 samples (judging by eye Figure A and B), for which typically a non-parametric test should be used instead. Given that the effect of siRNa-KO (in particular of the actin regulator genes) on p65 dynamics in the live-cell imaging data is subtle (Figure 4A), this poses questions about whether the conclusions are robust.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to Reviewer 3 for their positive feedback on our manuscript presentation and analyses, while also bringing to our attention the need for additional statistical information.

Therefore, MIA PaCa2 cells appear to have particularly long nuclear RELA persistence following TNFα compared to PANC1 cells and quantification in other studies in other cell lines (Ashall et al., 2009; Tay et al., 2010; Zambrano et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
