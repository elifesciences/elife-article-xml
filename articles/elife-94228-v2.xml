We have recently shown that ectopic expression of mouse IZUMO1 induces cell-cell fusion and that sperm can fuse to fibroblasts expressing JUNO. Here, we found that the incubation of mouse sperm with hamster fibroblasts or human epithelial cells in culture induces the fusion between these somatic cells and the formation of syncytia, a pattern previously observed with some animal viruses. This sperm-induced cell-cell fusion requires a species-matching JUNO on both fusing cells, can be blocked by an antibody against IZUMO1, and does not rely on the synthesis of new proteins. The fusion is dependent on the sperm’s fusogenic capacity, making this a reliable, fast, and simple method for predicting sperm function during the diagnosis of male infertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>male fertility test</kwd><kwd>Izumo1</kwd><kwd>Juno</kwd><kwd>in vitro fertilization</kwd><kwd>egg-sperm fusion</kwd><kwd>fusion from without</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>257/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podbilewicz</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2462/18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podbilewicz</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2327/19</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podbilewicz</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>178/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podbilewicz</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>844807</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brukman</surname><given-names>Nicolas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico, Direccion General de Asuntos del Personal Academico, Programa de Estancias de Investigacion (PREI), UNAM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Podbilewicz</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The fertilizing potential of sperm correlates with their ability to induce viral-like fusion of somatic cells expressing JUNO.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infertility is estimated to affect approximately 15% of the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">World Health Organization, 2023</xref>), and many couples dealing with this burden turn to assisted reproductive techniques (ARTs) as a possible solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Steptoe and Edwards, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Palermo et al., 1992</xref>). During fertility evaluation of a male patient, a basic semen examination is performed, where different sperm parameters are determined: concentration, motility, morphology, and vitality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">World Health Organization HRP, 2021</xref>). This basic analysis can be complemented with additional tests to determine the fertilizing potential of the sperm and choose the best treatment for the couple. The hamster oocyte penetration (HOP) test has been proposed as a quantitative method for analyzing the fusogenic potential of human spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aitken and Elton, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yanagimachi et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zainul Rashid et al., 1998</xref>), however, it was excluded from the newest WHO laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">World Health Organization HRP, 2021</xref>) for being considered obsolete. Therefore, to date, there is no other standardized methodology to analyze specifically the ability of sperm to fuse to oocytes.</p><p>In mammals, the adhesion of the sperm to the oocyte plasma membranes is mediated by the species-specific interaction of two membrane proteins: IZUMO1 and JUNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bianchi and Wright, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsumura et al., 2021</xref>). The transmembrane protein IZUMO1 is expressed during spermatogenesis and localizes to the fusogenic region of the sperm head after an exocytic process named acrosome reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Satouh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Inoue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nishimura et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, the IZUMO1 receptor, JUNO, is an oocyte protein bound to the plasma membrane by a GPI lipid anchor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bianchi et al., 2014</xref>). The subsequent fusion of the two gametes relies on the action of IZUMO1 in a unilateral manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>). The IZUMO1-JUNO interaction was characterized also in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aydin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohto et al., 2016</xref>) and its relevance for human fertility is supported by the presence of antibodies against IZUMO1 in the sera of immuno-infertile women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark and Naz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enoiu et al., 2022</xref>), the mutations on JUNO in cases of fertilization failure and polyspermy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark and Naz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enoiu et al., 2022</xref>), and the lower levels of IZUMO1 observed in sperm that failed to fertilize during in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark and Naz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Enoiu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we found that mouse sperm can fuse to fibroblasts ectopically expressing the sperm-receptor JUNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we show that after sperm fuses with a somatic cell, this cell can fuse with additional cells inducing syncytia formation - a single cell with several nuclei (multinucleated cell). This is possibly mediated by the bridging of a single sperm simultaneously fused to two different cells. We call this process ‘Sperm-induced cell-cell fusion requiring JUNO (SPICER).’ We found that sperm with higher fertilizing ability can induce the fusion of somatic cells more efficiently, judged by the increased levels of multinucleation. This establishes the basis for the future development of a new method for diagnosis of male fertility hinge on the ability of sperm to induce cell-cell fusion in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sperm fusion to fibroblasts promotes syncytia formation</title><p>There are reports showing that mammalian sperm can fuse to somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rival et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mattioli et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendich et al., 1974</xref>). In our experimental conditions, mouse sperm cells only fuse to Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cells if they are induced to express the sperm-receptor, JUNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>). This fusion was demonstrated by detecting the transfer of the DNA binding GFP (GFP-MBD) from the BHK cells to the sperm heads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>). To further study the mechanisms of mammalian sperm-oocyte fusion, we incubated mouse sperm with BHK cells expressing JUNO (functioning as pseudo-oocytes) and determined the efficiency of the sperm-BHK cell interactions. Surprisingly, we found that sperm induces the formation of multinucleated BHK cells (syncytia; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The induction of multinucleation was dependent on the presence of JUNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), however, JUNO expression alone is not sufficient to induce this process. Only cells with sperm fused to them form syncytia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, bigger syncytia tend to contain more sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and the levels of multinucleation were dependent on the amount of sperm added to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the fusion of sperm with JUNO-expressing BHK cells is required for inducing subsequent multinucleation of these somatic cells. This phenomenon was unexpected, leading us to further study the mechanisms of this process.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sperm induce syncytia formation of fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of experimental design: Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells were transfected with either pCI::H2B-RFP or pCI::JUNO::H2B-RFP vectors and pcDNA3.1-EGFP-MBD-nls.

However, decades ago, it was first described that some somatic cells can fuse following viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Okada, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kohn, 1965</xref>) and later confirmed for diverse viruses, including SARS-CoV2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Buchrieser et al., 2020</xref>). This process may require the synthesis of new viral proteins and, therefore, induces Fusion From Within (FFWI) while other viruses induce fusion independently of protein synthesis in a process called Fusion From Without (FFWO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bratt and Gallaher, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duelli and Lazebnik, 2007</xref>). For instance, orthoreoviruses induce the expression of fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins upon infection, promoting FFWI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ciechonska et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Theuerkauf et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesized that in a way reminiscent of viral-induced cell-cell fusion, sperm could induce syncytia formation following its merger via FFWI or FFWO. To distinguish between these alternative mechanisms, we performed the experiment in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. We found no differences in the levels of multinucleation between control and cycloheximide treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). This shows that de novo protein synthesis is not required for the induction of multinucleation by sperm and suggests a mechanism of FFWO. Additionally, live imaging of the process showed that fusion between cells occurs efficiently within 10–15 min after the addition of the sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), suggesting that protein synthesis is not involved. Even though it is not known whether sperm can induce the fusion of somatic cells in vivo, we show that sperm use a viral-like mechanism of FFWO when the fibroblasts express the oocyte JUNO in vitro.</p><media mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4" xlink:href="elife-94228-video1.mp4" id="video1"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Time-lapse experiment using spinning disk confocal microscopy showing the fusion of two cells expressing JUNO and GFPnes after the addition of sperm at t=0 min.</title><p>Time in hours:minutes.

For that, we employed a content-mixing experiment where two populations of cells expressing different fluorescent markers were mixed and then exposed to sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed the formation of multinucleated hybrid cells containing both fluorescent markers, confirming the fusion of BHK cells expressing JUNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This BHK-BHK cell fusion was not observed when only one or neither of the cell populations expressed JUNO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>), indicating that sperm-induced multinucleation is indeed BHK-BHK cell fusion which relies on bilateral expression of JUNO. An alternative explanation for sperm-induced multinucleation is a failure in cytokinesis.

The first model involves an initial fusion of the sperm to a BHK cell expressing JUNO, the transfer of IZUMO1 to the target cell (forming a pseudo-sperm from a pseudo-oocyte), and a subsequent fusion to a new JUNO-expressing BHK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2Ci</xref>). On the other hand, the second model suggests the fusion of one sperm cell with two JUNO-positive BHK cells, bridging both and forming a continuous syncytium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2Cii</xref>). We have previously shown that IZUMO1 fades from the sperm after fusion to the fibroblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brukman et al., 2023</xref>) indicating that this transmembrane protein is transferred to the target cell plasma membrane. Consistent with these findings, IZUMO1 was observed diffusing to the oocyte plasma membrane during in vitro fertilization assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Satouh et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we detected IZUMO1 by immunostaining and by a fluorescent reporter and confirmed that it diffuses from the sperm head after its fusion with the BHK cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>), suggesting a function for the fusogenic machinery carried by the sperm during the FFWO process. However, when sperm were first allowed to fuse with one population of green cells before adding the second population of red cells, hybrid syncytia were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Only when a viral fusogen (VSV-G) was employed or when the two populations of cells were plated before the addition of the sperm, content mixing was induced. These results suggest that it is not possible to uncouple temporarily the sperm-BHK and BHK-BHK cell fusions, arguing against the model of transfer of fusion proteins and suggesting that sperm are fusing simultaneously to two cells using a sperm sandwich mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2Cii</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Sperm-induced multinucleation as a readout of sperm fertilizing ability</title><p>Following the discovery of the ability of sperm to induce cell-cell fusion, we decided to evaluate whether BHK cell multinucleation could be used as a readout of sperm fusogenic potential. For this purpose, we incubated the sperm in media lacking BSA or Ca<sup>2+</sup> that do not support capacitation (i.e. a process by which sperm acquires its fusogenic activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Visconti et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yanagimachi, 1988</xref>). We found that sperm cells incubated under these conditions failed to fuse to BHK cells, as well as to induce syncytia formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Thus, BHK-BHK cell fusion requires fully capacitated sperm. A sperm which is unable to fuse with BHK cells, will not induce multinucleation. Furthermore, to examine whether the extent of cell-cell fusion correlates with the sperm fertilizing ability, we simultaneously evaluated the levels of multinucleation and the performance of sperm during in vitro fertilization assays. We detected a positive and significant correlation between the syncytia formation and the levels of fertilization, evaluated with complete and denuded oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>). In contrast, BHK multinucleation did not correlate with the percentage of acrosome reaction of capacitated sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that SPICER relies not only on capacitation but on the overall sperm fertilizing potential.

On the other hand, by simply exchanging the JUNO sequence used, this assay could be easily adapted to allow the analysis of the sperm fertilizing ability in different mammalian species, such as humans or cattle, having implications not only for reproductive health but also for biotechnological and agricultural uses. Furthermore, even though IZUMO1-JUNO interaction is a specific requirement during sperm-egg fusion of mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grayson, 2015</xref>), we cannot exclude that alternative configurations, using the right egg receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu and Ikawa, 2022</xref>), will be possible in the future to induce somatic cell-cell fusion by sperm of other sexually reproducing organisms.

In this context, other proteins that are essential for gamete fusion, such as SPACA6, TMEM95, TMEM81, FIMP, SOF1, and DCST1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barbaux et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenzetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lamas-Toranzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujihara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inoue et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Noda et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elofsson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Deneke et al., 2023</xref>), might be transferred to the somatic cells together with IZUMO1 during sperm-induced cell-cell fusion. Finally, considering that antibodies against IZUMO1 were detected on the sera of infertile women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark and Naz, 2013</xref>) and here, we observed that a monoclonal antibody against this protein was able to block sperm-induced syncytia, SPICER could serve as a tool to readily analyze cases of immuno-infertility. For all these cases, in-depth studies utilizing human sperm from healthy donors and infertile patients will be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Further applications for SPICER</title><p>In addition to the potential uses of SPICER for the diagnosis of infertility, this assay could be used to evaluate potential sperm donors and animal studs. Moreover, our SPICER tool has the potential to aid screening for compounds that enhance fertilization (new fertility treatments) or that block gamete interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stepanenko et al., 2022</xref>), or to easily determine the effect of genetic variations of JUNO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allingham and Floriano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takaiso et al., 2016</xref>). SPICER could also facilitate studies aimed at resolving standing enigmas of sperm-egg fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deneke and Pauli, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yanagimachi, 2022</xref>). This includes the role of IZUMO1 and other potential fusogens as well as additional cellular pathways that are known to influence fusion in different systems, including the action of the cytoskeleton and molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shilagardi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>), specific lipids (e.g. phosphatidylserine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rival et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">van den Eijnde et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abay et al., 2017</xref>), calcium signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsuchiya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Earles et al., 2001</xref>), phosphorylation cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eigler et al., 2021</xref>), and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brukman et al., 2019</xref>). Finally, whether other cell types rather than sperm, such as muscle cells or osteoclasts, can induce syncytia formation after ectopic fusion remains an open question, with important biological implications.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations of the study</title><p>The main caveat of our assay is that it cannot discriminate between defects in sperm docking or gamete fusion, as a poor performance in SPICER could be explained by the altered interaction of IZUMO1 and JUNO or by a reduced capacity of IZUMO1 (and IZUMO1 partners in the sperm) to induce membrane merger. Moreover, simultaneous measurements of the levels of spontaneous acrosome reaction will be needed to exclude a faulty capacitation. Alternatively, capacitation could be further stimulated pharmacologically using a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tateno et al., 2013</xref>). In this context, further analysis may be required to refine the characterization of defective sperm. As noted before, future validations using human sperm will be necessary for the establishment of an assay that could be used in the clinics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Equal amount of H2B-RFP and GFPnes cells (1.25 × 10<sup>5</sup> each) were mixed and seeded on glass-bottom plates (12-well black, glass-bottom #1.5 H; Cellvis) and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. 18 h after mixing, 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> capacitated wild-type sperm cells in mHTF were added to the BHK cells and co-incubated for 4 hr after which they were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS and stained with 1 µg/ml DAPI. Micrographs were obtained using wide-field illumination using an ELYRA system S.1 microscope (Plan-Apochromat 20×NA 0.8; Zeiss). The percentage of mixing was defined as the ratio between the nuclei in mixed cells (NuM) and the total number of nuclei in mixed cells and fluorescent cells whose cell bodies are in contact that did not fuse (NuC), as follows: % of mixing = (NuM/[NuM +NuC])×100. 1000 nuclei (NuM +NuC) were counted in each independent repetition (experimental point).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>Content mixing assay in two steps</title><p>BHK cells grown on 12-well glass bottom tissue-culture plates were transfected with 1 µg of either pCI::GFPnes or pCI::JUNO::GFPnes. 24 hr later, the cells were thoroughly washed with DMEM with 10% serum, and, when indicated, 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> capacitated wild-type sperm cells in mHTF were added to the BHK cells, and co-incubated for 1 hr. In some cases, the sperm were removed by washing three times with DMEM. In parallel, BHK cells grown in 35 mm plates that were transfected with 1 µg pCI::JUNO::H2B-RFP or pCI::VSV-G::H2B-RFP the day before were washed and detached using 0.05% EDTA solution.

In this work, we present evidence for a new phenomenon, named SPICER, of sperm-induced fusion of cells expressing the oocyte protein JUNO. We showed that this effect depends on JUNO, the sperm fertilizing ability, and the action of the sperm protein IZUMO1. We were glad to receive positive feedback from the reviewers, in which they understood the potential research and applied applications for our discovery that will be of interest to a wide audience. We have revised and improved the manuscript based on their suggestions.</p><p>The main concern that arose from the reviewers was that the applicability of the results to the diagnosis of human infertility is not direct and immediate. In the revised version, we are more cautious in these statements even though we have included new data showing that mouse sperm fertilizing ability correlates with the extent of cell-cell fusion observed (Figure 3C-D).</p><p>By request of the reviewers, we have performed an experiment to distinguish the mechanism by which sperm induce syncytia formation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). When sperm were allowed to fuse to one population of cells before adding the second one, we were not able to detect multinucleated cells with both markers. These results indicate that the simultaneous fusion of one sperm to two adjacent cells is the main mechanism for SPICER to occur.</p><p>In addition, we have new controls showing that sperm incubated without calcium or BSA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), two conditions employed to test the relevance of sperm capacitation, presented lower levels of acrosome reaction (i.e. a functional consequence of capacitation). Also as requested, we carried out the SPICER assay using the hamster JUNO which showed no differences compared to the mouse ortholog (Figure 4). This verifies the functional relevance of the assay by confirming the promiscuous nature of hamster oocytes during in vitro fertilization assays using sperm from different species including humans and mice.</p><p>Finally, we added information regarding the number of sperm per syncytia (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), a concentration curve of sperm (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B), and a time-course experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In summary, in this revised manuscript we have carefully considered all the suggestions made by the three reviewers and we enclose a detailed point-by-point response. We have deposited the revised manuscript in BioRxiv.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point-by-point description of the revisions</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This work by Bruckman et al. showed how sperm can induce somatic cell syncytium upon binding. This finding has tremendous implications for the field. Although gamete fusion is one of the fundamental events in biology, the molecular details of this process in mammals is not well understood. As briefly mentioned in this work, spermatozoa contribute Izumo1 which forms a complex with SPACA6 and TMEM81; and probably with other proteins. On the other hand, the egg counterpart is JUNO, a GPI- anchored protein, and CD9. IZUMO1 and JUNO have been shown to interact and this interaction is essential for fusion. However, it is still not clear the extent that this binding is needed for attachment of for fusion between gametes. The authors have published before that somatic cells expressing IZUMO1 can fuse with other cells expressing JUNO; and that sperm can fuse to JUNO-expressing cells. This previous work strongly suggests that IZUMO and JUNO are sufficient for fusion; however, the efficiency of the fusion assay was low. In the present work, formation of syncytium is highly efficient, making possible to envision applications of this assay to research of the proteins involved in sperm-egg fusion as well as for molecular mechanisms. In addition, as mentioned in this work, the assay can be translated for the use for clinical diagnosis.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the insightful comments that improved our manuscript. Furthermore, we appreciate the acknowledgment of the value of our findings for the field.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the manuscript is straightforward, and the conclusions are sound. I have only a couple of comments:</p><p>1) As mentioned in this work, fusion of human sperm with hamster eggs was used in the past to evaluate human sperm fusogenic properties. Although this assay is not longer recommended, still highlight the fact that hamster egg's oolemma is promiscuous regarding species-specific fusion. Although I don't think the experiment is essential, if it were possible, trying hamster IZUMO1 in this assay will be a good addition to this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment and it is now included in the revised manuscript (Figure 4). As discussed in the new version, hamster JUNO is as efficient as its murine counterpart in facilitating SPICER, confirming the well-known promiscuous nature of hamster eggs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is it possible to know how many sperm form part of the syncytium&gt;?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included in the revised manuscript a Figure showing the number of sperm fused in syncytia of different sizes (Figure 1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although I understand the relevance of this assay for diagnostic use, still the major contribution of this manuscript is to the sperm-egg fusion field of study. I encourage the authors to start the discussion with a more basic approach and add at least one paragraph summarizing how their discovery advanced the field. From my perspective the translational application should be at the end of the Discussion section, not at the start.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the Introduction and Discussion sections according to this comment. In addition, we are now including new data further supporting that the SPICER assay can be used to predict sperm fertilizing capacity (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee Cross-Commenting</p><p>The syncytia described in this work support the hypothesis that once Izumo and partners in sperm interact with Juno, the cells become able to undergo fusion events. It does not claim that this type of event happens in vivo. Although Juno is expressed in other cell types and not only in the egg, it is too soon to claim a physiological role for syncytia formation in vivo.</p><p>I agree with reviewer 2 comments. Both experiments proposed (paragraph 2 and 3) are relatively straightforward.</p><p>In general, I also agree with reviewer 3 comments, one of the experiments proposed is similar to the one proposed by reviewer 2. Having said this, I disagree that the human sperm experiment is needed for this paper to be significant. Although the diagnostic claim is important, the major contribution of this work is at the basic research level. Toning down the clinical relevance would be sufficient to make this paper a significant contribution to the field.</p><p>Mechanisms of sperm-egg fusion have been elusive for the last decades. In my view, syncytia formation and I don't expect a single paper to elucidate such a complex event.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>General Assessment: This is an excellent manuscript contributing to our understanding of sperm-egg fusion. In addition, the tools described here warrant new approaches to study the molecules involved in this process using genetically modified mouse models.</p><p>Advance: Although the relevance of IZUMO1 and JUNO for sperm-egg fusion have been previously reported, as far as I know, this is the first study showing somatic cell fusion and syncitium formation using sperm and somatic cells. This finding will provide new tools to study the molecular basis of sperm-egg fusion as well as generate translational tools to evaluate human sperm ability to fertilize.</p><p>Audience: I believe that this manuscript will have broad interest. Although initially, the main audience will be related to reproductive biologists, this manuscript will be also highly relevant for other scientists studying fusion. In addition, this work has clear translational applications.</p><p>Keywords describing my expertise: sperm, eggs, in vitro fertilization, reproductive biology, embryos</p></disp-quote><p>We are pleased and grateful to read this reviewer’s comments. We have now implemented the suggestions in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This is a very nice manuscript that continues previous work of the lab. Authors in this manuscript goes further, showing that proteins from the plasma membrane of sperm end up in somatic cells plasma membrane after fusing, conferring them fusogenic capacity. The manuscript is very elegantly written, and of interest to the reproductive community. I have only some minor concerns to be addressed:</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the positive feedback as well as for the valuable suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors indicate that this test &quot;can help embryologists to better predict the success of the different ARTs for each individual.&quot;. This assumption should be taken as it is, an assumption. In order to state that in can be used, authors should first demonstrate, maybe with a correlation test hand by hand with a reproductive clinic, that this procedure indeed works for diagnosis. There is no doubt that it is a very nice proof of principle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the Introduction and Discussion to be more cautious about this point. Unfortunately, we currently do not have permission to work with human samples, however, we have added new data showing a positive correlation between the extent of cell-cell fusion and the fertilizing potential of mouse sperm (Figure 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure S1C. Although I agree with the ayuthors that the two models are possible, have the authors tried to wash sperm away from the fusing assay, and add new cells, maybe differentially tagged, to see whether they fuse to those already fused with sperm? This could shed light onto the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed this experiment that was requested by Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). The results show that when the sperm are added to the plate before the addition of the second population of cells, no fusion is observed. This argues against the model in which there is transfer of the fusion machinery to the somatic cells. We have now adjusted the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 3. Sperm incubated in the absence of BSA, failed tu fuse to cells. I wonder whether the lack of BSA precludes fusogenicity. Have authors tried removing HCO3 and keeping BSA? The presence of HCO3 still enables PKA activation even in the absence of BSA, also allowing hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Have authors evaluated acrosomal status after the selected treatments?</p></disp-quote><p>As the co-incubation of the sperm and the cells is performed in the cell-culture incubator with CO<sub>2</sub> supply, we were not able to evaluate a condition without HCO3. However, we have analyzed the levels of acrosome reaction after the incubation in media without calcium or BSA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). For both conditions, the levels of acrosome reaction are significantly lower than the control consistent with previous reports (Visconti et al., 1995 PMID: 7743926).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee Cross-Commenting</p><p>I thank reviewer 3 for his/her insight. I agree on being cautious about the relevance of this finding, as it is unclear if anything similar happens in vivo.</p><p>I agree with comments raised by rev 1. This reviewer clearly points out that the clinical relevance of the manuscript is not a strength of the manuscript. And I agree with reorganizing the discussion as suggested. In this line, I consider very important to tone down the clinical aspect of the manuscript. In this regard, I completely understand the experiments suggested by reviewer 3, but still, I think that the major contribution of this manuscript is to the sperm-egg fusion field of study. Thus, my suggestion is to tone down to a minimum level the clinical relevance of the study.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The work shows an interesting advance in the field. However, caution should be taken when referring to &quot;capacitated sperm&quot;, since no controls are taken, and methods to inhibit capacitation are not solid.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have improved the manuscript following their recommendations and now the pertinent controls are included (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors find that mouse sperm can fuse to hamster fibroblasts (Baby Hamster Kidney, BHK) and that consequently these cells form large multinucleated syncytia. They describe and quantify the formation of syncytia and suggest that the sperm ability to induce formation of syncytia is associated with sperm functionality.</p><p>Based on these findings, the authors propose a novel method for the diagnosis of male infertility.</p><p>Overall, the manuscript is clearly written, and the experimental procedures are described in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate the important comments and suggestions made by Reviewer #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>The main limitation of the study is that the data is obtained with mouse sperm, while the proposed application is for the evaluation of human sperm fertilizing ability. The authors need to repeat the assay of sperm fusion to somatic cells with human samples.</p><p>Furthermore, to correlate sperm functionality with cell fusion induction, it would be necessary to compare sperm from fertile and infertile men. The experiment reported in figure 3, where non-capacitated sperm, maintained in media without Calcium or without BSA, are used, does not mimic real cases of human male infertility where even fully capacitated sperm are unable to fertilize eggs.</p><p>The experiments with human sperm should not take longer than 6 months, depending on the local legislation regulating human sample collection and usage.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point made by Reviewer #3 and agree to tone down the clinical significance of the finding. Unfortunately, we do not have permission to perform experiments with human samples. We also agree with Reviewers #1 and #2 in the sense that these experiments are out of the scope of this study. However, we have now included new data directly correlating mouse sperm fertilizing ability and syncytia formation (Figure 3) that further support our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Figure 1. The % of multinucleation in panel C (~ 55%) and in panel D (25%) are substantially different. The authors should explain better how the percentages were calculated.</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the Results section, within the panels and in the legend of Figure 1, in panel C we quantify multinucleation separately for cells with and without sperm fused to them to distinguish the effect of sperm fusion. Instead, in panel D we quantify multinucleation in the whole population. This is better clarified in the revised version in the legend of Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2., panel C. It is unclear how the number of 'fluorescent cells IN CONTACT that do not fuse (NuC)' are evaluated given the lack of a marker for cell membranes or for actin. It is challenging to visualize all the filopodia at the edges of cells just with light microscopy, therefore adding a cell membrane dye could be helpful for visualization and counting.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we cannot confirm that the cells are projecting filopodia between them. When we stated “in contact” we referred to the cell body, as we have done in several publications to date: Podbilewicz et al., 2006 (DOI 10.1016/j.devcel.2006.09.004); Avinoam et al., 2011 (DOI: 10.1126/science.1202333); Valansi et al., 2017 (DOI: 10.1083/jcb.201610093); Moi et al., 2022 (DOI: 10.1038/s41467-022-31564-1); and Brukman et al., 2023 (DOI: 10.1083/jcb.202207147). To be more specific we have now explained this in the revised version as “cells whose cell bodies are in contact”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3, panel A. The authors should specify if the 500 cells are single cells or nuclei, including those in syncytia.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure refers to cells, not nuclei. It is better explained in the revised version of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1 panel C. To discern between the mechanism proposed in (i) and (ii), a possibility would be to add sperm to JUNO(GFPnes) cells, wash them out carefully after 4 hours in order to remove non-fused and unbound sperm, and then to add JUNO(H2B-RFP) cells. If sperm induce multinucleation by fusing with more than one cell, only GFP syncytia will be obtained. On the other hand, if fusion is due to the transfer of sperm fusing machinery, syncytia will be GFP positive and have red nuclei too.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed this important experiment that was also requested by Reviewers #1 and #2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). We found that when the sperm were added to the plate before the addition of the second population of cells, no hybrid syncytia were formed, only multinucleated GFP cells. The manuscript has been modified to include this observation that points against the model in which there is transfer of the fusion machinery to the somatic cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>As pointed out by reviewer 1 'this is the first study showing somatic cell fusion and syncitium formation using sperm and somatic cells' therefore if the clinical relevance of the manuscript is toned down, I believe that the authors need to add a more in-depth investigation of the cell fusion mechanism. Particularly in consideration of the data shown by other groups indicating that IZUMO1 and JUNO are not sufficient for cell fusion. In that regard, the experiments suggested by reviewers 1 and 2 would be helpful to start getting a better understanding of the mechanism. Anyhow, I would be extremely cautious about the relevance of this finding because it is unclear whether anything similar happens in vivo.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The mechanism of sperm-egg cell membrane fusion is still unclear, and the entire molecular machinery orchestrating fertilization is yet to be unveiled.</p><p>The sperm protein IZUMO1 and its egg receptor JUNO have been shown to be essential for sperm-egg binding in mouse, human and rats. Whether IZUMO1 also mediates membrane fusion is still debated because research groups who have adopted various assays came to different conclusions (PMID: 24739963; PMID: 35096839; PMID: 36394541; PMID: 26568141).</p><p>In a previous paper published earlier this year Brukman and colleagues showed that IZUMO1 is able to induce membrane fusion in a heterologous cell system (PMID: 36394541). In the current manuscript, they expand on this observation and report the formation of syncytia (large multinucleated cells) induced by the fusion of sperm with somatic cells. Whether this event that is observed in vitro has any relevance in vivo has to be investigated.</p><p>The large amount of work done on an unrelated cell membrane protein, the fibroblast growth factor receptor-like 1 (FGRL1), that also induces cell fusion in vitro, suggests a possible interpretation for the results described by Brukman et al. 'Cell fusion might just be the most extreme result of very tight cell adhesion […] Under normal conditions, FgfrL1 might only bring together the cell membranes into intimate contact' https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00018-012-1189-9 (PMID:23112089)</p><p>Therefore, it is reasonable to think that cell-cell fusion observed in vitro does not recapitulate the fusion of sperm and egg.</p><p>Regardless of whether sperm can induce fusion of somatic cells in vivo, the SPICER method proposed in this manuscript needs to be validated with human sperm in order to become a valuable tool for the assessment of male fertility.</p></disp-quote><p>We are truly grateful for the comments and suggestions made by Reviewer #3 that allowed us to improve our manuscript. We agree about the important questions that arise from our discovery and we believe that SPICER will be a powerful tool to address them in the future. We would only like to mention that the FGRL1-induced fusion was observed only when at least one of the fusing cells was a CHO cell (PMCID: PMC2988375 DOI: 10.1074/jbc.M110.140517). In our case, the fact that SPICER, as well as IZUMO1-induced fusion (Brukman et al., 2023, J Cell Biol.), was detected in two unrelated cell lines (i.e. hamster BHK and human HEK cells) argues against a cell-specific effect and suggests the involvement of a conserved mechanism.</p></body></sub-article></article>
