survival signaling pathways. In conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), Src is involved in the activation of the non-enzymatic functions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1), an immunoregulatory molecule endowed with both catalytic activity and signal transducing properties. Prompted by the discovery that the metabolite spermidine confers a tolerogenic phenotype on cDCs that is dependent on both the expression of IDO1 and the activity of Src kinase, we here investigated the spermidine mode of action. We found that spermidine directly binds Src in a previously unknown allosteric site located on the backside of the SH2 domain and thus acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the enzyme. Besides confirming that Src phosphorylates IDO1, here we showed that spermidine promotes the protein–protein interaction of Src with IDO1. Overall, this study may pave the way toward the design of allosteric modulators able to switch on/off the Src-mediated pathways, including those involving the immunoregulatory protein IDO1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Src kinase</kwd><kwd>polyamine</kwd><kwd>IDO1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010607</institution-id><institution>Università degli Studi di Perugia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ricerca di base 2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mondanelli</surname><given-names>Giada</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AIRC 2019-23084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Volpi</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Ministry of Education, University, and Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PRIN 2020L45ZW</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orabona</surname><given-names>Ciriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010607</institution-id><institution>Università degli Studi di Perugia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ricerca di base 2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macchiarulo</surname><given-names>Antonio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A road to modulators of the kinase activity and the non-enzymatic functions of Src and IDO1 at once.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Besides being intermediates in metabolic reactions, metabolites can serve as intra- and intercellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Piazza et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, by interacting with specific molecular partners, soluble mediators can trigger a series of molecular events critical for cell fitness and adaptation. Metabolites binding to either the active site or the allosteric pocket – that is, that different from the catalytic site – of enzymes are among the best-characterized interactions that modulate protein activity as well as the assembly and function of multiprotein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Changeux and Christopoulos, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mondanelli et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The naturally occurring polyamines (i.e., putrescine, spermidine, and spermine) are organic cations derived from the decarboxylation of <sc>L</sc>-ornithine, which is generated by the arginase 1 from <sc>L</sc>-arginine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pegg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Igarashi and Kashiwagi, 2000</xref>). The conversion of <sc>L</sc>-ornithine into putrescine is catalyzed by the rate-limiting enzyme ornithine decarboxylase 1, followed by two specific synthases that sequentially give rise to spermidine and spermine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pendeville et al., 2001</xref>). These metabolites are protonated at physiological pH levels, allowing them to interact with negatively charged macromolecules, including nucleic acids, proteins, and phospholipids. Given their structure, polyamines indeed modulate several cellular processes, ranging from cell growth and proliferation to immune system function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Proietti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Holbert et al., 2022</xref>). As a matter of the fact, alteration of polyamines intracellular content is associated with the occurrence of several tumors, including prostate, breast, and colon cancers, for which polyamines are considered as biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nakkina et al., 2021</xref>). Among polyamines, spermidine has recently gained much more attention as player of immune regulation and in age-related disorders, such as cardiac hypertrophy and memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madeo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eisenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ni and Liu, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Spermidine exerts a protective role in mouse experimental models of autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and psoriasis, by activating the Forkhead box protein O3 (FOXO3) pathway and thus suppressing the production of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interleukin (IL)-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, spermidine is able to reprogram mouse conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) toward an immunoregulatory phenotype via Src kinase-dependent phosphorylation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>). However, the exact mechanism of Src activation by spermidine remains to be elucidated.</p><p>The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is the representative of a family of structure-related kinases initially discovered as a proto-oncogene regulating critical cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Oppermann et al., 1979</xref>). Src activation mainly occurs downstream of multiple transmembrane receptors, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGF-R), and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). Indeed, a dysregulated Src activity has been associated with tumor growth and metastasis, inflammation-mediated carcinogenesis, and therapeutic resistance to traditional antineoplastic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dosch et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roskoski, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shao et al., 2022</xref>). The induction of Src kinase activity can also occur following Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor (AhR) activation, whose conformational changes favor the Src-AhR disjunction, allowing the former to phosphorylate its downstream partner IDO1 and thereby promote the generation of an immunoregulatory milieu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manni et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the kinase domain, Src possesses an N-terminal Src homology-4 (SH4) domain, a unique domain, an SH3 domain, an SH2 domain, an SH2-kinase linker domain, and a C-terminal autoregulatory motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roskoski, 2015</xref>). The SH2 and SH3 modules serve in protein–protein interactions that are essential for the regulation of kinase activity and signaling function. Specifically, the SH2 domain contains two distinct binding pockets. The first one has a conserved arginine residue that binds a phosphotyrosine (pY) residue presented by the protein substrate, whereas the second pocket binds the residue that is three positions C-terminal of pY (pY+3), contributing to the specificity in ligand–protein recognition.</p><p>The autoregulatory function of the kinase occurs through intramolecular interactions that stabilize the catalytically inactive conformation of Src, in which the SH2 domain binds to a pY located at position +530 of the human sequence. Accordingly, binding of ligand proteins to the SH2 domain displaces intramolecular contacts and promotes the catalytic activation of the Src kinase, which is characterized by the phosphorylation of a tyrosine residue in the activation loop (Y419 of the human sequence). Given the crucial role of the non-catalytic domains in modulating Src kinases activity, efforts have been made to develop drug-like modulators of the SH2 and SH3 domains. Small peptidomimetics destabilize the closed conformation and thus promote the kinase activation through the binding of SH3 and/or SH2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moroco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moroco et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, modulators of Src kinases able to reinforce the intramolecular interactions have proven to allosterically inhibit the enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorman et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Prompted by the finding that spermidine triggers the immunosuppressive IDO1 signaling in cDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>), here we investigated the molecular relationship between that polyamine, Src kinase and IDO1. We found that spermidine (1) activates Src kinase with an allosteric mechanism; (2) binds directly Src kinase at a previously unknown allosteric site; (3) favors the association of IDO1 and Src kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spermidine causes allosteric activation of the kinase activity of Src</title><p>The activation of Src kinase mainly occurs downstream of multiple transmembrane and intracellular receptors (such as AhR) as well as protein tyrosine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mondanelli et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arias-Romero et al., 2009</xref>). In cDCs, it has been demonstrated that a small molecule, namely spermidine, activates Src with a still undefined mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>). To figure out whether a direct activation would occur, we assayed spermidine against purified recombinant human Src (rhSrc) protein. After 30 min of incubation, a luminescent assay was used to measure the ADP released by the kinase. Results showed that spermidine activated rhSrc with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 106.4 ± 13.4 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To confirm the modulation of the kinase also in living cells, we resorted to immunoblot analysis of phosphorylated murine Src at the tyrosine Y418 as sign of kinase activation. SYF cells that is fibroblast null for Src family kinases, Src, Yes, and Fyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>) were stably transfected with vector encoding for murine Src kinase and then treated with increasing concentration of spermidine. Results showed that the metabolite promoted Src phosphorylation with an EC50 of 6.4 ± 0.6 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). In addition, by measuring the kinase activity in cells endogenously expressing Src (i.e., the murine colon cancer cell line MC38), we confirmed the ability of the polyamine to activate Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spermidine enhances the activity of Src kinase in ATP-independent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Enzymatic activity of rhSrc in the presence of ATP (10 μM), synthetic peptide (100 μM), and increasing concentration of spermidine (45 nM to 100 μM).

Results showed that spermidine did not activate Src in the absence of either ATP or peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while it promoted the production of ADP when the substrate is also present, ruling out any competition for the same site. As this profile was compatible with an allosteric modulation, we incubated rhSrc with different concentration of ATP or peptide. In the presence of fixed amount of spermidine and increasing concentration of the peptide, the maximum rate of Src kinase activity (Vmax) and the affinity (Km) for the substrate increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). On the contrary, in the presence of different concentration of ATP, spermidine did not affect neither the efficacy nor the affinity of Src kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such a kinetic profile is consistent with a non-ATP competition, suggesting that spermidine allosterically activates the kinase activity of Src. On measuring the spermidine effect on constitutive active Src, we resorted to the SYF cells model expressing the Src carrying a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at position 529 of the murine sequence (here, Src Y529F). Results demonstrated that the polyamine is not able to activate Src Y529F as measured by its phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that spermidine per se cannot activate or stabilize the constitutive active form of Src, instead it might promote the conformational changes of the kinase and thus its activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Spermidine binds to a negatively charged pocket in SH2 domain of Src kinase</title><p>In the inactive state, Src assumes a closed conformation with the SH3 domain bound to the SH2-kinase linker and the SH2 domain bound to the tyrosine phosphorylated tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

As a result, n.18 solutions were obtained showing a conserved binding mode located in a shallow cavity close to E150 and shaped by A148, F153, and T250 (sequence numbering of human isoform, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

SYF cells were thus stably transfected with vectors coding for the mutated Src (i.e., Src E149A and Src E168A) and wild-type Src (WT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To validate the functional equivalence of Src mutants, cells were exposed to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a stimulus known to activate Src kinase downstream the LPA2 receptor in SYF cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lai et al., 2005</xref>). Results indicated that Src activity is induced by LPA as measured by the phosphorylation of the Y418, independently of the mutation at the putative allosteric site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). On evaluating the activation of Src by spermidine, we found that the mutation of the glutamate residues abrogated the kinase activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). The split-luciferase fragment complementation assay confirmed that E149 and E168 are key anchoring points for spermidine binding. Specifically, SYF cells expressing Src WT or mutant were stably transfected with a bioluminescent reporter that contains the SH2 domain and the Src consensus substrate peptide between the amino-(Nluc) and carboxyl-(Cluc) terminal domains of the Firefly luciferase molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Niu and Chen, 2012</xref>). When the endogenous Src is active, the tyrosine residue of the consensus peptide is phosphorylated and interact with the docking pocket of the SH2 domain. This creates a steric hindrance that prevents the reconstitution of a functional luciferase, resulting in a reduction of bioluminescent signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Cells co-expressing Src and the reporter were thus exposed to spermidine and the luminescent signal was measured. Results demonstrated that the bioluminescence decreased when spermidine is applied only in cells ectopically expressing wild-type Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Of note, in the absence of spermidine, cells – those reconstituted with the reporter and the different mutants of Src – did not generate statistically different luminescent signal (617.7 ± 121 vs 552.2 ± 68.9 vs 501 ± 110, WT Src vs E149A vs E168A, respectively). This suggests that the basal activity of the kinase is not affected by the specific amino acid substitution.</p><p>Overall, these data suggested the presence of a previously unknown allosteric site on the backside of Src SH2 domain as defined by the glutamate residues at positions 150 and 169 of the human sequence. Spermidine, by means of ionic and hydrogen bond interactions between its protonated amino groups and residues of the shallow anionic site on the SH2 domain, directly associates with and activates Src kinase. It is worth noting that no direct interaction was observed between spermidine and E169 in the docking study. This may be ascribed to the limit of the scoring function in identifying a binding mode engaging E169 among resulting solutions, or to an indirect role of such residue in promoting long-range electrostatic interactions to accomplish the molecular recognition of the cognate ligand into the allosteric site. Moreover, the alignment of murine Src, Yes, and Fyn sequences highlighted that only the glutamate residue at position 149 of murine Src is conserved across SH2 domains, while the glutamate residue at position 168 is replaced by the amino acid glycine (data not shown). Thus, although we cannot exclude that spermidine can bind the SH2 domain of related Src kinases, we might speculate that the lack of the negative charge at position 168 reduces the long-range electrostatic interactions that we hypothesized to be responsible for the molecular recognition of the ligand into the allosteric site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Spermidine promotes the Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of IDO1 and their interaction</title><p>Among the proteins phosphorylated by Src, the immunometabolic enzyme IDO1 is worthy of note (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manni et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, aside metabolizing the amino acid tryptophan, IDO1 is endowed with non-enzymatic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mondanelli et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallotta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orabona et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Orecchini et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albini et al., 2018</xref>). The latter relies on the presence of two ITIMs (immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) that can be phosphorylated in response to immunomodulatory stimuli, such as TGF(transforming growth factor)-β, <sc>L</sc>-kynurenine, and spermidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Manni et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pallotta et al., 2011</xref>). However, the exact molecular mechanism and the role of spermidine have never been explored. To confirm that Src can phosphorylate IDO1, SYF cells were reconstituted with vectors coding for murine wild-type Src and IDO1, either alone or in combination, and then were exposed to spermidine. Results from immunoblot demonstrated that IDO1 phosphorylation increased when Src is co-expressed and activated by spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, we found that in the presence of a constitutive active Src (i.e., Src Y529F) IDO1 phosphorylation increases regardless of the stimulation with spermidine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that spermidine can act as an on/off switcher of the kinase, without potentiating the constitutively active protein.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spermidine triggers the phosphorylation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) by Src kinase and the complex formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody from SYF cells reconstituted with vectors coding for Src and IDO1 and then treated with spermidine (100 μM) for 60 min.

By detecting phosphotyrosine residues with a specific antibody, we found that IDO1 was phosphorylated in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C</xref>). Moreover, in the presence of spermidine, Src quicker phosphorylated IDO1, as demonstrated by the twofold increase of the relative velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To figure out whether the IDO1 phosphorylation was a direct effect through physical interaction with Src, SYF cells reconstituted with murine wild-type Src and IDO1 were exposed to spermidine for different length of time. Co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot studies demonstrated that when cells were treated with spermidine for 60 min, IDO1 was found in a complex with Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Of note, among the predicted functional partners of murine Src, we verified additional substrates (i.e., Stat3) and we found that the spermidine effect is specific to the IDO1–Src complex (data not shown). The specific IDO1–Src interaction was confirmed in situ by the proximity ligation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>).

Results demonstrated that when MC38 cells are exposed to spermidine, the phosphorylation of IDO1 increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) as well as the IDO1/Src interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p><p>As a whole, these results suggested that spermidine not only accelerates the Src-mediated phosphorylation of IDO1, but also promotes the formation of Src–IDO1 complex.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is the representative of a family of structure-related enzymes involved in several signaling pathways regulating key cellular processes as well as immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caner et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Much relevant literature correlates dysregulated Src kinase activity with cancer and thus extensive efforts have been made to develop small molecules kinase inhibitors. Currently, approved kinase inhibitors are compounds that reversibly bind the catalytic site and thus compete with the ligand (i.e., ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roskoski, 2015</xref>). As the ATP-binding cleft is structurally well conserved among kinases, these inhibitors are poorly selective. Moreover, their chronic usage is frequently associated with acquired drug resistance that ultimately limits patients’ compliance and the therapeutic success. For instance, the FDA-approved Dasatinib and Bosutinib inhibit more than 30 kinases, and thus are not suitable for probing Src-dependent pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ozanne et al., 2015</xref>). Saracatinib is another example of small molecule that interacts with the ATP-binding pocket. Although more selective than Dasatinib, it potently inhibits EGF-R as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Formisano et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to competitive Src inhibitors, an emerging pharmacological modality – known as targeted covalent inhibitors – has been pursued at the preclinical level for blocking Src kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gurbani et al., 2020</xref>). However, the promiscuity of molecules interacting with the ATP pocket has moved the interest toward the development of alternative strategies for more effective and less-toxic inhibitors.</p><p>The peculiarity of the Src protein, as well as of other tyrosine kinases, is its structural plasticity, that is, the capability to adopt distinct conformations due to intrinsic dynamic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engen et al., 2008</xref>). The activation state of this protein kinase is indeed dictated by dynamic intramolecular interactions between the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains. The SH2 domain plays a key role in both autoregulating Src kinase activity and in recruiting the protein ligand. Specifically, the tyrosine residue at position +530, when phosphorylated, interacts with the SH2 domain and stabilizes a restrained catalytically inactive conformation of Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shah et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, binding of ligand proteins to the SH2 domain displaces intramolecular contacts and promotes the catalytic activation of the Src kinase. This activating event is mostly driven by a dynamic breakage and formation of electrostatic interactions that involve salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. Guided by the dynamic nature of the kinase, allosteric modulation has been proposed as pharmacological approach to target the activity of Src kinase. Allosteric molecules do not possess intrinsic efficacy, but instead modulate – either positively or negatively – the activity of orthosteric agonists. Moreover, being less conserved among kinases, the allosteric hotspots ensure greater drug selectivity. Targetable allosteric pockets have been identified for few kinases as reported for Hck, Lyn, Aurora A kinase, and Bcr-Abl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dorman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saporito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panicker et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, modulators of the SH2 and SH3 domains – either peptidomimetics or small molecules – have been developed as chemical tools modifying the conformation and thus both the enzymatic and non-enzymatic functions of Src, the latter including protein–protein interactions and intracellular localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moroco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moroco et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Saporito et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leonard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Metabolites are chemicals that do not merely take place in the metabolic reactions, but are also involved in inter- and intracellular communications, energy production, macromolecule synthesis, post-translational modifications, and cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gargaro et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Makowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Icard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diskin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mondanelli and Volpi, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mondanelli and Volpi, 2020</xref>). In accordance, the enzymes responsible for their production are considered central regulators of the function of cells, including immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giovanelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grohmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mandarano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonometti et al., 2023</xref>). IDO1 is the prototype of such metabolic enzymes acting at the forefront of immune responses. Thanks to its catalytic activity as well as non-enzymatic function (relying on the phosphorylation of its ITIMs), IDO1 is a tiebreaker of tolerance and immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grohmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mondanelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iacono et al., 2020</xref>). Prompted by the finding that spermidine (i.e., a natural occurring polyamine) can reprogram murine cDCs toward an immunoregulatory phenotype <italic>via</italic> the Src kinase-dependent induction of the IDO1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>), we here demonstrated that the polyamine behaves as a positive allosteric modulator of Src by increasing the maximum rate of enzyme activity. Indeed, electrostatic potential calculation studies on the SH2 domain identified a surface endowed with a negative electrostatic potential on the back side of the pY-binding site, as delimited by glutamate residues E149 and E168. By its protonated amino groups, spermidine interacts with the anionic head of E149 on the SH2 domain, directly associates with and activates Src kinase. As a matter of the fact, the site-directed mutagenesis of the glutamate residues with uncharged amino acids abrogates the spermidine-mediated activation of Src kinase. On note, by aligning murine Src with several SH2 domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) such as enzymes (Abl1, SHIP1), docking (Shc1), and adaptor (Grb2, SOCS1) proteins, we found that neither E149 nor E168 are conserved, in their place there are non-polar hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., alanine, glycine, and proline) or those with polar uncharged side chains (e.g., glutamine) (data not shown). These would suggest that spermidine cannot broadly bind SH2-domain containing proteins and that the polyamine selectively affects the Src kinase activity. It is noteworthy of mention that polyamines are not new in the field of allosteric modulation, as they modify the activity of ionotropic <italic>N</italic>-methyl-<sc>D</sc>-aspartate receptor (NMDAR, a receptor for glutamate) by both increasing the affinity of NMDAR for the co-agonist glycine and relieving the tonic proton inhibition of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hirose et al., 2015</xref>), further supporting the spermidine mode of action. Polyamines are usually considered as a family of molecules with similar functions; however, different polyamines may have distinct, sometimes opposite, roles as in inflammatory- and age-related pathologies, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Minois et al., 2011</xref>). Concordantly, they have a different regulatory capacity on Src. For instance, putrescine and spermidine, but not spermine, promote the phosphorylation of Src in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hölttä et al., 1993</xref>), while spermine negatively modulates the activity of the kinase in intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). In cDCs, putrescine and spermidine, but not spermine, increased Src phosphorylation and when compared the IDO1-inducing ability of polyamines, the induction of the IDO1 protein could be observed only for spermidine-treated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mondanelli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Besides confirming that Src phosphorylates IDO1, and that the polyamine accelerates the enzyme kinetic, here we showed that spermidine promotes the interaction of Src with IDO1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Our data provided evidence that an endogenous metabolite, when present at specific concentrations, can directly activate Src kinase without requiring a membrane receptor. By acting on the backside of the SH2 domain, that is the domain responsible for the substrate binding, spermidine not only modulates the catalytic activity, but also affects the scaffold function of Src in organizing transducing signaling complexes – as those with IDO1 – which could be relevant in many diseases. Thus, from a therapeutic perspective, our results provide the proof of principle for the development of molecules that can modulate the kinase activity and the non-enzymatic functions of Src and IDO1 at once.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Scheme of the Src kinase modulation by the polyamine spermidine.</title><p>Created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorender.com/">BioRender.com</ext-link>.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85872-fig4-v2.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>SYF cells that is fibroblast null for Src, Fyn, and Yes kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klinghoffer et al., 1999</xref>); RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_6461">CVCL_6461</ext-link> were grown in DMEM(Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium) supplemented with 10% FCS(fetal calf serum), at 37°C, in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator.

It should be mentioned that the SH2 domain of the viral Src kinase shares a high sequence identity (97%) with the relative SH2 domains of human and murine Src tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, it is possible to use the NMR structure of the viral isoform with very good approximation to infer about the electrostatic potential map of human SH2 domain and to investigate the putative binding site of spermidine. The use of the NMR structure of the single viral SH2 domain avoids the bias that a full-length structure of human Src kinase might bring into more time-consuming calculations due to considering multiple conformations between the regulatory and kinase domains of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Indeed, diverse conformations of Src may differently affect the electrostatic potential of the SH2 domain as well as potentially mask a putative binding site for spermidine.

In particular, hydrogen atoms were added and the internal geometries of the protein were optimized with a coordinate displacement restrain on heavy atoms set to 0.3 Å.

The inner box was sized 10 × 10 × 10 Å. Since the allosteric site features a shallow surface, a ligand induced-fit approach was used to investigate the binding mode of spermidine. Accordingly, docking solutions were obtained using the induced-fit docking algorithm (Schrödinger Release 2021-3: Induced Fit Docking, Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2021) and the standard protocol to generate up to n.20 binding poses of spermidine into the allosteric site.

The side chain conformations of residues within 5 Å of the ligand-binding pose were sampled and refined using the OPLS 2005 force field.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Volker Dötsch as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please be more clear in the numbering of amino acids and specific species used:</p><p>– Line 65. In the introduction, the authors stated &quot;The autoregulatory function of the kinase occurs through intramolecular interactions that stabilize the catalytically inactive conformation of Src, in which the SH2 domain binds to a pY located at position +535.&quot; What Src isoform and species are the authors referring to? cSrc is regulated by phosphorylation of Tyr530 in human, Tyr529 in mouse, Tyr527 in avian protein. Providing a reference would be helpful.</p><p>– Line 88. The authors stated that they check the phosphorylation of human Src on Tyr424 as an indicator of Src activity. Human Src is phosphorylated on Tyr419, the mouse is on 418, and avian is on 416.</p><p>– in vitro experiments were done with human Src but there is no clear statement of what Src construct was used in SYF cells.</p><p>– Figure 2C does not highlight A153, F155? and T255. Is F155 numbering correct? E155 or F155?</p><p>2. Related: Amino acid positions for the SH2 domain listed in the Results section are confusing. Authors must indicate what species they are referring to. The figure shows the SH2 domain of vSrc. However, vSrc does not have Glu in either position. It appears that the positions are specified for rat Src. Why did the author choose to take the structure of the vSrc SH2 domain alone? If they would take a look at the structure of full-length human Src (PDB# 1FMK) they would find that both Glu amino acids are positioned in close proximity to the region where the SH3 domain binds suggesting a different mechanism of action if these are the sites spermidine interaction. The docking models shown in Figure 2C, D do not reflect the real interactions because they are done with SH2 alone. They have to be one with full-length Src.</p><p>3. Please have a look at the statistical analysis and adjust accordingly:</p><p>– Figure 1A. The authors do not indicate how many repeats they did for this experiment. Half of the data points do not have error bars. The error bars for the other half are not specified. The figure legend suggests that the star should indicate a statistically significant difference between samples. However, the samples highlighted in Figure 1A do not appear to be different at all. Also, it is not clear if the other samples are significantly different.</p><p>– Figure 1C. The figure legend suggests that the star should indicate a statistically significant difference between samples. However, the samples highlighted in Figure 1C do not appear to be different at all. Also, it is not clear if the other samples are significantly different given how large the error bars are.</p><p>– Figure 3C does not show any error bars and does not indicate any statistical analysis.</p><p>4. Related: Line 98. Authors stated that &quot;In the presence of fixed amount of spermidine and increasing concentration of the peptide, the maximum rate of Src kinase activity (Vmax) increased, while the affinity (Km) for the substrate was not affected (Figure 1E).&quot; However, neither Vmax nor Km values are provided. Judging from the data, it might be impossible to obtain these parameters within the concentration range tested. Also, the figure legend does not indicate how many replicates were performed and what are the error bars showing. The same criticism applies to Suppl Figure S1.</p><p>5. In Figure 1A authors show that wild-type Src is activated two-fold by spermidine. It is important to show how spermidine affects the activity of constitutively active Src. This experiment will also allow authors to evaluate the extent of activation and compare the Kcat and Vmax of constitutively active Src and spermidine-activated. A two-fold increase in activity is not substantial for Src but this could be the limitation of the assay.</p><p>6. Figure 1b does not indicate what concentration of spermidine was used in what lane.</p><p>7. Authors show that spermidine induced maximum Src activity at 106nM in vitro. However, EC50 in cells is much higher at 6uM. How would the authors explain the discrepancy? Such a drastic difference suggests that the mechanism of Src activation in cells might be different from what they observe with purified protein.</p><p>8. The rationale for the experiment in Figure 1D is not clear. Why would there be any activity without ATP or substrate? Some of the bars in Figure 1D are marked with stars indicating statistical significance but it is not clear what they are compared to.</p><p>9. Line 129. Authors stated that &quot;Results indicated that Src activity is induced by LPA as measured by the phosphorylation of the Y424, independently of the mutation at the putative allosteric site (Supplementary Figure S3B).&quot; This figure only shows that wild-type Src is activated. Both mutants appear to show elevated activity without LPA and do not show convincing activation following LPA treatment (especially considering uneven Src expression in some samples). The figure legend does not state how many times this experiment was repeated and has no quantification data.</p><p>10. Figure 2E shows that spermidine does not activate wt Src contradicting their previous data. Samples without spermidine should be shown on the same blot to compare basal levels of activity. The activity measurements in Figure 2F should compare all samples to the activity of wtSrc without spermidine. This will allow authors to evaluate if mutants have higher residual activity. As mentioned above, mutation of these amino acids may affect the inhibitory binding of the SH3 domain and thus lead to increased basal activity of Src. Same problem with the data in Figure 2H. It shows that the mutants do not respond to spermidine, but it does not reveal if they already have higher activity without spermidine. The figure legend does not provide information about the error bars. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the mechanism of spermidine action is to prevent Src SH2 domain binding phospho-tyrosine. In this case, the luciferase sensor should show a higher signal with higher spermidine concentration regardless of Src activity.</p><p>11. Line 159. Authors stated that &quot;Results from immunoblot demonstrated that the co-precipitated IDO1 is tyrosine phosphorylated by Src and that the polyamine increases the phosphorylation (Figure 3A).&quot; The data does not show that Src phosphorylates IDO1. They only suggest that IDO1 phosphorylation increases when Src is co-expressed and activated. Furthermore, there is a band in the IP sample where IDO1 is expressed without Src. This is not explained by the authors. The figure legend says that &quot;IDO1/pTYR ratio is measured by densitometric quantification of the specific bands and is expressed relative to untreated cells.&quot; but no measurements are provided.</p><p>12.

As mentioned above, mutation of these amino acids may affect the inhibitory binding of the SH3 domain and thus lead to increased basal activity of Src. Same problem with the data in Figure 2H. It shows that the mutants do not respond to spermidine, but it does not reveal if they already have higher activity without spermidine. The figure legend does not provide information about the error bars. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the mechanism of spermidine action is to prevent Src SH2 domain binding phospho-tyrosine.

We used the NMR structure of the SH2 domain of Src kinase of Rous sarcoma virus (PDB ID: 2JYQ) because it shares a high sequence identity (97%) with the relative SH2 domains of human and murine Src tyrosine kinase. This is now explicitly stated in the Materials and methods section of the revised manuscript, also inserting the sequence of the viral isoform in the multiple alignment reported in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1. The very high sequence identity allows using the NMR structure of the viral isoform with very good approximation to infer about the electrostatic potential map of human/murine SH2 domain and to investigate the putative binding site of spermidine.</p><p>The advantage of using a single domain structure rather than the full-length structure of human Src (PDB# 1FMK) is to avoid the bias that a full-length structure of human Src kinase might bring into more time-consuming calculations due to considering multiple conformations between the regulatory and kinase domains of the enzyme. Indeed, diverse conformations of Src may differently affect the electrostatic potential of the SH2 domain as well as potentially mask a putative polyamine binding site for polyamine.</p><p>Although we agree with Reviewer’s comment that the human full-length Src may be instrumental to provide more insights into the mechanism of action of spermidine, this latter was not the aim of the present study. Indeed, using electrostatic potential mapping and docking calculations, the goal of the study was to generate a working hypothesis to locate a potential binding site of spermidine in the SH2 domain and next prove such hypothesis with mutagenesis experiments. Results of mutagenesis experiments are in agreement with the working hypothesis generated using the NMR structure of the viral SH2 domain, thereby supporting the validity of using such isoform as input structure for our calculations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Although the potentiating effect of spermidine on Src activity in SYF cells is relatively subtle, it is nonetheless likely to be physiologically relevant, as small degrees of positive allosteric modulation of the Src by spermidine is known to be relevant in conventional dendritic cells (Mondanelli ed al., Immunity, 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3c.

We thus tried to use higher concentrations of either ATP or peptide. The revised Figure 1F and Revised Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 now show the curve of peptide or ATP from 0 to 600 µM. Due to the limit of detection of the luminescent assay as well as to the saturating effect, we were not able to include any other concentrations higher than 600 µM. The results confirmed that in the presence of increasing concentrations of peptide (but not in the case of increasing concentrations of ATP), spermidine enhanced by almost 2-fold the maximum rate of Src kinase activity and the affinity for the substrate.

We got the importance of showing that spermidine increases the activity of the constitutively active Src. However, due to funding shortage and long time required for the reagent purchase and shipment, we were not able to perform the specific experiment with the recombinant viral Src protein as required by the Referee. We wish to sincerely apologize for that.</p><p>Nevertheless, we performed related experiments with SYF cells expressing the wild type Src or the mutated one at the tyrosine 529 into phenylalanine (Y529F of the murine sequence) that is constitutive active Src. By measuring the pSrc/Src ratio (revised Figure 1 —figure supplement 1) as well as the phosphorylation of IDO1 (revised Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) in cells treated with spermidine, we found that spermidine did not potentiate the activity of Src Y529F.</p><p>We thus concluded that, upon binding the allosteric site on the SH2 domain, spermidine makes Src to change its tridimensional structure. We speculated that spermidine promotes the conformational changes of the kinase and thus its activation. The results obtained with the SYF model highlight that spermidine per se cannot activate or stabilize the constitutive-active form of Src, i.e., that mutated in the residue Y529 at the C-terminus. Therefore, spermidine behaves as a pharmacologic allosteric modulator of Src, as it binds to a distinct site from the catalytic pocket and guides Src to assume the active conformation.</p><p>We understand the concern about the 2-fold increase in activity. We would like to stress that this result has been obtained by means of biochemical and fibroblast-based assays, because the aim of this paper was to show the spermidine mechanism of action with these two in vitro models. However, a 2-fold increment of Src activity is sufficient to phosphorylate IDO1 in dendritic cells and finally promote the immunoregulatory phenotype of such immune cells as demonstrated in Mondanelli et al. (Immunity, 2017) and in line with the concept of allosteric modulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

However, given the intrinsic difference between the cell-free (i.e., the biochemical assay with recombinant Src protein) and cell-based assay (i.e., that with SYF fibroblasts reconstituted with murine Src vector), the tested compound can exhibit distinct potency. Indeed, in a cell-based assay the molecule must penetrate through the cell membrane, distribute within the cell, find the target among the other proteins, and finally activate it. On the contrary, in a biochemical assay, the molecule is directly added to the reaction mixture containing only the purified target protein (besides other reagents in the optimal concentration to carry out the in vitro reaction). Thus, is not surprising that the EC50 of spermidine in the SYF cellbased assay is higher than that found in the biochemical assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

The experiments without ATP or peptide are negative controls of the biochemical assay. Our aim was to confirm the lack of intrinsic activity of the molecule spermidine against purified Src when neither the ATP nor the substrate are present, thus measuring the background signal – which is below 1000 rlu. On the contrary, the activity of Src in the samples with ATP and peptide is above 10000 rlu, which at least doubles in the presence of spermidine. In accordance with the Reviewer #1 request (please, see Reviewer #1, point 3), the statistical analysis of data in Figure 1D (now revised Figure 1E) has been now performed using the Student t-test, by comparing Spd/ATP/ peptide vs ATP/peptide samples.

Indeed, the DNA plasmid-based reporter is built by physically separated the N and C luciferase fragments introducing a phosphopeptide recognition domain (i.e., the SH2 sequence) and the Src peptide substrate. Upon cellular Src activation, the reporter peptide substrate becomes phosphorylated, interacts with SH2 of the reporter, thus creating a steric hindrance that prevents luciferase reconstitution and bioluminescence emission (please, refer to the schematic representation Figure 2G). Thus, in the presence of spermidine, the luciferase sensor shows a lower signal in cells co-expressing the wild-type Src and not the mutated forms of the kinase, suggesting that the polyamine activates only the cellular, wild-type Src by acting at the putative allosteric site.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

The measurement is reported under the specific IP bands and is expressed relative to untreated cells (fold change = 1). To be clearer, we modified the statement in the figure legend as follows: “The amount of IDO1 immunoprecipitated is measured by densitometric quantification of the specific bands in treated sample co-expressing IDO1 and Src and is expressed relative to untreated cells (fold change = 1)”, as the analysis refers to the amount of IDO1 precipitated with the a-pTyr antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Related: Figure 3, does spermidine promote IDO1 phosphorylation via constitutively active-Src in the SYF model?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. By immunoprecipitation with the a-pTyr antibody, we found that IDO1 is phosphorylated in SYF cells co-expressing IDO1 and the constitutively active-Src regardless of the stimulation with spermidine, as opposed to samples coexpressing IDO1 and wild type Src (please, refer to revised Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). This result suggests that spermidine can act as on/off switcher. Indeed, when the polyamine binds the site on the SH2 domain, which is distinct from the substrate pocket, it can make Src assume an active conformation, essentially turning it on. Conversely, constitutive active Src adopts already the open conformation, as the substitution of the tyrosine residue at position 529 of the murine sequence with the phenylalanine interferes with the autoregulatory clamp of the enzyme.

Is spermidine selective for the IDO1-Src complex? Is it possible additional Src substrates may also be candidates?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for highlighting this point. Among the predicted functional partners of murine Src (https://string-db.org/), we verified Stat3 as possible candidate. Results demonstrated that spermidine does not increase the interaction of Src with Stat3 in SYF cells, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Although we cannot exclude the effect on any other candidates, our analysis indicated that spermidine is selective for the IDO1-Src complex. These findings are in line with the notion that allosteric ligands can selectively affect only one biological process and have no effect on any other response via the pharmacologic target. These results have been included as “data not shown” in the main text (please see lines 189-191).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85872-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14a.

The alignment of murine Src, Yes and Fyn sequences highlights that only the glutamate residue at position 149 of murine Src is conserved across SH2 domains, while the glutamate residue at position 168 is replaced by the amino acid glycine, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>. Thus, although we cannot exclude that spermidine can bind the SH2 domain of related Src kinases, we might speculate that the lack of the negative charge at position 168 reduces the long-range electrostatic interactions hypothesized to be responsible for the molecular recognition of the ligand into the allosteric site. These findings were included in the main text as data not shown (please see lines 162-167).</p><p>By aligning murine Src with several SH2 domain proteins such as enzymes (Abl1, SHIP1), docking (Shc1) and adaptor (Grb2, SOCS1) proteins, we found that neither E149 nor E168 are conserved, in their place there are non-polar hydrophobic amino acids (e.g., alanine, glycine and proline) or those with polar uncharged side chains (e.g., glutamine). In light of these results, we may conclude that spermidine cannot broadly bind SH2-domain containing proteins, suggesting that the polyamine selectively interacts with Src kinase.

It would be more meaningful to include constitutively active-Src and kinase dead-Src in Figure 1A and Figure 1B.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point raised by the Reviewer. However, due to funding shortage and long time required for the reagent purchase and shipment, we were not able to perform the specific experiment with the recombinant proteins as required by the Referee (as parallel experiments for figure 1A). We wish to sincerely apologize for that.</p><p>Nevertheless, we performed related experiments with SYF cells expressing the wild type Src or the mutated one at the tyrosine 529 into phenylalanine (Y529F of the murine sequence) that is constitutively active Src. By measuring the pSrc/Src ratio (Figure 1 —figure supplement 1) as well as the phosphorylation of IDO1 (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1) in cells treated with spermidine, we found that spermidine did not potentiate the activity of Src Y529F.</p><p>We thus concluded that, upon binding the allosteric site on the SH2 domain, spermidine makes Src to change its tridimensional structure. We speculated that spermidine promotes the conformational changes of the kinase and thus its activation. The results obtained with the SYF model highlight that spermidine per se cannot activate or stabilize the constitutive-active form of Src, i.e., that mutated in the residue Y529 at the C-terminus. Therefore, spermidine behaves as a pharmacologic allosteric modulator of Src, as it binds to a distinct site from the catalytic pocket and guides Src to assume the active conformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure S3B, it seems in reconstituted SYF cells, E155A and E174A Src mutants are active in absence of LPA activation and do not significantly respond to LPA ( o vs other time points). A similar profile seems true even with spermidine stimulation of mutants (Figure 2E, F). Why are mutants more active in the LPA experiment (Figure S3B, 0 time points) but not in Figure 2E (-Spd)?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the bad quality of the Western blot experiment shown in Supplementary Figure S3. We have now repeated the experiment and the results are now shown in revised Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, alongside the densitometric analysis demonstrating that LPA activates Src in cells expressing the mutant forms of the kinase similarly to the wild-type protein (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2).</p><p>Moreover, as shown by the revised Figure 2 —figure supplement 2, the mutant forms of the kinase have a basal activity comparable to wild-type protein. The same results can be obtained by looking at the absolute values of luminescent reporter in untreated SYF-Src cells as well as those expressing Src E149A or Src E168A (please, see lines 149-153 of the main text). Specifically, luminescent signal in unstimulated SYF cells co-expressing the reporter and wild type Src is 617,7 ± 121 rlu vs 552,2 ± 68,9 rlu of E149A Src vs 501 ± 110 rlu of E168A Src – which are not statistically different (one-way ANOVA, followed by post-hoc Bonferroni test).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 3, does spermidine promote IDO1 phosphorylation via constitutively active-Src in the SYF model?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the Reviewer for this suggestion. By immunoprecipitation with the a-pTyr antibody, we found that IDO1 is phosphorylated in SYF cells co-expressing IDO1 and the constitutively active-Src regardless of the stimulation with spermidine, as opposed to samples coexpressing IDO1 and wild type Src (please, refer to revised Figure 3 —figure supplement 1). This result suggests that spermidine can act as on/off switcher. Indeed, when the polyamine binds the site on the SH2 domain, which is distinct from the substrate pocket, it can make Src assume an active conformation, essentially turning it on. Conversely, constitutive active Src adopts already the open conformation, as the substitution of the tyrosine residue at position 529 of the murine sequence with the phenylalanine interferes with the autoregulatory clamp of the enzyme. In that case, spermidine does not increase the Src activity – as also shown by the measurement of the pSrc/Src in SYF cells exposed to spermidine and expressing constitutively active Src (Revised Figure 1 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>That spermidine promotes IDO1 phosphorylation is interesting.
