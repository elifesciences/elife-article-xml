complexity of the brain is to measure the effects of spatially and temporally synchronized systematic perturbations. In humans, this can be non-invasively achieved by combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Spatiotemporally complex and long-lasting TMS-EEG evoked potential (TEP) waveforms are believed to result from recurrent, re-entrant activity that propagates broadly across multiple cortical and subcortical regions, dispersing from and later re-converging on, the primary stimulation site. However, if we loosely understand the TEP of a TMS-stimulated region as the impulse response function of a noisy underdamped harmonic oscillator, then multiple later activity components (waveform peaks) should be expected even for an isolated network node in the complete absence of recurrent inputs. Thus emerges a critically important question for basic and clinical research on human brain dynamics: what parts of the TEP are due to purely local dynamics, what parts are due to reverberant, re-entrant network activity, and how can we distinguish between the two? To disentangle this, we used source-localized TMS-EEG analyses and whole-brain connectome-based computational modelling. Results indicated that recurrent network feedback begins to drive TEP responses from 100 ms post-stimulation, with earlier TEP components being attributable to local reverberatory activity within the stimulated region. Subject-specific estimation of neurophysiological parameters additionally indicated an important role for inhibitory GABAergic neural populations in scaling cortical excitability levels, as reflected in TEP waveform characteristics. The novel discoveries and new software technologies introduced here should be of broad utility in basic and clinical neuroscience research.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcranial magnetic stimulation</kwd><kwd>electroencephalography</kwd><kwd>computational model</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>neural mass model</kwd><kwd>recurrence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Labatt Family Innovation Fund in Brain Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010523</institution-id><institution>Centre for Addiction and Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tri-Council (SSHRC-NSERC-CIHR) UK-Canada AI Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffiths</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole-brain computational modelling, incorporating novel ML-based parameter estimation techniques, reveals how transcranial magnetic stimulation-evoked brain responses are driven at earlier timepoints by local echoes of the external stimulus, and at later timepoints by large-scale network reverberation across the connectome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain is a complex, nonlinear, multiscale, and intricately interconnected physical system, whose laws of motion and principles of organization have proven challenging to understand with currently available measurement techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bullmore and Sporns, 2009</xref>). In such epistemic circumstances, the application of systematic perturbations, and measurement of their effects, is a central tool in the scientific armory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Deco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>). For human brains, the technological combination that best supports this non-invasive perturbation-based modus operandi is concurrent TMS and EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rogasch and Fitzgerald, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Siebner et al., 2022</xref>). TMS-EEG allows millisecond-level tracking of stimulation-evoked activity propagation throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Momi et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thut and Miniussi, 2009</xref>), originating from a target region that is perturbed by the secondary electrical currents of a focal (2–2.5 cm diameter), brief (1 ms), and powerful (1.5–2 T) magnetic field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hallett, 2007</xref>). Trial-averaged TMS-EEG response waveforms (known as TMS-evoked potentials or TEPs) have been used to elucidate basic neurophysiology in the areas of brain connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Momi et al., 2021c</xref>), axonal conduction delays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bortoletto et al., 2021</xref>), and neural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chung et al., 2017</xref>) and also as a clinical biomarker for several pathological conditions such as coma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rosanova et al., 2012</xref>), stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borich et al., 2016</xref>), depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Voineskos et al., 2021</xref>), obsessive-compulsive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 2022</xref>), and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cao et al., 2021</xref>). In addition to this wide variety of basic physiological and clinical applications, TEP measurements speak directly to a central theoretical question at the very heart of systems neuroscience: to what extent does stimulus-evoked neural activity propagate through the brain, via local and/or long-range projections, to affect activity in spatially distant brain regions? In the present paper, we are concerned with this question, and even more so with its equally interesting corollary: to what extent does stimulus-evoked activity propagate <italic>back</italic> from downstream areas to a primary stimulation site? This phenomenon of top-down or cyclic feedback within large-scale brain networks is known as <italic>re-entry</italic> or <italic>recurrence</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edelman and Gally, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lau and Bi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llinás et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the contribution of recurrent activity to TEPs, and stimulus-evoked activity in general, is critically important for proper interpretation of TMS-EEG experimental results and the design of clinical interventions. In the case of TMS, the direct physical and physiological effects at the primary stimulation site of an extracranially-applied magnetic perturbation are reasonably well-understood: secondary electrical currents initially depolarize the membranes of cells in the superficial neural tissue underneath the coil, causing action potentials and an associated local response in the stimulated brain region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pascual-Leone and Meador, 1998</xref>). Concurrently, this local electrical activation propagates (as some combination of soma-originating and prodromic axon-originating action potentials) along white matter pathways to reach distant cortical and subcortical sites, resulting in predominantly excitatory effects with magnitudes depending on the strength of the anatomical connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Momi et al., 2021b</xref>). The final EEG-measurable outcomes of this process appear as early (&lt;100 ms) and late (&gt;100 ms) responses at both the primary stimulation site and a broad set of interconnected brain regions, usually persisting for 300 ms, and showing reliable characteristic patterns but also high levels of inter-subject variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rocchi et al., 2018</xref>). A key challenge in interpreting these data is that it is impossible from the TMS-evoked EEG time series alone to disentangle whether TEP waveform components at the primary stimulation sites arise due to a ‘local echo’ - driven only by the recent history of that region, or to a ‘global echo’ - driven by the recurrent activity within the rest of network.</p><p>Here, we introduce a novel approach to addressing these questions around the physiological basis and spatiotemporal network dynamics of neural activity evoked by noninvasive brain stimulation, using a combination of empirical TMS-EEG data analyses and whole-brain, connectome-based neurophysiological modelling. An overview and conceptual framework are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The logic proceeds as follows: In the first step, we fit a connectome-based model to individual-subject TEP data, achieving accurate replication of the measured channel- and source-level TMS-EEG patterns. Then, we introduce to the model a series of spatially and temporally specific ‘virtual lesions’ by setting to zero the weights of all connections leaving from and returning to the primary stimulation site, at specific times. These virtual lesions isolate the TMS-stimulated region from the rest of the brain for delineated periods, and allow us to ask what its dynamics would look like with and without recurrent feedback from downstream brain areas. Activity patterns at the stimulated node that are unchanged by a given virtual lesion that suppresses recurrent inputs are thus independent of those inputs, and can be understood as a ‘local echo’ of the stimulation that persists in time for long periods (dozens to hundreds of milliseconds). This framing implies two contrasting potential scenarios for the change in TEP waveform components after introducing a lesion that suppresses recurrent feedback to the stimulation site:</p><list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p>TEP components are still observed and entirely or largely unchanged, or</p></list-item><list-item><p>TEP components are substantially reduced or disappear</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Studying the role of recurrent activity in stimulation-evoked neural responses with computational models.</title><p>Shown here is a schematic overview of the hypotheses, methodology, and general conceptual framework of the present work. (<bold>A</bold>) Single transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse (i - diagram, iv - real data) applied to a target region (in this case left M1) generates an early response (TMS-EEG evoked potential (TEP) waveform component) at electroencephalography (EEG) channels sensitive to that region and its immediate neighbors (ii). This also appears in more distal connected regions such as the frontal lobe (iii) after a short delay due to axonal conduction and polysynaptic transmission. Subsequently, second and sometimes third late TEP components are frequently observed at the target site (i, iv), but not in non-connected regions (v). Our central question is whether these late responses represent evoked oscillatory ‘echoes’ of the initial stimulation that are entirely locally driven and independent of the rest of the network, or whether they rather reflect a chain of recurrent activations dispersing from and then propagating back to the initial target site via the connectome. (<bold>B</bold>) In order to investigate this, precisely timed communication interruptions or ‘virtual lesions’ (vii) are introduced into an accurately fitting individual subject computational model of TMS-EEG stimulation responses (vi), and the resulting changes in the propagation pattern (vii) are evaluated. No change in the TEP component of interest (e.g. blue shaded area) would support the ‘local echo’ scenario (viii), whereas suppressed TEPs (e.g. blue shaded area) would support the ‘recurrent activation’ scenario (ix).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As noted, clear evidence of (a) would be consistent with these brain responses being simply a ‘local echo’ of the TMS perturbation, that activates only the stimulated area. In contrast, evidence of (b) would imply the local TEP response requires global network reverberation - recurrent activity propagating out from the stimulated region, via its distal interconnected notes, and back again to evoke or to amplify inflections at specific time points post-stimulation.</p><p>For modelling the empirical TMS-EEG TEP data following the investigative line described above, we use a newly-developed numerical simulation approach that draws on recent technical advances in the field of machine learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>). Our novel modelling methodology allows accurate and robust individual subject-level TEP waveform fitting, allowing us to present here the first ever subject-specific, cortex-wide, connectome-based neurophysiological model of TEP generation. As we show, this allows us to pose and answer questions around both the shared structure and the well-known inter-subject variability of TMS-EEG responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozdemir et al., 2020</xref>). We examine the general question of recurrent activity in relation to feedforward and feedback connections to primary stimulation targets, as well as to the broader graph topological structure of the anatomical connectome. Inter-subject variation in estimated physiological parameters offers candidate explanations for TEP phenomena in terms of excitatory/inhibitory population parameters that are consistent with known pharmaco-physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Premoli et al., 2014</xref>). We argue that this physiologically-based mathematical parameterization of brain stimulation responses offers an important new framework for understanding (and minimizing) inter-subject variability in TMS-EEG recordings for basic scientific and clinical applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Connectome-based neurophysiological models accurately reproduce subject-specific TEP patterns</title><p>As an important preliminary to our primary research question, extensive testing confirmed that our new connectome-based neurophysiological model of TMS-EEG responses achieves robust and accurate recovery of TEP waveforms at both the group average and individual levels. This is demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> for both the EEG channel level and cortical surface source level, respectively. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows empirical and fitted (i.e. simulated, with optimized physiological parameters) TEP waveforms and selected topography maps for three example subjects (for the entire group, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>). It is visually evident in these figures that the model accurately captures several individually-varying features of these time series, such as the timing of the 50 ms and 100–120 ms TEP components, and the extent to which they are dominated by left/right and temporal/parietal/frontal channels. (For the latter, this can be seen by comparing the line colors in the upper and lower rows of corresponding columns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, and using the channel location references given by the channel color map on the top left of each TEP plot). Pearson correlations between empirical and simulated TMS-EEG time series confirmed that an excellent goodness-of-fit was observed at the whole-head level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and individual channel level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with time-wise permutation tests revealing a significant Pearson correlation coefficient for every electrode. As well as the millisecond-by-millisecond TEP comparisons and the timing of key waveform components, we also assessed the accuracy of the model in capturing holistic time series properties.

These grand mean channel-level waveforms were further used to assess model fit in brain source space. As can be seen in the topoplots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the same spatiotemporal activation pattern is observed both for empirical (top row) and model-generated (bottom row) time series. M1 stimulation begins with activation in left motor area at ~20–30 ms, then propagates to temporal, frontal, and homologous contralateral brain regions, resulting in a waveform peak at ~100–120 ms. Time-wise permutation tests on these data revealed a significant Pearson correlation coefficient in 75.63% of all vertices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Finally, significant positive correlations were found between the dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM) values extracted from the seven canonical Yeo Networks, with stronger correspondences for the primary stimulation target (Somatomotor [SMN], R<sup>2</sup>=46%, p=0.008) compared to the non-stimulated Networks (Visual [VISN]: R<sup>2</sup>=38%, p=0.01; Dorsal Attention [DAN]: R<sup>2</sup>=38%, p=0.004; Anterior Salience [ASN]: R<sup>2</sup>=38%,p=0.003; Limbic [LIMN]: R<sup>2</sup>=40%, p=0.01; Fronto-parietal [FPN]: R<sup>2</sup>=41%, p=0.006; Default Mode [DMN]: R<sup>2</sup>=43%, p=0.009). This correspondence between empirical and simulated TEP data is clearly visible in the bar charts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D, E, F and G</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Later TEP responses are driven by recurrent large-scale network dynamics</title><p>Having established the accuracy of our model at replicating TEP waveforms across a wide range of subject-specific shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app2fig1">Appendix 2—figure 1</xref>), we now turn to the central question of the present study, as laid out in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are effects on the simulated TEP of virtual lesions to recurrent incoming connections of the main activated regions at 20 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms after single-pulse TMS stimulation of left M1. The leftmost column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which shows the simulated data grand average with no virtual lesion (re-plotting the data from the second row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), serves as a reference point for the other three columns. A key result here is that there is a reduction of source activation at the 50–100 ms time window in the central two panels (lesions at 20 ms and 50 ms, respectively), as compared to the rightmost (lesion at 100 ms) and leftmost (no lesion) panels. This reduction demonstrates the critical importance of network recurrence in generating later TEP components. These effects were evaluated statistically by extracting dSPM loadings from the source activity maps for each of the 7 canonical Yeo networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas Yeo et al., 2011</xref>) and entering them into an ANOVA with factors of NETWORK and TIME OF DAMAGE. Significant main effects were found for both NETWORK (F<sub>(6,114)</sub> = 114.73, p&lt;0.0001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.85) and TIME OF DAMAGE (F<sub>(3,57)</sub> = 254.05, p&lt;0.0001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.93) - indicating that the effects of virtual lesions vary depending on both the time administered and the site administered to, as well as the combination of these factors (significant interaction NETWORK*TIME OF DAMAGE (F<sub>(18,342)</sub> = 23.79, p&lt;0.0001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.55)). The specific results described above, with significant TEP suppression at the stimulation site occurring in the early and late TEP components for specific time windows, were verified through extensive post-hoc <italic>t</italic>-tests (see Appendix 2).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Removing recurrent connections from stimulated target nodes suppresses their late TMS-EEG evoked potential (TEP) activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We found that TMS-evoked propagation dynamics in the model change significantly depending on the specific time that a virtual lesion is applied (highlighted orange circle). Specifically, early significant reductions in the TMS-evoked activity (50 ms-100 ms time window) were found when important connections were removed at 20 ms (blue) and 50 ms (orange) after the transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse, as compared to both a later virtual lesion (100 ms green) and no damage (red) conditions. These results are demonstrated also for network-based dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping (dSPM) values (bottom row) extracted for all four conditions.

We explored this by examining the relationship between TEP waveform components and the physiological parameters of the Jansen-Rit model. To do this, singular value decompositions (SVDs) were performed on the channel x time TEP waveform matrices for both empirical and simulated data. The left and right singular vectors from this decomposition, respectively define the temporal and spatial expression of the channel-level TEP eigenmodes. The spatial part of each eigenmode takes the form of a loading pattern over channels that can be represented as a topoplot. As with the TEP waveform and PCI comparisons, this procedure also yielded high spatial similarity between empirical and simulated grand average data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), as well as similar levels of variance explained (74.14 and 66.96% cumulatively by the first two right SVD eigenvectors in simulated and empirical data, respectively). Inspecting the temporal peaks in the left singular vectors for the first two eigenmodes revealed that the first was maximally expressed in empirical[/simulated] data at 72 ms[/70 ms], and the second at 115 ms [/117 ms] post-stimulus. Thus the first two eigenvectors of the TEP waveform correspond quite closely to the canonical ~50 ms and ~100 ms TEP waveform components. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, a significant negative correlation was found between the synaptic time constant of the Jansen-Rit inhibitory population and the amplitude of the first eigenmode at its peak (R<sup>2</sup>=27%, p=0.02). Interestingly, we also observed a significant positive correlation between this parameter and the second eigenmode at its peak (R<sup>2</sup>=28%, p=0.02). Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the topoplots for 2 representative subjects with high (top) and low (bottom) estimated values for the synaptic time constant of the inhibitory population show that the magnitude of the synaptic time constant is closely coupled to the amplitude of the individual first and second SVD modes. Interestingly, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, by varying the optimal value of the inhibitory synaptic time constant, an increase in the amplitude of the first, early, and local TEP components; and a decrease of the second, late, and global TEP components was found. However, these significant results were not corrected for the Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.007. For this reason, the reader should critically interpret such results.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Synaptic time constants of inhibitory neural populations affect early and late TMS-EEG evoked potential (TEP) amplitudes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Grand mean Singular value decomposition (SVD) topoplots for simulated (top) and empirical (bottom) TMS-EEG data.

Characterizing these phenomena at a mechanistic level is important not only as a basic question in systems and cognitive neuroscience, but also as a foundation for clinical applications concerned with changes in excitability and connectivity due to neuropathologies or interventions.</p><p>We employed a `virtual dissection' approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aerts et al., 2016</xref>) to study the extent to which model-generated TMS-evoked stimulation patterns at the primary stimulation site relied on recurrent incoming connections from the rest of the brain, and at what times. These in-silico interventions resulted in substantial reductions in TMS-evoked activity when pivotal connections were inactivated. Specifically, compared to late (100 ms after the TMS pulse) virtual lesions, and compared to the control condition where no damage was applied, early (20 ms, 50 ms) damage of essential nodes' afferent and efferent pathways significantly reduced the amplitude of the 100 ms TEP component at the stimulation site (left M1) and its neighboring regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In these early lesion conditions, some residual activity in the left M1 area was still observed at around 100 ms, indicating that a local echo of the TMS stimulus does indeed persist for tens to hundreds of milliseconds after stimulation. However, this purely locally-driven activity was low in amplitude, and does not appear to be the principal source of the commonly studied 100 ms TEP components in TMS-EEG recordings. In addition to recurrence at the stimulation site, we can also see that amplification of the TMS-evoked stimulation response occurs via network spreading and recruitment. Early lesions also compromised the propagation of the TMS-evoked activity to the contralateral homolog of the stimulated region (i.e. right M1), as well as bilateral frontal and parietal regions. This result clarifies not only <italic>that</italic> TMS-evoked activity in those regions depends on the presence of those specific cross-hemispheric and parieto-frontal pathways in the network, but also <italic>when</italic> propagation along them is critical for the subsequent response. Finally, in contrast to the 100 ms TEP component, the 50 ms TEP component at the target site was largely unaffected by lesions to recurrent connections at 20 ms and 50 ms, indicating that this earlier part of the canonical TMS-EEG response can be attributed solely to the local impulse-response characteristics of a patch of cortical tissue.</p><p>Our results, and the framework for investigating such questions that we are introducing here, have clear and practical relevance to basic and clinical TMS-EEG research, but also have broader implications for the scientific understanding of functional brain organization. Variations on the concept of recurrence in systems neuroscience go back many decades, and have been developed in a wide number of areas and with a wide number of labels, including ‘re-entry,’ ‘reverberation,’ ‘feedback,’ ‘top-down control,’ ‘predictive coding,’ ‘functional/effective connectivity,’ etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Edelman and Gally, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Llinás et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiegler et al., 2016</xref>). These framings vary a great deal on dimensions such as the spatial/temporal scale, role of corticothalamic interactions, association with cognitive functions, association with global brain state, level of physiological detail/abstraction, etc. In all these cases however the central shared intuition is that information or activity flows between network elements in the brain are bidirectional, but that the primary direction of travel may fluctuate dynamically over time. For example, the response of the visual system to images - a sensory stimulation-evoked response that is similar in many ways to electromagnetic stimulation-evoked responses - is widely understood to involve a period of feedforward activity propagation hierarchically up the ventral visual stream, followed rapidly by recurrent top-down feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahlfors et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clarke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000</xref>). Moreover, in vitro recordings have shown how a magnetic pulse delivered to a single ganglion cell generates a local early response that terminates after a few ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonmassar et al., 2012</xref>) depicting a scenario similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>. The connectome-based neurophysiological modelling approach presented here could easily be deployed to investigate similar questions in these and other areas such as visual cognitive neuroscience or consciousness research, where feedback and recurrence play a central explanatory role in current theories.</p><p>The mathematical and theoretical neuroscientific context that has particularly informed the present study owes much to the ideas of Walter Freeman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>) and of Andreas Spiegler and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiegler et al., 2016</xref>). Freeman’s hierarchical `K Set' framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>) offers a rigorous technical and qualitative analysis of neuronal dynamics in systems progressing in complexity from a single excitatory neural population (K0e set), to ones with self-, uni-directional, and bi-directional excitation and inhibition (KI sets), and eventually adding network-level interactions and feedback (KII and KIII sets). Notably, Freeman’s analysis provides both physiological and mathematical motivation for the central premise of our argument - that a local patch of cortical neural tissue can generate TEP-like damped oscillatory responses to a brief stimulation, without the need for feedback from other brain regions (this is also an implicit premise in all studies using second-order differential equations to model sensory-evoked potentials, such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen and Rit, 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">David et al., 2005</xref>, and ourselves here). In these terms then, the questions we have posed and addressed are whether the 50 ms and 100 ms TEP components at the stimulation site represent KI set or KII set ensemble behavior. Complementing this, the nature of recurrent activity at the level of whole-brain connectome networks in particular is expressed more sharply in the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiegler et al., 2016</xref>, who emphasizes how feedback loops within the connectome can lead to re-entrant activity, the result of which is to produce longer-lasting and temporally more complex evoked responses - consistent with our findings here. These authors also discovered from an exhaustive investigation comprising 37,000 simulation runs over 190 different stimulation targets that persistent, long-lasting activations tend to propagate within canonical resting-state networks. Interestingly, this prediction was later confirmed in our own experimental TMS-EEG work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Eldaief et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ozdemir et al., 2020</xref>), which demonstrated that the TEPs mainly propagate within distal cortical regions belonging to the same network. For example, stimulation of parietal default-mode network (DMN) nodes resulted in widespread sustained activity across the parietal, temporal, and frontal lobes - but this activity was primarily to be found within other DMN regions. The same result was also observed for nearby stimulation of dorsal attention network (DAN) nodes. More recently we obtained a similar result with anatomical connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Momi et al., 2021c</xref>), namely that network-level anatomical connectivity is more relevant than local and global brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation after the stimulation of two resting-state networks (again DMN and DAN). Whilst we did not study DMN or DAN stimulation in the present study, it can be seen from the Yeo network loadings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> that our results are also consistent with these experimental observations, with the somatomotor network dominating for all our simulated M1 stimulations. Extending the present results to TEP measurements from additional target sites both anterior and posterior to the M1 target studied here is an important priority for future work with this model.</p><p>In addition to our scientific conclusions on the nature of recurrent activity in stimulation-evoked brain dynamics, the present work offers several technical advances over previous contributions in a number of areas. Our model is to our knowledge the first connectome-based neurophysiological model for TMS-EEG that demonstrates accurate single-subject reconstruction of TEP waveforms at the sensor and source level. Related work has focused on stimulation-evoked functional connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spiegler et al., 2016</xref>) and stimulation-evoked time-frequency responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cona et al., 2011</xref>) within either large or small-scale networks. Most notably and recently, Bensaid and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bensaid et al., 2019</xref>) proposed a whole-brain model of TMS-EEG TEP waveforms, with a focus on the sleep/wake differences in TMS-EEG responses studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casali et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Massimini et al., 2005</xref>, and others. Bensaid et al’s., model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bensaid et al., 2019</xref>) includes extensive ‘horizontal’ corticothalamic connectivity, which we elected not to replicate in the present model for reasons of tractability, but may add in future iterations. None of the above studies, or indeed any published work to date to our knowledge, achieve the level of accuracy for single-subject TEP waveform fits that we show here. Our model’s success on this front is owed in large part to our decision to formulate and implement the Jansen-Rit connectome network differential equations in the widely-used machine learning library PyTorch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paszke et al., 2019</xref>). We have recently discussed and demonstrated the advantages of deep learning-based computational architectures for neurophysiological model simulation and parameter estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>). In the present study this precision was critical for addressing our research questions, which centred on the timing and amplitudes of well-defined TEP waveform components. These components can be found in most or all subjects, but vary considerably in their shapes and exact timings.</p><p>One example of the utility of this new model-fitting framework can be seen in our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, where we identified trends over subjects in the relationship of estimated model parameters to individual variation in TEP waveform features. Through these analyses we found, in an entirely data-driven fashion, that the synaptic time constant of the inhibitory Jansen-Rit population is a strong predictor of the amplitude of early (P60) and late (N100) TEP components. This is consistent with the finding of increased TEP amplitudes following the application of paired-pulse TMS protocols known to affect inhibition (or reduced excitability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rogasch et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, pharmacological intervention studies have shown that GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists (benzodiazepine) decrease N100 component amplitude, suggesting that this component is driven by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated inhibition. Whilst further research will be needed to explore and verify this hypothesis, its generation via the combination of data-driven model fitting and theoretically-informed brain network simulations offers a promising new approach for the interpretation of TMS-EEG experiments, and neurophysiological research more broadly.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Overview of approach</title><p>The analyses conducted in the present study consist of four main components: (i) TMS-EEG evoked response source reconstructions, (ii) construction of anatomical connectivity priors for our computational model using diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) tractography, (iii) simulation of whole-brain dynamics and stimulation-evoked responses with a connectome-based neural mass model, and (iv) fitting of the model to individual-subject TMS-EEG data.

Anatomically constrained tractography was employed to generate the initial tractogram with 10 million streamlines using second-order integration over fiber orientation distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tournier et al., 2010</xref>). Then, the spherical-deconvolution informed filtering of tractograms (SIFT2) methodology was applied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), in order to provide more biologically accurate measures of fiber connectivity. Brain regions or network nodes were defined using the 200-region atlas of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>, which was mapped to each individual’s FreeSurfer surfaces using spherical registration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fischl et al., 1999</xref>).

Using this atlas in combination with the filtered streamlines, 200 × 200 two anatomical connectivity matrices were extracted, with matrix elements representing the number of streamlines and the fiber length connecting each pair of regions, respectively. These connectomes for the 400 HCP subjects were then averaged, yielding a healthy subject population-representative connectome matrix. Finally, this matrix was prepared numerically for physiological network modelling by rescaling values by first taking the matrix Laplacian, and second by scalar division of all entries by the matrix norm, which ensures that the matrix is linearly stable (i.e. all eigenvalues have negative real part except one eigenvalue which was zero). The Laplacian sets each row sum (i.e. each node’s weighted in-degree) to zero by subtracting row sums from diagonal, and has been used often in previous whole-brain modelling research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelnour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Atasoy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raj et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Large-scale connectome-based neurophysiological brain network model</title><p>As previously described, a brain network model comprising 200 cortical areas was used to model TMS-evoked activity patterns, where each network node represents the population-averaged activity of a single brain region according to the rationale of mean-field theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Deco et al., 2008</xref>). We used the Jansen-Rit (JR) equations to describe activity at each node, which is one of the most widely used neurophysiological models for both stimulus-evoked and resting-state EEG activity measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">David et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jansen and Rit, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Spiegler et al., 2010</xref>). JR is a relatively coarse-grained neural mass model of the cortical microcircuit, composed of three interconnected neural populations: pyramidal projection neurons, excitatory interneurons, and inhibitory interneurons. The excitatory and the inhibitory populations both receive input from and feedback to the pyramidal population but not to each other, and so the overall circuit motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) contains one positive and one negative feedback loop. For each of the three neural populations, the post-synaptic somatic and dendritic membrane response to an incoming pulse of action potentials is described by the second-order differential equation<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>¨</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo>˙</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msubsup></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>v</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>which is equivalent to a convolution of incoming activity with a synaptic impulse response function<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mo>∫</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∞</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>whose kernel <italic>h<sub>e,i</sub>(t</italic>) is given by<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>m(t</italic>) is the (population-average) presynaptic input, <italic>v(t</italic>) is the postsynaptic membrane potential, <italic>H<sub>e,i</sub></italic> is the maximum postsynaptic potential, and τ<italic><sub>e,i</sub></italic> a lumped representation of delays occurring during the synaptic transmission.</p><p>This synaptic response function, also known as a pulse-to-wave operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Freeman, 1975</xref>) determines the excitability of the population, as parameterized by the time constants τ<sub>e</sub> and τ<sub>i</sub>, which are of particular interest in the present study.

This thresholded E-field map was then used to inject a weighted stimulus into the target regions in the model. Finally, channel-level EEG signals were computed in the model by first taking the difference r(<italic>t)=v1(t) − v2(t</italic>) between the excitatory and inhibitory interneuron activity at each cortical parcel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schaefer et al., 2018</xref>), and projected to the EEG channels space using a lead field matrix Y=G * X + ϵ. We based this decision on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">David et al., 2006</xref>) which consider that the post-synaptic potential in the Jansen-Rit model is defined by the inputs to that population, namely the excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations, which are differenced due to their opposite polarities.

Notably, the model is implemented in PyTorch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Paszke et al., 2019</xref>), a software library that has in recent years been widely adopted by the machine learning community in both academic and commercial sectors. Moving to this framework from more conventional numerical simulation libraries involves some minor modifications to accommodate tensor data structures, but brings the substantial advantage of naturally accommodating gradient-based parameter optimization via automatic differentiation-based algorithms, for relatively complex sets of equations that do not admit tractably computable Jacobians. This is one of a growing number of cases (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Richards et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suárez et al., 2020</xref>) where the natural parallel between our physiologically-based large-scale brain network models and deep recurrent neural networks used in machine learning is proving technically and conceptually fruitful.</p><p>The general mathematical framework for this approach has been described by us in a recent technical paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Griffiths et al., 2022</xref>), where it was applied in the context of connectome-based neurophysiological modelling of resting-state fMRI data. In the present work we are extending this technique’s domain of application to fast-timescale evoked responses, but the overall approach in the two cases is the same with minor modifications. The algorithm proceeds by dividing a subject’s multi (in this case 64) -channel, 400 ms long (–100 ms to +300 ms post-stimulus), trial-averaged TMS-EEG TEP waveform into short (20 ms) non-overlapping windows, termed batches. The total length of the simulation was 400 ms which included –100 ms of baseline (pre-TMS) and +300 ms after stimulation injection. Prior to the start of the 100 ms baseline, a 20 ms burn-in was included, which allowed for the system to settle after the usual transient due to randomly selected initial conditions for the state variables.</p><p>Rolling through each batch in the time series sequentially, the JR model-simulated TEP ŷ was generated with the current set of parameter values, and its match to the empirical TEP y was calculated with the following mean-squared error (MSE) loss function<disp-formula id="equ12"><label>(12)</label><mml:math id="m12"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi mathvariant="bold-italic">y</mml:mi><mml:mo mathvariant="bold" stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <italic>N<sub>t</sub></italic> is the number of the time points and <italic>N<sub>ch</sub></italic> is the number of EEG channels.

At the channel level, Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between empirical and model-generated TEP waveforms were computed for each subject. In order to control for type I error, this result was compared with a null distribution constructed from 1000 time-wise random permutations, with a significance threshold set at p&lt;0.05. As a complement to these TEP comparisons that emphasize matching of waveform shape and component timing, we also examined more holistic time series variability characteristics using the PCI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Casali et al., 2013</xref>), which was extracted from the simulated and the empirical TMS-EEG data, and Pearson correlations between the two computed. PCI gauges the amount of information contained in the integrated response to a direct perturbation which uses the Lempel-Ziv measure of algorithmic complexity to approximate the amount of non-redundant information contained in a binary sequence by estimating the minimal number of different patterns necessary to describe the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lempel and Ziv, 1976</xref>).

Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values, indicating empirical-simulated data similarities, were computed. Again, in order to control for type I error, time-wise permutation testing was done by comparison against 1000 surrogate, shuffled TEP differences, with a significance threshold set at p&lt;0.05. Finally, and unlike the channel-level data, network-level comparisons of simulated vs. empirical activity patterns were made by averaging current densities over surface vertices at each point in time within each of the seven Freesurfer surface-projected canonical Yeo network maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomas Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), and Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values between empirical and simulated network-level time series were again computed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Dissecting the propagation dynamics of TMS-evoked responses</title><p>A key aim of the present study is to ascertain whether the TMS-evoked activity in a certain region at a certain time point is primarily attributable to a localized response to TMS at the primary stimulation site, or to re-entrant activity feeding back from other nodes in the connectome network. In order to explore this, activity of each network node at a given time point was extracted as the sum of the absolute value of the simulated pyramidal cell population activity within a narrow temporal window (0–300 ms). Maximally activated nodes were defined as the top 1% of nodes exceeding two standard deviations above the mean over regions. This approach was used to identify, for each subject individually, the most important nodes at three key time points: 20 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms after the TMS pulse, where we wanted to identify the contribution of re-entrant activity. With these key brain regions identified for each time window of interest, simulations were re-run for each subject using their optimal parameters estimated from the original TEP fitting step - but this time with the selected nodes’ incoming and the outgoing connection weights set to zero for the duration of the window. These new ‘virtually lesioned’ TEP time series was again projected to the EEG channel space and back to the source level, where they were compared against the original model-generated TEP time series. Finally, as above, the model-generated dSPM values were extracted from the seven canonical network surface maps for each individual and for each condition, and analyzed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25 (IBM Corp). A 4x7 repeated measures ANOVA with within-subjects factors ‘TIME OF DAMAGE” (four levels: 20 ms; 50 ms; 100 ms; no damage) and ‘NETWORK’ (seven levels: VISN; SMN; DAN; ASN; LIMN; FPN; DMN) was run. Post-hoc paired t-tests were used to detect dSPM value changes for different networks and lesion times, testing on a per-network basis whether and at what times the virtual lesions impacted on network-level activations.</p><p>In order to control for possible confounding factors such as the residual sensory artifacts (auditory or somatosensory) that can completely bias the interpretation of the re-entrant activity, we have run the same analysis in another independent open dataset (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1">https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fecchio et al., 2017</xref>).

First, SVDs were run on the grand mean of both the empirical and the model-generated TMS-EEG data, in order to identify prototypical TMS-evoked responses. Following this, the group-level SVD spatial eigenmodes were identified within each subject’s time series corresponding to the time point with the highest cosine similarity between the individual’s TEP and the prototypical response. Latencies and amplitudes of the SVD left singular vector time series peaks were extracted for every subject and related to the individuals’ JR model parameters, with Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values computed accordingly. The critical p-value was then adjusted using Bonferroni correction to account for multiple comparisons (corrected p-value = 0.007).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The computational modelling work undertaken in this study made use of the publicly available TMS-EEG datasets of Rogasch group (figshare.com/articles/dataset/TEPs-_SEPs/7440713; Biabani et al., 2019) and Massimini &amp; Rosanova group (https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1; Fecchio et al. 2017), links to which are provided above.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jil Meier (Reviewer #1); Andrea Pigorini (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors state: &quot;Our central question is whether these late responses represent evoked oscillatory 'echoes' of the initial stimulation that are entirely locally-driven and independent of the rest of the network, or whether they rather reflect a chain of recurrent activations dispersing from and then propagating back to the initial target site via the connectome.&quot; Since the network is connected, it seems unlikely that any effect can be &quot;independent of the rest of the network&quot;, in which case Figure 4B would have been sufficient to show that the later responses to TMS are due to recurrent network dynamics. The authors should provide stronger motivation for their temporal virtual lesion analysis.</p><p>2. Regarding structural connectivity: &quot;We set strong priors on the connection weights, such that individual fits allow for a small adjustment of these values.&quot; How much variance did you allow? How did the structural matrices look afterwards? There is one example of one subject in Figure S4 but could you also please quantify the differences between the original and the individually fitted structural matrices?</p><p>3. &quot;This matrix was prepared numerically for physiological network modelling by rescaling values by first taking the matrix Laplacian, and second by scalar division of all entries by the matrix norm.&quot; Which matrix norm is referred to here? Please clarify why the Laplacian was taken as input as this seems like an unconventional normalization.</p><p>4. &quot;This thresholded E-field map was then used to inject a weighted stimulus into the target regions in the model.&quot; How was this weighting calculated? How were the SimNIBS results transferred into the parcellation?</p><p>5. &quot;JR model-simulated TEP ŷ was generated&quot; To which state variable of the model does ŷ refer?</p><p>6. How were the Gaussian prior distributions chosen for each of the JR model parameters?</p><p>7. Why were the source-space waveforms not assessed on an individual subject level? It seems like the waveforms and Figure 4 should be validated on an individual basis.</p><p>8. At what time was the stimulus onset? Was this onset time varied and tested for different correlation outcomes with the empirical time series? It seems that the responses are slightly shifted between empirical and simulated waveforms. Related to this, what was the transient time of the simulation, and was this cut-off? What was the total length of the simulation?</p><p>9. Can the authors please comment on the differences in the y-axis ranges between simulated and empirical responses? Can these not also be optimized?</p><p>10. It could be quite interesting to also compare the TEPs with a resting-state simulation using the same optimized parameters. This could provide a useful benchmark to compare the stimulus ON periods with stimulus OFF periods and distinguish the stimulus propagation from normal activity spreading in the individual brain networks. If the authors compare their model outcomes also with other whole-brain dynamics benchmarks, e.g. resting-state networks or markers of healthy EEG activity, then this could give increased credibility to the model. Since the authors make claims about whole-brain dynamics, it would be important to validate their model beyond the TEP signature.</p><p>11. How much does the result of the optimization algorithm depend on the window length? In my opinion, a 40 ms window seems quite long. Could the authors also test shorter time windows?</p><p>12. One of the Reviewers reran the code which is provided by the authors (compliments for sharing!) and noticed that the optimization algorithm has quite varying results, e.g. the first run returned an optimal value of 98.53 and the second one an optimal value for the same parameter of 100.34. Thus, did the authors run the newly developed algorithm multiple times and checked the robustness of the fitting results?</p><p>13. The HCP data also offers good quality to extract subcortical regions and their connectivity. These regions could play a major role in TEP stimulus propagation. Why did the authors choose to leave out subcortical regions?</p><p>14. The main results hinge on the idea of performing virtual lesions at different times and comparing the activity against the no-lesion case, to see whether activity continues in the absence of recurrent feedback from distant regions. This is an elegant and logical approach. But the implementation requires clarification. From the stated premise and the schematics in Figures 1B and 4A, it seems that the lesions are to isolate a stimulated node. But Figures 4B and 4C appear to use a fully-disconnected network, and the Methods text refers to disconnecting the connections of &quot;maximally activated nodes&quot; at different time points. It is thus difficult to understand what type of lesion was used for what analysis. Please clarify.</p><p>15. For the central question of teasing apart recurrent vs local activity, the activation map results in Figure 4A appear to focus on spatial spread rather than the precise question of how much activity at the stimulation site is local vs recurrent. It seems potentially trivial that if you lesion around the stimulation site at 20 ms or 50 ms you don't see spread beyond that site, whereas for a later lesion the delayed stimulus-evoked activity has already reached the other areas (i.e., closing the door after the horse has bolted). Please provide a quantitative calculation of the relative contributions of recurrent vs local activity at the stimulation site. Figures 4B and C may speak to this but the text does not address these.</p><p>16. Relatedly, it is unclear how the lesions interact with the propagation delays between regions, which could be important for interpreting the post-lesion activity. In particular, if a signal is &quot;in transit&quot; at the time of lesioning, does that delayed activity still make it to the destination? This likely depends on whether the lesions are modelled as being physically close to the sender or close to the receiver (or both). In any case, one would expect that the delays between regions would determine whether the initial pulse is able to drive activity there before the lesion cuts them off.</p><p>17. The fitting seems to do impressively well overall, but not so well at the start (within the first ~50 ms post-stimulus). This is interesting because one might think that the earliest part of the pulse is &quot;simpler&quot; than the more complex patterns possible after receiving multiple variously-delayed feedbacks from the rest of the network (this is of course central to the paper's main topic). Do the authors have insight into why the initial pulse is apparently more difficult to fit?</p><p>18. Regarding the role of inhibitory time constants, it is stated that this result is &quot;entirely data-driven&quot; but it is not clear whether relationships were sought with the various other model parameters too. Some correlations are given (Figure 5B) and some additional modelling is used to verify this (Figures 5C and D), but those panels are not addressed in the text so it's difficult to know what to take from these results. The authors give some justification along the lines that TMS protocols have inhibitory effects, but it's not clear why this should be specifically the time constant vs a synaptic strength or some other property of the inhibitory population.</p><p>19. As is evident from most of the figures and as mentioned by the authors of the database (see below), the data contains residual sensory artefacts (auditory or somatosensory) that can bias the authors' interpretation of the re-entrant activity. One key limitation is due to the stimulation target. Only the primary motor cortex (M1) is considered here. TMS of M1 – especially at Resting Motor Threshold, as in Biabani et al. – leads to peculiar features in the time and frequency domain of the EEG response, possibly due to feedback from the periphery following target muscle activation – see for example Fecchio, Pigorini et al., Plos One 2017. Are the authors able to address this potential contamination of the signal?</p><p>20. On a related note, the data used here are collected by delivering white noise to cover TMS-click instead of a customized one (see Russo et al. JNeurosMethods, 2022). This could introduce the residual auditory activity in the EEG response to TMS that might substantially bias the results and their interpretation in terms of network long-range interactions. For example, residual auditory effects (i.e. n100-p200 component) seem to be present in most of the figures. Can the authors rule out a major contribution of such effects to their findings?</p><p>21. Besides the influence of late sensory components, in the same subjects the initial response of the real data seems to be of rather low amplitude and not lateralized, suggestive of a non-effective TMS delivery (see Belardinelli et al., Brain Stim, 2019, for the relevance of this topic). Importantly, in the related simulated data it seems that the initial response is instead present and much higher and lateralized with respect to the real data, possibly reflective of a capacity of the model to replicate the typical TEPs obtained by &quot;effective&quot; TMS. The authors should comment on this potential limitation.</p><p>22. The work by Biabani et al. reports that &quot;TEPs elicited by motor cortex TMS reflect a combination of transcranially and peripherally evoked brain responses despite adopting sensory attenuation methods during experiments&quot;. This spurious effect is particularly relevant after 60 ms following TMS, and thus the present findings, as well as their interpretation, could be in principle biased by somatosensory re-entrant activity. As such, for the purpose of the present manuscript – i.e. evaluating the late effect of TMS, a dataset in which the residual sensory activity is maximally reduced during data collection is recommended (see Casarotto et al., JNeurosc Methods, 2022 for a full discussion on this topic).</p><p>23. The Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI, Casali et al., Science Tr Med, 2013) should be used to evaluate changes in complexity induced by cortical lesions (as in Rosanova, Fecchio, Nat comms 2018 or in Sarasso, Brain, 2020) and not for evaluating the similarity between real and simulated data. Indeed, two completely different wave shapes could in principle have exactly the same PCI value. Instead, for evaluating the quality of the simulated signal (i.e. its similarity with real data), the &quot;natural frequency&quot; may be preferable (Rosanova et al. 2009, JNeurosc).</p><p>24. Please clarify the rationale for performing virtual lesions only at 20, 60, and 100 ms. A time-resolved analysis would be preferable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key points:</p><p>(i) The authors themselves state that structural connectivity plays an important role in the waveform shapes: &quot;More recently we obtained a similar result with anatomical connectivity (Momi et al., 2021b), namely that network-level anatomical connectivity is more relevant than local and global brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation after the stimulation of two resting-state networks (again DMN and DAN).&quot; Thus, it would be very interesting to also compare the optimized structural networks among individuals and analyze the relationship between strong structural connections and their individual variability in waveform shapes.</p><p>(ii) 26. &quot;Latencies and amplitudes of the SVD left singular vector time series peaks were extracted for every subject and related with the individuals' JR model parameters, with Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values were computed accordingly.&quot; Does this mean that the authors tested correlations of the amplitudes with several of the JR parameters? If the authors ran more tests, one would need to correct for multiple comparisons. Also, it would be great to report the results of these other comparisons in the supplementary material.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I appreciate the authors including Supplementary Figure S4 showing the parameter distributions across the cohort. It's interesting that there is apparently not a great deal of spread in any of the local region parameters – are these fitted values in line with those found by others using the Jansen-Rit model? What dynamical regime does this place the model in? This would give confidence that the model is indeed in a state consistent with the pre-stimulus resting state.</p><p>2. The fitting algorithm apparently allows a great many parameters to vary because the connectivity matrix is allowed to vary from the tractography-derived priors. Can the authors give a sense of how much of the fit is due to this huge number of degrees of freedom in the network, versus the local region parameters? And can they defend against the classic charge that a model with so many free parameters can fit anything?</p><p>3. Figure 3, it appears that the model fits better in channel space than in source space. Can the authors give an intuition for why this is so?</p><p>4. How focal is the stimulation? It is mentioned that SimNIBS is used, but how many regions are stimulated by the TMS pulse?</p><p>5. Can the authors justify why TMS is modeled as perturbing specifically the excitatory interneuron population?</p><p>6. What's the reasoning for using the matrix laplacian of the connectivity matrix?</p><p>7. Equation (4), it appears that Su(t) should be S(v) or S(v(t)). And why the t=0 boundary? I suspect a typo in the denominator too (I think it should be 1+exp instead of 1-exp).</p><p>8. Equation (11), bracket missing.</p><p>9. Here the modeled EEG signal is estimated from the difference between the excitatory and inhibitory interneuron activity in each region, which at first sounds at odds with the generally accepted view that EEG is most related to pyramidal neurons. I suspect this choice is because in the Jansen Rit model it is those outputs of the interneurons that drive the pyramidal neurons. This should be clarified.</p><p>10. lines 647-649, it is unclear how Equation (13) is a measure of complexity; also a typo referring to it as Equation (14).</p><p>11. Figure 4C, what's the inset scalp picture?</p><p>12. Figure 4C, if this is Local Mean Field Power how can it go negative? And why does it have units of microvolts?</p><p>13. Supp. Figure S4 uses different symbols for the parameters vs the main text.</p><p>14. Many of the figures pack in so much detail that it is difficult to see what is going on without excessive zoom to read labels etc. Some labeling should be larger, and some figures should potentially be split into multiple if there's no space to increase the size of details within.</p><p>15. There should be a space between a number and its units.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really enjoyed reading this manuscript. I found it interesting and well-conceived. Below the authors can find a list of issues (along with possible suggestions). In case the authors will properly address them, I would really recommend the publication of this otherwise excellent study on <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) As clearly stated in my public review, most of my issues derive from the data used in the manuscript. My suggestion is to use the open dataset that came with Fecchio, Pigorini et al. (Plos One, 2017), including parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and M1 stimulation. The dataset is available at :</p><p>https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1</p><p>Using this dataset:</p><p>i) You could consider cortices other than M1;</p><p>ii) You use data collected with customized noise masking, that minimizes residual auditory evoked potentials (i.e. n100-p200 component, as in Figure S1, Subjects 5, 6, 7, 8, 15… etc);</p><p>iii) You use data that maximize the impact of TMS on the cortex;</p><p>iv) You can be sure that residual sensory artefacts are maximally reduced during data collection.</p><p>For all these reasons, I would really recommend using the above-mentioned dataset (or a similar one). This will be enormously important also for the TMS-EEG community. Indeed, it will allow demonstration, thanks to your modelling approach, that TMS-EEG data can contain late components even in the complete absence of residual sensory artefacts. I understand that re-running the entire analysis over another dataset is an enormous amount of work, but I strongly believe that it is fundamental for a proper interpretation of the results, and to make your study useful for the entire TMS-EEG community.</p><p>2) By applying your modelling approach to such a dataset you should also be able to replicate the results reported in Rosanova et al. (JNeurosc, 2009) and Ferrarelli et al. (Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2012) showing that the stimulation of different areas leads to TEPs characterized by different &quot;natural frequencies&quot;. Reproducing this feature in simulated data is fundamental to check the quality of simulated data – as a note I would indeed recommend using the natural frequency instead of the Perturbational Complexity Index to evaluate the quality of the simulated data (see also point 5 of the public review), and perhaps PCI to evaluate changes in complexity upon virtual lesion (as in Rosanova, Fecchio et al., Nat Comms, 2020). As a note, I am not 100% sure that a connectome-based approach that accounts for only a few local properties (Jensen and Rit equations) can be able to reproduce the Natural frequency. If it were the case, it would be an incredibly valuable readout of the efficacy of your method; if not, it means that this is just a first step that needs to be perfected (and this can be easily discussed).</p><p>3) Related to my point (6) of the public review; if possible and not computationally challenging, I would perform more than 3 lesions over time. Instead of 20, 60, and 100ms, I would try to perform a more time-resolved analysis with one lesion every 5/10 ms, up to 200-300 ms.</p><p>4) It is not very clear how the authors performed the statistical comparison between real and simulated data. In addition, in figure 1A, empirical and simulated TEPs exhibit extremely different voltages, so simulated TEPs appear to be remarkably larger than empirical TEPs. How do the authors explain this discrepancy? Since the metric employed by the authors (correlation) is independent of the absolute value of the voltage, it would be important to quantify and report these differences.</p><p>5) This is more of a curiosity: what happens to high frequencies (&gt;20Hz) after the lesion? Do you see any suppression as in Rosanova, Fecchio (Nat Comms, 2018)?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;TMS-evoked responses are driven by recurrent large-scale network dynamics&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Michael Frank (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed. These issues are outlined in the Reviewer comments provided below. These need to be addressed comprehensively before we can consider publication of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors provided a significantly improved revised manuscript and with most of their responses to my comments. I am very happy. However, there are still a few major and minor points that I suggest the authors take a closer look at.</p><p>General point:</p><p>Often, the authors nicely provide detailed explanations in the rebuttal but fail to also add those explanations to the manuscript. If these refinements were also added to the improved manuscript, then future readers could benefit from the improved clarity directly without additionally having to consult the rebuttal letter. An example is essential revision 3, where it would be great if the authors could also clarify in the text that they used the Frobenius norm.</p><p>Essential revision 2:</p><p>– I fail to recognize the distance-dependence in the subject-specific SCs. There are many strongly red-colored entries, not just the ones around the diagonal. It seems similar in the original SC, thus I would not take this as a key feature here to judge the fitted SCs.</p><p>– In the visualization of the original SC matrix (Appendix 2- Figure 4), one can see that the range of values is [0:0.003], thus allowing a variance of 1/50=0.02 seems very extreme in my opinion.</p><p>– Also for better comparison of the original SC with the subject-specific SCs, could the authors please use the same color bar limits for all SCs?</p><p>– If the authors allowed such a 1/50 variance, did they only allow this variance in the positive direction or did their prior distribution also allow for negative entries in the SC?</p><p>– &quot;We selected a prior variance for each of these connections of 1/50, which was determined empirically to provide a strong constraint but allow for some flexibility during the fitting process.&quot; What exactly is meant with „determined empirically&quot; here?</p><p>– &quot;It can be seen here that the distribution of the norm distances scores (see image below) acceptable, indicating a relatively small deviation from the prior connectivity weights.&quot; It would be much better if the authors describe in words what they calculated here instead of posting the code as a justification of acceptability of the norm distance scores.</p><p>Essential revision 4: The x axis ‚brain regions' should probably be relabeled and also add numbers to the ticks please.</p><p>Essential revision 6: I applaud the authors for providing such a table with individually optimized parameters, which is an important step towards full reproducibility of their study.</p><p>– In the table, there is only one column of variances added for each variable, was this the variance of the prior or posterior distribution or were they the same?</p><p>– How can there be a negative variance for the global gain?</p><p>Essential revision 12:</p><p>The 100 repetition times of their fitting algorithm show a large and to me alarming variability of optimized parameters and warrants further analyses. One solution to deal with this alarming variability would be to please always run the algorithm 100 times (at least 10 I would suggest) and take the mean of its distribution as the final optimized parameter in order to increase robustness of the presented fitting results.</p><p>– &quot;For completeness, the prior means for each parameter are also shown as vertical red lines. Shown below are parameter estimate distribution plots for a single subject, repeated 100 times. The vertical red line indicates the original parameters' value (the one in the manuscript) for the same subject.&quot; What do the red lines in the plots represent, the prior means or the parameter value chosen for this subject in the manuscript results?</p><p>– &quot;Reassuringly, these histograms are approximately normally distributed, and have a tight range of variation that spans only a few percent of the magnitude of each parameter&quot; Even though the variation spans only a few percent of the magnitude of each parameter, the variation for this single subject (e.g. for parameter a: [94:102]) spans nearly over the whole range of optimal parameter values that were fitted over all subjects (e.g. for parameter a: [92:102], see Appendix 2 – Table 1) – or even a larger range than the one fitted over all subjects as in the case of c1. Thus, all results regarding individual variability should be interpreted with caution. The plot for c4 is probably mislabeled as no subject has optimal values in this range according to Table 1.</p><p>Essential comment 18:</p><p>Results lack significance after Bonferroni correction, therefore they should in my opinion be moved to the Supplementary Material and not be mentioned in the main text as being significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job in responding to the reviewer comments. In particular it is impressive that they successfully replicated the analysis on an independent dataset. Some residual comments:</p><p>1.

Re Equation 4, why the t=0 boundary?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>First, I would like to congratulate the authors on the incredible amount of work done in order to address all the issues posed by myself and the other reviewers. In particular, I really appreciate the new set of analyses performed on a completely different dataset in order to control for possible confounding factors, such as residual sensory input. In general, the authors have addressed most of the issues I formerly raised, and significantly improved the manuscript with the revised version.</p><p>Yet, the first fundamental issue mentioned in my previous review has not been addressed (see point 19 of previous review). The authors mentioned in their response that they &quot;believe that [testing different areas] is beyond the scope of the present manuscript…&quot;. I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, the interpretation of the results could be severely biased by the stimulation of one single area (primary motor cortex – M1), having strong efferent connections with periphery. To better clarify my point, by stimulating only M1 it is not possible to conclude that late TEP components are &quot;driven by the recurrent activity within the rest of network&quot; (as stated in the introduction); or at least this is not the only possible interpretation. Indeed, TMS of M1 – especially at Resting Motor Threshold (RMT), as in Biabani et al., or above RMT, as in Fecchio, Pigorini et al. (Experiment_1) – most often leads to muscle twitch, which in turn, induces proprioceptive (sensory) feedback from the periphery. So, TEP components under these experimental conditions are inherently confounded by the peripheral twitch induced by the stimulation. How can the authors address this problem?</p><p>In my view, the most straightforward solution implies including other areas in the main analysis (as suggested in my previous review); however, I understand that this implies a huge amount of work, encompassing &quot;diffusion-weighted MRI analysis, TMS-EEG analysis, e-field modeling, deep learning for parameter optimization and neural mass model implementations…&quot;. I also understand that &quot;this question is among the scientific priorities&quot; of the authors, which &quot;are currently working on expanding this model further to other stimulation sites&quot;.</p><p>So in my view, other two – less time consuming – possible solutions to disentangle this problem are:</p><p>1) The authors could control whether TEP associated with high voltage and low voltage Motor Evoked Potentials are associated with different late components in the simulated data (data available in Fecchio, Pigorini 2017 – Experiment_2).</p><p>2) The authors need to significantly rework the main message of the manuscript by incorporating this confound in the authors' interpretation of their main finding (e.g. the title should be changed because late components could be recurrent large scale network dynamics, but could be also feedback from the periphery…).</p><p>I find this second option overly detrimental to the overall significance of the study and I strongly suggest the authors to implement the first in a revision.</p><p>Apart of this main issue, I also found a couple of issues the authors may want to address before publication.</p><p>1) Perhaps my previous comment about PCI was not clear enough. I did not say that &quot;PCI should never be used for evaluating model fit&quot;; and I fully understand that fitting &quot;could be done with any metric at all that can be computed from empirical and simulated time series&quot;. However, while it is true that &quot;the model may be considered a good one to the extent that it captures multiple data features of physiological interest that are reliably quantifiable&quot;, it is also true that some metrics are better than others to capture similarities among different time series. As mentioned in my previous review, &quot;two completely different wave shapes could in principle have exactly the same PCI value&quot;. The authors can find an example for this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig1">Decision letter image 1</xref>. Top and bottom panels report the butterfly plot (black) and the channel under the coil obtained by stimulating (in the same subject) occipital and prefrontal cortices, respectively. In both cases PCI is 0.47, but the wave shapes highlight major differences both in time and space which are not captured by the single PCI scalar. I hope this example clarifies my former concern and suggest the authors to report metrics other than PCI in the main figures (Pearson correlation coefficients are more than enough).</p><fig id="sa1fig1" position="float"><label>Decision letter image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa1-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>2) Something must be wrong with the axes in Figure S5. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa1fig2">Decision letter image 2</xref> the authors can find a plot with the correct time and voltage scales for each subject. For example, in Subj_1 the first peak is a 4 ms and not at 38 ms (as in Figure S5).</p><fig id="sa1fig2" position="float"><label>Decision letter image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa1-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>3) Related to my former comment on the original manuscript: &quot;Figure 2B shows a correlation that can be partially driven by the spectral content of the waveforms. It could be relevant to verify whether these correlations are significant with respect to a comparable null hypothesis (e.g. IAAFT, or correlating different empirical and simulated sessions).&quot; I mean that correlation analysis could be strongly affected by low frequencies (characterized by higher power). Thus, a statistical test accounting for different frequencies (e.g., IAAFT) could be preferable (yet not mandatory at this stage).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83232.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors state: &quot;Our central question is whether these late responses represent evoked oscillatory 'echoes' of the initial stimulation that are entirely locally-driven and independent of the rest of the network, or whether they rather reflect a chain of recurrent activations dispersing from and then propagating back to the initial target site via the connectome.&quot; Since the network is connected, it seems unlikely that any effect can be &quot;independent of the rest of the network&quot;, in which case Figure 4B would have been sufficient to show that the later responses to TMS are due to recurrent network dynamics.

We realize however that this example may be something of a distraction from our main results (which comes up again in Editor Question #14), since the aim of this sub-figure was simply to show visually the effect of the lesion on TEP time series in one example case. We have therefore replaced this figure with the corresponding waveforms for the 20ms lesion condition (see response to Question #14 for full description of this edit).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Regarding structural connectivity: &quot;We set strong priors on the connection weights, such that individual fits allow for a small adjustment of these values.&quot; How much variance did you allow?

There is one example of one subject in Figure S4 but could you also please quantify the differences between the original and the individually fitted structural matrices?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editor for raising this important point regarding the structural connectome we used in our analysis. Our prior connectivity weights matrix was constructed as the average of 400 healthy young individuals taken from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult; Van Essen et al. 2012). We selected a prior variance for each of these connections of 1/50, which was determined empirically to provide a strong constraint but allow for some flexibility during the fitting process. Importantly, after fitting every subject we also conducted visual inspections to confirm that the (posterior mean) connection weight matrices retained the key topological features present in empirical neuroimaging measurements – namely: distance-dependence (strongest values around the main diagonal), within-hemisphere and within-network modular block structure, and (relatively) strong(er) inter-hemispheric connections between homologous brain regions.</p><p>Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> are the matrices of the posterior mean structural connectivity weights for all subjects from our analysis.

Please clarify why the Laplacian was taken as input as this seems like an unconventional normalization.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question that we have examined extensively in our present and previous work (see eg pages 337-338 of (John D. Griffiths et al. 2020) for a review of connectivity matrix normalization approaches used in the whole-brain modelling literature). The matrix norm we use here is the Frobenius norm (numpy.linalg.norm(x); see e.g.(Mehta-Pandejee et al. 2017; Robinson et al. 2014)). Other commonly used approaches are scalar division by the maximum weight (placing all entries in the range {0,1} ). Division by the matrix norm is the preferable option here as it ensures that the matrix is linearly stable (i.e. all eigenvalues have negative real part). As to the second question: the matrix Laplacian is not particularly unconventional, it has also been used often in previous whole-brain modelling research (Abdelnour et al. 2018; Atasoy et al. 2016; Raj et al. 2022). The Laplacian sets each row sum (i.e. each node’s weighted in-degree) to be equal (by subtracting row sums from diagonal). The effect of this is that the difference between nodes now becomes a question of the pattern of connections, but not their magnitude. This is related to the rationale followed in eg (Deco et al. 2013, 2014; Schirner et al. 2018), where connection weights as defined by streamline counts are divided by the connecting surface area of a given brain region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. &quot;This thresholded E-field map was then used to inject a weighted stimulus into the target regions in the model.&quot; How was this weighting calculated?

Why were the source-space waveforms not assessed on an individual subject level? It seems like the waveforms and Figure 4 should be validated on an individual basis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editor for their insightful suggestion.</p><p>We have run the recommended analyses for evaluating goodness of fit in source space at the single subject level.</p><p>Please see the new Figure 3 which now includes 3 panels (E, F and G).</p><p>Specifically, panel E includes a bar plot showing the cosine similarity between empirical and simulated sources at the level of vertices for all the subjects. In panel F there are the same 3 representative subjects as Figure 2, but with similar scores at the level of the 200 parcels. Finally, in panel G we have reported the cosine similarity at the level of the 7 canonical Yeo networks. As can be seen, despite their differences, all 3 of these analyses show cosine similarity scores &gt; 0.7. This is particularly notable given the level of individual variability in the fitted TEP waveform data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. At what time was the stimulus onset? Was this onset time varied and tested for different correlation outcomes with the empirical time series? It seems that the responses are slightly shifted between empirical and simulated waveforms. Related to this, what was the transient time of the simulation, and was this cut-off? What was the total length of the simulation?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important question that we are happy to elaborate on further.</p><p>Regarding transient times: The total length of the simulation was 400ms which included -100ms of baseline (pre-TMS) and +300ms after stimulation injection. Prior to the start of the 100ms baseline there was a 20ms burn-in, which allowed for the system to settle after the usual transient due to randomly selected initial conditions. The sufficiency of this burn-in period is evidenced clearly in all of our simulated TEP waveform figures by the lack of any residual large inflection at the start of the prestimulus baseline.</p><p>Regarding stimulus onsets and durations: The external input was injected at t=0ms (i.e. exactly the onset of the TMS pulse) for a duration of 10ms, with a simple squarewave on/off pattern. We do not claim that this 10ms square-wave is a particularly faithful replication of the physical field patterns and physiological response of individual neuronal cell membranes to a ~200μs biphasic TMS-pulse, that level of physical detail being largely beyond the scope of the neural mass modelling framework. Rather, the 10ms stimulus duration is best understood as a ‘charging time’ during which reciprocal excitation across multiple stimulated cells reaches the level of population-level activation. We have explored different stimulation durations between ~3-15ms, however the overall model behaviour was little affected by this parameter.</p><p>The lag of ~20ms that the reviewer correctly observes is therefore not the result of a delayed stimulation onset, but rather to the rise time of the evoked response at the first few stimulated nodes. The speed of this rise, and peak time of that first inflection, is in part determined by some of the fitted JR parameters, which allow the model to account for variation across subjects in those early TEP component times and waveforms.</p><p>As the reviewer may be aware, other neural mass modelling approaches for sensory-evoked responses (e.g. (David et al. 2006)) have elected to inject stimuli into the cortex at large lag times, such as up to ~80ms, so as to account for thalamic relay of sensory inputs. In the case of electromagnetic fields administered directly to the cortex, however, there is (apart from the 10ms charging period indicated above) no physiological rationale for inserting long delay times before stimulus onset, and so we have not done so here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Can the authors please comment on the differences in the y-axis ranges between simulated and empirical responses? Can these not also be optimized?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editor for pointing this out.</p><p>Whilst we did not explicitly attempt to optimize the exact μV channel-level TEP amplitudes, this should still have been optimized implicitly by the fact that the main term in the objective function of our model is the mean-squared error between empirical and simulated EEG time series.</p><p>We certainly do agree that more accurately matching these quantities is a desirable property for future iterations of the model, and will investigate further customization of the objective function to promote this in future work. Relaxing the level of regularization (prior precision) on the lead-field matrix entries, for example, would likely help here, although this comes at the cost of increasing potential overfitting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. It could be quite interesting to also compare the TEPs with a resting-state simulation using the same optimized parameters. This could provide a useful benchmark to compare the stimulus ON periods with stimulus OFF periods and distinguish the stimulus propagation from normal activity spreading in the individual brain networks. If the authors compare their model outcomes also with other whole-brain dynamics benchmarks, e.g. resting-state networks or markers of healthy EEG activity, then this could give increased credibility to the model. Since the authors make claims about whole-brain dynamics, it would be important to validate their model beyond the TEP signature.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Editor’s suggestion and we strongly agree with their vision. Indeed, this is exactly our goal: building a model that is able to resemble both resting state and evoked activity. Originally, the Jansen and Rit model was employed for simulating α oscillations in the occipital cortex and evoked responses to visual stimuli. Following the request suggested by the Editor’s comment we have tested this by re-running the simulation using the same parameters we have fitted but without injecting the external stimulus. This can be easily achieved by the implementation of the model we have changing the following code line.</p><p>u[:,:,110:120]=0</p><p>As the Editor can see this line of code simply set the external stimulus to zero.</p><p>Please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref> for the results for 1 representative subject. As shown in the joint plots and time frequency plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref> showing simulated (left) and empirical (right) prestimulus activity.</p><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa2-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig6">Author response image 6</xref>, the resting state of our model, shows some similarity to the empirical resting state spectrum on the right, at least in terms of its slope and the presence of some oscillatory peaks. The frequency of the peaks does not match the 10Hz α rhythm evident in the empirical data however. Our feeling is that this result is encouraging (seeing as the parameters used here were obtained from fitting ERP data and not resting-state data), and achieving accurate recovery of individual subject TEP waveforms as well as resting-state oscillations will be a major focus of our future work with this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. How much does the result of the optimization algorithm depend on the window length? In my opinion, a 40 ms window seems quite long. Could the authors also test shorter time windows?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We apologize for this typo and indeed the window length was 20ms (not 40ms). We would like to specify that when we have explored this parameter we have invariably found that changing the window size across a sensible range of 15ms-60ms does not dramatically affect the fit results. In our time-windowed model-fitting and epoching approach, the only real relevance of the window length is to maximize the smoothness of the gradient with respect to the model parameters that generate simulation trajectories. Smaller/Larger windows may perform poorly for this reason, and this is an empirical question, but since our model fits are invariably excellent, we do not feel it is one of paramount importance.</p><p>It is true that potentially if we used smaller/larger windows we could be more sensitive to some short-time features in the TEP. But there aren’t really very many things in the TEP that are shorter than 20ms in temporal width. Moreover, we do not (yet, at least) wish to claim that the current model accurately reproduces the multiple fine-grained fast and early TEP components in the first few dozen milliseconds post-stimulation. We promptly corrected this missing info in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. One of the Reviewers reran the code which is provided by the authors (compliments for sharing!) and noticed that the optimization algorithm has quite varying results, e.g. the first run returned an optimal value of 98.53 and the second one an optimal value for the same parameter of 100.34. Thus, did the authors run the newly developed algorithm multiple times and checked the robustness of the fitting results?</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to express our gratitude with the Editor for raising this important point. We firmly believe that sharing code and data should be the default rather the exception in science, and particularly so in computationally-focused fields such as ours. It is very validating to see that early sharing of this information can also enhance and enrich the review process, and we greatly appreciate that the Reviewers took the time to download and run the code and repository that we have shared.</p><p>Regarding the question of parameter stability and robustness of fitting results: This is an important question that we have studied closely within our model, although we did not discuss at length in the manuscript. Our model is non-deterministic in two key ways – its use of stochastic differential equations at the level of the neural dynamics, and its use of Bayesian inference + stochastic gradient descent at the level of parameter estimation. It also does not rely on consistently specified initial conditions for the states. For these reasons we do indeed expect some variability in parameter estimates upon re-runs. The important question is whether the magnitude of this variability is acceptable. From our testing we feel that this is the case. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref> is an example plot of the distributions of posterior mean values for the 7 main Jansen-Rit model parameters, for 100 repeat runs for an exemplary subject. Reassuringly, these histograms are approximately normally distributed, and have a tight range of variation that spans only a few percent of the magnitude of each parameter.

The HCP data also offers good quality to extract subcortical regions and their connectivity. These regions could play a major role in TEP stimulus propagation.

As stated the first 200 parcels were cortical ROIs from the Schaefer Atlas (Schaefer et al. 2018).</p><p>Then, a parcellation into the same networks was also applied for 14 cerebellar ROIs, which were extracted from the Buckner Atlas (Buckner et al. 2011), and a parcellation of the thalamic nuclei was used to derived 7 different ROIs corresponding to Yeo 7 networks (Yeo et al. 2011).</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0cz132fxva7yox/ThalamusParcellation.zip?dl=0<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/b0cz132fxva7yox/ThalamusParcellation.zip?dl=0">.</ext-link></p><p>Finally, a Freesurfer parcellation was added to this set, giving an additional 12 subcortical structures, including the bilateral basal ganglia (divided into the putamen, caudate and pallidum nuclei), the amygdalae and thalami. This resulted in a 231x231 structural connectivity matrix.</p><fig id="sa2fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa2-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Ultimately however we elected not to include this subcortically-equipped version in the final manuscript, for the following reasons:</p><p>1. We did not observe any qualitatively differences in model behaviour or model fit performance in the cortico-subcortical vs. the cortical-only model.</p><p>2. Whilst we believe that the above-described approach followed the current stateof-the-art in neuroimaging parcellation and connectome estimation methods, it still suffers from various issues, whose satisfactory resolution was beyond the scope of the present work. For example, anatomical connectivity estimation for subcortical regions from MRI data is well known to be highly problematic. On the one hand, low physical distance between subcortical parcels leads to an over-representation of their inter-connectivity. Conversely, estimating connection strengths between subcortical and cortical regions from tractography is highly challenging due to the much smaller size of the former.</p><p>3. Unlike most cortical nodes, the source-localized TMS-EEG signal that is our primary object of study here is not well understood or readily measurable in subcortical regions. Having a large proportion of the (hidden) state variables in our model not contributing to any observed measurements is certainly possible, but would pose additional challenges for our model fitting approach that would not be suitable in the present work, this being the first time we have applied it to the use case of TMS-EEG.</p><p>Taking these points together, we have opted in the present work to not attempt to address the necessarily large question of how best to integrate cortico-subcortical contributions to connectome-based models of TEP dynamics. As regards to the neurobiological question itself, an important contribution of the results in our paper is however to offer a ‘computational existence proof’ that subcortical contributions are not <italic>necessary</italic> for an effective model of TMS-EEG dynamics; the observed waveform patterns can indeed be generated by a connectome-based model without complex subcortical wiring.</p><p>Strong examples of whole-brain modelling work that incorporates (in different ways) cortico-subcortical connectivity are (Meier et al. 2022; Spiegler et al. 2016, 2020). In the latter case a comprehensive treatment of basal ganglia regions was essential, given the focus of investigation on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and Parkinson’s. We look forward to exploring the extent to which these regions dictate the TMS-EEG response in our future modelling work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The main results hinge on the idea of performing virtual lesions at different times and comparing the activity against the no-lesion case, to see whether activity continues in the absence of recurrent feedback from distant regions. This is an elegant and logical approach. But the implementation requires clarification. From the stated premise and the schematics in Figures 1B and 4A, it seems that the lesions are to isolate a stimulated node. But Figures 4B and 4C appear to use a fully-disconnected network, and the Methods text refers to disconnecting the connections of &quot;maximally activated nodes&quot; at different time points. It is thus difficult to understand what type of lesion was used for what analysis. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if Figure 1 and Figure 4 were confusing and we are grateful to the Editor for reporting this.</p><p>Regarding maximally activated nodes: As stated in the methods, the lesion was applied for disconnecting the connections of maximally activated nodes. In order to do that we identified the nodes that were most affected by the stimulation and virtually lesion their connection at different time points. These maximally activated nodes overlapped 92% with the stimulated nodes as defined by the thresholded E-field maps, but importantly also showed some variability over subjects. We attribute this variability to a combination of heterogeneities in the empirical EEG dataset that we were not able to control for post-hoc, including on the stimulation side (precise TMS coil location relative to the brain; brain size and shape differences), and on the EEG measurement side (brain size and shape differences again, as well as differential location of EEG channels relative to the brain). Extending the lesioned node set to the maximally activated nodes provides, we believe, an efficient and data-driven way to accommodate inter-subject differences in TEP patterns given limited information.</p><fig id="sa2fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 9.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa2-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding fully disconnected networks: We included the example of a simulation where the network is fully disconnected in Figure 4C and 4D to help convey the idea behind our methodology, although these model types per se are not a key feature of our results or our argument. We do see now however from the editor’s question (as well as a similar comment in Question #1), that this additional example may be causing more confusion than it is resolving. We have therefore added another panel B where we display a zoom of the source localized EEG activities for the four different conditions showing how early lesions (e.g 20ms and 50ms) compromised the propagation of the TMS-induced signal compared to control (no damage) and late lesion (100ms) conditions (left). Moreover, we also added a bar plot showing a reduced TMS-evoked activity (dSPM area under the curve) when the lesion was applied 20ms and 50ms compared to the others conditions for all the subjects. Importantly we have replaced panels C and D (previous panel B and C) in Figure 4 with the analogous plot from an example subject in our main results set, where the lesion was applied at t=50ms. This replacement figure achieves the original goal (showing channel-level time series in the same subject before and after the virtual lesion), without adding confusion around fully disconnected networks.We thank the Editor again for helping us to sharpen the messaging in this section of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. For the central question of teasing apart recurrent vs local activity, the activation map results in Figure 4A appear to focus on spatial spread rather than the precise question of how much activity at the stimulation site is local vs recurrent. It seems potentially trivial that if you lesion around the stimulation site at 20 ms or 50 ms you don't see spread beyond that site, whereas for a later lesion the delayed stimulus-evoked activity has already reached the other areas (i.e., closing the door after the horse has bolted). Please provide a quantitative calculation of the relative contributions of recurrent vs local activity at the stimulation site. Figures 4B and C may speak to this but the text does not address these.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for the perceptive point. The key sub-panels in Figure 4A are those highlighted with an orange background, and within those surface maps the key part is indeed the differential level of left motor cortex activation in the lesioned vs. non-lesioned case. The observation that the latter is not emphasized enough, given its importance for our argument, is a fair one with which we concur.</p><p>To address this, we have therefore added a further panel B to Figure 4, which (a) represent the surface maps from Figure 4A with clear emphasis on presence/lack of recurrent activity at M1, and (b) quantify the magnitude of this effect over subjects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Relatedly, it is unclear how the lesions interact with the propagation delays between regions, which could be important for interpreting the post-lesion activity. In particular, if a signal is &quot;in transit&quot; at the time of lesioning, does that delayed activity still make it to the destination? This likely depends on whether the lesions are modelled as being physically close to the sender or close to the receiver (or both). In any case, one would expect that the delays between regions would determine whether the initial pulse is able to drive activity there before the lesion cuts them off.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, an important point, which we thank the Editor for raising.</p><p>This is likely well-understood by the Editor, but to be clear: as is standard with this type of network model, there is no explicit concept of physical space in relation to signal propagation, such as is used when modelling the transmission of action potentials along axons. Inputs from connected regions ‘appear at’ their pre-synaptic destination after some delay, but do not travel along a spatial pathway to reach that destination per se. More importantly with respect to the Editor’s question: our implementation of the model’s delay-differential equations does not (as is sometimes done) make use of a moving buffer that saves and aggregates delayed inputs. Rather, the history of the state variables themselves are directly indexed according to the time delay matrix (discretized into number of integration steps). As a result, when a lesion is applied, it is applied at the point where network inputs to a region are collated and summed, as opposed to when they are sent from upstream regions. Neurobiologically, this could be understood as a lesion occurring at the location of synapses, or synaptic boutons at the end of axons, as opposed to e.g. at the mid-point of the axon or at the axon hillock of the pre-synaptic cell(s).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17. The fitting seems to do impressively well overall, but not so well at the start (within the first ~50 ms post-stimulus). This is interesting because one might think that the earliest part of the pulse is &quot;simpler&quot; than the more complex patterns possible after receiving multiple variously-delayed feedbacks from the rest of the network (this is of course central to the paper's main topic). Do the authors have insight into why the initial pulse is apparently more difficult to fit?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question. The observation is correct, our model does not perform as well in the initial 50ms post-stimulation. There are likely a few reasons why this is captured less well in our fits is that the later responses. First, the later response components (100-200ms) dominate the signal, in terms of both amplitude and number of channels contributing, and so the fitting algorithm is able to account for more variance in the data by prioritizing those features. An alternative way of stating this is that the characteristic time scale of TEPs (as well as, for that matter, most canonical ERP waveforms) is more on the order of 100-200ms than 25-50ms – with most channels going ‘up/down/up’ over a 300ms period. This is visually apparent in both the empirical and simulated channel-level time series shown below for each subject, and in most TMS-EEG TEP waveform figures in the literature. Related to this, the default (prior mean) Jansen-Rit model parameter set we are using here has an inbuilt ‘preference’ for these slightly longer time-scale ranges – although interesting not because those parameters were selected for ERP models, but rather because they produce rhythmic oscillations in the α frequency range (~10Hz), the period of which is also 100ms.</p><p>It would nevertheless be interesting to explore whether this model can successfully reproduce some of the canonical early TEP components in the &lt;50ms window, which could be done by restricting the fitting range to only this first portion of the response. We have not yet attempted this modelling experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>18. Regarding the role of inhibitory time constants, it is stated that this result is &quot;entirely data-driven&quot; but it is not clear whether relationships were sought with the various other model parameters too. Some correlations are given (Figure 5B) and some additional modelling is used to verify this (Figures 5C and D), but those panels are not addressed in the text so it's difficult to know what to take from these results. The authors give some justification along the lines that TMS protocols have inhibitory effects, but it's not clear why this should be specifically the time constant vs a synaptic strength or some other property of the inhibitory population.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editor for this feedback on parameter correlation analyses. Regarding the first point: yes, we tested for correlations between TEP component amplitude and all 7 Jansen-Rit physiological parameters. The strongest effect, and only one that is significant, is that of the inhibitory time constant. Thus it is data-driven in the sense that other patterns <italic>could</italic> have been observed in the fitted parameters’ relationship to TEP components, but they were not. The observation that panels 5C and 5D are not mentioned in the main text is helpful, and we have corrected it.</p><p>Line 305: “As shown in Figure 5B, a significant negative correlation was found between the synaptic time constant of the Jansen-Rit inhibitory population and the amplitude of the first eigenmode at its peak (R2 = 27%, p = 0.02). Interestingly, we also observed a significant positive correlation between this parameter and the second eigenmode at its peak (R2 = 28%, p = 0.02). Indeed, as shown in Figure 5C, the topoplots for 2 representative subjects with high (top) and low (bottom) estimated values for the synaptic time constant of the inhibitory population show that the magnitude of the synaptic time constant is closely coupled to the amplitude of the individual first and second SVD modes. Interestingly, as shown in Figure 5D, by varying the optimal value of the inhibitory synaptic time constant, an increase in the amplitude of the first, early, and local TEP component; and a decrease of the second, late, and global TEP component was found.</p><p>However, these significant results were not corrected for the Bonferroni corrected pvalue of 0.007. For this reason the reader should critically interpret such results. For a comprehensive overview of individual timing and topographies of the first two eigenmodes, please refer to Supplementary Figures S3”.</p><p>As to why this parameter specifically: in the Jansen-Rit model there are two chief parameters of interest that determine the dynamics of the inhibitory population – the inhibitory time constant and, as the editor also notes, the excitatory input strength from the pyramidal cell population. The latter would implicate synaptic weights and glutamatergic neurotransmission more directly than the former. The inhibitory time constant should be understood as controlling the overall level of inhibitory activity in the circuit. Note that it does not (as is implied by the technical term ‘time constant’, and is also the case for simpler systems such as harmonic oscillators) simply continuously shift the (damped, in our case) oscillator frequency – this would require a concurrent shift in both the excitatory and inhibitory time constants (c.f. e.g.(David and Friston 2003), Figure 4; (Spiegler et al. 2010), Figure 9; also discussed in (Stefanovski et al. 2019), page 7); although it can alter the frequency by discretely shifting some nodes in the network to a different point in the bistable regime as defined by its bifurcation diagram (c.f. e.g. Figures 6, 7, 13 in(Stefanovski et al. 2019)). Thus our interpretation of the inhibitory time constant parameter estimates in our analyses is that they may index a natural variation across this population of healthy subjects in the intrinsic level of cortical inhibition, and that this leads to variation in TEP component amplitudes, in a manner broadly consistent with conclusions of previous pharmacological TMS-EEG studies (Premoli et al. 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>19. As is evident from most of the figures and as mentioned by the authors of the database (see below), the data contains residual sensory artefacts (auditory or somatosensory) that can bias the authors' interpretation of the re-entrant activity. One key limitation is due to the stimulation target. Only the primary motor cortex (M1) is considered here. TMS of M1 – especially at Resting Motor Threshold, as in Biabani et al. – leads to peculiar features in the time and frequency domain of the EEG response, possibly due to feedback from the periphery following target muscle activation – see for example Fecchio, Pigorini et al., Plos One 2017. Are the authors able to address this potential contamination of the signal?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to item 22 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>20. On a related note, the data used here are collected by delivering white noise to cover TMS-click instead of a customized one (see Russo et al. JNeurosMethods, 2022). This could introduce the residual auditory activity in the EEG response to TMS that might substantially bias the results and their interpretation in terms of network long-range interactions. For example, residual auditory effects (i.e. n100-p200 component) seem to be present in most of the figures. Can the authors rule out a major contribution of such effects to their findings?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to item 22 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21. Besides the influence of late sensory components, in the same subjects the initial response of the real data seems to be of rather low amplitude and not lateralized, suggestive of a non-effective TMS delivery (see Belardinelli et al., Brain Stim, 2019, for the relevance of this topic). Importantly, in the related simulated data it seems that the initial response is instead present and much higher and lateralized with respect to the real data, possibly reflective of a capacity of the model to replicate the typical TEPs obtained by &quot;effective&quot; TMS. The authors should comment on this potential limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to item 22 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22. The work by Biabani et al. reports that &quot;TEPs elicited by motor cortex TMS reflect a combination of transcranially and peripherally evoked brain responses despite adopting sensory attenuation methods during experiments&quot;. This spurious effect is particularly relevant after 60 ms following TMS, and thus the present findings, as well as their interpretation, could be in principle biased by somatosensory re-entrant activity. As such, for the purpose of the present manuscript – i.e. evaluating the late effect of TMS, a dataset in which the residual sensory activity is maximally reduced during data collection is recommended (see Casarotto et al., JNeurosc Methods, 2022 for a full discussion on this topic).</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to express our gratitude to the Editor (along with the other reviewers) for raising these important points regarding the dataset we have used in our study. We do concur that it is possible there are some residual auditory/somatosensory evoked potential sources in the data used here. This was unfortunately largely out of our control, given that we neither collected nor preprocessed the data. We do note however that the dataset in question has (at least until very recently) represented the state-of-the-art in terms of TMS-EEG preprocessing and analysis (the publication source is indeed a data preprocessing methodology paper) – having been produced by one of the strongest groups in the field, and used for multiple publications in leading journals (Biabani et al. 2019; Rogasch et al. 2020).</p><p>Nevertheless, being active in the TMS-EEG community, we do recognize that the questions raised are important ones. We have therefore run the re-run the analysis using the dataset suggested by Reviewer#3 ((Fecchio et al. 2017)- https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1 ).</p><p>Our goal was to replicate the results we obtained with the Rogash group dataset, rejecting in this way the null hypothesis that our previous results were due to sensory artifact. In this way, our interpretation of the re-entrant activity should not be biased by the residual sensory artifacts (auditory or somatosensory).</p><p>Please see the new Appendix 2-figure 6 showing the Empirical (upper row) and simulated (lower row) TMS-EEG butterfly plots with scalp topographies for all 6 subjects of the Fecchio and Pigorini’s dataset.

Similarly to Figure 2B of the manuscript, in Panel A there are the Pearson correlation coefficients between simulated and empirical TMS-EEG time series for each subject. Panel B shows the source reconstructed TMS-evoked propagation pattern dynamics for empirical (top) and simulated (bottom) data for one representative subject of Fecchio and Pigorini’s dataset. Panel C represents the similarity between simulated and empirical time series in source space for every subject of the Fecchio-Pigorini dataset, showing a robust recovery of TEP patterns in model-generated EEG time series. Panel D shows the network-level Pearson correlation coefficients between empirical and simulated source-reconstructed time series extracted for every subject.</p><p>Finally, we have also re-run the analysis for the virtual lesion approach using the Fecchio-Pigorini dataset. Please see the new Appendix 2-figure 9 showing how removing recurrent connections from stimulated target nodes suppresses their late TEP activity in the same way we found for the Rogash group dataset.</p><p>In the same way as our analyses of the Rogash dataset in the manuscript, the network level effects were evaluated statistically by extracting dSPM loadings from the source activity maps for each of the 7 canonical Yeo networks (Yeo et al., 2011) and entering them into a 4x7 repeated measures ANOVA with within-subjects factors “TIME OF DAMAGE (4 levels: 20ms; 50ms; 100ms; no damage) and “NETWORK” (7 levels: VISN; SMN; DAN; ASN; LIMN; FPN; DMN) Significant main effects were found for both TIME OF DAMAGE (F(6,30) = 229.87, p&lt;0.0001, η2p = 0.97) and NETWORK (F(6,18) = 12.08, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.71) – indicating that the effects of virtual lesions vary depending on both the time administered and the site administered to, as well as the combination of these factors (significant interaction NETWORK*TIME OF DAMAGE (F(3,18) = 10.26, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.67)).</p><p>The fact that the results we have reported for the Rogash group dataset were replicated and extended in the Fecchio-Pigorini dataset indicates that, despite the suggestion that the first dataset does contain residual sensory artifacts (auditory or somatosensory), our interpretation of the re-entrant activity is unaffected by those artifacts.</p><p>We edited the main manuscript accordingly to reflect the above points:</p><p>Line 700: “Finally, as above, the model-generated dSPM values were extracted from the 7 canonical network surface maps for each individual and for each condition, and analyzed statistically using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 25 (IBM Corp).

For a complete overview of this control analyses and the corresponding results, please refer to Supplementary Results 2.2 and Supplementary Figures S5, S6, S7.”</p><p>We have also added a new section as Supplementary Results (2.2 Control analyses). Figure S5 shows empirical and fitted TEP waveforms and selected topography maps for the entire group of the Fecchio, Pigorini et al. dataset (Fecchio et al. 2017). Similarly to the analyses for the Rogasch’s dataset, it is visually evident in these figures that the model accurately captures several individually-varying features of these time series, such as the timing of the 50 ms and 100-120 ms TEP components, and the extent to which they are dominated by left/right and temporal/parietal/frontal channels.</p><p>Similarly to the single-subject fits, an accurate recovery of the grand mean empirical TEP waveform was reported when the fitted TEPs were averaged over subjects (Figure S6A). These grand mean channel-level waveforms were further used to assess model fit in brain source space. As shown in Figure S6B, the same spatiotemporal activation pattern is observed both for empirical (top row) and model generated (bottom row) time series. M1 stimulation begins with activation in left motor area at &lt;inline-graphic mimetype=&quot;image&quot; mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image1.png&quot; /&gt;20-30 ms, then propagates to temporal, frontal and homologous contralateral brain regions, resulting in a waveform peak at &lt;inline-graphic mimetype=&quot;image&quot; mime-subtype=&quot;png&quot; xlink:href=&quot;media/image2.png&quot; /&gt;100-120 ms.

Significant main effects were found for both TIME OF DAMAGE (F<sub>(6,30)</sub> = 229.87, p&lt;0.0001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.97) and NETWORK (F<sub>(6,18)</sub> = 12.08, p &lt; 0.0001, η<sup>2</sup><sub>p</sub> = 0.71) – indicating that the effects of virtual lesions vary depending on both the time administered and the site administered to, as well as the combination of these factors (significant interaction NETWORK*TIME OF DAMAGE (F(3,18) = 10.26, p &lt; 0.0001, η<sup>2</sup>p = 0.67)).</p><p>As for the Editor’s point regarding testing different cortical sites, we absolutely embrace his view. However, although we agree that this is an important consideration, we believe that is beyond the scope of the present manuscript, given the various complexities involved that include diffusion-weighted MRI analysis, TMS-EEG analysis, e-field modelling, deep learning for parameter optimization and neural mass model implementations. Despite this, we would like to further note that this question is in fact our primary scientific priority at the moment; and indeed we are currently working on expanding this model further to other stimulation sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23. The Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI, Casali et al., Science Tr Med, 2013) should be used to evaluate changes in complexity induced by cortical lesions (as in Rosanova, Fecchio, Nat comms 2018 or in Sarasso, Brain, 2020) and not for evaluating the similarity between real and simulated data. Indeed, two completely different wave shapes could in principle have exactly the same PCI value. Instead, for evaluating the quality of the simulated signal (i.e. its similarity with real data), the &quot;natural frequency&quot; may be preferable (Rosanova et al. 2009, JNeurosc).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Editor for raising up this important point and for giving us the opportunity to elaborate around choosing Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI,(Casali et al. 2013)) as a metric for evaluating the similarity between real and simulated data.</p><p>In regards to the Editor’s comments:</p><p>1. Respectfully, we disagree with this blanket injunction that PCI should never be used for evaluating model fit. In principle this could be done with any metric at all that can be computed from empirical and simulated time series, and the model may be considered a good one to the extent that it captures multiple data features of physiological interest that are reliably quantifiable.</p><p>2. The multiple realizability issue that the Editor raises also applies just as equally to other standard metrics such as variance, covariance, correlations, for which various pattern combinations could produce similar values.</p><p>3. Indeed, for similar reasons to these concerns, we have not limited ourselves to only reporting PCI in comparing the similarity between empirical and modelgenerated time series, but instead we have used multiple metrics. None of our arguments in the paper are dependent on the simulated time series PCI values. In the manuscript we report PCI scores, Pearson correlation coefficients for comparing the simulated and empirical TMS-EEG time series for each subject (Figure 2B), cosine similarities, as well as run a time-wise permutation tests yielding with statistically significant fits for every EEG electrode (Figure 3C).</p><p>4. Quantification aside, the simulated TEP waveforms we present are quite clearly very visually similar to the modelled empirical data. To assist with this, we have added additional information to the manuscript. First of all, in Figure 2A we show the individual empirical and simulated TEPs patterns for 3 representative subjects. Moreover, in Supplementary Figure S1 we extended Figure 2A and we reported all the subjects empirical and simulated TMS-EEG activity. Additionally, as requested by the Editor and Reviewer #3’s later comment, we have validated our model in a completely independent open dataset Fecchio, Pigorini et al. (Fecchio et al. 2017). The results for this new dataset for every subject are now available as Appendix 2-figure 1.</p><p>5. Regarding the Editor’s final comment on natural frequency – this is indeed an interesting experimental observation that we are keen to investigate further and replicate in our model. It is not however (unlike the TMS-EEG TEP waveform itself, which we have focused on here) a conventional metric studied in the field, and so is not (yet) a major priority in our model fitting evaluations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. Please clarify the rationale for performing virtual lesions only at 20, 60, and 100 ms. A time-resolved analysis would be preferable</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the Editor for pointing out this important doubt regarding the choice of the time point for lesioning the structural connectome. The rationale behind our selection was based on previous literature, which is robust in terms of the TEP waveforms following M1 stimulation. Indeed, each TEP elicited by a single TMS pulse delivered to M1 is actually composed of a sequence of negative and positive deflections (mainly N15, P30, P60, N120). Despite there being little understood and/or definitely established in terms of the physiological mechanisms underlying each component of the TEP, several studies have suggested that the early components N15 and P30 reflect fast excitatory mechanisms (Mäki and Ilmoniemi 2010; Rogasch et al. 2013). The P60 component has also been proposed to reflect somatosensory return (Paus et al. 2001), and the N120 has been associated with the activation of GABA-B receptors (Bonnard et al. 2009; Nikulin et al. 2003; Premoli et al. 2014).</p><p>One of our main goals in the present work was to disentangle the physiological origin of these waveforms, and for this reason we have decided to apply a virtual lesion slightly before the key time point. We have deliberately omitted the N15 because applying a lesion before that time point would be completely infeasible due its proximity to the TMS pulse. Moreover, the first 14ms after the TMS pulse were zero padded and then interpolated, making any inference on the N15 difficult to interpret.</p><p>As for investigating the P30, P60 and N120 we have applied the virtual lesion 20ms, 50ms or 100ms after the pulse. Our results show that, as compared to both a later virtual lesion (100ms) and no damage (control) conditions, when important connections were removed at 20ms and 50ms after the TMS pulse, there was an early significant reductions in the TMS-evoked activity of the P60 and N120 signal components, but not in P30. This indicates that P30 is mainly due to a local echo of the stimulus, such that even an early lesion (20ms) doesn’t affect the overall generation and shape of this waveform. Conversely at 80ms (P60 has some degree of freedom, +/-20ms) we have found a complete essence of propagation in the condition where the lesion was applied before that time frame (20ms and 50ms after the pulse). That means that P60 might be due to a network reverberation, and not a local node echo. Finally, as for the N120: we have found both an essence of propagation to ipsilateral and homologous brain regions (like in the control condition) and a local residual of the stimulus. This indicates that the N120 can be due to both local and global effects.</p><p>Overall, we found that TMS-evoked propagation dynamics in the model change significantly depending on the specific time that a virtual lesion is applied, providing insight on the physiological origin of the TEPs and their underlying dynamics.</p><p>Despite this, as requested by Reviewer #3, we have run the lesions analysis again for one subject with one lesion every 10ms, up to 200ms after the TMS pulse.

Despite the necessary loss of some information due to ‘downsampling’, we believe that our choice of 20, 50, and 100ms as a window for showing the propagation changes due to virtual lesions does summarize this complexity well.We hope that the Editor would appreciate our efforts in showing the result for the analysis asked for and we hope he would agree regarding the time windows we have used for showing the results in the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Key points:</p><p>(i) The authors themselves state that structural connectivity plays an important role in the waveform shapes: &quot;More recently we obtained a similar result with anatomical connectivity (Momi et al., 2021b), namely that network-level anatomical connectivity is more relevant than local and global brain properties in shaping TMS signal propagation after the stimulation of two resting-state networks (again DMN and DAN).&quot; Thus, it would be very interesting to also compare the optimized structural networks among individuals and analyze the relationship between strong structural connections and their individual variability in waveform shapes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this compelling comment and interesting idea.

New prospective studies including a predefined assignment to a low and high modularity group will be needed to further verify this relationship between TMS responses and connectome modularity.</p><p>We have added a Supplementary Results section (2.4 Relationship between fitted structural Connectome and TMS-evoked engagement) when these results are reported.

The fitting algorithm apparently allows a great many parameters to vary because the connectivity matrix is allowed to vary from the tractography-derived priors. Can the authors give a sense of how much of the fit is due to this huge number of degrees of freedom in the network, versus the local region parameters? And can they defend against the classic charge that a model with so many free parameters can fit anything?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important question, and one we have been very mindful of in conducting this work.</p><p>We would like to first highlight that we have examined this question of the contribution of connectivity weights vs. neurophysiological model parameters to fitting performance in our other recent work (John David Griffiths et al. 2022), (doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.19.492664<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.19.492664">,</ext-link> also under review). As can be seen in that paper (compare e.g. Figure 3C vs. Supplementary Figure 2A), we showed that including strongly constrained connectivity matrix parameter estimation does not substantially alter estimation of physiological neural mass model parameters, or the behaviour of the model when weights are fixed and those parameters are used alone.</p><p>Unlike Griffiths et al. 2022, which is a technical methodology paper introducing the parameter estimation approach used in the present paper, here we are principally concerned with the neurobiological question of recurrent activity. Our approach to connectivity matrix fitting was identical however; namely to avoid this issue we have strongly constrained the model by placing relatively tight priors on the connectivity matrix weights. As can be seen in our response to the Editor’s Question #2, the structure of the resultant fitted connectivity matrices does not vary hugely across subjects, even though the TEP waveforms themselves are highly variable across subjects. There is some individual variation however, and as noted in the above response to Review #1 Question (i), variation in the modularity structure of the fitted weights does in fact replicate previously reported results on the relationship between empirical structural connectivity and TMS-EEG measurements. We are therefore quite confident that the primary results of interest here are not heavily determined by the estimation of connectivity weight parameters, but that the patterns in these recovered parameters do nevertheless express biologically meaningful non-arbitrary (i.e. not over-fitted) structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 3, it appears that the model fits better in channel space than in source space. Can the authors give an intuition for why this is so?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this compelling question. We note that in our model fitting framework, we are fitting TMS-EEG times series at the level of the channel. The source EEG is then derived for the simulated EEG time series. For this reason, it is expected that the model fits better in channel space than in source space, also considering the nature of the inverse problem which is by definition “illposed” (e.g. different source eeg configuration can give rise to the same channel level topoplots).</p><p>We hope that we clarify this important point better and thanks for the opportunity to discuss this further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Can the authors justify why TMS is modeled as perturbing specifically the excitatory interneuron population?</p></disp-quote><p>Our implementation, where input is inserted into the excitatory interneuron population, follows the convention set by the original Jansen-Rit model (see e.g. variable <italic>p(t)</italic> in Equation 6 of Jansen and Rit, 1995; variable Cu<sup>U</sup> Figure 1 and Equation 2 of David et al. 2006). Given the number of novel aspects to the present work, we felt that following conventions such as this were particularly important to ground our analyses in the extant body of work. We do however agree that whether excitatory interneurons should be the sole TMS target population open is very much an open question for the field moving forward.</p><p>It is also a question that we have further evaluated in our next (currently ongoing) study using this model, by comparing alternative options (e.g. input to excitatory interneurons, to pyramidal cells, to all populations). Thus far we have found relatively little difference in the overall modelled TMS-EEG response for stimuli injected into different target populations within the JR circuit. What this indicates is that at the local level, stimulation spreads to all three populations within a given node fairly quickly, and then the transmission to other nodes in the network (which always proceeds via the pyramidal cells) proceeds similarly regardless of the specific subpopulation that was targeted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is correct here, we take the post-synaptic potential on to the Pyramidal cell population (i.e. the Pyramidal cell somato-dendritic activity) as the EEG source, consistent with the generally accepted biophysical basis of the EEG signal, as well as common usage of the Jansen-Rit model (e.g. (David et al. 2006)). In the Jansen-Rit model, this PSP is defined by the inputs to that population, namely the excitatory and inhibitory interneuron populations, which are differenced due to their opposite polarities.

It considers the model complexity as a function of weights, and therefore as proportional to the absolute value of its weight. The L2 regularization works by forcing the weights toward zero (without making them exactly zero), removing a small percentage of weights at each iteration.</p><p>As for the Line 647-649, it was indeed a typo.

My suggestion is to use the open dataset that came with Fecchio, Pigorini et al. (Plos One, 2017), including parietal, premotor, prefrontal, and M1 stimulation. The dataset is available at:</p><p>https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1</p><p>Using this dataset:</p><p>i) You could consider cortices other than M1;</p><p>ii) You use data collected with customized noise masking, that minimizes residual auditory evoked potentials (i.e. n100-p200 component, as in Figure S1, Subjects 5, 6, 7, 8, 15… etc);</p><p>iii) You use data that maximize the impact of TMS on the cortex;</p><p>iv) You can be sure that residual sensory artefacts are maximally reduced during data collection.</p><p>For all these reasons, I would really recommend using the above-mentioned dataset (or a similar one). This will be enormously important also for the TMS-EEG community. Indeed, it will allow demonstration, thanks to your modelling approach, that TMS-EEG data can contain late components even in the complete absence of residual sensory artefacts.

Reproducing this feature in simulated data is fundamental to check the quality of simulated data – as a note I would indeed recommend using the natural frequency instead of the Perturbational Complexity Index to evaluate the quality of the simulated data (see also point 5 of the public review), and perhaps PCI to evaluate changes in complexity upon virtual lesion (as in Rosanova, Fecchio et al., Nat Comms, 2020). As a note, I am not 100% sure that a connectome-based approach that accounts for only a few local properties (Jensen and Rit equations) can be able to reproduce the Natural frequency. If it were the case, it would be an incredibly valuable readout of the efficacy of your method; if not, it means that this is just a first step that needs to be perfected (and this can be easily discussed).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that the ‘natural frequencies’ observations of Rosanova et al. are an interesting and potentially important feature of TMS-evoked EEG responses. As noted above in response to the Editor however, we disagree that natural frequency responses are a critical feature for novel models of TEPs to reproduce, for the simple reason that (as opposed to eg the time series waveform and component structure trial-averaged TEP) these are not a widely studied and widely replicated experimental result. We do look forward to investigating questions around natural frequency responses in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to my point (6) of the public review; if possible and not computationally challenging, I would perform more than 3 lesions over time. Instead of 20, 60, and 100ms, I would try to perform a more time-resolved analysis with one lesion every 5/10 ms, up to 200-300 ms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his suggestion and for proposing this interesting analysis to better disentangle the TMS-induced propagation pattern. For this reason, even though it was indeed quite computationally challenging, we have followed the flow suggested by the Reviewer’s comment, and have run the lesion analysis again for one subject with one lesion every 10ms, up to 200ms after the TMS pulse. The results of this analysis are detailed above in our response to the Editor’s question #24.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is not very clear how the authors performed the statistical comparison between real and simulated data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for his question and for giving us a chance to clarify how we performed the statistical comparison between real and simulated data.First of all, we have performed this comparison both in channel and source space. As for channel-level we have computed the Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values between empirical and model-generated TEP waveforms. We have used Pearson correlation coefficients also as the objective functions during the fitting process for computing the loss between empirical and simulated times series.</p><fig id="sa2fig17" position="float"><label>Author response image 17.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83232-sa2-fig17-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Then, in order to control for type I error, this result was compared to a null distribution constructed from 1000 time-wise random permutations, with a significance threshold set at p &lt; 0.05.

We have then collected these “fake/surrogate” Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values, and created a distribution. Finally, we have used this distribution for determining the cluster threshold as the 95th percentile of the cluster's surrogate distribution.Furthermore, in channel space, we also examined more holistic time series variability characteristics using the PCI (Casali et al. 2013), which was extracted from the simulated and the empirical TMS-EEG data, and Pearson correlations between the two computed. This was a complement to these TEP comparisons that emphasize matching of waveform shape and component timing.</p><p>All this information is reported in the manuscript as follows:</p><p>Line 664: “At the channel level, Pearson correlation coefficients and corresponding pvalues between empirical and model-generated TEP waveforms were computed for each subject.

Moreover we have also compared network-level time series from the simulated and empirical data extracted using the 7 Freesurfer surface-projected canonical Yeo network maps (Yeo et al. 2011).</p><p>Please find below the corresponding line in the manuscript:</p><p>Line 680: “Finally, and unlike the channel-level data, network-level comparisons of simulated vs. empirical activity patterns were made by averaging current densities over surface vertices at each point in time within each of the 7 Freesurfer surface projected canonical Yeo network maps (Yeo et al. 2011), and Pearson correlation coefficients and p-values between empirical and simulated network-level time series were again computed.”</p><p>We thank the Reviewer again for giving us the opportunity to clarify this point and we hope that we succeeded in this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, in figure 1A, empirical and simulated TEPs exhibit extremely different voltages, so simulated TEPs appear to be remarkably larger than empirical TEPs. How do the authors explain this discrepancy?

We have added the requested responses, plus some additional points (please see below):</p><p>Line 559: “Finally, this matrix was prepared numerically for physiological network modelling by rescaling values by first taking the matrix Laplacian, and second by scalar division of all entries by the matrix norm, which ensures that the matrix is linearly stable (i.e. all eigenvalues have negative real part except one eigenvalue which was zero). The Laplacian sets each row sum (i.e. each node’s weighted in-degree) to zero by subtracting row sums from diagonal, and has been used often in previous whole-brain modelling research (Abdelnour et al., 2018; Atasoy et al., 2016; Raj et al., 2022).”</p><p>Line 525: “The whole-brain model we fit to each of the 20 subjects’ TMS-EEG consists of 200 brain regions, connected by weights of the anatomical connectome. We set strong priors on the connection weights, such that individual fits allow for small adjustment of these values.</p><p>Specifically, a prior variance of 1/50 was set for every connection, which was determined empirically to provide a strong constraint but allow for some flexibility during the fitting process. Importantly, after fitting every subject, visual inspection was conducted to confirm that the (posterior mean) connection weight matrices retained the key topological features present in empirical neuroimaging measurements.</p><p>To obtain population-representative values for these connectivity priors, we ran diffusion weighted MRI tractography reconstructions across a large number of healthy young subjects and averaged the results.”</p><p>Line 664: “The algorithm proceeds by dividing a subject’s multi (in this case 64) -channel, 400ms long (100ms to +300ms post-stimulus), trial-averaged TMS-EEG TEP waveform into short (20 ms) nonoverlapping windows, termed batches. The total length of the simulation was 400ms which included -100ms of baseline (pre-TMS) and +300ms after stimulation injection. Prior to the start of the 100ms baseline, a 20ms burn-in was included, which allowed for the system to settle after the usual transient due to randomly selected initial conditions for the state variables.</p><p>Rolling through each batch in the time series sequentially, the JR model-simulated TEP ŷ was generated with the current set of parameter values, and its match to the empirical TEP y was calculated with the following mean-squared error (MSE) loss function.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision 2:</p><p>– I fail to recognize the distance-dependence in the subject-specific SCs. There are many strongly red-colored entries, not just the ones around the diagonal. It seems similar in the original SC, thus I would not take this as a key feature here to judge the fitted SCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the Figure that we attached in the previous round of revisions was not clear. Please find below the same Figure which includes the matrices of the posterior mean structural connectivity weights for all subjects from our analysis. As the Reviewer might notice we have replace “coolwarm” color scale with “viridis”. This prevents to have blue for small +ve numbers and white for some arbitrary small number above 1 (like it was before). From this new Figure it should be more clear that the SC’s parameter estimates differ only very slightly across subjects in their overall spatial structure.</p><p>We have included this information in the revised supplementary materials section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the visualization of the original SC matrix (Appendix 2- Figure 4), one can see that the range of values is [0:0.003], thus allowing a variance of 1/50=0.02 seems very extreme in my opinion.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point that gives us the opportunity to correct a typo in the text. Indeed 0.02 does not represent the variance on the structural connectome weights (which as the Reviewer pointed out would have been very extreme), but rather the variance on the gain parameter that encodes the deviation from the prior value, computed with the element wise matrix product SC<sub>updated</sub> = SC<sub>prior</sub> * exp(gain). This is implemented in the code at the following location:.</p><p>https://github.com/GriffithsLab/PyTepFit/blob/main/tepfit/fit.py#L333</p><p>As the Reviewer might seen from the code line (also reported below),</p><p>w = torch.exp(self.w_bb) * torch.tensor(self.sc, dtype=torch.float32)</p><p>Basically 0.02 variance was applied on the connection gain (variable name w_bb)and not on the structural connectome (variable name sc). If the prior mean of w_bb was 0, the most deviation of w_bb is about 2*std which is 2*sqrt(0.02)=0.28. Thus after taking exponential exp(0.28)=1.32, the maximum possible change is about a 32% of the original SC. Thus, our choices here represent strong priors on the SC matrix posterior values.</p><p>We have added this information to the manuscript (please see below):</p><p>Line 526: “We set strong priors on the connection weights, such that individual fits allow for small adjustment of these values. Specifically, a prior variance of 1/50 was set for every connection, which was determined empirically to provide a strong constraint but allow for some flexibility during the fitting process. This prior variance was applied to the connection gain and not directly to the connectivity weights, preventing the final fitted structural matrix to differ much from the original. Importantly, after fitting every subject, a visual inspection was conducted to confirm that the (posterior mean) connection weight matrices retained the key topological features present in empirical neuroimaging measurements.”</p><p>We hope that this is much clearer right now and thanks again for giving us the opportunity to provide a better explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Also for better comparison of the original SC with the subject-specific SCs, could the authors please use the same color bar limits for all SCs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a brand new Figure 4 in the new Appendix 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If the authors allowed such a 1/50 variance, did they only allow this variance in the positive direction or did their prior distribution also allow for negative entries in the SC?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this comment. No, negative SC entries are not permitted in our scheme. As noted in our response to the Reviewer’s previous comment, connection weights are updated using SC<sub>updated</sub> = SC<sub>prior</sub> * exp(gain). This is a standard formulation in parameter estimation schemes that ensures the numerically desirable property that values near zero in the gain matrix exert minimal change (since exp(0) = 1), and also that values cannot go negative (since the range of the function exp(x) is [ 0, +infinity]).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;We selected a prior variance for each of these connections of 1/50, which was determined empirically to provide a strong constraint but allow for some flexibility during the fitting process.&quot; What exactly is meant with „determined empirically&quot; here?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we acknowledge that this terminology may be unclear in the present context. By ‘determined empirically’ here we simply mean that we selected this number as one that was found to work well in terms of balancing constraint and flexibility through the manual, partially exploratory process of developing the model and algorithm. The variance is a model hyper-parameter and it is learned to experience during the fitting process. We know from previous studies in general what is the parameters range of the Jansen and Ritt model and how the optimization algorithm works which give us an insight on how to set up the prior/initial conditions on mean and the variance. Such priors simply determine how far you want the fitted SC from the original SC each step. In our case, as specified before, we added this variance to the connection gain and not directly to the SC. Moreover by adding the exponential function in front we assure that all the values will be close to 1 meaning that the final SC was not diverging that much from the original prio</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;It can be seen here that the distribution of the norm distances scores (see image below) acceptable, indicating a relatively small deviation from the prior connectivity weights.&quot; It would be much better if the authors describe in words what they calculated here instead of posting the code as a justification of acceptability of the norm distance scores.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize – in general we find posting the code to be most helpful in specifying exactly what we have computed, but we appreciate that this is not necessarily the case for all readers.</p><p>We have calculated the norm distances between the original (initial condition) and the individually fitted SC matrices as the Frobenius norm between the upper triangles of the two matrices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision 4: The x axis ‚brain regions' should probably be relabeled and also add numbers to the ticks please.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if the figure was confusing.

One solution to deal with this alarming variability would be to please always run the algorithm 100 times (at least 10 I would suggest) and take the mean of its distribution as the final optimized parameter in order to increase robustness of the presented fitting results.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the Reviewer for this important point and for giving us the opportunity to disentangle the variability in the optimized parameters. We respectfully disagree with the Reviewer’s comment, since we strongly believe that this variability is far away from being considered alarming. We refer the Reviewer to our comment below regarding ranges and posteriors for elaboration of this. It is also important to mention that, at the end of the day, the scope of the paper was testing the physiological origin of the recurrent activity induced by TMS for 4 different conditions (1 control with no lesion and 3 experimental where the lesion has been applied at different times). For this central comparison, the model parameters are equal in all the 4 different conditions (since we fit the data for no lesion first and then re-run with lesions applied), and so does not affect the results. Finally, we would also like to add in this regard that the for final fitted parameters (the ones reported in table 1 and that we used for running our simulations) we already took the average of the last 100 batches (an algorithmic detail which we have not emphasized previously), which is in fact similar to the Reviewer’s suggestion here. We have added this information to the manuscript (please see below):</p><p>Line 693: “When the batch window reaches the end of the TEP time series, it returns to the start and repeats until convergence. When the optimization was completed, the average value for every parameter was computed using the last 100 batches and then used for running the simulations. For an overview of all parameters used in the model, please refer to Appendix 2-figure 4 and Supplementary File 1. For a complete description of the parameter estimation algorithm, please see (Griffiths et al., 2022).”</p><p>We hope that the Reviewer would understand that re-running all the subjects for two independent dataset 100 times and re-doing all the Figures and statistical analyses from scratch would represent a huge amount of effort which is partially not in line with the aforementioned scope of the paper: testing the physiological origin of the TMS-evoked potentials. Moreover, the solution we have already implemented is similar to the one proposed by the Reviewer’s comment and should control for large variability in fitted parameters’ values. We hope that the Reviewer would embrace our vision also considering all the effort we made for re-doing the analyses using the other two datasets coming from Fecchio-Pigolini’s paper (low and high voltage motor-evoked potential data). We wish to thank again the Reviewer for their suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;For completeness, the prior means for each parameter are also shown as vertical red lines. Shown below are parameter estimate distribution plots for a single subject, repeated 100 times.

The red lines were the parameter value chosen for this subject so the average of the last 100 batches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– &quot;Reassuringly, these histograms are approximately normally distributed, and have a tight range of variation that spans only a few percent of the magnitude of each parameter&quot; Even though the variation spans only a few percent of the magnitude of each parameter, the variation for this single subject (e.g. for parameter a: [94:102]) spans nearly over the whole range of optimal parameter values that were fitted over all subjects (e.g. for parameter a: [92:102], see Appendix 2 – Table 1) – or even a larger range than the one fitted over all subjects as in the case of c1. Thus, all results regarding individual variability should be interpreted with caution. The plot for c4 is probably mislabeled as no subject has optimal values in this range according to Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this comment, which indicates a close and thoughtful inspection of our results that is much appreciated. It is important to remember here that because we are employing Bayesian inference, the proper interpretation of the fitted parameters is as probability distributions, and that these are defined not only by the mean and support (i.e. range) but also their shape – how tightly distributed they are around the mean, as determined by the variance parameters. The fact that a small number of repeat runs arrive at an estimate of the mean that lie in the extremes of the ranges noted (e.g. [94:102] for a) is entirely expected given that the posterior variances are non-zero (i.e. there is some degree of spread in the posterior distributions). The Reviewer’s statement that ‘results regarding individual variability should be interpreted with caution’, made on the basis of the ranges in the figures and tables provided, is correct to the extent that the posterior distributions are uniform (i.e. flat), in which case the extreme values on the left and right hand side of the ranges would have equal significance to the mean. Whilst (from our experience) flat posteriors are not uncommon when Bayesian inference is employed in physiological modelling applications, this is not the case in our results. We therefore stand by our conclusion that the reported variability in estimated synaptic parameters \can account for differences the TMSevoked potentials across subjects, and given their physiological nature provide insight into mechanisms that are difficult to measure in-vivo in humans.</p><p>Regarding the Reviewer’s comment on plot c4, we wish to apologize and it was indeed incorrect.

For this reason the reader should critically interpret such results.</p><p>We apologize for disagreeing with Reviewer’s vision but we really hope he/she will allow us to keep that figure/results in the main manuscript because we firmly believe that section represents an valuable part of our work that can potentially have some value for future research even though is not corrected for multiple comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done a good job in responding to the reviewer comments.

We agree with the Reviewer’s comment and strongly believe that the manuscript has significatively improved and for that we wish to express our deep gratitude to the Reviewer because it would not be possible without his knowledge and expertise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Yet, the first fundamental issue mentioned in my previous review has not been addressed (see point 19 of previous review). The authors mentioned in their response that they &quot;believe that [testing different areas] is beyond the scope of the present manuscript…&quot;. I respectfully disagree. In my opinion, the interpretation of the results could be severely biased by the stimulation of one single area (primary motor cortex – M1), having strong efferent connections with periphery. To better clarify my point, by stimulating only M1 it is not possible to conclude that late TEP components are &quot;driven by the recurrent activity within the rest of network&quot; (as stated in the introduction); or at least this is not the only possible interpretation. Indeed, TMS of M1 – especially at Resting Motor Threshold (RMT), as in Biabani et al., or above RMT, as in Fecchio, Pigorini et al. (Experiment_1) – most often leads to muscle twitch, which in turn, induces proprioceptive (sensory) feedback from the periphery. So, TEP components under these experimental conditions are inherently confounded by the peripheral twitch induced by the stimulation. How can the authors address this problem?</p><p>In my view, the most straightforward solution implies including other areas in the main analysis (as suggested in my previous review); however, I understand that this implies a huge amount of work, encompassing &quot;diffusion-weighted MRI analysis, TMS-EEG analysis, e-field modeling, deep learning for parameter optimization and neural mass model implementations…&quot;. I also understand that &quot;this question is among the scientific priorities&quot; of the authors, which &quot;are currently working on expanding this model further to other stimulation sites&quot;.</p><p>So in my view, other two – less time consuming – possible solutions to disentangle this problem are:</p><p>1) The authors could control whether TEP associated with high voltage and low voltage Motor Evoked Potentials are associated with different late components in the simulated data (data available in Fecchio, Pigorini 2017 – Experiment_2).</p><p>2) The authors need to significantly rework the main message of the manuscript by incorporating this confound in the authors' interpretation of their main finding (e.g. the title should be changed because late components could be recurrent large scale network dynamics, but could be also feedback from the periphery…).</p><p>I find this second option overly detrimental to the overall significance of the study and I strongly suggest the authors to implement the first in a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the Reviewer for raising this important potential confounding factor. We hoped to have addressed this pivotal point in the previous round of revisions by rerunning the analyses in a completely independent dataset ((Fecchio et al., 2017)- https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Data_for_Fecchio_Pigorini_et_al_/4970900/1">)</ext-link>.</p><p>As the Reviewer correctly pointed out, even though we were able to replicate the results we obtained with the Rogash group’s dataset, this did not allow us fully to reject the null hypothesis that our previous results were due to proprioceptive (sensory) feedback from the periphery. We thank the Reviewer for understanding and for sharing our perspective regarding including other areas in the main analysis, which in our opinion would have indeed been out of the scope of the current work. However, we agree that this point needed to be disentangled somehow, and we strongly believe that the Reviewer’s suggestion #1 is the best way to address this potential confounding factor. Indeed we are entirely on the same page as the Reviewer since we strongly believe that suggestion #2 would have decreased the impact of our manuscript.</p><p>For this reason we have re-run the analysis for the low voltage Motor Evoked Potentials as suggested by Reviewer’s comment.</p><p>Please see the new Appendix 2-figure 7 showing the Empirical (upper row) and simulated (lower row) TMS-EEG butterfly plots with scalp topographies for all 6 subjects of the Fecchio and Pigorini’s dataset – but this time using the low voltage data. Results show a robust recovery of individual empirical TEP patterns in model-generated activity EEG time series.</p><p>In accordance with the flow suggested by the Reviewer’s comment, we have also re-run the analysis for the virtual lesion approach using the low voltage data of Fecchio-Pigorini dataset. Please see Appendix 2-figure 9 (Panel B), which shows how removing recurrent connections from stimulated target nodes suppresses their late TEP activity in the same way as found for both the Rogash group dataset and the high voltage trials of Fecchio-Pigorini dataset (Panel A).</p><p>We edited the Appendix 2 Control analyses section accordingly:</p><p>“Appendix 2-figure 6, 7 shows empirical and fitted TEP waveforms and selected topography maps for the entire group of the Fecchio, Pigorini et al. dataset (Fecchio et al., 2017) using both high (Appendix 2-figure 6) and low (Appendix 2-figure 7) voltage motor-evoked potentials data.</p><p>Similarly to the analyses for the Rogasch’s dataset, it is visually evident in these figures that the model accurately captures several individually-varying features of these time series, such as the timing of the 50 ms and 100-120 ms TEP components, and the extent to which they are dominated by left/right and temporal/parietal/frontal channels.”</p><p>“Shown in Appendix 2-figure 8 are effects for one representative subject of the Fecchio, Pigorini et al. dataset (Fecchio et al., 2017) on the simulated TEP of virtual lesions to recurrent incoming connections of the main activated regions at 20 ms, 50 ms, and 100 ms after single-pulse TMS stimulation of left M1.</p><p>Similarly to the analyses for the Rogasch’s dataset, the network-level effects were evaluated statistically by extracting dSPM loadings from the source activity maps for each of the 7 canonical Yeo networks (Yeo et al., 2011) and entering them into an ANOVA with factors of NETWORK and TIME OF DAMAGE.</p><p>For the high voltage motor evoked potentials data (Appendix 2-figure 8A), a significant main effects were found for both TIME OF DAMAGE (F(6,30) = 229.87, p&lt;0.0001, η2p = 0.97) and NETWORK (F(6,18) = 12.08, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.71) – indicating that the effects of virtual lesions vary depending on both the time administered and the site administered to, as well as the combination of these factors (significant interaction NETWORK*TIME OF DAMAGE (F(3,18) = 10.26, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.67)).</p><p>For the low voltage motor evoked potentials data (Appendix 2-figure 8B), a significant main effects were found for both TIME OF DAMAGE (F(6,30) = 204.07, p&lt;0.0001, η2p = 0.95) and NETWORK (F(6,18) = 11.25, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.68) – indicating that the effects of virtual lesions vary depending on both the time administered and the site administered to, as well as the combination of these factors (significant interaction NETWORK*TIME OF DAMAGE (F(3,18) = 9.58, p &lt; 0.0001, η2p = 0.64)).”</p><p>The fact that the same results were found for both the high and the low voltage motor evoked potentials data indicates that the results observed are not affected by proprioceptive sensory feedback from the periphery.</p><p>We strongly believe that with this additional analyses we have re-run on the low voltage Motor Evoked Potentials helped us to reject the null hypothesis that the recurrence results we reported using the high voltage datasets (by Rogash and Fecchio-Pigorini) could be affected by proprioceptive sensory feedback from the periphery. We definitely agree that this suggestion made by the Reviewer improves the quality of the manuscript and for this we wish to express, once again, our deepest gratitude!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Apart of this main issue, I also found a couple of issues the authors may want to address before publication.</p><p>1) Perhaps my previous comment about PCI was not clear enough. I did not say that &quot;PCI should never be used for evaluating model fit&quot;; and I fully understand that fitting &quot;could be done with any metric at all that can be computed from empirical and simulated time series&quot;. However, while it is true that &quot;the model may be considered a good one to the extent that it captures multiple data features of physiological interest that are reliably quantifiable&quot;, it is also true that some metrics are better than others to capture similarities among different time series. As mentioned in my previous review, &quot;two completely different wave shapes could in principle have exactly the same PCI value&quot;. The authors can find an example for this in Decision letter image 1. Top and bottom panels report the butterfly plot (black) and the channel under the coil obtained by stimulating (in the same subject) occipital and prefrontal cortices, respectively. In both cases PCI is 0.47, but the wave shapes highlight major differences both in time and space which are not captured by the single PCI scalar. I hope this example clarifies my former concern and suggest the authors to report metrics other than PCI in the main figures (Pearson correlation coefficients are more than enough).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for taking the time to elaborate more on his perplexity on using the Perturbational Complexity Index (PCI,(Casali et al., 2013)) as a metric for evaluating the similarity between real and simulated data. We absolutely agree with the Reviewer and thanks for providing an image with a compelling example of how PCI value can be misleading in evaluating the wave shape. That being said, we respectfully disagree that this should drive us to remove panel D from Figure 2. We believe that Figure 2 in its current state offers a compelling and comprehensive overview of the goodness-of-fit at the level of channels. Indeed, panel A shows 3 representative subjects waveforms for empirical and simulated time series. From their comments it seems the reviewer may have missed this, but Panel B does also show the Pearson correlation coefficients between simulated and empirical TMS-EEG time series for each subject. Panel C shows the corresponding stats (Time-wise permutation tests) of the Pearson correlation coefficient scores. Only Panel D reports PCI values. Moreover, in the Appendix 2-figure 1 we provided the empirical and simulated TMS-EEG waveforms for every study subject, reinforcing the demonstrations in Figure 2 that the model-generated EEG activity time series achieve robust recovery of individual subjects’ empirical TEP propagation patterns. The same strategy has been used for showing the goodness of fit for an independent dataset. We strongly believe that figure 2 in its current state provides a full overview of (1) TEP waveforms (Panel A and Appendix 2figure 1), (2) Pearson correlation coefficients (Panel B and C) and only at the end PCI scores which is a small (and marginal) part of Figure 2. We would agree with the Reviewer if we only have used PCI to justify and evaluate the goodness of fit but – as specified above – we have provided a comprehensive overview including multiple quantitative metrics as well as extensive qualitative visual assessments. As part of this combination, and given that it is a well-known measure in the analysis of TMS-EEG TEPs, we feel that including PCI as a small part of the goodness-of-fit assessment adds value to the analysis.</p><p>For this reason, we kindly ask the Reviewer to include PCI as a small part of Figure 2 (Panel D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Something must be wrong with the axes in Figure S5. See Decision letter image 2 the authors can find a plot with the correct time and voltage scales for each subject. For example, in Subj_1 the first peak is a 4 ms and not at 38 ms (as in Figure S5).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize and we also thank the Reviewer for pointing this out. It was only an issue with axis x that we have promptly corrected in the new Figure S5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to my former comment on the original manuscript: &quot;Figure 2B shows a correlation that can be partially driven by the spectral content of the waveforms. It could be relevant to verify whether these correlations are significant with respect to a comparable null hypothesis (e.g. IAAFT, or correlating different empirical and simulated sessions).&quot; I mean that correlation analysis could be strongly affected by low frequencies (characterized by higher power). Thus, a statistical test accounting for different frequencies (e.g., IAAFT) could be preferable (yet not mandatory at this stage).</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to thank the Reviewer for further explaining this point that was not clear to us in the previous round of revisions, and we think it is a constructive comment. The goal of Figure 2 in the manuscript is to “prepare the field” for exploring the main subject of the paper: examining the origins of recurrent activity in TEPs. We do agree that correlation coefficients can be misleading at times if assumptions are made about equivalency of frequency content that are not checked. We believe we have provided enough information to confirm, at least informally, that there is not a clear discrepancy in frequency content between the empirical and simulated waveforms, as is clear from the comprehensive overview of TEP waveforms given in Figure 2 and the supplementary materials.</p><p>With this being said, we will take into account this possibility for further improving our model in future work, and perhaps such comparisons can be potentially included as a part of the model fitting process. We hope that the Reviewer would agree that at this stage implementing this further analysis would require a great deal of effort, in a direction outside the main focus of the paper, and as such would not impact its main message regarding recurrent activity.</p><p>References</p><p>Abdelnour F, Dayan M, Devinsky O, Thesen T, Raj A. 2018.
