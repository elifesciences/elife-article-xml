It is widely accepted that membrane voltage potentiates aminoglycoside activity, which is ascribed to voltage-dependent drug uptake. In this paper, we measured the response of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> treated with aminoglycosides and discovered that the bactericidal action arises not from the downstream effects of voltage-dependent drug uptake, but rather directly from dysregulated membrane potential. In the absence of voltage, aminoglycosides are taken into cells and exert bacteriostatic effects by inhibiting translation. However, cell killing was immediate upon re-polarization. The hyperpolarization arose from altered ATP flux, which induced a reversal of the F1Fo-ATPase to hydrolyze ATP and generated the deleterious voltage. Heterologous expression of an ATPase inhibitor completely eliminated bactericidal activity, while loss of the F-ATPase reduced the electrophysiological response to aminoglycosides. Our data support a model of voltage-induced death, and separates aminoglycoside bacteriostasis and bactericide in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aminoglycosides</kwd><kwd>voltage</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>ATP</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gilliam Fellowship for advanced study</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruni</surname><given-names>Giancarlo Noe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005665</institution-id><institution>Kinship Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Searle Scholar Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kralj</surname><given-names>Joel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM065103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruni</surname><given-names>Giancarlo Noe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2GM123458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kralj</surname><given-names>Joel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aminoglycosides are a class of antibiotics that can kill <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by building up internal voltage through disrupting the normal consumption of ATP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aminoglycosides are a potent class of translation inhibitor antibiotics with a broad activity spectrum. Despite a long history in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krause et al., 2016</xref>), their exact mechanism of action remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Keren et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, aminoglycosides must cross the outer membrane and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>), into the cytoplasm where they can exert their bactericidal effect which requires binding to the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 1987</xref>). The kinetics of uptake into the cytoplasm have been extensively studied and occur in three steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>). An ionic interaction between the polycationic aminoglycosides and the outer membrane of the bacterial cell induces a disruption of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hancock et al., 1981</xref>), and allows the aminoglycoside to ionically associate with the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan and Van Den Elzen, 1977</xref>). The next step is known as the energy-dependent phase I (EDP-I) and occurs almost instantaneously upon aminoglycoside treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Muir et al., 1984</xref>). This portion is noted as energy dependent because both respiration inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leviton et al., 1995</xref>) and differential carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Young, 1985</xref>) reduced uptake. EDP-I is thought to be the step at which the aminoglycoside enters the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Young, 1985</xref>), is concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan and Van Den Elzen, 1977</xref>), and occurs in cells that are resistant to or tolerant of aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryan and Van den Elzen, 1976</xref>). Following EDP-I is EDP-II, which only occurs in aminoglycoside-sensitive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryan and Van den Elzen, 1976</xref>), is thought to be essential for the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides, and requires respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryan and Van den Elzen, 1976</xref>). Throughout these early studies, uptake of the aminoglycosides was often treated as synonymous with bactericidal activity.</p><p>Proposed bactericidal mechanisms all stem from this consensus theory of aminoglycoside uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leviton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohanski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>). Once aminoglycosides are inside the cell, several competing theories exist to explain bactericidal activity including membrane breakdown from mistranslated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Busse et al., 1992</xref>), reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohanski et al., 2007</xref>) (ROS), and a positive feedback of drug uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leviton et al., 1995</xref>), although there is debate around each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohanski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraimow et al., 1991</xref>). Despite this debate, there is broad agreement upon two important points. The first is that the uptake mechanism, and therefore the resulting bactericidal activity, is voltage dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damper and Epstein, 1981</xref>). That is, bactericidal activity occurs after uptake, and that uptake is intrinsically tied to membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>). This makes sense given the ample evidence of broken respiration protecting bacteria from aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Young, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCollister et al., 2011</xref>). The second point is that this voltage induced uptake is responsible for mistranslation of protein upon aminoglycoside binding, which in turn creates the membrane breakdown essential for bactericidal activity. These pores, or the ROS produced in their occurrence, are thought to be responsible for the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohanski et al., 2008</xref>). New techniques offer the ability to study the effects of aminoglycosides and perhaps resolve some debated aspects of their mechanism of action.</p><p>Single cell, fluorescent imaging offers a means to shed light on the effects of antibiotic exposure with high resolution in space and time. Improvements in microscope hardware enable automated live cell imaging while resolving the responses of individual bacteria. This hardware can be coupled with genetically encoded, or chemical fluorescent sensors that report bacterial voltage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kralj et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Prindle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stratford et al., 2019</xref>), calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruni et al., 2017</xref>), and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tantama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yaginuma et al., 2015</xref>), providing a lens to explore the long-term effects of antibiotic exposure. Recently, live cell voltage imaging of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> revealed the importance of membrane potential in response to translation inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). These new tools highlight the importance of membrane potential controlling bacterial physiology, and our ability to now study electrophysiology at the single-cell level.</p><p>Despite the debate on the bactericidal mechanism of aminoglycosides, there is broad agreement that bacterial membrane potential plays a critical role. In this paper, we sought to investigate the influence of membrane potential in mediating bactericide upon treatment with aminoglycosides. We used live cell microscopy to maintain high spatial and temporal resolution while also resolving any heterogeneity within the population. We found that lethal concentrations of aminoglycosides-induced voltage hyperpolarization leading to large fluctuations in cytoplasmic calcium that persisted for &gt;48 hr after treatment. We found these transients were correlated with the inability of cells to regrow, giving us a technique to measure the onset of cell death in real time at the single-cell level. We found evidence that the transients arise from decreased ribosomal consumption of ATP leading to a reversal of the F1Fo-ATPase. The voltage hyperpolarization, in tandem with mistranslated proteins in the membrane, induced the bactericidal action. Our model proposes a new mechanism which links the chemical energy state of the cell with membrane potential dysregulation that can lead to death.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Voltage is not necessary for aminoglycoside uptake or inner membrane pore formation in <italic>E. coli</italic> but is required for bactericidal activity</title><p>The proton ionophore cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) dissipates voltage gradients, and is known to protect <italic>E. coli</italic> against the bactericidal activity and EDP-II uptake of aminoglycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis, 1987</xref>).

Untreated cells showed a majority of 70S particles, while addition of aminoglycosides caused a large fraction of ribosomes to split into 30S and 50S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Unexpectedly, ribosomes in aminoglycoside-treated cells showed equal dissociation in the presence or absence of CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), despite the dramatic difference in drug activity. Aminoglycoside treatment at pH 6, which also has reduced membrane potential (see Materials and methods), showed bacteriostatic activity and ribosomal dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to chemical perturbations, naturally occurring mutations in bacterial populations can lead to protection against aminoglycosides arising from a decrease in membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Damper and Epstein, 1981</xref>). These mutations often occur in the electron transport chain and reduce aminoglycoside uptake while concomitantly increasing survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>). Mutations of genes in the <italic>nuo</italic> operon have reduced uptake and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>), but have equivalent aminoglycoside-induced ribosomal dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Although uptake of aminoglycosides in the absence of membrane potential has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fraimow et al., 1991</xref>), the equivalent effect on ribosomal fraction abundance in <italic>E. coli,</italic> independent of voltage, had not been observed previously to our knowledge.</p><p>The clear uptake of aminoglycosides in the absence or alteration of membrane voltage suggested mistranslated proteins that induce membrane pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohanski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>) could also occur. We measured the uptake of propidium iodide (PI), a membrane-impermeable DNA-binding fluorescent dye, in the presence of aminoglycosides. The aminoglycoside-treated population showed increasing PI fluorescence as compared to untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating a loss of membrane integrity which correlated with the kinetics of cell death when measured by CFUs. Pre-treating cells with CCCP, however, showed a similar aminoglycoside-induced increase in PI fluorescence, despite the switch from bactericidal to bacteriostatic activity. Chloramphenicol, a bacteriostatic translation inhibitor, induced only small increases in PI fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Fluorescently labeled gentamicin texas-red (GTTR) also showed an increase in concentration in the presence or absence of CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), although the increases after 1 hr could be due to a destabilized membrane, similar to the results with PI. These data suggested that protein mistranslation and membrane destabilization occur in the absence of membrane potential and are not sufficient to cause bactericidal activity. Given the discrepancy between CFUs, ribosomal dissociation, and PI uptake, we hypothesized voltage led to bactericide through mechanisms other than drug uptake. We therefore considered if bactericidal activity could arise through a combination of the mistranslated protein-induced pore formation and membrane hyperpolarization. In order to test this hypothesis, we turned to single-cell measurements of bacterial electrophysiology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Voltage and calcium exhibit altered electrophysiological flux in response to aminoglycosides</title><p>Fluorescent sensors of voltage and calcium have been used to monitor electrophysiology in bacteria at the single-cell level with high time resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stratford et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruni et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sirec et al., 2019</xref>).

To visualize the transients across a population, a moving standard deviation was calculated for each cell, and then averaged across all cells. This mean of the moving standard deviation (taken from 30 to 500 cells) was considered one biological replicate, and the average and standard deviation of three biological replicates is then plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This metric will depend strongly on the microscope system used, and thus requires relative comparisons of treated versus control under otherwise identical imaging conditions. We defined a drug-induced calcium transient as any cell that showed a moving standard deviation (SD) &gt;7 fold above untreated cells for &gt;40 min. The GCaMP moving SD metric can separate treated and untreated populations of <italic>E. coli</italic>. All aminoglycosides tested exhibited a concentration-dependent onset of calcium transients, as well as significantly increased GCaMP SD, but other bacteriostatic or bactericidal antibiotics had neither (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Our measurements do not rule out the possibility of other ions moving across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubin and Davis, 1961</xref>), and indeed we see that proton concentrations as measured by the red fluorescent pH indicator, pHuji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) also show transients, but their initial amplitude is much smaller than the calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). A lack of sufficient sensors prohibited us from measuring other ions at these temporal and spatial scales.</p><p>Given the observation that CCCP and low pH eliminated the calcium transients, we hypothesized that these large fluorescent changes were a product of a more polarized membrane potential, which would be consistent with the positive feedback of drug uptake model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryan and Van Den Elzen, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 1986</xref>).

Cells treated with kanamycin showed a sharp increase in TMRM fluorescence after 80 min, corresponding to a change of −72 mV after 2.5 hr (see Materials and methods). Assuming a resting potential of −150 mV the treated cells would have a membrane voltage of −222 mV. This observation is consistent with an aminoglycoside-induced change in membrane potential occurring at the same time as the calcium transients.</p><p>If aberrant voltage induced the calcium transients, dissipating the voltage would eliminate the transients. Cells expressing GCaMP6 were treated with CCCP and compared to kanamycin exposure alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). CCCP-treated cells showed no increase in GCaMP6f SD, or individual calcium transients. Cells treated at pH 6 also showed no increase in calcium transients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and showed no hyperpolarization measured by TMRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4B</xref>).

Fluorescence measurements were taken under continuous flow during the addition, then removal, of kanamycin. As expected, antibiotic exposure induced large calcium transients in many cells. After 4 hr of kanamycin exposure, medium without drug was added, and ~2% of cells reinitiated cell division (recovered cells, 35/1727 cells, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>).

We hypothesized that mistranslated proteins in the plasma membrane created an ionic imbalance in polarized cells leading to the observed calcium transients. To test our hypothesis, we incubated GCaMP6 expressing <italic>E. coli</italic> with PI in the presence of aminoglycoside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The population average showed a smoothly increasing level of PI uptake upon aminoglycoside exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), similar to our earlier data. However, the GCaMP6 moving SD increased well before appreciable PI uptake. Individual cells showed calcium transients preceded PI entry into the cytoplasm, and that PI often increased in very large bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, pores large enough to accommodate PI occurred after aminoglycoside-induced hyperpolarization and catastrophic calcium transients, suggesting bactericidal activity occurred prior to pore formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Voltage toggles between bactericidal and bacteriostatic activity in aminoglycoside-treated cells</title><p>The data above showed that aminoglycoside uptake, ribosome dissociation, and mistranslated protein can occur without membrane potential.

This was hypothesized to be associated with bacterial energetic investment in protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieß et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, a reduction in ribosome concentration has been annotated as a means to protect persister cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2015</xref>). We reasoned that the sudden change in energetic demand from the loss of a large fraction of 70S translating ribosomes could free up ATP and GTP to be used in other processes. To connect this shift in energetics to aminoglycoside-induced voltage dysregulation, we considered how <italic>E. coli</italic> generate a membrane voltage in aerobic environments. In the presence of glucose, <italic>E. coli</italic> use glycolysis to power the NADH dehydrogenase assembly (Complex I) and induce a proton motive force (PMF). The F1Fo-ATPase then depletes the PMF to generate ATP. However, the F1Fo-ATPase can be run in reverse, using ATP hydrolysis to generate a membrane voltage, which occurs in anaerobic conditions to power flagellar rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yasuda et al., 1998</xref>). We hypothesized that aminoglycosides increased cellular ATP flux through non-ribosomal sinks, leading to hyperpolarization via the combined activity of the NADH dehydrogenase and a reversed F1Fo-ATPase.</p><p>We initially measured ATP concentration in <italic>E. coli</italic> using a ratiometric fluorescent ATP sensor, mRuby-iATPSnFR1.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lobas et al., 2019</xref>). Gentamicin treatment increased the 488/561 nm fluorescence ratio by 50% within 2 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Cells at low pH or in the presence of CCCP also showed ATP increases expected from ribosome dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Other non-aminoglycoside translation inhibitors which exhibit bacteriostatic activity also showed increasing ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with our observation that recovered cells did not exhibit calcium transients, cells that recovered after 4 hr of kanamycin treatment had lower ATP compared to arrested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We attempted to quantify the absolute change in ATP concentration in populations of cells, as our single-cell data indicated that ATP levels were increased when cells were treated with aminoglycosides. Using a luminescence-based assay, we determined that steady state levels of ATP in gentamicin-treated <italic>E. coli</italic> were significantly lower than untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>) in the first half hour of treatment, which was inconsistent with our iATPSnFR single-cell data. This data is, however, consistent with an increased ATP flux through consumers other than ribosomes, such as the F1Fo-ATPase. We suspected that the genetically encoded ATP sensor can act as a buffer absorbing some of this ATP flux from a loss of translation, while the luminescence-based assay measures absolute values after the cells are permeabilized. This interpretation is consistent with recent results which show an increase in an alarmone with an ATP precursor after aminoglycoside treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ji et al., 2019</xref>).

(2) Aminoglycosides bind to ribosomes and (3) in the process create mistranslated protein and inhibit translation for a majority of translating ribosomes. These mistranslated proteins are implicated in creating pores in the inner membrane that occur regardless of polarization. Pore formation appears to be an essential step in aminoglycoside-mediated bactericide that distinguishes it from other translation inhibitors. With the loss of translation, (4) ATP is more readily available to other cellular processes. This in turn causes (5) ATPases (including the F1Fo ATPase) to increase their activity given the greater accessibility of ATP, causing the F1Fo ATPase to hyperpolarize cells. This hyperpolarization is required for the (6) bactericidal activity to occur in our observations. Cellular processes including the electron transport chain’s dehydrogenase activity, as well as the energetic state of the cell help determine the degree to which this bactericidal activity occurs. Specifically, higher respiration and carbon sources that contribute the most ATP to the cell (glucose) are the most detrimental prior states <italic>E. coli</italic> can experience before aminoglycoside treatment.

Knockouts from the proton conducting Fo domain (atpB, atpE, atpF) as well as atpG had increased CFUs and reduced calcium transients compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> top), and all tested ATPase knockouts showed gentamicin-induced ATP accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Interestingly knockouts of atpC (ε-subunit), which has increased gentamicin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brynildsen et al., 2013</xref>), and atpH (δ-subunit) both decreased the time to calcium transient onset and reduced CFUs faster than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref> bottom). AtpC biases the motor in the direction of ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), while atpH acts as a filter for proton conduction through the Fo domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelbrecht and Junge, 1990</xref>), thus the knockouts of these proteins would improve proton conduction through the F1Fo-ATPase thereby increasing membrane potential that can be generated by this pump, which are consistent with knockouts showing more rapid cell death. Furthermore, gentamicin-treated Fo domain knockouts reduced hyperpolarization while, as their function predicts, atpC and atpH increased hyperpolarization relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Completely eliminating the F1Fo-ATPase (∆<italic>unc</italic> operon – strain DK8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klionsky et al., 1984</xref>) also showed reduced calcium transients as compared to a strain with intact F1Fo-ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Finally, expression of a virulence factor from <italic>Salmonella,</italic> mgtC, eliminated the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). MgtC is an inhibitor of the F1Fo-ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2013</xref>), and aids in <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection and survival at low magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanc-Potard and Groisman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pontes et al., 2016</xref>).

Based on our model and previous data, hyperpolarization enhanced aminoglycoside killing in the absence of other protective effects, yet both of these strains show protected phenotypes, indicating that the loss or inhibition of the F-ATPase protected these strains relative to wildtype populations.

This evidence included voltage-dependent aminoglycoside uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leviton et al., 1995</xref>) and cell death correlated with the citric acid cycle and carbon source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allison et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Su et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meylan et al., 2017</xref>). Metabolic changes can likewise induce changes in membrane voltage and the overall proton motive force. The relationship between metabolism, proton motive force, and membrane potential has been typically seen as being requisite to the <italic>uptake</italic> of aminoglycosides, which was synonymous with cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nichols and Young, 1985</xref>). Our work has shown that membrane voltage is not essential for drug uptake, but rather the voltage is required to initiate the bactericidal mechanism after ribosome dissociation. Although we show a correlation between the ionic imbalance (calcium and pH transients) and cell death, we did not definitively prove they cause cell death, but rather they provide a convenient metric for cell death at the single-cell level. The GCaMP signal in our hands is certainly more accurate than PI uptake. Our data also does not preclude a mechanism of voltage enhanced aminoglycoside uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ezraty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Taber et al., 1987</xref>). Rather our work suggests that the uptake of aminoglycosides in the absence of a membrane potential is sufficient to create intracellular conditions, including ribosome dissociation, metabolic dysfunction, and pore formation, that allow the presence of a membrane potential to exert bactericidal effects. Our data is also consistent with other translation inhibitors hyperpolarizing membrane potential correlated with subsequent cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). We provide evidence that one mechanism by which this hyperpolarization can occur is through F1Fo-ATPase activity. We observed enhanced aminoglycoside killing in the strain atpC::kanR, which is missing the F1Fo-ATPase ε-subunit that typically biases the rotor in the direction of ATP synthesis. This observation suggests that F1Fo-ATPases with a higher likelihood of ATP hydrolysis enhance aminoglycoside killing, which would stem from the already ribosome-related dysregulation of metabolism. We observed similar enhanced aminoglycoside killing in the strain atpH::kanR that encodes the δ-subunit of the F1Fo-ATPase, which is able to block proton conduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engelbrecht and Junge, 1990</xref>) and ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Xiao and Penefsky, 1994</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the difference between bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides compared to the bacteriostatic activity of other translation inhibitors may be the lack of the mistranslated membrane proteins causing pore formation. We hypothesize this mechanism kills bacteria by eliminating ion homeostasis in the presence of a membrane potential and pores that can leak ions. However, we currently lack tools to be able to induce the calcium transients in the absence of aminoglycosides, although perhaps channel rhodopsins will be able to mimic these effects.</p><p>One fascinating facet that remains to be explored is the period after aminoglycoside treatment that cells cannot divide but remain metabolically active for at least 2 days. If these arrested cells can still export quorum-sensing molecules, they could send paracrine signals to untreated cells, and influence their behavior. This observation became clear by using sensitive genetically encoded fluorescent proteins, and these tools open up a new avenue to study the long-term effects of antibiotic treatment on cells and mixed cultures. Another curious corollary is the observation that protonophores enhance aminoglycoside killing in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maiden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maiden et al., 2019</xref>), which stands in opposition to our observation that protonophores protect planktonic <italic>E. coli</italic>. The differences driven by these species specific and context-dependent observations will hopefully add to a more complete picture of aminoglycoside activity in multiple bacterial species.</p><p>The model of aminoglycoside-induced death proposed from this work is consistent with evidence from other groups previous work, requires the presence of membrane pores and membrane potential to drive aminoglycoside bactericidal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Aminoglycosides enter the cell through an unknown mechanism, possibly through channels such as mscL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wray et al., 2016</xref>), which occurs long before a loss of membrane integrity. Once aminoglycosides enter the cell they bind ribosomes, disrupt a majority of translating 70S particles and cause mistranslation of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kohanski et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubin and Davis, 1961</xref>). As soon as ribosome disruption occurs, respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lobritz et al., 2015</xref>) and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levin et al., 2017</xref>) go through a substantial shift in flux. This disruption of metabolism enables non-canonical generators of membrane potential, such as the F1Fo-ATPase to drive changes in membrane potential. Why voltage is so toxic in the presence of the mistranslated membrane proteins remains to be explored; however, this shift in understanding the role voltage plays in aminoglycoside lethality will hopefully provide a necessary rethinking of how these antibiotics function so much more effectively than other translation inhibitors. The difference between these mechanisms of bactericide and stasis could lead to novel antibiotics that impinge on the aminoglycoside mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic> K-12 BW25113</td><td>Yale Coli Genetic Stock Center</td><td>CGSC#: 7636</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔnuoA</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213603796</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔnuoB</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213603795</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔnuoH</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213603791</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔnuoI</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213603790</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpA</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213606163</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpB</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213606167</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpC</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213605824</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpD</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213605825</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpE</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213606166</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpF</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213606165</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpG</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213607977</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BW25113 ΔatpH</td><td>Dharmacon Keio</td><td>OEC4987-213606164</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td><italic>E. coli</italic> DK8 1100∆(uncB-uncC)ilv::TnlO</td><td>Rubinstein lab (created in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guo et al., 2019</xref>)</td><td>DK8</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>BL21(DE3)</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>CMC0016</td><td>Electrocompetent cells</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (bacterial)</td><td>Plasmid: pKL09-GCaMP6f-mScarlet bb118</td><td>This paper</td><td>Addgene #pending</td><td>GCaMP6-mScarlet</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (bacterial)</td><td>Plasmid: pKL10-mRuby-iATPSnFR1.0 bb118</td><td>This paper</td><td>Addgene #

For knockout strains from the keio collection kanamycin (50 µg/mL) was also added to any overnight cultures. Strain DK8 was grown overnight in the presence of tetracycline (30 µg/mL). Glycerol stocks were streaked onto plates bearing the appropriate antibiotics, and individual colonies were picked and grown in 5 mL culture tubes, or in 24-well plates, or in 50 mL Erlenmeyer flasks. All cells were grown overnight at 37°C with shaking between 150 and 200 rpm with the appropriate antibiotic if required for plasmid or strain selection. Knockouts from the Keio collection were plated on LB plates with kanamycin and carbenicillin to ensure maintenance of the knockout cassette, but overnight liquid cultures that were to be used for imaging were grown only in the presence of carbenicillin to avoid any potential effects of protein translation inhibition on sensor expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Expression of GCaMP6f-mScarlet was carried out with a constitutive promoter (118, iGem biobrick) assembled in an ampicillin-resistant plasmid similar to earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bruni et al., 2017</xref>). The mScarlet amino acid sequence was taken from the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bindels et al., 2017</xref>) and purchased as a gBlock (IDT). The plasmid was double digested with Pme1/Nco1 and assembled using Gibson assembly. The mRuby-iATPSnFR1.0 construct was created by obtaining the amino acid sequence directly from the publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lobas et al., 2019</xref>) and codon optimizing it in a single gBlock ordered from IDT, then Gibson cloned into the same constitutive promotor backbone as GCaMP6f-mScarlet. Expression of these constructs was carried out in the 118 plasmid. Expression of GCaMP6f alone was carried out using a similar constitutive promoter (100, iGem biobrick) in the same backbone. The mgtC over expression plasmid was created by obtaining the amino acid sequence directly from salmonella on a gBlock, and Gibson cloned into the 118 biobrick backbone used above. GCaMP6f tethered to pHuji was purchased on a gBlock and Gibson cloned into the same constitutive biobrick 118 promoter used previously. All novel plasmids and sequences have been deposited on Addgene. All plasmids were transformed into their respective genetic background strain using Transfer Storage Solution transformation protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Imaging media and fluorescent dyes</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all imaging experiments were conducted in PMM at pH 7.5. The PMM recipe used is: 1x M9 salts (Sigma), 0.2% glucose (Sigma), 0.2 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 10 µM CaCl<sub>2,</sub> 1x MEM amino acids (Gibco). Experiments were conducted at pH 7.5 unless otherwise noted in the text, and NaOH or HCl was used to change the pH to the final value. Given the critical importance of pH in aminoglycoside response, all PMM media with additional chemicals was pH adjusted to 7.5 before imaging. At more basic pH, and higher concentrations of Mg, precipitate forms in this media over time. For oxygen free microscopy experiments, Oxyrase for Broth was added to the media pads during the pre-imaging incubation time to 10% v:v, then sealed to have oxygen removed.</p><p>Propidium iodide (Life Tech) was dissolved in water in a stock concentration, and added to a final concentration of 3 µg/mL. PI was imaged with a 561 nm laser in a flow experiment, and was added at the same time as 30 µg/mL kanamycin.</p><p>Gentamicin Texas Red (GTTR) was synthesized using a previously described protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Saito et al., 1986</xref>). Texas Red-succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) was dissolved in anhydrous <italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>-dimethylformamide on ice to final concentration of 20 mg/ml. Gentamicin was dissolved in 100 mM K<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>, pH 8.5, to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. On ice, 10 µL of Texas Red was slowly added to 350 µL gentamicin solution to allow a conjugation reaction. The gentamicin-Texas Red product from this reaction was used for the imaging experiments. Gentamicin uptake was measured by incubating gentamicin-Texas Red (final concentration of 10 µg/ml) simultaneously with GCaMP6f in a flow experiment.</p><p>TMRM (ThermoFischer) was dissolved in DMSO in a 1 mM stock solution, and diluted in PMM to 8 µM, then added to a final concentration of 200 nM to cell suspensions. TMRM was measured as described below in flow cytometry.</p><p>DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) was dissolved in Ethanol to a 10 mM stock solution, and diluted in PMM to 1 mM, then added to a final concentration of 1 µM to cell suspensions.

The silicone was 3/16’ as the final thickness, and was cut by hand. The pads were diced into small squares using an exacto knife to fit into the flow chambers (~2 mm x 2 mm). Cells from an overnight culture were placed directly on to the agarose pad (1.0 µL) and left for ~5 min. The agarose pads were then placed with the cells down onto a 24 mm x 50 mm glass coverslip (thickness 1.5) with a silicone flow chamber. The apparatus was then sealed with a custom glass slide with holes drilled to enable flow.</p><p>Experiments involving drug titrations or knockouts were prepared onto 96-well glass bottom dishes (Brooks Automation, MGB096-1-2-LG-L). A custom 96-well mold was created and 3D printed using a commercial service. The mold was designed to hold a volume of 200 µL per well (Shapeways), with a separate piece designed to press the agarose pads into the coverslip in 8-, 12-, or 96-well format. The 3D printed pieces are available at the Kralj Lab store on Shapeways (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.shapeways.com/shops/kraljlab">https://www.shapeways.com/shops/kraljlab</ext-link>) and the. stl files are available to researchers upon request. The bottom of the agarose mold was sealed with a 4’ x 6’ piece of glass (McMaster Carr), and liquid agarose was added to the desired wells. A second piece of glass (3’ x 5’) was used to seal both sides, and the agarose was left to cast for &gt;1 hr. The glass piece was then removed, and cells were added to each pad individually (2 µL) and left for 10 min for the liquid to absorb into the agarose. The cells were then pressed out into the 96-well plate using the custom 3D printed press. For all experiments, cells were left in the pad for ~1 hr before imaging. Any chemical treatments were then added to the top of the pad. A 5 µL drop of a solution at 40x final concentration was added on to the pad and left to diffuse throughout. In house measurements with a small fluorescent dye showed compounds diffuse to the glass in ~5 min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Imaging</title><p>Flow experiments were conducted using a Nikon TiE base with perfect focus, running Elements software, with a custom laser illumination with high angle illumination. A 488 nm (Obis 150 LX, Coherent) or 561 nm (Obis 50 LS) were combined, expanded, and focused onto the back aperture to create a widefield illumination. A mirror located 1 f away from the widefield lens was used to control the illumination angle. Imaging took place with a 100x NA 1.45 objective with intensities (at the sample) of 130 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> 488 nM and 1050 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> 561 nm light. A quad band emission filter (Semrock) was used for reflecting the illumination light, and no emission filter was needed. The light was imaged onto an Andor EMCCD (iXon 888 Ultra) using an exposure time of 200 ms. Images were acquired sequentially (561 nm, then 488 nm) once per minute over the entire experiment (6–48 hr). These illuminations showed no evidence of phototoxicity compared to unilluminated cells as measured by growth rate.</p><p>Flow was controlled with two identical syringe pumps (Harvard Apparatus). Flow rates were set to 20 µL/minute which was sufficient to fully exchange the medium in the chamber within 2.5 min. Each syringe pump was loaded with the appropriate medium and was programmed to turn on or off at the desired time. A typical experiment involved 2 hr of PMM alone, followed by switching to PMM+Kan using the second pump. Tubing from multiple syringes was connected with a T-connector with a dead volume of ~20 µL. At all times during flow cell experiments, the specified media was flowed through the chamber.</p><p>Imaging 96-well glass bottom plates took place using a Nikon Ti2 inverted microscope running the Elements software package. Fluorescent excitation was achieved with a Spectra-X LED source (Lumencor). A 40x, NA 0.95 air objective was used to both illuminate and image the cells onto 2- Flash 4 v2 sCMOS cameras (Hamamatsu) using a custom splitter to image two colors simultaneously (Thorlabs). Illumination was achieved by simultaneous excitation with 470/26 and 554/20 band pass LED illumination for a 200 ms exposure. Measured light intensities at the sample were 330 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (470 nm) and 2050 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> (554 nm). Typical sampling rates were one frame per minute, unless noted in the text.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-5"><title>CFU measurements</title><p>CFUs were measured by plating-treated cells onto LB-agarose without antibiotic and counting growing colonies. CFU measurements were conducted trying to mimic the experiments performed via microscopy. Briefly, cells were grown overnight in LB and diluted 1:20 in 5 mL PMM. These cultures were grown at room temperature and shaking for 2 hr (t = 0) followed by the addition of antibiotic. At each time point, the culture was removed from the shaker, and 100 µL was removed. A 10x series dilution was then conducted by removing 20 µL and adding to 180 µL LB alone in a 96-well plate. The 10-fold dilution was performed seven times, leading to the original concentration to a dilution of 10<sup>7</sup>. From each of the 10x dilution series, 3 µL was plated onto an LB agar pad and left to dry (one colony = 333 cells/mL, lower end of our dynamic range). After an entire experiment (typically 5 hr), the agar was placed into an incubator and grown overnight. Colonies were then manually counted the next morning.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-6"><title>Cell cytometry</title><p>A 5 ml of PMM media was seeded with 50 µL of overnight BW25113 cells, or the respective knockout strain tested. When the cells reached ~0.4 OD, 100 µg/ml kanamycin, 10 µg/ml gentamicin, or PMM alone was added. After 30 min of antibiotic or mock treatment, TMRM or DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) was added to the suspension at a final concentration of 0.2 mM or 1 µM, respectively. Two hours later, 1 mL of cell suspension was transferred to a 1 mL Falcon polystyrene round-bottom tube. Cells were quantified for their TMRM incorporation by counting 100,000 events per condition using a BDFACSCellesta Flow Cytometer with the following Voltage settings: FSC at 700, SSC at 350, with 561 nm laser D585/15 at 500, C610/20 at 500 and B670/30 at 481. Emission for each event was collected at the 585/15 nm wavelengths. Cells were quantified for their DiOC<sub>6</sub>(3) incorporation by counting 100,000 events per condition using a BDFACSCellesta Flow Cytometer with the following Voltage settings: FSC at 700, SSC at 350, with 488 nm laser B 530/30 at 350. Emission for each event was collected at the 530/30 nm wavelengths.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-7"><title>Bactiter glo ATP analyses</title><p>ATP per optical density unit was quantified using Promega’s BacTiter-Glo kit coupled with a BioTek Synergy plate reader. BacTiter-Glo reagents and standards were prepared as described in the manual. Briefly, exponentially growing cultures of <italic>E. coli</italic> were treated according to the experimental parameters for the times indicated. When the time of treatment was reached 100 µL of culture, blank, or standard, was added to a black walled clear bottom 96-well plate. This was done in technical triplicate for each condition, blank, or standard, which had at least three biological replicates. Once the plate was prepared 100 µL of BacTiter-Glo Reagent was added to each well, and shaken in an orbital shaker for 1 min at room temperature, then left on the benchtop for 5 min. Luminescence was recorded using the BioTek Synergy plate reader, set to auto scaling and 1 s integration time. Simultaneously with BacTiter-Glo plate preparation, an optical density plate was created with the same cultures, and the absorbance of the culture was read on the same plate reader at 600 nm. ATP per OD unit was calculated by the average of the three biological replicates (which were averaged from the technical replicates), which were then divided by the obtained OD values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-8"><title>Polysome analyses</title><p>Sucrose gradients were prepared in Beckman Coulter Ultra-Clear Tubes (14 × 89 mm) Reorder No. 344059. Media recipes and protocol is from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qin and Fredrick, 2013</xref>. Roughly 6 ml of 10% sucrose was layered on the bottom of the tube, then a large needle was used to add 40% sucrose below the 10% layer up to a 6 ml marker on the outside of the tube. If a clear meniscus between the two layers was not visible the tube was discarded. Tubes were placed in a MagnaBase tube holder (sku B105-914A-I/R), and short caps were placed on top to eliminate all air from the tube. The tube holder was then placed on the gradient maker. A 10–40% gradient was then established using a BIOCOMP Gradient Station ip gradient maker with the following settings: Short cap, Sucrose, 10–40%wv, 81°, 1:48 min:sec. Caps were then removed, and gradient tubes were stored no longer than 1 hr at 4 °C until lysate supernatant was prepared.</p><p>Ribosomes and ribosomal subunits were characterized using a slightly adapted protocol, due to differences in available equipment, from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qin and Fredrick, 2013</xref>.

Optical Density was taken at time of collection, when 37.5 ml of culture was then transferred to Nalgene Oak Ridge Centrifuge Tubes (Cat. 3119–0050) on ice. Cells were then pelleted in a chilled Sorvall SA-600 rotor in a Sorvall RC 5C Plus Centrifuge at 10,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Culture media was decanted and aspirated. Cell pellets were then resuspended in 500 µL lysis buffer (750 µL for anaerobic conditions), and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen suspensions were thawed in a 5–10°C water bath, then flash frozen again, and either stored at −80 °C or thawed in the same manner and treated as follows. Lysis was completed by adding 15 µL of 10% sodium deoxycholate to freeze-fractured pellet resuspensions and mixed by inversion. Lysate was then separated by centrifugation at 4 °C at 10,000 rpm in a chilled Eppendorf FA45-30-11 rotor in an Eppendorf 5804R Centrifuge for 10 min at 4 °C. Lysate supernatant was collected in chilled microfuge tubes. Then 300 µL of the 10–40% gradient was removed from the top of the sucrose gradient columns and replaced with 300 µL of lysate supernatant.</p><p>Loaded gradient columns were placed in Beckman SW-41 swinging buckets and balanced to within 0.01 g of each other using the 10% sucrose solution. Loaded sucrose gradient buckets were then centrifuged using the SW-41 rotor in an LM-8 Ultracentrifuge in 4 °C at 35,000 rpm for 3 hr. Sucrose gradient columns were then removed, and fractions were then collected using the following series of machines. A BIOCOMP Gradient Station IP with settings Distance 80.00 mm, Speed 0.3 mm/s was tethered to a BIORAD Model 2110 Fraction Collector with the following settings: six drops/fraction. As fractions were collected the absorbance at 254 nm was collected from the fractions using a BIORAD Econo UV Monitor set to range 1.0 (AUFS) tethered to computer running the BIOCOMP Gradient Profiler 2.0 software. Data files for each gradient run were saved as. csv files and later analyzed in Matlab using custom scripts to integrate peaks with the trapz.m function.</p><p>Due to the nature of collection with these devices, often the beginning of the non-ribosomal RNA peaks was missed, capturing the absorbance as the non-ribosomal RNA ran through the detector midway through the peak. In all conditions tested, non-ribosomal RNA, 30S, 50S, and 70S peaks were detected. To simplify comparisons between conditions, polysomes beyond the 70S peak were ignored in the (30S+50S)/70S ratio measurements. Note that because of the nature of these experiments, different total quantities cell lysate, and therefore of total RNA, are loaded into the sucrose gradients columns. Due to this reality, comparing the 254 nm absorbance quantities between samples is unreasonable; however, comparing the ratio of the ribosome peaks should be total-RNA agnostic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Image processing</title><p>Data was stored as.

Each of these experimental images were then averaged together to give an estimate of the uneven illumination. These images were smooth across the entire field of view, and varied by ~50% across the entire image.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Correcting uneven illumination. Each individual movie was then loaded into memory sequentially. Each frame of the movie was converted to a double, and then divided by the uneven illumination. This image was then multiplied by the average value of the movie and converted back into a uint16 to maintain consistent intensity values. Each frame was then reassembled into an illumination corrected movie.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Registering drift and jitter in XY: Each frame was aligned to the previous frame using a convolution of the 2D Fourier transform. Each sequential image was first estimated by applying the XY warping from the previous frame. Then, the 2DFT was taken for each image, and multiplied to the previous frame. The optimal updated XY position was then calculated and applied.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Subtracting the estimated background: The background was estimated for each frame individually using a morphological operator. A disk structured element with radius 9 µm was blurred with a Gaussian filter. This background estimation was then subtracted from the original image. To protect against potential negative values, the minimum of the entire movie was set to 50 counts.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Segmenting cells using a Hessian algorithm: To segment cells, first the foreground was estimated using Otsu’s method from the background subtracted image. The Hessian was then calculated on the background subtracted image, and then elementwise multiplied to a logical image of the foreground. Otsu’s method was again used on this modified Hessian image to identify individual cells. Hard limits were set to remove potential noise that did not fit given criteria for size or minimum intensity. We found that first increasing the size of the image using a spline interpolation gave superior segmentation results. Using this method, not all cells were identified within a microcolony, though we estimate that it can identify ~96% of the cells accurately.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Extracting time traces for individual cells: From a given identified cell, for each time point in the movie, we extracted the mean intensity using the Matlab command, regionprops. The mean intensity for both the GCaMP6f and the mScarlet were extracted using this method, or any other fluorophore the cells expressed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Processing each time trace for the onset and amplitude of transients: For each time trace, the moving median over 45 min was divided to remove the slow baseline trends. A standard deviation was calculated from the timepoints before aminoglycoside addition, and a cell was defined as blinking if it had transients that lasted &gt;10 min that were &gt;7 x the pre-treatment standard deviation. From each normalized time trace, the moving standard deviation was also calculated using a 30 min sliding window. Within a given FOV, the entire population moving standard deviations was averaged, providing the average standard deviation trace shown in the figures.</p></list-item></list><p>During flow experiments, single frames were sometimes contaminated by bubbles that dramatically changed the contrast. To remove these features, we took the average of all extracted cells. If the differential of any single frame was initially lower, then higher than 5x the standard deviation of the whole movie, a single frame was removed. This preprocessing removed spurious catastrophic blinks that appeared to occur in every cell at the same instant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Cytometry analysis</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> energize their membrane through a proton motive force (PMF) that powers their flagellar motors and several membrane pumps.

For example, if the extracellular pH is at pH 7.5, then there is no pH difference, so all of the PMF will be carried in the voltage component, which would be accomplished by establishing ionic gradients using pumps and channels. On the other hand, if the extracellular pH is low, for example pH 6, then the PMF could have a value −87 mV without having to maintain any voltage component. The PMF could be carried entirely by the change in pH, which could drive the flagellar motors and other PMF dependent processes in the membrane.</p><p>Thus, by changing the environmental pH from 7.5 to 6, we can lower the membrane voltage by fact that the cell will utilize the pH component of PMF without the need to generate an external voltage from other ions.</p><p>Analysis of the cytometry data was achieved by fitting the data to a 1D Gaussian distribution and calculating the mean and 95% confidence interval for each of these fits for each strain tested.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers each highlighted the general importance of the work and the notion that this work may be revealing an important new angle on aminoglycoside mechanism of action. However, there were significant concerns raised about whether the calcium transients were simply correlated with cell death or truly causal. And precisely how calcium transients would, at a mechanistic level, result in cell death was unclear. These concerns are laid out in some detail in the individual reviews provided below and we hope they will be helpful to the authors.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper tackles an important and interesting problem, namely why aminoglycosides are bactericidal. Relying largely on a GCaMP6 reporter that is a calcium sensor, the authors provide some data to support a claim that aminoglycosides trigger hyperpolarization of the cell, which is ultimately lethal. Although this represents an intriguing new angle on aminoglycoside mechanism of action, I thought some of the results were overinterpreted and at the end of the paper I'm still left wondering (i) how aminoglycosides lead to the purported increase in ATP that the authors think drives reverse action of the F1Fo ATPase to produce hyperpolarization and (ii) how hyperpolarization ultimately kills cells.</p><p>1) Figure 2D: It definitely seems like low pH reduces transients, but the authors should verify that there is, in fact, less killing by aminoglycosides in this low pH environment.</p><p>4) For the results in Figure 3E, the authors argue that there's no correlation between GTTR uptake and calcium transients, but there seems to be some sort of pattern in which GTTR uptake increases after a long burst of transients, i.e. toward the end of each trace shown. So, I'm not fully convinced there's no relationship.</p><p>3) &quot;However, single cell data showed the initiation of transients and the uptake of PI were not correlated. The catastrophic transients started before dye uptake in all observed cells.&quot; But couldn't it be that catastrophic transients arise more easily than PI uptake but that both are reporting on aminoglycoside-induced membrane defects?</p><p>4) I guess I don't really understand why pH and protonophore CCCP both diminish transients and aminoglycoside efficacy. Do these treatments prevent hyperpolarization or aminoglycoside uptake or something else? I can see why CCCP likely prevents hyperpolarization by dissipating the PMF, but then shouldn't acidic pH conditions exacerbate not rescue the effects seen?</p><p>5) The increase in CFU in Figure 4E following addition of CCCP at 1 hr is not particularly large – it looks like an increase of only 2-3 fold. Given the central importance of this experiment to the model, I'm worried about overinterpretation of modest effect sizes here.</p><p>6) In Figure 5 I think it's essential for the authors to measure ATP concentration in a more direct way than their fluorescent reporter, which doesn't seem to have a particularly large dynamic range.</p><p>7) Why do large calcium transients kill cells?</p><p>8) I don't really understand why aminoglycoside increase ATP levels as hypothesized based on the results in Figure 5. If it's just a matter of inhibiting translation, then shouldn't a bacteriostatic antibiotic like chloramphenicol show a similar increase in ATP?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Bruni et al., from Kralj's lab, the authors proposed that aminoglycoside bactericidal action arises from dysregulated membrane potential. The authors used a genetically encoded calcium sensor previously developed in Bruni et al., 2017.</p><p>The Introduction is very short and could contain more information about what is known on aminoglycoside uptake (EDP-I and II, PMF, feed forward loop,… Taber et al., 1987).</p><p>The results are interesting, provocative and conceptually new. However, clarifications, controls and new experiences are needed to support their conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>My main concern is that the authors consider the uptake as an aminoglycoside mechanism of action. This point of view leads to surprising conclusions as in the title of the paper:</p><p>“Membrane voltage dysregulation, not uptake, underlies bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides.”</p><p>For me, aminoglycoside act on ribosomes, so uptake is essential, without uptake no death. The authors use a fluorescent gentamicin (GTTR) to track the uptake and observe that the calcium transients appear before the drug uptake. Is GTTR fluorescence detection sufficiently sensitive for this type of experiment?</p><p>It will be interesting if the authors could use their tools (GCaMP6, GTTR) in the conditions previously used in others studies to support their conclusions: adding chloramphenicol to block translation and EDP-II step; used PMF altered strains (<italic>nuo</italic> sdh, Fe-S biosynthesis) and Gm-resistant strain.</p><p>In the same vein, the authors need to clarify the impact of low pH, anoxic medium and CCCP (subsection “Aminoglycosides induced catastrophic calcium transients”), these three conditions are known to decrease PMF (essential for aminoglycoside uptake). Instead, the authors talk about &quot;environments that diminish aminoglycoside efficacy&quot;.</p><p>The most surprising result is that even in presence of CCCP, the ribosomes are still dissociated with aminoglycoside, leading to the conclusion that voltage is not necessary for aminoglycoside uptake. Is it possible to detect GTTR fluorescence in the presence of CCCP?</p><p>In all experiments, the GCaMP6 fluorescence tends to increase even before adding drugs. Given that previous study of the same lab have shown that using agarose pad lead to a voltage-induced calcium flux via a local mechanical environment, it will be essential to represent in a same figure the control without aminoglycoside. Even though in the text (subsection “Aminoglycosides induced catastrophic calcium transients”) this comparison is made.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Bruni and Kralj present data supporting that bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides relies on membrane voltage dysregulation. Specifically, the authors describe an interesting observation of fast calcium fluctuations in <italic>E. coli</italic>, under the addition of aminoglycosides that correlates with cellular death. Driven by this observation, they perform additional experiments and conclude that aminoglycosides increase ATP concentration inside bacterial cells, which reverses the F1Fo-ATPase activity, causing hyperpolarization and eventually cell death. Together, this work provides a better understanding of the bactericidal mechanism of antibiotics, which is very significant. In general, I found the paper meaningful, but I have major concerns regarding the main claims, and specifically regarding the proposed mechanism of action.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the increased cellular ATP reverses the activity of the F1Fo-ATPase generating a hyperpolarized state of the cell. While I agree with the authors that reverse activity of F1Fo-ATPase can cause hyperpolarization, it is unclear to me if this is the only, or even the major mechanism of hyperpolarization upon aminoglycoside treatment. The authors present two lines of evidence to argue their point: ATPase knockout mutants and mgtC expression data.</p><p>My first concern with the author's claims is that while some ATPase knockouts show a reduction of aminoglycosides action, there is no single mutant that abolishes the effect (changes in mean SD of calcium transient or recover CFUs). This is in contrast to the results where the authors truly abolish the hyperpolarization through other means such as CCCP or pH. This discrepancy suggests the possibility that the reverse activity of F1Fo-ATPase may not by the sole cause, or even the major cause of the hyperpolarization.</p><p>Second, the expression of MgtC eliminates the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides. MgtC is a magnesium ion transporter, and thus it is also plausible to think that increased magnesium ion uptake prevents hyperpolarization.</p><p>2) Contrary to the authors claim, I could not find evidence in the manuscript to support that the catastrophic calcium transients are the direct cause of cell death. Even more, the fact that any cell that experienced calcium transients in the untreated condition did not divide, but did also not die (Introduction), provokes the question whether calcium transients are the true cause of death.</p><p>The authors would be better off, stating the relationship between calcium transients and cell death as a correlation rather than causation. However, if the authors choose to stick with their claim of causality, they have to show that calcium transients itself are sufficient to kill the cell, regardless of potential other effects related with hyperpolarization. Perhaps the authors could use a specific calcium chelator, such as BAPTA, to prevent calcium transient and therefore cellular death?</p><p>Below I detail my major concerns regarding the claimed mechanism of action:</p><p>- One of the most important results in this manuscript is that some ATPase knockouts affect calcium transients. To show the change between these mutants and WT strain, the authors measured differences in the mean GCaMP6 SD signal. My problem is that the measurements for different knockouts were done at different time points (Figure 5D top and bottom. See Table 1). I don't think that this is the proper way of comparing strains. It is unclear why the authors chose this strange comparison.</p><p>- Why is there so much variation of the GCaMP6 signal between WT replicas? For example, the same Figure 5D, and Figure 2—figure supplement 4C, Supplementary igure 5A, and 5E. In some cases, the variation between different WT replicas could be even larger than the difference between ATPase mutants and the WT strain.</p><p>- Furthermore, shouldn't the ATP concentration decrease if F1Fo-ATPase keeps hydrolyzing ATP?</p><p>- It is also not clear why the atpC knockout should have a higher membrane potential than WT. In the discussion, the authors do not mention anything about atpC.</p><p>- The authors do not mention why calcium transients (and possibly increase in ATP concentration) are not observed in other antibiotics that also impair ribosomal activity, such as chloramphenicol?</p><p>- Importantly, GCaMP6 signal doesn't report directly on the membrane potential. Therefore, to determine whether hyperpolarization induces a positive feedback on gentamycin uptake, it would be necessary to use a more direct membrane potential reporter, such as the one the authors used for their other measurements.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Membrane voltage dysregulation driven by metabolic dysfunction underlies bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Daisy Lee (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>This paper examines the mechanism of killing by aminoglycoside antibiotics, providing evidence that their bactericidal activity stems from a hyperpolarization of the inner membrane of cells rather than affecting uptake, or at least rather than affecting only uptake. This revised version of the manuscript was deemed substantially improved by the reviewers and they are each enthusiastic about the work and the prospect of publishing it in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, one of the reviewers raised a couple of important points about the role of ATP and the reversal of ATP synthase that the authors should address, either by providing additional data or by adjusting the language in the papers and the claims made.</p><p>1) The revised manuscript still does not include an experiment addressing aminoglycoside uptake. Did the authors have any alternative to replace GTTR?</p><p>2) It is unclear what 'by metabolic dysfunction' in the title means. Do the authors mean increased intracellular ATP? While the abstract claims that 'the hyperpolarization arose from altered ATP flux', it is hard to understand why or how F1Fo ATPase reverts its action only when the membrane potential is high enough (inside is more negative), not in the other way around (inside is not as negative – it seems to me it's better to revert the action in this case since then they can increase the membrane potential to the normal level through reverting it…).</p><p>3) Throughout the data, it seems that the membrane potential plays a critical role in exerting bactericidal effects. While ATPase mutants and the mgtC expressing strain presented here likely have altered membrane potential without any antibiotic treatment, I couldn't find data showing their basal membrane potential level compared to the WT. Without the basal membrane potential data, it is impossible to discern if the phenotypes of the mutants are due to their basal membrane potential differences or by the author's main claim in the abstract. It would be very valuable if the authors can provide the basal membrane potential level of mutants compared to WT, CCCP added case, and/or pH6.5 case in the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58706.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

We have some data in the lab which shows single cell data correlated with continued growth for up to 16 hours at low pH in the presence of aminoglycoside that we’re happy to share to provide some evidence that growth is still possible, but we do not have the gold standard CFU assay to back it up, and will not until we return to lab.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the results in Figure 3E, the authors argue that there's no correlation between GTTR uptake and calcium transients, but there seems to be some sort of pattern in which GTTR uptake increases after a long burst of transients, i.e. toward the end of each trace shown.

Furthermore, the GTTR data became suspect when we explored our PI data further. If uptake up PI can occur in a majority of cells, even in the absence of a membrane potential, then the uptake of GTTR cannot be considered to be occurring through the typical uptake route of aminoglycoside because they can enter through pores that are not there during the initial aminoglycoside uptake. We have removed the GTTR data as a result of these conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the same vein, the authors need to clarify the impact of low pH, anoxic medium and CCCP (subsection “Aminoglycosides induced catastrophic calcium transients”), these three conditions are known to decrease PMF (essential for aminoglycoside uptake). Instead, the authors talk about &quot;environments that diminish aminoglycoside efficacy&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified the impact of low pH and CCCP and attempted to better explain their inhibitory effects in the supplementary discussion (Materials and methods section). We have removed the anoxic medium piece of data because we have been unable to set up anoxic conditions for all of the necessary experiments to clearly argue their protective effect throughout the text. We hope to address the differences anoxic conditions create in a future publication as we believe it is more nuanced than a decreased PMF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most surprising result is that even in presence of CCCP, the ribosomes are still dissociated with aminoglycoside, leading to the conclusion that voltage is not necessary for aminoglycoside uptake. Is it possible to detect GTTR fluorescence in the presence of CCCP?</p></disp-quote><p>This surprised us as well, and ultimately inspired a good portion of this project’s direction. We have altered the main text to highlight this point, including the ribosome dissociation in the first figure. We have removed the GTTR data because of the Propidium iodide data in main text Figure 1D: GTTR increased on the same timescale as our PI experiments, so we cannot rule out GTTR uptake through pores. Therefore, the GTTR data is suspect unless it can be detected prior to PI uptake (spectral overlap of GTTR and PI preclude us from determining this result). We have altered the text to reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In all experiments, the GCaMP6 fluorescence tends to increase even before adding drugs. Given that previous study of the same lab have shown that using agarose pad lead to a voltage-induced calcium flux via a local mechanical environment, it will be essential to represent in a same figure the control without aminoglycoside. Even though in the text (subsection “Aminoglycosides induced catastrophic calcium transients”) this comparison is made.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included main text Figure 2A, C to address this shortcoming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors claim that the increased cellular ATP reverses the activity of the F1Fo-ATPase generating a hyperpolarized state of the cell. While I agree with the authors that reverse activity of F1Fo-ATPase can cause hyperpolarization, it is unclear to me if this is the only, or even the major mechanism of hyperpolarization upon aminoglycoside treatment. The authors present two lines of evidence to argue their point: ATPase knockout mutants and mgtC expression data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there are numerous ATPases that can affect membrane voltage, which will temper the potential importance of the F-ATPase in the context of aminoglycoside killing. Hopefully our revisions to the text have clarified that this molecular machine is merely one, albeit significant and important, contributor to aminoglycoside killing in this context. We have found that in strain with all components of the ATPase, there are still a few transients, though much reduced compared to the parent strain (Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My first concern with the author's claims is that while some ATPase knockouts show a reduction of aminoglycosides action, there is no single mutant that abolishes the effect (changes in mean SD of calcium transient or recover CFUs). This is in contrast to the results where the authors truly abolish the hyperpolarization through other means such as CCCP or pH. This discrepancy suggests the possibility that the reverse activity of F1Fo-ATPase may not by the sole cause, or even the major cause of the hyperpolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>We found the observation that no single mutant abolished the aminoglycoside effect unsettling as well and further reflected on this point. In order to address this concern, we have included a complete knockout of the F-ATPase (DK8) in main text Figure 5E. Unfortunately, due to COVID related loss of laboratory access the corresponding DK8 CFU experiments remain to be completed. Regardless of that outcome, we have adapted the text by downplaying what we initially argued was a central role for this ATPase. Instead, we now invoke a relatively well-established translation inhibitor cellular response – the dysregulation of metabolism – as the main driver of cell death. While the F-ATPase contributes to this cell death through hyperpolarization, it is not exclusively responsible given the single component knockout results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the expression of MgtC eliminates the bactericidal activity of aminoglycosides. MgtC is a magnesium ion transporter, and thus it is also plausible to think that increased magnesium ion uptake prevents hyperpolarization.</p></disp-quote><p>While mgtC is upregulated in response to low magnesium and aids in Mg uptake with other components of its operon, we are unaware of evidence that mgtC alone is a magnesium ion transporter. There is even evidence that the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> mgtC does not bind magnesium https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22984256, and further most of the evidence we have found for the <italic>Salmonella</italic> mgtC function appears to be one of a regulatory role in the cell. If we have grossly missed evidence to the contrary, please let us know what that is so that we can run additional experiments to verify that the function of mgtC we claim is due to F-ATPase activity inhibition rather than Mg uptake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Contrary to the authors claim, I could not find evidence in the manuscript to support that the catastrophic calcium transients are the direct cause of cell death. Even more, the fact that any cell that experienced calcium transients in the untreated condition did not divide, but did also not die (Introduction), provokes the question whether calcium transients are the true cause of death.</p><p>The authors would be better off, stating the relationship between calcium transients and cell death as a correlation rather than causation. However, if the authors choose to stick with their claim of causality, they have to show that calcium transients itself are sufficient to kill the cell, regardless of potential other effects related with hyperpolarization. Perhaps the authors could use a specific calcium chelator, such as BAPTA, to prevent calcium transient and therefore cellular death?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot prove calcium transients are the direct cause of cell death. We unfortunately did have a sentence that insinuated this in the prior version of the text. That has been removed. We have multiple instances reinforcing that there is no evidence that large calcium transients kill cells including subsection “Single cell calcium flux predicts cellular aminoglycoside response”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below I detail my major concerns regarding the claimed mechanism of action:</p><p>- One of the most important results in this manuscript is that some ATPase knockouts affect calcium transients. To show the change between these mutants and WT strain, the authors measured differences in the mean GCaMP6 SD signal. My problem is that the measurements for different knockouts were done at different time points (Figure 5D top and bottom. See Table 1). I don't think that this is the proper way of comparing strains. It is unclear why the authors chose this strange comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the majority of these ATPase knockouts are affecting the onset of transients due to their differential effects on the polarization state of the cell, and therefore would exhibit altered kinetics. We are happy to run statistical testing at multiple time points if that is preferable. We can also separate different strain’s GCSD traces in the figure to improve readability if this was the main cause of concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why is there so much variation of the GCaMP6 signal between WT replicas? For example, the same Figure 5D, and Figure2—figure supplement 4EC, Supplementary figure 5A, and 5E. In some cases, the variation between different WT replicas could be even larger than the difference between ATPase mutants and the WT strain.</p></disp-quote><p>The standard deviation metrics will include aspects of the signal-to-noise characteristics of the GCaMP images, which are intrinsically tied to the microscope used to collect data. During our experiments, we used more than one microscope (one with a sCMOS camera and 40x air objective, and one with a EMCCD with a 100x oil objective) which have very different noise characteristics. Thus, we believe the only way to view this type of analysis is through a relative measurement of untreated or wildtype cells taken at the same time. For all data shown, the biological replicates and conditions were taken on the same day on the same microscope and used for comparison. Using these relative metrics, we can easily identify treated vs untreated conditions, as well as investigate the kinetics and amplitude of the calcium transients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Furthermore, shouldn't the ATP concentration decrease if F1Fo-ATPase keeps hydrolyzing ATP?</p></disp-quote><p>On the basis of newly included experiments, we have adapted our thinking of the ATP result. The steady state level of ATP changes very little, but the flux through non-ribosomal components increases dramatically. Please see Materials and methods section, Figure 5—figure supplement 1D, and subsection “ATP dysregulation precedes voltage induced bactericidal killing”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- It is also not clear why the atpC knockout should have a higher membrane potential than WT. In the Discussion section, the authors do not mention anything about atpC.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see subsection “ATP dysregulation precedes voltage induced bactericidal killing”. We have added a brief discussion on about the roles of atpH and atpC. Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors do not mention why calcium transients (and possibly increase in ATP concentration) are not observed in other antibiotics that also impair ribosomal activity, such as chloramphenicol?</p></disp-quote><p>Additional experiments have confirmed that non-aminoglycoside translation inhibitors do increase ATP flux, and some even alter basal membrane potential (data not included). This new data supports a model that incorporates previously known aminoglycoside effects including mistranslated proteins and membrane pores helping to explain the difference in bactericidal activity. Hopefully this discrepancy is now clear. Also see Figure 5—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Importantly, GCaMP6 signal doesn't report directly on the membrane potential. Therefore, to determine whether hyperpolarization induces a positive feedback on gentamycin uptake, it would be necessary to use a more direct membrane potential reporter, such as the one the authors used for their other measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the hyperpolarization could induce a positive feedback on gentamycin uptake. However, we see that even in the absence of membrane potential, enough aminoglycoside enters the cell to dissociate the ribosome and increase ATP. The hyperpolarization is required for bactericidal activity, though, which is a new way of viewing the role of voltage in the activity of aminoglycosides.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…]</p><p>1) The revised manuscript still does not include an experiment addressing aminoglycoside uptake. Did the authors have any alternative to replace GTTR?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially removed the GTTR data from our revised manuscript since the ribosome dissociation data is more specific indicator of aminoglycoside activity. We have added it back in to help support our hypothesis. Figure 1—figure supplement figure 1D (a new panel) shows GTTR uptake in the absence or presence of CCCP, again showing dye uptake into cells regardless of membrane voltage. Furthermore, given our data with PI showing a large non-specific uptake, the GTTR signal may be confounded with our factors, which warrants caution in interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear what 'by metabolic dysfunction' in the title means. Do the authors mean increased intracellular ATP? While the abstract claims that 'the hyperpolarization arose from altered ATP flux', it is hard to understand why or how F1Fo ATPase reverts its action only when the membrane potential is high enough (inside is more negative), not in the other way around (inside is not as negative – it seems to me it's better to revert the action in this case since then they can increase the membrane potential to the normal level through reverting it…).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for confusion in the presentation of the model. When we refer to metabolic dysfunction, we are referring to deleterious usage of ATP within the cell. The F1Fo ATPase can trade negative (inside) voltage for ATP. So if it makes ATP, it is moving the voltage closer to 0 mV. On the other hand, the pump can also use ATP to increase (more negative) the membrane polarization. So if the balance of ATP to voltage is tilted, the motor can shift from consuming ATP to hydrolyzing ATP. In our model, ATP is not consumed by ribosomes, and is therefore free to be consumed by other ATPases (including the F1Fo ATPase) which will then hyperpolarize the membrane, leading to the transients.</p><p>We have attempted to clarify the model in Figure 5—figure supplement 3 (new supplementary figure) showing this stepwise process. Furthermore, we revised our thinking on calling step 2 “increased cellular ATP” in lieu of our BacTiter-Glo data, showing in bulk that cells do not have more ATP. Rather we believe that there is the same amount of ATP, however the metabolic burden of translation is no longer contributing to ATP consumption. Other groups have seen similar shifts in metabolic load in the presence of aminoglycosides and other translation inhibitors (cited in the relevant parts of the paper), so we believe this is part of a more universal effect of translation inhibitors causing metabolic dysfunction. Our language in subsection “ATP dysregulation precedes voltage induced bactericidal killing” of the main text document reflect this change in thinking, however if it is not clear that we mean a shift in ATP flux, rather than an increase in bulk ATP concentrations, we will revise our language to better reflect this thinking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Throughout the data, it seems that the membrane potential plays a critical role in exerting bactericidal effects. While ATPase mutants and the mgtC expressing strain presented here likely have altered membrane potential without any antibiotic treatment, I couldn't find data showing their basal membrane potential level compared to the WT. Without the basal membrane potential data, it is impossible to discern if the phenotypes of the mutants are due to their basal membrane potential differences or by the author's main claim in the abstract. It would be very valuable if the authors can provide the basal membrane potential level of mutants compared to WT, CCCP added case, and/or pH6.5 case in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that membrane potential plays a critical role in the aminoglycoside response, and that the protection afforded by these mutations could be due to decreased voltage. To test the basal voltage, we have included a table and figure (Figure 5—figure supplement 2) which contains the membrane potentials for individual strains BW, DK8 (∆<italic>unc</italic> – F-ATPase components are all removed), and BW+mgtC. We observed that the DK8 and BW+mgtC strain had a more polarized basal membrane potential as compared to the BW strain alone. Finally, to see if this result was due to the strain, or some effect that is specific to the strain treated with TMRM, we utilized the less sensitive Nernstian dye DiOC<sub>6</sub> to assess if dye uptake was altered in the DK8 strain overall. We observed results similar to our TMRM data with the dye DiOC<sub>6</sub>. These data are consistent with the interpretation that protection arises from altered ATP consumption, and not depolarization.</p></body></sub-article></article>
