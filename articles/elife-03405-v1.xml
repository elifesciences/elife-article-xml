Using <italic>in vivo</italic> two-photon calcium imaging in the rat barrel cortex during artificial whisking against different surface coarseness or controlled passive whisker vibrations simulating different coarseness, we show that layer 2–3 neurons within barrel boundaries differentially respond to specific texture coarsenesses, while only a minority of neurons responded monotonically with increased or decreased surface coarseness. Neurons with similar preferred texture coarseness were spatially clustered. Multi-contact single unit recordings showed a vertical columnar organization of texture coarseness preference in layer 2–3. These findings indicate that layer 2–3 neurons perform high hierarchical processing of tactile information, with surface coarseness embodied by distinct neuronal subpopulations that are spatially mapped onto the barrel cortex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03405.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03405.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03405.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As nocturnal tunnel-dwelling animals, rats rely on their whiskers to enable them to navigate in the dark. By moving their whiskers back and forth in movements called whisking, rats can obtain detailed information about the shape, texture, and size of objects in their path and also work out whether they can fit through narrow gaps.</p><p>Like all hairs, whiskers are made of dead cells. However, the follicles from which whiskers grow are densely packed with the ends of sensory nerves. When a whisker bends, information is transmitted along these nerves to a region of the brain called the barrel cortex, which takes its name from the barrel-shaped structures that represent the individual whiskers. These structures are arranged in an orderly grid with adjacent barrels corresponding to neighboring whiskers.</p><p>One of the key functions of whiskers is to help animals to distinguish between textures. By recording nerve impulses from the barrel cortex of anesthetized rats as the animals' whiskers were moved back and forth across four sandpapers of differing coarseness, Garion et al. have obtained key insights into how this process works. Only a small minority of barrel cortex neurons were more active or less active in response to an increase or a decrease in coarseness. Instead, most neurons showed a preference for one particular coarseness and fired much more when the rats' whiskers encountered the corresponding sandpaper.</p><p>Neurons with the same preferred coarseness were usually located close to one another. This gives rise to a gradient across the barrel cortex in which successive columns of neurons fired when the whiskers detected surfaces that were increasingly coarse, while neurons at different depths within each column fired at the same coarseness. This pattern was also seen using a different experimental method—in which whisker vibrations that were typical for different textures were converted to electrical signals and then played back to the rat's whiskers.</p><p>By revealing that the barrel cortex essentially contains a texture map, Garion et al. have identified a fundamental difference in how tactile (or touch) information is represented in the rat brain compared to visual and auditory information. Further work is now required to determine how the neurons identify different textures—whether they use particle size or sharpness, for example—and to confirm that the same results can be seen in awake animals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03405.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03405.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>texture representation</kwd><kwd>layer 2–3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Rappaport Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schiller</surname><given-names>Jackie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neurons within rat somatosensory cortex are selective to texture and are spatially organized according to their texture preference.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The somatosensory system and especially the highly developed mystacial whisker system is one of the most important senses used by rats to sense the external world. The rat mystacial pad contains an array of vibrissae (whiskers) that rhythmically move back and forth (whisk) to palpate the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>). Using their whiskers, rodents can locate and distinguish objects in their immediate sensory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond et al., 2008b</xref>). Texture discrimination is one of the major sensory tasks performed by the barrel whisker system, and just a few whisker palpations are sufficient for discriminating between different texture coarseness with a high degree of sensitivity and reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>). Previous studies have shown that activation of the primary barrel cortex is crucial for texture coarseness discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guic-Robles et al., 1992</xref>), yet despite its importance the functional organization and texture coarseness coding in the S1 barrel cortex are largely unknown.</p><p>Previous studies of texture coding in anaesthetized rats and texture discrimination in awake behaving rats revealed that the degree of texture coarseness was correlated with the average firing rate of the granular and infragranular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arabzadeh et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>). However, a simple averaged firing coding scheme was not sufficient to explain the psychophysical discrimination curve of the rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, other or additional coding schemes are required to achieve the high performances of the rat whisker system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). One such additional coding scheme that has been suggested previously is a temporal code scheme of texture coarseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolfe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In different sensory modalities, sensory features are coded selectively by specialized neurons that respond best to certain parameters of the stimulus which in turn can be spatially mapped across the cortex. This spatio-functional representation is one of the fundamental principles governing organization of different sensory cortexes. For example, in the visual system, neurons that selectively respond to certain bar orientations or movement directions in the visual field are organized in columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>). In the somatosensory whisker system the most conspicuous functional spatial map is the somatotopical organization of the vibrissae array onto the S1 cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>). Information about the organization within the barrel column is lacking. It has been shown that neurons in the barrel cortex selectively respond to certain angular directions of whisker deflection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lavzin et al., 2012</xref>), which tend to be arranged in maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hubel and Wiesel, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lottem and Azouz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al., 2011</xref>). However, aside from angular tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>), mapping of other fundamental sensory features including texture coarseness onto the somatosensory barrel cortex is largely unknown. The present study sets out to use two-photon calcium imaging to further understand texture coarseness coding and explore the spatial representation of texture coarseness in layer 2–3 of the rat barrel cortex in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2–3 barrel cortex neurons during artificial whisking against textures</title><p>We recorded the responses of layer 2–3 neurons during artificial whisking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Semba and Egger, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Szwed et al., 2003</xref>) (‘Materials and methods’) across sandpapers with different degrees of coarseness (P120, P320, P600, and P1000) and whisking in air (free whisk–FW) while simultaneously recording calcium transients from multiple neurons bulk loaded with Fluo-4 using two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TPLSM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Sandpapers are traditionally used as a substrate of choice to investigate coarseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond et al., 2008b</xref>) as different sandpapers mainly differ by the average size of their particles (grit size), which are uniformly distributed across a flat surface. In experiments that included FW only three sandpapers were examined (P320, P600, and P1000) due to time limitation imposed by the dye washout observed in the AM bulk loading technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato et al., 2007</xref>). To increase the temporal resolution during acquisition of calcium signals from large number of neurons, we developed a new free hand line scan routine that allowed us to retain high temporal resolution (50–100 Hz) while simultaneously recording from dozens of neurons (50.3 ± 3.4 neurons per experiment, range of 24–89 neurons per experiment, 23 rats) (‘Materials and methods’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The stability of the line scan path was checked continuously during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>). Responses were recorded from the principle barrel, as determined by intrinsic imaging during whisker deflection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), and whisker displacements were measured by an infrared photo-sensor and a high speed camera (Flare, IO industries at 1000 fps) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Our imaging measurements showed that the calcium transients were locked to the whisking envelopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the temporal resolution of our calcium measurements (up to 100 Hz) was not sufficient to detect changes resulting from individual micro movements of the whisker. To characterize the variability and reliability of the calcium and whisking responses between repeated trails, we calculated the mean and SEM of the responses in individual neurons (individual traces are shown for four neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and the average values are shown for all neurons in a single experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Furthermore, we tracked whisker movements during artificial whisking using the fast camera (1000 Hz) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). We found little variability in the whisker angle between consecutive trails and between different trial blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), indicating robust whisker movements during artificial whisking. As expected, we did observe differences in the whisker curvature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>) and differences in the stick and slip events between different texture coarseness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03405.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two-photon calcium imaging of layer 2–3 neurons evoked by artificial whisking against textures in the barrel cortex in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental set-up. A small (2 × 2 mm) craniotomy was performed above the barrel cortex, and the dura was carefully removed. Nerve stimulation was performed with a silver hook attached electrode to the buccal nerve. Only the principle whisker was left intact while other whiskers were trimmed. Artificial whisking (10 trains at 5.5 Hz) was performed either in free air (FW) or against different sandpapers.

First, in all experiments, we identified the vertical blood vessels at the TPLSM plane and histological images, and vertically reconstructed down to the layer 4 barrel which was identified by cytochrome oxidase staining. Second, in some experiments (n = 7), we validated our conclusions by performing biocytin electroporation of selected bulk loaded neurons and later performed post hoc histology of cytochrome oxidase barrel staining aligned to the neuronal biocytin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). For these experiments at the end of the imaging session several bulk loaded neurons were electroporated with biocytin using a patch electrode (‘Materials and methods’). The biocytin-labeled neurons served as second clear anatomical landmark for alignment with the barrel boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Using this method, we compared the average distance between neurons with the same preferred texture coarseness in our experimental data with that of randomly distributed neurons (calculated for 1000 runs) (for details see ‘Materials and methods’ section). We found that in all our maps the average distance between neurons sharing the same texture coarseness preference was significantly smaller than that expected by chance occurrence (20 maps, at the p &lt; 0.05 level, examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Aligning the TPLSM image with the histologically confirmed barrel boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) revealed that in all cases clusters of texture selective neurons were observed within the barrel boundaries, while septal neurons were mostly non-preferring and non-responsive neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>When we aligned multiple maps from different experiments and projected them onto a single ‘normalized’ barrel, we observed a tendency for texture coarseness to be arranged along the rostro/medial-caudo/lateral diagonal of the barrel with a tendency of the coarser texture (P120) to be represented in the rostro-medial region and the finer texture (P1000) at the caudo-lateral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; p &lt; 0.01 4 way ANOVA).

We find texture responding neurons in layer 2–3 barrel cortex with subset of neurons preferentially responding to different texture coarseness. We further find that cells with similar preferred texture coarseness are spatially clustered across layer 2–3 of the barrel cortex. It is presently unclear whether these neurons code for the complex entity of coarseness or alternatively code for another more basic physical feature such as velocity of the whisker, grain sharpness, grain size, frequency etc. Regardless of the answer to this important question it is clear that texture coarseness can be decoded from the activity of these neurons irrespective of the exact physical entity they code for. These findings were shown in two different whisker activation paradigms, artificial whisking against different texture coarseness and passive replay of texture-like vibrations. The manner by which whiskers are activated is critical for the experiments. There is no ‘perfect’ way to repeatedly activate the whisker system in a robust and behaviorally relevant manner. Behaving rats performing texture discrimination tasks are of course most physiologically relevant, yet multiple well-controlled robust repetitions are very hard to obtain. On the other side of the spectrum passive whisker movements in anesthetized rodents are very well controlled and robust; yet probably differ from the physiological whisker activation. Artificial whisking in anesthetized animals is an intermediate whisker activation paradigm however receptor activation may deviate from that occurring under physiological whisking. It is important to note that a recent report shows that the kinematics of the whisker movement during artificial whisking closely simulates that of freely behaving rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bagdasarian et al., 2013</xref>). In our experiments both passive whisker activation and artificial whisking yielded similar results, reinforcing our main conclusion that texture selective neurons clustered across the S1 barrel cortex. It is however important to stress that in our experiments, rats were anesthetized; and in future, the findings should be corroborated in behaving animals. It is interesting to note that texture responding neurons were detected in barrel cortex of awake behaving mice during a texture discrimination paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Texture coding in the barrel cortex</title><p>Using their whiskers, rats can reliably detect small differences in surface coarseness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guic-Robles et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carvell and Simons, 1990</xref>). Psychophysical tests show that using their macro vibrissae, rats can discriminate between grain sizes as small as 10–20 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). The underlying cortical coding mechanisms responsible for the formidable capability of rodents to distinguish texture coarseness have been studied extensively, mainly in granular and infra-granular cortical layers using multi- and single-unit recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guic-Robles et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabzadeh et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morita et al., 2011</xref>). In the granular and infra-granular cortical layers of the barrel cortex neurons mostly respond to stick and slip events, and surface coarseness has been shown to be coded for the most part by the average spike count in the neuronal population. However, a rate coding spike count scheme could only explain discrimination between rough vs smooth textures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">von Heimendahl et al., 2007</xref>), but could not explain discrimination between finer textures well within the psychophysical discrimination curve of the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabzadeh et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008a</xref>). Thus, additional coding schemes based on the timing of action potential firing or on sparse synchronous firing have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Diamond et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to the ‘temporally based coding schemes’, a ‘resonance’ coding theory has also been suggested. The resonance hypothesis suggests that texture identity is represented spatially across the whisker pad. This representation stems from the gradient of whiskers' lengths across the pad, denoting each whisker with a distinct resonance frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neimark et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008a</xref>).</p><p>Our results suggest a novel complementary strategy for coding texture coarseness in layer 2–3 of the barrel cortex. According to our results, coarseness is coded by neurons which prefer different coarsenesses, including the intermediate texture coarseness P600. We corroborated the existence of these neurons using electrophysiological single unit recordings. Interestingly, we found that neurons with similar coarseness preference are spatially clustered. Though certainly differences in coarseness induce differences in multiple parameters in whisker kinematics, the spatial clustering by itself may hint that coarseness is a fundamental quality that is represented in the rodent cortex. A coding scheme based on coarseness selective neurons can increase the reliability of texture coarseness coding as coarseness can be extracted by comparing the activity of neurons with different coarseness tuning. The alternative coding scheme where coarseness is extracted from the average firing of the neuronal population maybe more sensitive to the activity state of the animal and the context of the stimulus. This coding scheme is highly reminiscent of the coding suggested in primary visual and auditory cortexes in which subsets of neurons respond with increased firing selectively to a specific feature of the physical stimulus such as orientation or tone frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubel and Wiesel, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelken et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>As to the ‘temporal coding’ theories, the low acquisition rate of our calcium imaging data precluded us from critically testing these hypotheses, yet our findings do not contradict the use of temporal coding in the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arabzadeh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diamond et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jadhav et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Most of the previous studies including this present study preferred to treat texture coarseness as a gestalt quality due to its complex nature and psychophysical importance. The downside of such an approach is that it does not address the question of what features are extracted by neurons during different coarseness representation. Keeping in mind that in sensory research one can only find tuning within the parameter space examined, designing the appropriate parameter space of stimuli that will encompass in unbiased way what features are extracted by neurons is a highly complicated issue and awaits further investigation. It is important to stress that this problem is generic to all sensory systems. Just as in the visual system, for example, both simple, artificial stimuli (e.g., drifting gratings), and more naturalistic stimuli (e.g., natural image patches) revealed complementary aspects of sensory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gollisch and Meister, 2008</xref>), also in the somatosensory system both simple passive and more complex natural stimuli are needed to reveal the full coding scheme of the system.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Functional maps in sensory cortexes</title><p>The observation that functional information is mapped onto the cortical layers is one of the fundamental organizational principles of the central nervous system. In different sensory modalities, neurons which process closely related sensory information are contiguous.

These clusters were arranged along the rostro/medial-caudo/lateral diagonal of the barrel and to a lesser extent showed a tendency for radial arrangement of coarseness as well. This coarseness map is the second map described in S1 barrels in addition to the whisker angular direction map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bruno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andermann and Moore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kremer et al., 2011</xref>).

From this analysis, we found that selective neurons to texture coarseness were almost exclusively confined to the barrel boundaries, whereas neurons in the septa area were non-responsive or showed low preference to texture coarseness. Previous anatomical and functional studies have shown that barrel and septa neurons belong to different sub-networks associated with different thalamocortical and intra-cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shepherd and Svoboda, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bureau et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kerr et al., 2007</xref>). The large differences in responses of barrel and septa neurons in our experiments are consistent with these findings.

Our data show that layer 2–3 neurons, rather than using a simple rate coding scheme of the physical properties like layer 4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Romo et al., 2003</xref>), are organized in subpopulations of coarseness selective neurons, which are spatially mapped in the cortex.

This enabled us to define a line that passed through large numbers of neurons with relatively high temporal resolution (acquisition rate of 50–100 Hz). To assure the stability of the line scan a reference image was captured every 3–5 scans and if needed corrections were made (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Methods that allow for scanning along a user defined path were described in the past for a two-dimensional plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lillis et al., 2008</xref>) and for three-dimensional volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gobel et al., 2007</xref>). To obtain a free hand line scan routine, we created a scan path on a reference image which is built of a list of scanned pixel locations on that image. Later, we constructed a matrix of voltage values where Vx(i) and Vy(j) are the voltages that are needed by the X–Y galvanometer to drive the scanning beam to the ith and jth positions. Using this matrix, we can back-map the voltage values from a reference location on a scanned area.</p><p>A scan line is a vector or positions on the reference image defined as follows:</p><p>Line = {(Xi, Yi)|Xi is the X position of the (i)th pixel of the line, Yi is the Y position of (i)th pixel of the line, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, n is the number of pixels along the scan line}.</p><p>With this scan mode the time resolution (scan time and the scan frequency) is calculated as:</p><p>Single-line-scan-period = n*dwellTime + MAX (X-return-time, Y-return-time), measured in seconds.</p><p>Scan frequency = 1/Single-line-scan-period, measured in Hz.</p><p>The return path is the straight line between the points (Xn, Yn) and (X1, Y1).

The electrode was lowered using a precision stereotactic micromanipulator (TSE-systems, Germany). During the recordings the signals were amplified (X1000), filtered (0.1–10,000 KHz), and stored in a computer using the ME-16 amplifier and MC-Rack software (MEA, Germany). After completion of the experiments, the recorded data were replayed with a band-pass filter of 1–5 KHz to obtain spikes. Single units were sorted with an offline spike sorter (OFS version 3; Plexon, Dallas Texas).

For determining selectivity and temporal dynamics of firing, spike counts were calculated along 100 ms time bins. The prolonged time bin was used for better comparison with the calcium imaging data which has prolonged time course. Selectivity calculations were performed on the spike count during the stimulation period. Selectivity to a texture or to CD was defined as showing both a p &lt; 0.01 significance level in the ANOVA test when all textures were compared and a selectivity index of ≥0.35 (see data analysis for definition of selectivity index).

The nerve was cut, and its distal end mounted on a bipolar tungsten electrodes. Bipolar, rectangular electrical pulses (0.5–4.0 V, 40 µs duration) were applied through an isolated pulse stimulator (A360, WPI) at 100 Hz to produce whisker protraction, followed by a passive whisker retraction. The stimulation magnitude was adjusted to the minimal value that reliably generated the maximal possible movement amplitude. Typically, we evoked 10 consecutive trains (5.5 Hz, 50% duty cycle, 2 s) with 30 s between runs. All other whiskers except the principle whisker were cut off, the principle whisker was presented with different sandpapers (2 cm<sup>2</sup>) with the tip of the vibrissa just touching the sand paper. The textures were manually placed to be coplanar with the trajectory of the whisker motion, and the distance from the whisker pad was set such that the whisker contacted the texture and made a full move on the texture without being stuck.</p><p>Whisker displacements were measured by an infrared photo-sensor (resolution: 1 µm; Panasonic: CNZ1120) placed 2 mm from the whisker pad. The voltage signals were digitized at 10 KHz and amplified or photographed using a high-speed camera (see next section). To control for stability of the responses for each texture stimulus, the repetitions (typically 30 repetitions) were divided to two separate blocks that were segregated in time and appeared in a random order during the experiment. Thus during the experiment, the different textures were randomly interleaved, and each texture was presented twice in two separate blocks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>).

The peak response for each texture was determined by averaging10 sampling points around the highest value of the response. In each cell, we also calculated the <italic>SI</italic> using the area of responses (calculated during the whisking train). We applied this algorithm only to responding neurons. Neurons were considered selective if the <italic>SI</italic> was larger than 0.35, and there was a significant difference (at the p &lt; 0.01 significance level) between the responses to the different textures using the ANOVA (for equal variance, as determined by the Levene's test) or the Kruskal–Wallis statistical tests (unequal variance, for cases that failed the Levene's test).</p><p>With respect to the out of focus signal, this is an inherent problem of all imaging signals. Two-photon imaging minimizes this problem, but does not eliminate it all together. To partially deal with this problem we: (1) excluded all neurons in which the decay time constant was smaller than 650 ms (indicating a dominant neuropil component). (2) In the neurons in which we recorded simultaneously both electrophysiological and imaging data, we calculated the average transients with and without action potential firing. Traces without action potential firing represented the contribution of the neighboring out of focus neurons and neuropil signals. We found only very small transients (&lt;10%) during non-responsive traces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). (3) We compared the fluorescent values of three structures in our images, cells, non-cell regions (neuropil and out of focus neighboring neurons), and blood vessels (corresponding to background fluorescence). The net fluorescent value in cells (after background subtraction, as measured in blood vessels) was 1845 ± 546 fluorescence units compared to 574 ± 376 fluorescence units and in non-cell structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>), indicating a small out of focus and neuropil contribution in our recordings.</p><p>We used two methods to perform clustering analysis.

The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) It is helpful that the authors show both smooth and unsmoothed barrel maps to compare their passive whisker stim paradigm with their artificial whisk paradigm, however they fail to report how coarseness of preferred texture varies with radial distance from barrel center (as they do in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This is an essential quantification if they want to answer Reviewer 1's comment since the barrel maps themselves don't look that convincing. Also, in this section of the text they state that “the normalized map raises the possibility that textures coarseness is arranged along a diagonal axis”. However, if this was the case, one would expect there to be roughly equal numbers of very coarse neurons at the barrel edge as very fine neurons, with intermediate neurons clustered in the centre. This is inconsistent with the variation in coarseness preference with radial distance that they report in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>. In fact, perhaps this diagonal mapping of texture is what causes the relationship between coarseness and radial distance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> to be so weak since in order to calculate this they simply group the two coarsest textures into one “coarse” group and the two finest into one “fine group”. In order to reconcile the conclusion of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> with that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> they should simply plot a scatter plot between coarseness and radial distance for both conditions. The shape of this relationship will show whether arrangement is concentric or diagonal within a barrel.</p><p>2) While the piezo map is an important addition to the paper, statistical testing of the map would be helpful. The artificial whisking map is reported as a radial map with coarse-selective neuron near the edges, the piezo data, however, does not look radial and is not tested with a similar statistical test as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>. Both maps appear to have a diagonal tuning from coarse in the medial/rostral corner to fine in the caudal/lateral corner. The maps should be confirmed with the same statistical test and compared against each other; for example a correlation analysis of diagonal position against texture tuning. It would also be interesting to superimpose the two maps and retest with more data points.</p><p>3) The addition of the extra panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (right-hand panel) is helpful; however this figure is haphazardly laid out in general. It would not take much to scale all images and register them such that the narrative of Fluo4-imaging to cell localization is much clearer. Also if, as described in the rebuttal, they only did this in around 7/12 maps, and clearly obtain similar success in experiments without it, why bother at all? In summary: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> needs to be clearer, more streamlined and a justification given for why biocytin labelling was only needed for half the experiments.</p><p>4) The lack of response or texture tuning in septal neurons is intriguing! But it needs to be fleshed out a bit more in the main figures. If it is not possible to make extracellular recordings in septal regions, then it would be very nice to present septal imaging data as part of the population maps in the main figures. To confirm that the lack of response in septal neurons is not just the result of a few non-responsive experiments the authors could show examples of non-responding and responding cells on either side of a barrel edge from the same experiment.</p><p>5) The electroporation figure could do with some straightforward population analysis, for example location of electroporated cells superimposed on a normalized barrel.</p><p>6) The authors present images from one experiment to show cell position stability during imaging which is good to see, but it would be better to present a correlation analysis of cell position throughout the imaging procedure across a number of experiments to be sure that their imaging method is not subject to movement artefacts.</p><p>7) The analysis that was included in the rebuttal (demonstrating lack of tuning to coarseness across barrel field) should be included as a supplementary figure in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work, “Texture coarseness responsive neurons and their mapping in layer 2-3 of the rat barrel cortex in-vivo”, for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your submission has been assessed by Eve Marder and two reviewers, in consultation with a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors. Although we find that your work is of interest, we regret to inform you that the findings at this stage are too preliminary for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In rare cases (such as this one) we think the potential interest of the work is such that we would welcome a new submission that would include additional experiments, although of course we cannot guarantee the results of its review.</p><p>As you will see from the reviewers' comments below, while both reviewers found your results interesting and potentially important for our understanding of texture discrimination in rodent barrel cortex, they also raised significant concerns about the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from the existing results. We feel that significantly more data and more analysis are required in order to make the manuscript suitable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>In higher mammals, primary sensory cortical regions neurons are arranged into functional maps. Surprisingly, this has not been so clear at the cellular level in rodents. Here the authors describe a spatial clustering of cells with similar response properties to object texture in rat whisker barrel cortex using 2-photon calcium imaging. The imaging appears to be of good quality and the characterization of a functional map is important for the field. However, while the results are interesting I also find that there are several figures that should be improved with more N and/or more analysis to confirm the conclusions.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) The electrical whisking paradigm attempts to move the whiskers in a manner more similar to the awake whisking rat. But, as discussed in the manuscript, it is difficult to have excellent control of whisker position and is not a perfect replication of awake whisking, which is why almost all researchers in the field use passive stimulation of whiskers when using anesthesia. The authors address this and show non-random spatial arrangements of cells in barrel cortex to passive stimulation. It would enhance the paper greatly to demonstrate whether the passively evoked responses also show functional maps when superimposed on a barrel as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>; more specifically: are passively stimulated coarse-selective neurons also located near the edges of the barrels?</p><p>2) The columnar organization of the preferred response in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> is a very interesting finding. However, it is unclear how many rats were used in these experiments, is it just one? These experiments should be repeated in different rats to increase N.</p><p>3) There is a clear and interesting difference of barrel and septal sensory responses, this should be followed up and confirmed with electrophysiological recording and identification of the recording sites.</p><p>4) The authors perform biocytin electroporation of imaged cells to locate the imaging site relative to the barrel. This is a nice technique and important for the conclusions of the paper but more analysis should be presented for a main figure. Is the yellow arrow in D an identified single electroporated cell? Are there confirmed neurons that have been imaged and stained: this should be presented? Was electroporation done in all experiments? Are there any axons visible going down through the barrel?</p><p>5) The free hand line scan method the authors use scans an optimal path through a number of neurons to provide a fast scan rate. The authors should describe how stable the optimal path is throughout their experiment. Small movements of the brain could end up in scanning neuropil. So, was the path corrected during recording to account for brain movement? A full frame image at the start and end of recording showing any brain movement would be a good control and should be presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>The authors examine whether an embodied feature of the natural stimulus space of vibrissal sensing, coarseness, demonstrates a spatial map. They provide compelling data that neighboring neurons are clustered in their response properties to variation in this dimension. I think that with further analyses to help us know how we should think about this finding the result is of significance.</p><p>My main questions were about what to make of this finding relative to features we know about and that we know have spatial maps; is this a re-discovery of direction tuning, because the frictional term of a given surface dictates how a vibrissa is stopped with high deceleration (e.g., caudal direction tuning?), or propensity to spring forward suddenly (e.g., rostral direction tuning?)? Similarly, while 'coarseness' has not been shown to have a map, frequency has been shown to have one related to biomechanical resonance, a property engaged by contact with sandpapers.</p><p>Analyses and clarifications conducted with the present data:</p><p>1) Did barrel identity in its anterior-posterior position in the barrel map predict the coarseness tuning of cells in that column?</p><p>2) When looking at the normalized barrel map, there seemed to be a lower left (presumably aligned to the somatotopic more ventral/posterior position on the face) to upper right gradient of frequency preference. For example, no cells preferring 120 were outside of the lower left, and the majority of cells preferring the highest frequency are upper right. Smoothing these data lightly and integrating across frequencies should be conducted.</p><p>3) Also, please plot the actual axes of orientation used to align the barrels on this summary image, and please make sure all maps are presented in this same orientation for consistency.</p><p>4) Is there a spatial radial or (as suggested in question 2) a lower left-upper right map for frequencies directly played into the vibrissae? These data should be plotted on a normalized barrel map also.</p><p>5) More generally, while I buy the argument that calcium signals cannot track individual stick-slip events, the mean frequency generated by artificial whisking on each sandpaper can be reported, as can the range and peak velocity values, as can the number of stick-slip events per grit. These properties for vibrissae chosen to be identity- and length-matched to the ones used for the initial data acquisition (as I assume those vibrissae are now long gone) should be used to make these measures. At least we can begin to try to understand what mapping may exist from lower level features that have been probed and the present findings.</p><p>6) The authors simply state that the contact point of the vibrissa was related to its 'not getting stuck'; can we have any more information? Was the contact point of the vibrissa on the surface of the sandpaper a typical distance from the face and/or from the vibrissa tip?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03405.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) It is helpful that the authors show both smooth and unsmoothed barrel maps to compare their passive whisker stim paradigm with their artificial whisk paradigm, however they fail to report how coarseness of preferred texture varies with radial distance from barrel center</italic> (<italic>as they do in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6B</italic></xref><italic>).

This analysis shows that similar to the artificial whisker paradigm, the combined coarser textures (P120+P320) had significantly larger radial distances compared to the combined smoother textures (P600+P1000), although the difference is less pronounced than that observed for artificial whisking.</p><p>Regarding the diagonal axis arrangement, we performed statistical analysis to investigate this point. For each cell we calculated the distances from the two diagonal lines. We found texture coarseness to be arranged along the medio/rostral-caudo/lateral diagonal of the barrel with a tendency of the coarser texture (P120) to be represented in the medio-rostral region and the finer texture (P1000) at the caudal-lateral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In this case for both the active and passive maps 4 way ANOVA showed significance for comparison of the 4 texture.</p><p>Combining both these results, it seems that although there is a significant radial distances for coarser and smoother textures, the diagonal arrange is more prominent. This was especially true in the case of the passive case. These points are now communicated in the main text as well as in the figures of the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>). These points are further discussed in reply to point 2.</p><p><italic>2) While the piezo map is an important addition to the paper, statistical testing of the map would be helpful. The artificial whisking map is reported as a radial map with coarse-selective neuron near the edges, the piezo data, however, does not look radial and is not tested with a similar statistical test as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6b</italic></xref><italic>. Both maps appear to have a diagonal tuning from coarse in the medial/rostral corner to fine in the caudal/lateral corner. The maps should be confirmed with the same statistical test and compared against each other; for example a correlation analysis of diagonal position against texture tuning. It would also be interesting to superimpose the two maps and retest with more data points</italic>.</p><p>Following the editors’ comments we performed additional analysis and statistical testing:</p><p>A) We added the radial scatter plot for each of the 4 textures for the artificial whisking experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>B) We added the radial scatter plot for each of the 4 textures and for the coarser and finer texture for the passive whisking stimulation paradigm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). We found that the passive experiments also show a statistically significant difference in the radial distance when combining finer versus coarser texture preferring neurons, although the difference was less pronounced compared to the artificial whisking experiments.</p><p>C) As suggested we added a combined map of the passive and artificial whisking data and compared the radial distance of neurons with different preferred textures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>D) We performed statistical analysis for the distance of cells from the diagonals. We found texture coarseness to be arranged along the medio/rostral-caudo/lateral diagonal of the barrel with a tendency of the coarser texture (P120) to be represented in the medio-rostral region and the finer texture (P1000) at the caudo-lateral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This was true both when we performed a 4 way ANOVA and when we compared between coarser and finer textures for both the passive and artificial whisking maps. We added this analysis to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig9">Figures 6 and 9</xref>, and described the findings in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The addition of the extra panel in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref> (<italic>right-hand panel) is helpful; however this figure is haphazardly laid out in general. It would not take much to scale all images and register them such that the narrative of Fluo4-imaging to cell localization is much clearer. Also if, as described in the rebuttal, they only did this in around 7/12 maps, and clearly obtain similar success in experiments without it, why bother at all? In summary:</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>needs to be clearer, more streamlined and a justification given for why biocytin labelling was only needed for half the experiments</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we added a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) in which we show the relative position of the electroporated cells, the TPLS imaged cells and the barrel border in all 7 experiments where we electroporated cells for determining barrel boundaries. It is important to stress that in all cases the electroporated neurons were also filled with the calcium sensitive dye, and thus could also be identified in the two photon image. In some cases electroporation intentionally targeted neurons slightly off the imaged field in cases where we observed de-staining and bleaching of the imaged neurons at the end of the experiment.</p><p>With respect to the number of experiments performed with biocytin electroporation. We routinely used 3 methods of localizing the barrel, intrinsic imaging, cytochrome oxidase staining and vertical blood vessels reconstruction to define the relationship between our layer 2-3 imaging field and the stained layer 4 barrel. The electroporation method was performed on only 7 experiments since it was added later in the project in an attempt to cross check and validate the two other methods. We clarified this point in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) The lack of response or texture tuning in septal neurons is intriguing! But it needs to be fleshed out a bit more in the main figures. If it is not possible to make extracellular recordings in septal regions, then it would be very nice to present septal imaging data as part of the population maps in the main figures. To confirm that the lack of response in septal neurons is not just the result of a few non-responsive experiments the authors could show examples of non-responding and responding cells on either side of a barrel edge from the same experiment</italic>.</p><p>Following the editors’ comments we added information regarding septal neurons.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we have made the following changes:</p><p>A) In the revised manuscript <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> panel B includes only the texture preferring neurons recorded within the barrel border. We preferred not to include the non-responsive and non-selective neurons in this main figure to make the presentation of texture preference mapping clearer. We felt that adding non-responsive and non-selective neurons to this figure may compromise the main point of the manuscript.</p><p>B) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> we present the superimposed mapping of all neurons (including non-responsive and non-selective neurons) located within and out of barrel boundaries onto a “normalized” barrel (upper panel). In addition we show 3 maps of individual experiments (lower panels) to exemplify the point that responding cells were mostly located inside the barrel border while outside barrel borders cells are mostly non-responding or non-selective cells within the same map.</p><p><italic>5) The electroporation figure could do with some straightforward population analysis, for example location of electroporated cells superimposed on a normalized barrel</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we now added new supplement figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure2–figure supplement 1A</xref>), which includes all electroporated cells superimposed on a normalized barrel.</p><p><italic>6) The authors present images from one experiment to show cell position stability during imaging which is good to see, but it would be better to present a correlation analysis of cell position throughout the imaging procedure across a number of experiments to be sure that their imaging method is not subject to movement artefacts</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewers’ comment we present now a quantification of the cells movement across different experiments. More specifically we calculated the relative shift of the image in both the X and Y directions compared to a template picture during the different trials (described in the revised Methods section). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure1–figure supplement 2</xref> we present the trial-by-trial movements in the X and Y directions for one experiment, and the average movement per trial in X and Y directions for 15 experiments. We found very small shifts between the images throughout the experiment, on average per trial the X-Shift was 0.235±0.54 and Y-Shift was 0.215±0.58; n=15 experiments).</p><p><italic>7) The analysis that was included in the rebuttal</italic> (<italic>demonstrating lack of tuning to coarseness across barrel field) should be included as a supplementary figure in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>As suggested this figure is now added to the supplementary figures as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2</xref>, and a description in the main text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p><italic>1) The electrical whisking paradigm attempts to move the whiskers in a manner more similar to the awake whisking rat. But, as discussed in the manuscript, it is difficult to have excellent control of whisker position and is not a perfect replication of awake whisking, which is why almost all researchers in the field use passive stimulation of whiskers when using anesthesia. The authors address this and show non-random spatial arrangements of cells in barrel cortex to passive stimulation. It would enhance the paper greatly to demonstrate whether the passively evoked responses also show functional maps when superimposed on a barrel as in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6b</italic></xref><italic>; more specifically: are passively stimulated coarse-selective neurons also located near the edges of the barrels?</italic></p><p>Following the reviewer's comment we now present the passive maps superimposed onto a normalized barrel with and without smoothening (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>; Smoothing is described in the Methods section). Similar to the artificial whisking map, the normalized passive map also showed a tendency for coarser textures to map on the barrel perimeters.</p><p><italic>2) The columnar organization of the preferred response in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7</italic></xref> <italic>is a very interesting finding. However, it is unclear how many rats were used in these experiments, is it just one? These experiments should be repeated in different rats to increase N</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity. In the original manuscript we presented the data in terms of number of electrodes and cells, and not in number of rats. Altogether the data is from 12 different rats. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> presents the data for 2 individual electrodes in 2 different rats. All other panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> average the data from 12 electrodes recorded in 12 different rats (a single multi-contact electrode per rat). This is now described in the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> of the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) There is a clear and interesting difference of barrel and septal sensory responses, this should be followed up and confirmed with electrophysiological recording and identification of the recording sites</italic>.</p><p>This is a very valid point, and we tried to address this point during the project, but eventually decided that the size of the septa is too small to be accurately targeted with our single unit recordings. In fact we feel that this point is one of the clear advantages of two photon imaging. More specifically in our electrophysiological experiments we used two methods to define the recording site. First, intrinsic imaging performed prior to electrode insertion as described in the Methods section (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). With this method we were able to target the barrel, but not the septa. Second, at the end of experiments we replicated the location of the electrode by inserting a needle connected to a Hamilton syringe using the micromanipulator previously used to hold the electrode, and injecting dye at the recording site. We did not use electrical lesions as we reused our recording electrodes, and did not want to damage them by the current injection. In our opinion these methods were sufficiently reliable to determine that the electrodes were placed within the barrel boundaries (if close to the barrel center), but due to the small size of the septa relative to the barrels, these methods were not accurate enough to distinguish between septal and barrel perimeter locations.</p><p><italic>4) The authors perform biocytin electroporation of imaged cells to locate the imaging site relative to the barrel. This is a nice technique and important for the conclusions of the paper but more analysis should be presented for a main figure. Is the yellow arrow in D an identified single electroporated cell? Are there confirmed neurons that have been imaged and stained: this should be presented? Was electroporation done in all experiments? Are there any axons visible going down through the barrel?</italic></p><p>The yellow arrow was intended to point generally to the region from where we performed the imaging and electroporation but was not intended to point to any specific neuron. Following the comment we now point the arrow to one of the neurons that was actually electroporated. In all cases several imaged cells were electroporated at the end of the experiment (a new panel is added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Electroporation was performed in 7 out of the 12 maps. In the remaining 5 maps we determined the location of the imaging site relative to the barrel using alignment of vertical blood vessels. In addition in all cases intrinsic optical imaging was used to target the barrel. This is now added to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. As to the axonal track, we used only brief electroporation times just to mark the cell bodies and we processed the animal shortly after so, we could not follow axonal processes.</p><p><italic>5) The free hand line scan method the authors use scans an optimal path through a number of neurons to provide a fast scan rate. The authors should describe how stable the optimal path is throughout their experiment. Small movements of the brain could end up in scanning neuropil. So, was the path corrected during recording to account for brain movement? A full frame image at the start and end of recording showing any brain movement would be a good control and should be presented</italic>.</p><p>Indeed this is an important issue which we were aware of, and performed the necessary corrections. As a rule full frame images were obtained every 3-5 line scan images and if needed corrections were performed. Generally as the animal was anaesthetized, and the head was held by a very stable platinum plate, movements were small and only minor corrections were needed. This point is described now in the text and Methods section and in a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>[…] My main questions were about what to make of this finding relative to features we know about and that we know have spatial maps; is this a re-discovery of direction tuning, because the frictional term of a given surface dictates how a vibrissa is stopped with high deceleration</italic> (<italic>e.g., caudal direction tuning?), or propensity to spring forward suddenly</italic> (<italic>e.g., rostral direction tuning?)? Similarly, while 'coarseness' has not been shown to have a map, frequency has been shown to have one related to biomechanical resonance, a property engaged by contact with sandpapers</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer raises an important general question of whether the mapping of coarseness we are reporting is in fact reflects mapping of previously reported qualities such as orientation tuning. In this project we decided to treat texture coarseness as a single wholesome quality due to its biophysical importance. However, we are well aware of the fact that texture coarseness is composed of individual physical properties, and in turn one or more of these properties might be mapped onto the barrel. Previous studies have shown that whisker deflection direction is mapped onto the barrel. Although this is an interesting possibility at this point it is hard for us to see how textures differ from each other by the whisker deflection direction they evoke. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the texture mapping would be a composite of other maps such as direction and other qualities that are not yet known to be mapped. We added a comment in the Discussion of the manuscript.</p><p>With respect to mapping of frequencies in different barrels, see answer to comment 1.</p><p><italic>Analyses and clarifications conducted with the present data:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Did barrel identity in its anterior-posterior position in the barrel map predict the coarseness tuning of cells in that column?</italic></p><p>Following the reviewer's comment we plotted the dominant frequency preference as a function of the barrel location along the row and arc of the barrel field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>).

Each barrel was assigned a dominant texture, which was the texture preferred by the largest number of neurons recorded in the barrel.

These properties for vibrissae chosen to be identity- and length-matched to the ones used for the initial data acquisition</italic> (<italic>as I assume those vibrissae are now long gone) should be used to make these measures. At least we can begin to try to understand what mapping may exist from lower level features that have been probed and the present findings</italic>.</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer we further analyzed the data we acquired during our experiments when the whiskers contacted different sand papers.
