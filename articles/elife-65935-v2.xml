Finally, two transient receptor potential melastatin (TRPM) channels, GON-2 and GTL-2, mediate this newly described rapid pathogen avoidance. These results suggest a mechanism by which TRPM channels may sense the intestinal distension caused by bacterial colonization to elicit pathogen avoidance and aversive learning by detecting changes in host physiology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>pathogen avoidance</kwd><kwd>TRPM channels</kwd><kwd>aversive learning</kwd><kwd>olfactory aversive learning</kwd><kwd>host physiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM070977</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aballay</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI156900</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aballay</surname><given-names>Alejandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Behavioral assays using <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> show that a learned pathogen avoidance following intestinal distention requires specific chemosensory neurons and TRPM channels in the intestine and excretory cell.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to survive, animals have evolved mechanisms to detect and avoid harmful organisms, including pathogenic bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kavaliers et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Medzhitov et al., 2012</xref>).

However, how intestinal distention leads to avoidance remains unclear. One possibility is that mechanoreceptors on intestinal cells sense the pressure caused by distention and then send neuropeptide signals to the nervous system to initiate avoidance. While no mechanoreceptors have been found to be functional in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine, it does express transient receptor (TRP) channels that could act as mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao and Xu, 2011</xref>). However, TRP channels are known to play many other roles, including but not limited to taste, thermoregulation, ion homeostasis, and pacemaker activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holzer, 2011</xref>). Indeed, while the TRP vanilloid (TRPV) channel genes <italic>ocr-2</italic> and <italic>osm-9</italic> are known to inhibit avoidance of the pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>), this inhibition is through their role on hyperoxia avoidance rather than direct sensing of bacteria or distention. Moreover, they are not expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine. One TRP channel that is expressed in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine is the thermosensitive channel TRPA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>). TRPA-1 also plays a role in sensory neuron-mediated nose-touch responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kindt et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of this channel was shown to be involved in avoidance of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, though activity of this channel was localized to gustatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Soldano et al., 2016</xref>). The mammalian digestive system expresses many TRP channels, including members of the TRPA, TRP melastatin (TRPM), and TRPV families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holzer, 2011</xref>). Because nearly all of these channels are conserved across species, identification of their role in pathogen avoidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is likely to improve our understanding of pathogen avoidance in a range of organisms.</p><p>Here, we present evidence that <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoids <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> faster than <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> In contrast to the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>-mediated avoidance that requires small RNAs (sRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>), <italic>E. faecalis-</italic>mediated avoidance does not depend on sRNAs, nor does it require ASI neurons, full bacterial virulence, or innate immune activation. Instead, avoidance occurs after a rapid expansion of the anterior part of the intestine. This avoidance behavior, which exists in opposition to an NPR-1-mediated hyperoxia avoidance process, requires the ASE, AWB, and AWC chemosensory neurons. These latter two neuron pairs regulate an olfactory aversive learning process that underpins avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis.</italic> Finally, we identified two novel regulators of intestinal distention-induced pathogen avoidance: the TRP melastatin (TRPM) channels GON-2 and GTL-2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>E. faecalis</italic> elicits fast avoidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic></title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> is a free-living nematode that feeds on organic material rich in microorganisms, and therefore frequently encounters pathogenic bacteria. It has developed behavioral strategies to minimize exposure to these threats. For example, it avoids the pathogenic <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> bacteria slowly, taking between 12 and 24 hr to execute aerotactic and olfactory aversive learning processes depending on the bacterial growth conditions used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>).

Interestingly, we observed animals frequently exiting and entering the bacterial lawns over time. Quantification of these events revealed a slight imbalance favoring exiting events as early as 1 hr, with this difference growing larger in the 3–4 hr window due to a decrease in the entry events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>E. faecalis</italic> elicits fast avoidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of avoidance assays (top) and representative photomicrographs (bottom) of <italic>C. elegans</italic> on lawns of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PA14, or <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF at 0 hr (left) and 4 hr (right) on BHI media.

However, implementing this dry-drop assay with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> or <italic>E. faecium</italic> did not induce an aversive response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that direct contact with live replicating bacteria is required for the rapid avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> or <italic>E. faecium</italic>. Rapid aversion alone also cannot explain the re-entry events. Instead, it is likely that there is a balance of attraction and aversion to <italic>E. faecalis</italic> that changes over the course of exposure. Thus, the animals learn to avoid <italic>E. faecalis</italic> quickly after exposure. This process likely involves sensory pathways, as animals with loss-of-function mutations in <italic>tax-2</italic>, a subunit of a cGMP-gated-ion-channel important for sensory neuron function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coburn and Bargmann, 1996</xref>), show slowed avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because it has recently been suggested that the sensation of a bacterial sRNAs is at least partly responsible for learned <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>), we examined whether RNA from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> may also elicit avoidance. Unlike RNA from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, RNA from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> fails to induce avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The fact that exposure to bacterial sRNAs only accounts for ~25% of the avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa,</italic> and that they have no role in avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, suggests that another pathway is required to induce pathogen avoidance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> follows anterior intestinal distention and is independent of virulence</title><p>Two other potential pathways for induction of avoidance are sensation of intestinal distention or bacterial metabolites. The bacterial metabolite serrawettin W2 is responsible for the avoidance of <italic>S. marcescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pradel et al., 2007</xref>). Even though secondary metabolites phenazine-1-carboxamide and pyochelin produced by <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are insufficient for the elicitation of pathogen avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Singh and Aballay, 2019a</xref>), they are sensed by <italic>C. elegans</italic> as they elicit induction of DAF-7/TGF-β in ASJ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>). However, <italic>E. faecalis</italic> does not increase expression of DAF-7 in the ASJ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>), further strengthening the idea that direct contact with this pathogen rather than metabolite sensing induces avoidance.</p><p>To determine whether intestinal distention plays a role in avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, we measured the diameter of the intestinal lumen of animals fed either <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, or <italic>E. faecalis</italic> grown on BHI. There was significant expansion of the anterior part of the intestine of animals feeding on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> even at 1 hr, with distention persisting at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The medial part of the intestine was not significantly distended at 1 hr compared to animals fed <italic>E. coli</italic>, but was distended at 2 and 4 hr. The anterior part of the intestine was slightly distended in animals feeding on <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> compared to <italic>E. coli</italic> at 4 hr, but was otherwise not distended. Both parts of the intestine, but especially the anterior portion, were filled with live <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, as determined through the use of an <italic>E. faecalis</italic> strain expressing GFP, while the intestine of animals fed <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> expressing GFP were relatively empty and not distended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Because we first measured the anterior intestinal diameter at 1 hr, it was not clear whether distention preceded avoidance or vice versa. To explore this, we tracked animals until they left a lawn of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and measured their anterior intestines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These animals had significantly larger anterior intestines compared to animals that remained on the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> lawn. It is therefore likely that fast accumulation of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in the anterior intestine induces an aversive response to the pathogen, leading to avoidance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Anterior intestinal distention elicits avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative photomicrographs of animals at 4 hr on BHI media with <italic>E. coli</italic> (left), <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (middle), or <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (right).

We then placed the anesthetic sodium azide on the test plate surface underneath the bacteria plugs and placed animals in the center of the plate, allowing them to migrate toward one side or the other. This revealed a naïve preference for the odor of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> over <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). Both <italic>tax-2(p671)</italic> and <italic>tax-4(p678)</italic> mutants displayed decreased naïve odor preferences but <italic>tax-2(p694)</italic> did not. This result is consistent with the idea that the <italic>tax-2</italic> and <italic>tax-4</italic> expressing neurons AWB and AWC are responsible for establishing the naïve odor preference. Indeed, ablating them also resulted in a decreased preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). We next asked whether trained animals that were allowed to ingest <italic>E. faecalis</italic> would switch their odor preference. The animals were trained by exposing them to <italic>E. faecalis</italic> for 4 hr using the same plate setup that had been used for the avoidance assays. Then, the trained animals were transferred to the lid-choice testing plates. A marked shift in preference was observed for trained wild-type animals that was not seen in <italic>tax-2(p671)</italic>, <italic>tax-4(p678)</italic>, or AWB- and AWC-ablated strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left). The <italic>tax-2(p694)</italic> mutants, on the other hand, behaved like wild-type animals. The learning index for each strain also highlights that aversive olfactory learning takes place in wild-type and <italic>tax-2(p694)</italic> animals but not in <italic>tax-2(p671)</italic> or <italic>tax-4(p678)</italic> mutants or AWB- and AWC-ablated strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right).

Animals were then transferred to a choice plate, spotted with the attractive odorant on one side and ethanol on the other, and were allowed to roam for 1 hr before scoring. Results were compared to a naïve group that had no exposure to the odorant. Naïve animals displayed a strong attraction to benzaldehyde that was significantly reduced upon training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>). As benzaldehyde is primarily sensed by AWC neurons, ablation of these cells led to a decrease in naïve attraction, with training leading to no additional decrease. Interestingly, animals with ablated AWB neurons displayed wild-type levels of naïve attraction but did not show a decrease in attraction upon training, indicating that AWB neurons may be required for this aversive learning process.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The TRPM channels <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> are required for distention-induced pathogen avoidance</title><p>It remains unclear how <italic>C. elegans</italic> senses intestinal distention in order to execute pathogen avoidance, either for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> or for <italic>E. faecalis.</italic> Because TRP channels could be mechanoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiao and Xu, 2011</xref>) capable of sensing the intestinal distension caused by microbial colonization, we screened animals with loss-of-function mutations in five TRP-encoding genes for avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and found that two members of the TRPM subfamily, <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic>, negatively affected avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> uses different mechanisms that involve intestine-wide distention, germline mediated-signaling, and sensing of bacterial sRNAs via an ASI neuronal pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Thus, bacterial context is important for the elicitation of pathogen avoidance behaviors. This context dependence makes it likely that using <italic>C. elegans</italic> may lead to the discovery of new components of sensory pathways involved in pathogen avoidance and help to elucidate how physiological information from the site of infection is relayed to the nervous system. This was indeed highlighted by the identification of ASE neurons and GTL-2 as being necessary for avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> but not <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and the requirement of the germline in avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> but not <italic>E. faecalis.</italic></p><p>The decision to leave a bacterial lawn represents a dynamic balance between risk and reward for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, with feeding and food choice being critical for survival and propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kiyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Milward et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shtonda and Avery, 2006</xref>). Initially, the balance may be toward staying on the lawn, as it could be an area of high reward in the form of food. However, depending on the quality of the food, its availability, and its potential noxious qualities, the balance may swing toward bacterial avoidance, as the lawn becomes either an area of low reward (depleted or low-quality) or an area of high risk (pathogenic). The frequent entering and exiting events of animals on lawns of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) may be indicative of this dynamic balance. Multiple sensory inputs or physiological states such as oxygen level, odors, tastes, mechanosensation, pain, and hunger must be integrated in order to evaluate the environment and come to a decision. These cues are most likely integrated in the interneurons of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which are downstream of the sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metaxakis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Summers et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The involvement of ASE neurons, largely described as gustatory neurons, in the avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) suggests that taste may play a role in pathogen avoidance in <italic>C. elegans</italic> in certain contexts. ASE neurons have also been shown to be carbon dioxide sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bretscher et al., 2011</xref>), and polymodal sensory neurons are common in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kaplan and Horvitz, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Metaxakis et al., 2018</xref>), raising the possibility that ASE sensation of carbon dioxide, and not gustation, may elicit avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>. Additionally, a recent study implicated ASEL as a secondary sensory neuron in the detection of the food odor benzaldehyde (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leinwand et al., 2015</xref>). The results of the olfactory aversive learning experiments, however, suggest that ASE neurons are not involved in the olfactory component of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance. Whether they are involved in some other learning process underpinning avoidance remains unclear. Interestingly, AWC neurons are also recruited into a salt-sensing circuit via neuropeptide signaling from ASE neurons depending on salt concentration changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leinwand and Chalasani, 2013</xref>), leaving open the possibility that AWC neurons also play a role in avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) not only through olfactory aversive learning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>) but also through taste aversive learning. Further studies will need to be conducted to determine which possible sensory modality is important for ASE-dependent and AWC-dependent avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.

Interestingly, both AWB and AWC neurons were previously shown to play a role in avoidance of normally attractive food following undernourishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Olofsson, 2014</xref>), providing another link between pathogen avoidance behavior and foraging. Furthermore, in a recent study, the transcription factor Nrf2/<italic>skn-1</italic> was shown to be required in the AIY interneuron for the integration of information from ASE and AWC neurons during foraging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>).

Previous work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has also revealed olfactory-mediated avoidance of harmful microbes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>), illustrating that similar mechanisms are at play across different species.</p><p>The discovery of <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> playing a role in pathogen avoidance is novel. The most well-known impact of loss of <italic>gon-2</italic> function is severe impairment of gonadogenesis due to disruption of gonadal cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun and Lambie, 1997</xref>). This impairment is most likely responsible for the results observed for avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), as the germline and associated tissues are necessary for this avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaletsky et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">TeKippe and Aballay, 2010</xref>). The results of the <italic>glp-1</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>) further support this idea. However, the germline seems to play no role in avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, and therefore other functions of <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> may be responsible. The germline plays a role in a transgenerational learned avoidance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moore et al., 2019</xref>), but the lack of involvement of the germline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), bacterial sRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and ASI neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) in avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> suggests that such a process may not exist in the case of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection. Because <italic>gon-2</italic> is known to be highly expressed in the intestine, where it is responsible for electrolyte homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Teramoto et al., 2005</xref>), and rescue of <italic>gon-2</italic> intestinal expression using the <italic>ges-1</italic> promoter rescues <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance phenotypes, it may function as an intestinal receptor for the changes elicited by <italic>E. faecalis</italic> colonization. Magnesium excretion, and perhaps additional electrolytes, requires the activity of <italic>gtl-2</italic> in the excretory cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teramoto et al., 2010</xref>), and rescue of <italic>gtl-2</italic> excretory cell expression using the <italic>sulp-4</italic> promoter rescues <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance phenotypes. Thus, it is possible that the role of <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> in pathogen avoidance is related to sensation of an electrolyte perturbance caused by intestinal distention. Both <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-1</italic>, though not <italic>gtl-2</italic>, are also required for maintaining the rhythm of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> defecation motor program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwan et al., 2008</xref>), which could also result in aberrant avoidance behaviors, though loss of <italic>gtl-1</italic> does not seem to affect avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Finally, these TRPM channels could also be mechano-nociceptors, as described in other animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller-Tribbensee et al., 2015</xref>), that sense intestinal distention directly, though the data presented here could also be consistent with a less direct role as described above. Indeed, TRPM channels display many distinct functions in various settings, including the absorption of calcium and magnesium ions by TRPM6 and TRPM7 in the human colon, TRPM7-mediated pacemaker activity of interstitial cells of Cajal, and colonic nociception by mouse TRPM8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mueller-Tribbensee et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear how exactly GON-2 and GTL-2 function in pathogen avoidance. Because the intestine is not directly innervated, any signal coming from it must be extra-synaptic, such as an intestinal neuropeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee and Mylonakis, 2017</xref>). All animals are under pressure to develop behaviors that allow them to flee potential pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarabian et al., 2018</xref>). Future work will continue to elucidate the mechanisms underlying avoidance of pathogenic threats.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">OP50</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> Genetics Center (CGC)</td><td valign="bottom">OP50</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">OP50-GFP</td><td valign="bottom">CGC</td><td valign="bottom">OP50-GFP</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>E. coli</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">HT115</td><td valign="bottom">Source BioScience</td><td valign="bottom">HT115</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">PA14</td><td valign="bottom">Frederick M.

described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Worthy et al., 2018</xref>) to assess odor preference alone. To do this, bacterial cultures were grown and plated as indicated in the two-choice preference assays above. Then, agar plugs with the bacterial lawns were cut from the plates and transferred to the lids of new 6-cm-diameter BHI agar plates without any bacteria, so that the bacteria on the agar plugs faced down toward the plate surface on opposite sides of the plate. Two microliters of 1 M sodium azide was spotted on the surface below each agar plug. Young gravid adult hermaphroditic animals grown on <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 (naïve) or from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF training plates were transferred to the center of plates equidistant from both agar plugs. The numbers of animals paralyzed under each agar plug were counted after 1 hr. Three 6-cm-diameter plates were used per trial in every experiment. The choice index was calculated as indicated above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Dry-drop assay</title><p>The dry-drop assay was carried out as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tran et al., 2017</xref>). Using a capillary, a dry drop of either SDS (positive control), BHI or LB (negative control), or <italic>E. faecalis</italic> or <italic>E. faecium</italic> cultures was placed on a dry SK plate in front of a forward-moving animal. A response was counted if an animal initiated backward movement. Response Index = number of responses/total number of drops.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Imaging and quantification</title><p>Fluorescence imaging was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh and Aballay, 2017</xref>) with slight modifications. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized using an M9 salt solution containing 50 mM sodium azide and mounted onto 2% agar pads. The animals were then visualized using a Leica M165 FC fluorescence stereomicroscope. For quantification of intestinal lumen distention, brightfield images were acquired at each time point using the Leica LAS v4.6 software, and the diameter of the intestinal lumen was measured using ImageJ software. For quantification of fluorescent immune reporters, fluorescent images were acquired using the Leica LAS v4.6 software in grayscale as presented, and the fluorescence intensity was measured and averaged across three points in the intestine of each animal at the indicated time points using ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The statistical analysis was performed with Prism 8 (GraphPad). For box-and-whisker plots, the center line depicts the median, and the box range depicts the first and third quartile, while the whiskers depict the minimum and maximum data points. For all box plots, individual dots represent individual trials. For time course figures, the mean and standard deviation of nine trials is depicted at each time point. All experiments were performed in triplicate on three separate days. Unpaired t-tests, one-way or two-way ANOVA with subsequent group comparisons were performed as indicated in the figure legends. In the figures, ns denotes not significant, and asterisks (*) denote statistical significance as follows: *p≤0.05; **p≤0.01; ***p≤0.001; ****p≤0.0001, as compared with the appropriate controls.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Danielle A Garsin (McGovern Medical School) for providing the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> OG1RF <italic>ΔfsrB</italic> and GFP strains.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Understanding how animals learn to avoid pathogens is an important question that bridges physiology, neuroscience, and immunity. Using the nematode <italic>C. elegans</italic>, your work identifies a fascinating mechanism that links ingestion of the pathogen <italic>E. faecalis</italic> to intestinal distention (possibly detected by TRPM channels) and subsequent aversive learning. Your results show that <italic>C. elegans</italic> uses different strategies to avoid different pathogens and will be of broad interest to researchers interested in pathogen resistance mechanisms, sensory behavior, and the intersection of these processes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TRPM channels mediate learned pathogen avoidance following intestinal distention&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Douglas Portman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael O'Donnell (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussing their evaluations, the reviewers feel that several points must be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1. All three reviewers felt that the evidence that intestinal bloating drives pathogen avoidance learning was premature and largely correlative.</p><p>a. At a minimum, more needs to be known about the site of action of gon-2 and/or gtl-2.</p><p>b. Additionally, the manuscript would be significantly improved by demonstrating that anterior bloating has an instructive role in learning, perhaps by finding way (beyond the use of nol-6 and aex-5) to trigger bloating in the absence of pathogen ingestion. Otherwise, the text will need to be revised to make it clear that the proposed role of bloating is speculative.</p><p>2. The reviewers are concerned that the role of npr-1 in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance is overstated and potentially misleading. As explained in more detail below, the available evidence suggests that the models in 5E and 7E are not the simplest explanation of the data. Specifically, the possibility that npr-1 is not a part of the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance pathway per se, but rather is a separate input that can modulate this behavior when animals are in the presence of high ambient O2, should be acknowledged in the text and figures.</p><p>3. While the paper implies that the behavioral plasticity you observe is associative learning, this has not been clearly demonstrated. The paper would be significantly improved by carrying out additional behavioral studies to determine whether associative learning is indeed taking place, as described by reviewer #2 below. Alternatively, this issue can be handled by modifying the text to be clear about the nature of the behavioral change triggered by <italic>E. faecalis</italic> exposure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The claim of the title, that &quot;TRPM channels mediate learned pathogen avoidance following intestinal distention,&quot; is not well supported. The evidence that intestinal distention is the trigger for learning is almost completely correlative. A convincing demonstration of causality, beyond the evidence provided by the nol-6 and aex-5 experiments, would significantly improve the paper.</p><p>2. The role of the two TRPM channels identified is only superficially probed. While it seems clear that their function is required for E.f. avoidance, it is not clear that their function is necessary for learning, much less that they &quot;mediate&quot; learning in response to intestinal distention. This could be improved by determining the site of action of these factors, determining whether they have a specific role in pathogen learning and olfactory plasticity (as opposed to baseline responses to a bacterial lawn), and asking if they are specifically activated by intestinal distention (though I'm not quite sure how this might be done).</p><p>3. The role of npr-1 in pathogen avoidance is overstated, if not misconstrued. As it stands, the paper shows simply that, for npr-1(lf) animals, high O2 is a more potent aversive stimulus than is E.f. This is fine, but I don't see how it leads to the idea that npr-1 activity is downstream of pathogen exposure or detection, as is indicated in Figures5E and 7E, or that pathogen avoidance is &quot;regulated&quot; by npr-1, as stated in the first sentence of the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>As I described in the public comments, this is a really excited set of findings and if the hypotheses are fully supported, I think this would result in a publication of very broad interest.</p><p>The main concerns I have are related to the strength and specificity of the assertions made in each of the major finding areas I described. They are repeated below along with some suggestions that I think could strengthen these arguments.</p><p>1. Anterior intestinal distension causes rapid behavioral avoidance.</p><p>I found the authors' previous demonstrations linking distension to behavioral avoidance in <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quite impressive and in my opinion the experiments using nol-6 to disrupt distension were particularly important in establishing that. In this case, because the behavioral avoidance is so rapid, I think demonstrating causality is even more challenging and important, if you intend to assert this as strongly as is currently written. Given its role in peptide processing, I'd suggest that solely using aex-5 mutations to establish sufficiency is not ideal here.</p><p>I recognize that there aren't currently any tools available to block bloating via <italic>E. faecalis</italic> since nol-6 RNAi does not, but more carefully comparing the temporal progression of bloating relative to behavioral changes might be the next best approach. Lawn avoidance behavior is so rapid – is it really plausible that bloating might occur in minutes? Perhaps you could measure the intestine of animals that rapidly avoid compared to those that do not to see if there is a bias? Colonization was visualized at 4hr but is suggested to cause distension, which of these occurs first?</p><p>Also, it might be that certain components of behavioral avoidance are driven by physical bloating and others are not. For example, ASE, AWC and AWB are all involved in lawn avoidance but ASE is not needed for olfactory choice.</p><p>Additionally, to more strongly rule out immune signaling, would it not be more definitive to use fshr-1, pmk-1 or bar-1 mutants?</p><p>2. Avoidance occurs via an aversive learning process.</p><p>The olfactory plasticity data shown are quite strong and convincing. My main concern is the specificity of the description of learning in this case. In my opinion, aversive learning is typically used as a shorthand to describe an associative learning paradigm. I assume the authors are not proposing some form of non-associative learning such as habituation or sensitization. For the olfactory learning process to be associative, there should be specificity to the response to odors that were present during training. In my opinion, a change in olfactory preference from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic> doesn't directly demonstrate this specificity.</p><p>One way to address this would be to pair an AWB or AWC-sensed odor with the bacteria during training, then test if responses to this odor is specifically altered. If it turns out that this is not associative learning, this would still be quite interesting as it might indicate there are mechanisms to generally downregulate attraction to distension-causing bacteria – but this type of scenario should probably be referred to as some sort of state-dependent plasticity, as opposed to learning. If the effect is associative, can you rule out a satiety effect? Are the AWC/AWC dependent behaviors related to learning while the ASE effects are not? This concern might be solved by altering the text or interpretations.</p><p>3. Intestinal gon-2 and gtl-2 may sense intestinal bloating.</p><p>In my opinion, this section represents potentially the most exciting finding but also the area in which the data are currently least strong. While you haven't directly stated that these channels are intestinal bloating sensors, this is strongly implied and/or suggested throughout the manuscript and impact statements.</p><p>While gon-2 and gtl-2 are strongly expressed in the intestine, they are also expressed in other tissues, which might include neurons. To establish their site of action they should perform tissue specific rescue experiments.</p><p>Are the intestines of gon-2/gtl-2 mutants distended when grown on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> or is colonization affected?</p><p>If these channels act in the intestine, short of directly demonstrating a sensory function, it seems reasonable that they could play many different roles, which should probably be acknowledged in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The title of this paper emphasizes their discovery of TRPM channels in this learned pathogen avoidance response. I thought their characterization of the neural circuitry involved is equally important and could be emphasized instead in the title. To further characterize the TRPM channels, the authors could consider demonstrating that GON2 and GTL-2 function in the intestine (through intestinal expression in the mutant background), which would support their hypothesis nicely. Alternatively, the authors could further implicate these loci by rescuing the avoidance phenotype by expressing these genes under their own promoters in the mutant background.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65935.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>After discussing their evaluations, the reviewers feel that several points must be addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>1.

To learn more about the site of action of <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> we generated the following rescue strains: <italic>gon-2(q388); gon-2p::gon-2(cDNA)::SL2::GFP, gon-2(q388); ges1p::gon-2(cDNA)::SL2::GFP, gtl-2(n2618); gtl-2p::gtl-2(cDNA)::SL2::GFP,</italic> and <italic>gtl-2(n2618); sulp-4p::gtl-2(cDNA)::SL2:GFP</italic>. The <italic>ges-1</italic> promoter drives expression in the intestine while the <italic>sulp-4</italic> promoter drives expression in the excretory cell. We used these strains in <italic>E. faecalis</italic> avoidance assays and found that the expression of <italic>gon-2</italic> and <italic>gtl-2</italic> rescued the avoidance defects (New Figure 7C and D). The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“In addition to gonadal expression, gon-2 is known to exhibit intestinal expression (Teramoto et al., 2005).

The title for this section now reads: “Avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> follows anterior intestinal distention and is independent of virulence”.</p><p>However, following the suggestion of Reviewer 2, we took a more detailed look at the temporal relationship between distention and avoidance. To do this, animals were placed on avoidance assay plates with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and then monitored for when they first left the lawn. These animals were then immediately transferred to agarose pads for imaging, along with animals that were still on the lawn. The anterior intestinal diameter of both groups of animals was then measured. Importantly, animals outside the lawn had much larger anterior intestines (New Figure 2 – Supplement 1). This supports the notion that anterior intestinal distention triggers flight from the lawn. The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“Because we first measured the anterior intestinal diameter at 1 hour, it was not clear whether distention preceded avoidance or vice versa. […] It is therefore likely that fast accumulation of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in the anterior intestine induces an aversive response to the pathogen, leading to avoidance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The reference to NPR-1 in the title of this section has been removed, and the language has been changed throughout the manuscript to reflect that NPR-1 regulated hyperoxia avoidance opposes avoidance of <italic>E.f</italic> but does not necessarily fit into the avoidance pathway. This section now reads:</p><p>“Furthermore, when animals were taken out of the low oxygen environment and allowed to roam at atmospheric oxygen levels for one-hour, wild-type animals remained off the <italic>E. faecalis</italic> lawns while both npr-1(lf) strains migrated back onto the lawns (Figure 4C) indicating that hyperoxia avoidance is a more potent aversive stimulus than <italic>E. faecalis</italic> in npr-1(lf) animals.”</p><p>In addition, the models have been modified as suggested (New Figures 5E and 8E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Specifically, we paired the attractive odorant benzaldehyde with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and subsequently carried out odor chemotaxis assays with these trained animals, as well as naïve animals, to test if a negative association had formed during training (New Figure 8C). The data shows that wild-type animals do form a negative association, while both naïve and trained animals lacking AWC neurons show no attraction. Interestingly, naïve animals lacking AWB had the same attraction to benzaldehyde as wild-type animals, but trained animals lacking AWB showed no associative learning (New Figure 8D and E). The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“To strengthen the idea that avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> involves aversive learning, we paired an attractive odorant, benzaldehyde, with lawns of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and exposed animals to this pairing for four hours (Figure 6C).

This finding supports the notion that distention triggers flight away from the bacterial lawn, as most of the animals which had just left the lawn showed distended anterior intestines, while those still inside the lawn did not.

This revealed that expression of <italic>gon-2</italic> in intestine and <italic>gtl-2</italic> in the excretory cell rescued the avoidance phenotype. The revised manuscript reads:</p><p>“In addition to gonadal expression, gon-2 is known to exhibit intestinal expression (Teramoto et al., 2005). To confirm this, we generated a strain expressing gon-2::GFP under the gon-2 promoter, which revealed expression in the gonads and intestine (Figure 7 – supplement 2). […] Together, these results indicate that gon-2 expression in the intestine and gtl-2 expression in the excretory cell is sufficient for <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.”</p><p>These mutants show the same anterior intestinal distention as wild-type animals on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (New Figure 8 – Supplement 1).

The manuscript now reads:</p><p>“If these TRPM channels are somewhat involved in sensing anterior intestinal distention caused by <italic>E. faecalis</italic> infection, their loss should leave naïve olfactory preferences to E.</p><p>faecalis intact while diminishing negative associative learning. […] Altogether, these findings indicate that GON-2 and GTL-2 are required for the learned avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, though their exact mechanistic role remains to be determined (Figure 8E).”</p><p>This olfactory aversive learning is almost certainly a form of negative associative learning as demonstrated by newly performed odor-pairing experiments with benzaldehyde and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (New Figure 6C-E). The new relevant section of the manuscript reads:</p><p>“To strengthen the idea that avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> involves aversive learning, we paired an attractive odorant, benzaldehyde, with lawns of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and exposed animals to this pairing for four hours (Figure 6C). […] Interestingly, animals with ablated AWB neurons displayed wild-type levels of naïve attraction but did not show a decrease in attraction upon training, indicating that AWB neurons may be required for this aversive learning process.”</p><p>We also find the question of how these channels are activated intriguing, but believe that addressing it is outside the scope of an already broad manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

We thus tested <italic>fshr-1, pmk-1,</italic> and <italic>bar-1</italic> mutants as suggested and found that none of them affected avoidance behaviors (New Figure 3 – Supplement 1). This is consistent with the dispensability of <italic>pmk-1</italic> and <italic>fshr-1</italic> for general aversive behavior [Kaletsky et al. 2020; Lee and Mylonakis 2017; Melo and Ruvkun 2013]. The revised manuscript reads: “Furthermore, loss-of-function mutants for three key immune signaling genes, pmk-1, fshr-1, and bar-1, displayed wild-type levels of avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Avoidance occurs via an aversive learning process.</p><p>The olfactory plasticity data shown are quite strong and convincing. My main concern is the specificity of the description of learning in this case. In my opinion, aversive learning is typically used as a shorthand to describe an associative learning paradigm. I assume the authors are not proposing some form of non-associative learning such as habituation or sensitization. For the olfactory learning process to be associative, there should be specificity to the response to odors that were present during training. In my opinion, a change in olfactory preference from <italic>E. faecalis</italic> to <italic>E. coli</italic> doesn't directly demonstrate this specificity.</p><p>One way to address this would be to pair an AWB or AWC-sensed odor with the bacteria during training, then test if responses to this odor is specifically altered. If it turns out that this is not associative learning, this would still be quite interesting as it might indicate there are mechanisms to generally downregulate attraction to distension-causing bacteria – but this type of scenario should probably be referred to as some sort of state-dependent plasticity, as opposed to learning. If the effect is associative, can you rule out a satiety effect? Are the AWC/AWC dependent behaviors related to learning while the ASE effects are not? This concern might be solved by altering the text or interpretations.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very helpful suggestion and we set out to test exactly what was described: pair an attractive odor, benzaldehyde, with <italic>E. faecalis</italic> during training and then conduct odor chemotaxis assays for benzaldehyde, comparing trained vs. naïve animal chemotaxis (New Figures 6C-E). Doing so revealed that wild-type animals do form a negative association between the odor and <italic>E. faecalis</italic> exposure, such that chemotaxis to the normally attractive benzaldehyde is reduced. Interestingly, while animals with AWC ablated neurons were not even able to establish the naïve preference, animals with AWB ablated neurons were, but they were not able to form the negative association. The manuscript reads:</p><p>“To strengthen the idea that avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> involves aversive learning, we paired an attractive odorant, benzaldehyde, with lawns of <italic>E. faecalis</italic> and exposed animals to this pairing for four hours (Figure 6C). […] Interestingly, animals with ablated AWB neurons displayed wild-type levels of naïve attraction but did not show a decrease in attraction upon training, indicating that AWB neurons may be required for this aversive learning process.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Intestinal gon-2 and gtl-2 may sense intestinal bloating.</p><p>In my opinion, this section represents potentially the most exciting finding but also the area in which the data are currently least strong. While you haven't directly stated that these channels are intestinal bloating sensors, this is strongly implied and/or suggested throughout the manuscript and impact statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken the suggestion and toned down the language and raised other possibilities throughout the manuscript. For example the introduction now states:</p><p>“While no mechanoreceptors have been found to be functional in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> intestine, it does express transient receptor (TRP) channels which could act as mechanoreceptors (Xiao and Xu, 2011). However, TRP channels are known to play many other roles, including but not limited to taste, thermoregulation, ion homeostasis, and pacemaker activity (Holzer, 2011).”</p><p>The Discussion section now reads:</p><p>“However, TRPM channels display many distinct functions in various settings, including the absorption of calcium and magnesium ions by TRPM6 and TRPM7 in the human colon, TRPM7-mediated pacemaker activity of interstitial cells of Cajal, and colonic nociception by mouse TRPM8 (Holzer, 2011; Mueller-Tribbensee et al., 2015). Thus, it remains unclear how exactly GON-2 and GTL-2 function in pathogen avoidance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While gon-2 and gtl-2 are strongly expressed in the intestine, they are also expressed in other tissues, which might include neurons. To establish their site of action they should perform tissue specific rescue experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed tissue specific rescue and conducted avoidance assays, showing that rescue in intestine for <italic>gon-2</italic>, and excretory cell for <italic>gtl-2</italic> is sufficient for avoidance behaviors (New Figures 7C and D). This does not rule out a role for these genes in other cell types, though previously published reports have implicated these tissues in other processes (Kwan et al., 2008; Teramoto et al., 2005). The section describing these new findings has been written to reflect this possibility:</p><p>“In addition to gonadal expression, gon-2 is known to exhibit intestinal expression (Teramoto et al., 2005). […] Together, these results indicate that gon-2 expression in the intestine and gtl-2 expression in the excretory cell is sufficient for <italic>C. elegans</italic> avoidance of <italic>E. faecalis</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are the intestines of gon-2/gtl-2 mutants distended when grown on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> or is colonization affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included pictures and measurements showing that these mutants are indeed distended when grown on <italic>E. faecalis</italic> (New Figure 8 – Supplement 1). The revised manuscript reads: <italic>“</italic>Because gon-2(lf) and gtl-2(lf) animals display wild-type levels of anterior intestinal distention (Figure 8—figure supplement 1) …”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If these channels act in the intestine, short of directly demonstrating a sensory function, it seems reasonable that they could play many different roles, which should probably be acknowledged in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>See response above where we have highlighted other possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The title of this paper emphasizes their discovery of TRPM channels in this learned pathogen avoidance response. I thought their characterization of the neural circuitry involved is equally important and could be emphasized instead in the title. To further characterize the TRPM channels, the authors could consider demonstrating that GON2 and GTL-2 function in the intestine (through intestinal expression in the mutant background), which would support their hypothesis nicely. Alternatively, the authors could further implicate these loci by rescuing the avoidance phenotype by expressing these genes under their own promoters in the mutant background.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Essential Revisions, we have driven expression for both genes using their own promoters and using an intestinal promoter for <italic>gon-2</italic> and an excretory cell promoter for <italic>gtl-2</italic>, and conducted avoidance assays (New Figure 8C and D). Doing so established that expression in these tissues was sufficient for rescuing the avoidance phenotype. We believe that the discovery of these TRPM channels being involved in learned pathogen avoidance is the most exciting part of the study, with the new experiments performed further strengthening this argument. We have thus kept the original title. The revised manuscript reads:</p><p>“In addition to gonadal expression, gon-2 is known to exhibit intestinal expression (Teramoto et al., 2005).
