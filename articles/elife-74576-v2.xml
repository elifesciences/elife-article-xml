receptor (β-AR) blockade has been shown to improve heart functions in response to injury; however, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we inhibited β-AR signaling in the heart using metoprolol, a cardio-selective β blocker for β1-adrenergic receptor (β1-AR) to examine its role in heart maturation and regeneration in postnatal mice. We found that metoprolol enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced scar formation and improved cardiac function. Moreover, the increased cardiomyocyte proliferation was also induced by the genetic deletion of <italic>Gnas</italic>, the gene encoding G protein alpha subunit (Gαs), a downstream effector of β-AR. Genome wide transcriptome analysis revealed that the Hippo-effector YAP, which is associated with immature cardiomyocyte proliferation, was upregulated in the cardiomyocytes of β-blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts. Moreover, the increased YAP activity is modulated by RhoA signaling. Our pharmacological and genetic studies reveal that β1-AR-Gαs-YAP signaling axis is involved in regulating postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. These results suggest that inhibiting β-AR-Gαs signaling promotes the regenerative capacity and extends the cardiac regenerative window in juvenile mice by activating YAP-mediated transcriptional programs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cardiomyocyte proliferation</kwd><kwd>hear regeneration</kwd><kwd>adrenergic signaling</kwd><kwd>hippo pathway</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL-132211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xin</surname><given-names>Mei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Pharmacological and genetic blockade of β1-AR-Gαs signaling prolongs the cardiac regenerative window in juvenile mouse by activating YAP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The capacity to regenerate and repair in response to cardiac injury in the adult mammalian heart is limited.

To investigate whether blockade β1-AR specifically has a significant effect on cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration, we injected the β1-AR blocker metoprolol (hereinafter, referred to as “β-blocker”) into mice for two weeks starting at postnatal day (P) 1 via daily intraperitoneal injection (IP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).

Since metoprolol has a short half-life of 3–7 hr, it should be metabolized during these 4 days.

Recent studies have also demonstrated that oxidative stress after birth is one driver for cell cycle arrest in neonatal cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kimura et al., 2015</xref>. Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms of postnatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle withdrawal are not fully understood. In the present study, we found that Gαs signaling activity was correlated with loss of proliferative or regenerative ability of neonatal cardiomyocytes, and inhibition of Gαs activity promotes mono-nucleated cardiomyocyte division and cardiac regeneration through YAP transcriptional activity after the regenerative window. In the canonical Hippo signaling pathway, the major YAP regulators are the LATS1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate and inhibit YAP activity. A previous study reported a model that Rho GTPases inhibit LATS1/2 activity through actin cytoskeleton organization and activate YAP transcriptional activity. Therefore, we consider that Gαs-Rho-cytoskeleton-LATS pathway inhibits YAP and induces loss of proliferative or regenerative ability during cardiomyocyte maturation. Together, inhibition of Gαs induces the de-differentiation of mature cardiomyocytes to an immature state and reactivates YAP transcriptional activity to extend the regeneration window.</p><p>It has been shown that cardiac Gαs regulates heart rate and myocardial contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Molkentin and Dorn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tilley and Rockman, 2011</xref>. However, the role of Gαs in cardiomyocytes proliferation is still unclear. Our cardiomyocyte-specific <italic>Gnas</italic> KO mice showed an enlarged heart phenotype with an increase in cardiomyocyte proliferation at the juvenile stage. Conversely, transgenic mice overexpressing Gαs displayed myocardial hypertrophy with increased myocardial collagen content and fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iwase et al., 1997</xref>. Together, these results suggest that Gαs plays an important role in maintaining cardiomyocyte homeostasis.</p><p>Several signals such as mechanical and oxidative stress have been identified as regulators of the Hippo signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehtinen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geng et al., 2015</xref>. YAP is known as a mechanical sensor due to its ability to alter its localization in response to various environmental stimuli, including alternation of cytoskeletal dynamics and blood flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vite et al., 2018</xref>. We found that treatment of cultured cardiomyocytes with a Rho inhibitor hinders YAP activity. This is consistent with a previous study showing that the Rho-mediated pathway promotes nuclear localization of YAP in human embryonic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yu et al., 2012</xref>. At present, it is still unclear whether Rho directly regulates YAP activity in cardiomyocytes. A previous report using a cardiomyocyte-specific RhoA transgene revealed heart rate depression and decreased cardiomyocyte contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sah et al., 1999</xref>. We found that RhoA activity was gradually downregulated between P0 and P14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), and heart rate gradually increased from ~250 beats/min at P0 to ~550 beats/min at P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sato, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). During this period, YAP translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, suggesting that RhoA may regulate YAP activity by inhibiting cardiomyocyte contraction rate.</p><p>β-AR signaling has been shown to increase cardiac output by enhancing heart rate and contractility via activation of Gαs protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Salazar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>. β1-AR is expressed in all cardiomyocytes with equal distribution between the left and right ventricles. On the other hand, β2-AR is not only expressed in the cardiomyocytes, but also in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle cells in multiple tissues. Both β1- and β2-AR are coupled to GαS, while β2-AR can be coupled to Gαi/o as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tilley and Rockman, 2011</xref>. Stimulation of β1-AR results in adenylyl cyclase-mediated cAMP generation and activation of PKA, MAP kinase, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CAMKII) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bers, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oestreich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mangmool et al., 2010</xref>. Clinical studies have indicated that β-blockers, especially the β1-AR-specific blocker, metoprolol, improve cardiac function and reduce mortality in patients with heart failure and MI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">MERIT-HF Study group, 1999</xref>. However, mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of β-blockers in heart failure patients are poorly understood. A recent study indicated that in heart failure patients, YAP activity is inactivated by phosphorylation, and that blocking the inhibitory kinase LATS1/2 can reverse heart failure post-MI in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leach et al., 2017</xref>. Similarly, we demonstrate that at the juvenile stage, β-blocker treatment could promote nuclear YAP translocation and cardiac regeneration after MI. Given that YAP activity enhances cardiac regeneration and promotes survival post-MI in our mouse models, activation of Hippo-YAP signaling might be one of the reasons why β-blocker treatment is able to improve heart function in patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse experiments</title><p>All animal experiments were performed with the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Enzo R. Porrello as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Cardio-protection vs regeneration: The authors conclude that their results &quot;suggest that β blockade improves cardiac function by promoting cardiac regeneration in the injured heart&quot;. However, effects on CM proliferation are fairly modest (~0.3% pH3-positive CM following MI at P7) and it is unclear whether improvements in cardiac function/fibrosis post-MI are due to induction of CM proliferation. Moreover, the authors have not excluded an acute cardioprotective effect post-MI. Infarct size should be assessed (e.g. using tetrazolium chloride staining) and quantified acutely post-MI (e.g 24 hrs) to distinguish acute cardioprotective effects from bona fide regeneration. If the authors have access to cardiac MRI, this could be used to prove remuscularization has occurred post-MI.</p><p>2) Cardiomyocyte proliferation: Additional data are required to demonstrate bona fide cardiomyocyte division following β blockade and Gnas loss-of-function. AurkB staining should be performed to identify cardiomyocytes undergoing cytokinesis, which should be used as a marker for CM division as per other publications in the field. In addition, Supp Figure 1D (quantification of cardiomyocyte number following β blocker treatment) is a critical experiment and should be presented in the main data panels of Figure 1.</p><p>3) Given the potential clinical significance and therapeutic implications of the current findings, the authors should determine whether β blockers are sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in adult mice.</p><p>4) Additional biochemical evidence is required to demonstrate Yap translocation to the nucleus in Supplemental Figure 5. Immunofluorescence images provided in Supplemental Figures 5 d&amp;f are difficult to interpret. Nuclear translocation of the factor, which is essential for its activation, is not shown here biochemically. On the contrary, the authors show that there is nuclear YAP in basal conditions by immunofluorescence, while this drops to virtually null after epinephrine treatment (bar chart in Suppl. Figure 5f). Incidentally, the over 30% nuclear positivity shown in the graph in basal conditions is difficult to reconcile with the lack of nuclear staining in Suppl. Figure 5b.</p><p>5) Please clarify the connection of canonical Hippo signaling and the RhoA effect on Yap. In the current manuscript the mechanistic connection remains somewhat vague. In the original Yu Cell paper from 2021 there is a connection to cytoskeleton. Is that the case here?</p><p>6) The authors refer to effects of β blocker treatment on &quot;neonatal heart regeneration&quot;. This terminology could be confusing as it is most commonly used to describe experiments in P1 (regenerative) neonatal mice not P7 (non-regenerative) mice. For clarity, it is suggested that the authors rephrase these statements to refer to &quot;prolongation of the regenerative window&quot; in neonatal mice.</p><p>7) On several occasions the authors refer to expression of b1-AR specifically in the heart. Is it known whether b1-AR expression is restricted to cardiomyocytes and/or whether it is developmentally regulated from neonatal to adult stages? These data are important with regards to interpretation of systemic metoprolol administration studies. These data should be provided or cited from relevant literature.</p><p>8) Β blocker treatment and Gas knockout were both associated with repression of fatty acid oxidation and induction of glycolysis. Are these metabolic transcriptional programs dependent on RhoA/Yap signaling?</p><p>9) It would be helpful if the authors showed the overlap between β blocker and Gas KO RNA-seq data sets as a Venn diagram in Figure 4 (or associated Supplementary Figure).

In addition, the Discussion should be tempered to account for alternative physiological mechanisms mediating therapeutic effects observed post-MI in addition to regeneration (e.g. immunomodulation, inhibition of cell death, angiogenesis, reduced contractile loading, improved coronary flow, etc).</p><p>2. It is unclear why experiments were not performed in adult mice to determine whether β blockade or Gas loss-of-function are sufficient to induce adult cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry. Given the potential clinical significance and therapeutic implications of the authors findings, this experiment would significantly strengthen the paper.</p><p>3.

The use of cardiac MRI to prove remuscularization, should the authors have a microMRI available, the study of BrdU incorporation, the evidence for aurora B localization in midbodies would all strengthen the claim for regeneration.</p><p>An additional set of required experiments concerns YAP, as in my earlier text.

Interestingly, metoprolol robustly enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration post myocardial infarction, resulting in reduced scar formation and improved cardiac function. The conclusion was also supported by genetic deletion of Gnas. CMs had an immature cell state with enhanced activity of Hippo-effector YAP. They also find that increased YAP activity is modulated by RhoA.</p><p>Comments</p><p>1) AurkB should be used as a marker for CM division as per other publications in the field.

Please clarify.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Inhibition of adrenergic β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation through activation of RhoA-YAP axis&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Didier Stainier (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>As you will see from the reviewer comments below, there continue to be some concerns about the lack of definitive evidence for cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration in this study. Additional data are required to unequivocally demonstrate that adrenergic β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation including full progression through cytokinesis. Moreover, as metoprolol is not sufficient to induce adult cardiomyocyte proliferation, the authors' conclusions need to be substantially toned down to reflect the restricted effects on cardiac regeneration in the neonatal period. In addition, reviewer 2's remaining concerns about the biochemical validation of YAP activation should be directly addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have essentially NOT responded to my comments. First, there is no additional evidence of cardiomyocyte proliferation in this revised version of the manuscript. The images for histone H3 phosphorylation show few positive cells, the identity of which remains debatable. The authors themselves admit that there are so few Aurora B positive cells that not even statistical assessment can be attempted. These findings do not support the statement that &quot;metoprolol robustly enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration (abstract)&quot;. In addition, the new experiment in adult mice (asked by another reviewer) shows that the drug does NOT induce regeneration. Hence, the whole message of the manuscript is quite deceptive.</p><p>Second, as far as YAP activation is concerned, I asked for molecular or biochemical evidence of nuclear translocation (for example, by cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation). This was not provided, while the IF images remain doubtful (cf. my original comments). YAP is known to also regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which could explain some of the findings presented in this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74576.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Cardio-protection vs regeneration: The authors conclude that their results &quot;suggest that β blockade improves cardiac function by promoting cardiac regeneration in the injured heart&quot;.

As reviewer mentioned that some papers reported the cardioprotective effect of b-blocker, but it is still controversial. To address this question, we performed TTC staining to measure the infarct size 24 hrs post-MI (cardiac MRI is not available in our institute). We observed ischemic area in both saline and b-blocker treated hearts, and there is no significant difference of ischemic area between them, suggesting that the b-blocker (metoprolol) may not have any cardioprotective effects at this neonatal period. We added the data in Supplemental Figure3.</p><p>Previous studies regarding neonatal heart regeneration showed that promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation can reduce the infarct size and improve cardiac function post MI. The range of percentage of proliferating CM was 0.1-0.3% (Mahmoud et al., 2013; Nakada et al., 2017; Leach et al., 2017). This range is the same as what we observed in b-blocker-treated MI hearts, it is appropriate to say that β blockade improves cardiac function by promoting cardiac regeneration in the injured heart.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cardiomyocyte proliferation: Additional data are required to demonstrate bona fide cardiomyocyte division following β blockade and Gnas loss-of-function. AurkB staining should be performed to identify cardiomyocytes undergoing cytokinesis, which should be used as a marker for CM division as per other publications in the field. In addition, Supp Figure 1D (quantification of cardiomyocyte number following β blocker treatment) is a critical experiment and should be presented in the main data panels of Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed AurkB staining using P14 control, b-blocker-treated, and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts. We didn’t observe any AurkB-positive CMs in the control hearts, whereas b-blocker-treated or <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts showed a few AurkB-positive CMs. Since AurkB-postive CM is rare (one or two AurkB-positive CMs per section), it is hard to perform the statistical analysis. Therefore, we included the AurkB staining images in Supplemental Figure1d and Supplemental Figure 4b. Also, we moved the quantification data of cardiomyocyte number from the original Supplemental Fig1D to Fig1F in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the potential clinical significance and therapeutic implications of the current findings, the authors should determine whether β blockers are sufficient to induce cardiomyocyte cell cycle re-entry and cardiac regeneration following myocardial infarction in adult mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer mentioned, we performed MI surgery using adult mice to investigate whether b-blocker is sufficient to induce cardiac regeneration. We observed huge ischemic area in both the control and b-blocker-treated hearts as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. Therefore, in the adult stage, b-blocker treatment may not be sufficient to promote cardiac regeneration. Recent study showed that combination treatment with a/b-blocker and thyroid hormone inhibitor enhanced cardiomyocyte regeneration after MI surgery at P14 when the regeneration window has already closed, suggesting that it may need additional drug to promote cardiac regeneration at adult stage.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74576-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Additional biochemical evidence is required to demonstrate Yap translocation to the nucleus in Supplemental Figure 5. Immunofluorescence images provided in Supplemental Figures 5 d&amp;f are difficult to interpret. Nuclear translocation of the factor, which is essential for its activation, is not shown here biochemically. On the contrary, the authors show that there is nuclear YAP in basal conditions by immunofluorescence, while this drops to virtually null after epinephrine treatment (bar chart in Suppl. Figure 5f). Incidentally, the over 30% nuclear positivity shown in the graph in basal conditions is difficult to reconcile with the lack of nuclear staining in Suppl. Figure 5b.</p></disp-quote><p>In the canonical Hippo signaling pathway, the major YAP regulators are the LATS1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate and inhibit YAP activity. In this paper, we found that loss of Gas function up-regulates RhoA activity in cardiomyocytes. Previous paper (Yu et al., Cell, 2012) reported a model that Rho GTPases inhibit LATS1/2 activity through actin cytoskeleton organization and thereby promote YAP activation. From these results, we consider that Gas-Rho-cytoskeleton-LATS signaling pathway regulates YAP activity in neonatal cardiomyocytes. However, it is still unclear the mechanisms by which actin cytoskeleton controls LATS1/2 activity, therefore further investigation is required to solve the question. We added a Discussion section about the signaling pathway that regulates YAP activity in cardiomyocytes.</p><p>We apologize for having an incorrect information regarding the epinephrin treated hearts in the figure legend of Supplemental Figure5. We used “P4 pups” for this experiment instead of “P7 pups” as indicated in the original figure legend. We have made corrections in the new figure legend. As it’s shown in Supplemental Figure6b, YAP localized in the nucleus at P4 when the regeneration window is still open; however, YAP translated to the cytoplasm at P7 when the regeneration window closed. We hypothesized that this cytoplasmic YAP translocation is promoted by b1-AR-Gas signaling pathway. To test our hypothesis, we injected epinephrin into “P4 pups” and we observed cytoplasmic YAP translocation in the WT hearts, but not in the <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts. These data indicate that b1-AR stimulation promotes cytoplasmic YAP localization through Gas. The immunostaining results in Supplemental Figure6c using “P17 hearts” confirms our hypothesis. <italic>Gnas</italic> deletion leads to YAP nuclear localization when YAP has already translocated to the cytoplasm at P17 in the control mice.</p><p>Additionally, we performed western blotting analysis using hearts from P4 to P9 and found that phospho-YAP level increased as the heart regeneration window closed. This result correlates with the immunostaining data confirming that YAP nuclear localization correlates with heart regenerative capacity. This piece of data is in the new Supplemental Fig6a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please clarify the connection of canonical Hippo signaling and the RhoA effect on Yap. In the current manuscript the mechanistic connection remains somewhat vague. In the original Yu Cell paper from 2021 there is a connection to cytoskeleton. Is that the case here?</p></disp-quote><p>The canonical Hippo signaling pathway is mediated by MST kinases, LATS kinases, and the downstream transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ. As the reviewer mentioned, Yu et al. (Cell, 2012) reported that activation of GPCRs-Rho signaling by Epinephrine inactivates YAP through actin cytoskeleton organization which may controls LATS phosphorylation. In this study, we also found that YAP activity in the neonatal cardiomyocytes is affected by b1AR-Gas-Rho signaling pathway. Moreover, Yu et al. reported that YAP nuclear localization under LPA (Ga12/13 agonist) treatment correlated with levels of cellular actin filaments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we also have a piece of data indicating that LPA (Ga12/13 agonist) treatment activates YAP in the wild type P7 hearts, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> (data not included in the manuscript). Therefore, we argue that YAP activity in the cardiomyocyte appears to be regulated by Rho-cytoskeleton-LATS signaling pathway. Since the mechanisms by which actin cytoskeleton organization regulates LATS activity is still unclear, further investigation is required to elucidate it. We added the sentence to clarify the Hippo-RhoA-cytoskeleton-LATS signaling pathway in the discussion.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-74576-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors refer to effects of β blocker treatment on &quot;neonatal heart regeneration&quot;. This terminology could be confusing as it is most commonly used to describe experiments in P1 (regenerative) neonatal mice not P7 (non-regenerative) mice. For clarity, it is suggested that the authors rephrase these statements to refer to &quot;prolongation of the regenerative window&quot; in neonatal mice.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agreed the reviewer’s comment. We have edited it in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) On several occasions the authors refer to expression of b1-AR specifically in the heart. Is it known whether b1-AR expression is restricted to cardiomyocytes and/or whether it is developmentally regulated from neonatal to adult stages? These data are important with regards to interpretation of systemic metoprolol administration studies. These data should be provided or cited from relevant literature.</p></disp-quote><p>It is well known that b1-AR is the predominant bAR subtype in cardiac muscle comprising 80% of bARs in cardiomyocytes. It is also expressed in sinoatrial node, and atrioventricular node, but juxtaglomerular cell and adipose tissue. Since b1-AR knockout mice die prenatally between E10.5 and E18.5, b1-AR may have a critical role for the adrenergic system during embryonic heart development. However, previous paper reported that b1-AR mRNA expression in adult hearts significantly increased by fivefold than E11.5 hearts. Moreover, basal cAMP level was significantly increased in the developed hearts (<italic>Feridooni et al., 2017, Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol.</italic>). Therefore, these results suggest that b1-AR expression and stimulation is developmentally regulated from neonatal to adult stage. These data also support our model that inhibition of b1-AR signaling by b-blocker extended the cardiac regenerative window. We discussed b1-AR expression and stimulation during heart development in the discussion part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Β blocker treatment and Gas knockout were both associated with repression of fatty acid oxidation and induction of glycolysis. Are these metabolic transcriptional programs dependent on RhoA/Yap signaling?</p></disp-quote><p>There are pieces of evidence indicating that in several cancer cell lines, YAP is involved in metabolism regulation to promote glycolysis (<italic>Koo and Guan, 2018, Cell Metabolism</italic>). Other studies also reported that cells having constitutively active YAP promoted glucose utilization, indicating an increase in glycolysis. In fact, YAP promotes transcription of glycolysis related genes, such as GLUT3 or HK2, by interacting with TEAD. In the ischemic hearts, upregulation of YAP occurs one week after TAC, and then we can see increased glucose uptake in adult cardiomyocytes (<italic>Kashihara and Sadoshima, 2019, J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol.</italic>). Our transcriptome RNA seq data also suggest that YAP may promotes glycolysis in cardiomyocytes in response to loss of Gas function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It would be helpful if the authors showed the overlap between β blocker and Gas KO RNA-seq data sets as a Venn diagram in Figure 4 (or associated Supplementary Figure).

It has been previously reported that the neonatal EF and FS are slightly higher than juvenile mice (P10 vs. P35) (Wiesmann et al., <italic>Am.J.Physiol.Heart Circ.Physiol.</italic>, 2000).

We are sorry that some concerns regarding cardiomyocyte proliferation and YAP activation still remain not fully addressed. In this resubmission, we have provided EdU and Aurora B Kinase immunostaining data to demonstrate that β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation from DNA synthesis (EdU) to nuclear division (Phospho- Histone H3) eventually to cytokinesis (Aurora B). We further validated YAP activation via nuclear translocation by Fractionation Assay. Please see the detailed responses to reviewer 2’s concerns below.</p><p>We also toned down the conclusions to reflect the restricted cardiac regeneration effect in the juvenile stage (in the revised abstract, text and discussion).

First, there is no additional evidence of cardiomyocyte proliferation in this revised version of the manuscript. The images for histone H3 phosphorylation show few positive cells, the identity of which remains debatable. The authors themselves admit that there are so few Aurora B positive cells that not even statistical assessment can be attempted. These findings do not support the statement that &quot;metoprolol robustly enhanced cardiomyocyte proliferation and promoted cardiac regeneration (abstract)&quot;. In addition, the new experiment in adult mice (asked by another reviewer) shows that the drug does NOT induce regeneration. Hence, the whole message of the manuscript is quite deceptive.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. To show the proliferating cardiomyocytes more clearly, in this new revision, we included insets of higher magnification in the Phospho-histone H3 staining images in New Figures (Figure 1e and h and Figure 3e).</p><p>To show the full spectrum of proliferating cardiomyocytes, we performed EdU incorporation assay in the <italic>β-</italic>blocker treated hearts. A significant increase in the number of EdU positive and PCM1 (cardiomyocyte nuclear marker) positive cells was detected in the <italic>β-</italic>blocker treated hearts at P14, suggesting an increase in DNA synthesis (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1d).</p><p>In the last revision, we did observe Aurora B positive cardiomyocytes in <italic>β-</italic>blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts at P14, but did not detect any Aurora B positive cells in the control hearts confirming that cardiomyocytes ceased proliferation after the regeneration window in the control but ablation of <italic>Gnas</italic> indeed improved cytokinesis. In this new revision, we provided statistical analysis of Aurora B staining of P14 hearts (New Figure 1—figure supplement 1e) as well as new Aurora B data of <italic>β-</italic>blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts at P7. As shown in the new Figure 1f, 3f, Figure 1—figure supplement 1e and Figure 3—figure supplement 1b the number of Aurora B positive cardiomyocytes was significantly increased in both <italic>β-</italic>blocker treated hearts and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts at P7 and P14. These new results suggest that inhibition of β1-AR/Gαs signaling promotes cardiomyocyte proliferation at the juvenile stage. The texts were edited to reflect these changes (New Page4; line22-23 and Page7; line14).</p><p>We have toned down our conclusions regarding the effect of b-blocker on cardiac regeneration strictly to juvenile stage as it’s not sufficiently to induce adult heart regeneration. Please see the new abstract (page1), text (Page4; line1) and discussion (Page12; line5-13, Page13; line16, and Page14; line22). Our study suggests that inhibition of β1-AR/Gαs contributes to extending cardiac regeneration at the juvenile stage. Other pathways may be needed to promote adult cardiomyocyte proliferation and cardiac regeneration, which will need further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, as far as YAP activation is concerned, I asked for molecular or biochemical evidence of nuclear translocation (for example, by cytoplasmic and nuclear fractionation). This was not provided, while the IF images remain doubtful (cf. my original comments). YAP is known to also regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which could explain some of the findings presented in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments and have a better understanding of the experiment that the reviewer suggested. As requested, we performed fractionation assay using P14 β1- blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts. YAP is present in the nuclear fraction in both β1- blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO, but barely detectable in the control hearts. Cytoplasmic YAP is comparable with the controls. The nuclear fraction and cytoplasmic fraction were confirmed by Histone H3 and GAPDH, respectively. These data support the immunostaining results of increased YAP nuclear localization in both β1- blocker treated and <italic>Gnas</italic> cKO hearts. We have included these new data in Figure 4—figure supplement 2c and 2d and clarified these points in the manuscript (Page9; line19-21). Also, we included an inset with higher magnification to show nuclear YAP in the cardiomyocytes (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2b and e).</p><p>We appreciate that the reviewer pointed out that YAP may regulate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, which was also one of our concerns. We used two independent methods (WGA and isolated cardiomyocytes) and showed in our last revision that no significant difference in cardiomyocyte size was observed between control and b-blocker treated or Gnas cKO hearts. The data are now in Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and h and Figure 3—figure supplement 1d and e. Therefore, the enlarged heart phenotype is not likely due to cardiac hypertrophy (Page5 line5-10 and Page7; line 18-20).</p></body></sub-article></article>
