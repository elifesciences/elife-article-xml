The control signal emerges from interactions between ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons. Critically, these interactions vary across motoneuron pools and differ between muscles. To provide the most comprehensive framework to date of motor unit activity during isometric contractions, we identified the firing activity of extensive samples of motor units in the tibialis anterior (129 ± 44 per participant; n=8) and the vastus lateralis (130 ± 63 per participant; n=8) muscles during isometric contractions of up to 80% of maximal force. From this unique dataset, the rate coding of each motor unit was characterised as the relation between its instantaneous firing rate and the applied force, with the assumption that the linear increase in isometric force reflects a proportional increase in the net synaptic excitatory inputs received by the motoneuron. This relation was characterised with a natural logarithm function that comprised two stages. The initial stage was marked by a steep acceleration of firing rate, which was greater for low- than medium- and high-threshold motor units. The second stage comprised a linear increase in firing rate, which was greater for high- than medium- and low-threshold motor units. Changes in firing rate were largely non-linear during the ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the task, but with significant prolonged firing activity only evident for medium-threshold motor units. Contrary to what is usually assumed, our results demonstrate that the firing rate of each motor unit can follow a large variety of trends with force across the pool. From a neural control perspective, these findings indicate how motor unit pools use gain control to transform inputs with limited bandwidths into an intended muscle force.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor units</kwd><kwd>electromyography</kwd><kwd>isometric contractions</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-IDEX-0007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avrillon</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V00896X</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Avrillon</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name><name><surname>Farina</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EP/T020970</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farina</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-24-CE17-5805</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hug</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#810346</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farina</surname><given-names>Dario</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Future project managed by the French National Research Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-IDEX-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hug</surname><given-names>François</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG-2206-39688</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enoka</surname><given-names>Roger M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Motor units within a pool exhibit distinct rate coding as force levels change, highlighting how gain control can transform inputs with limited bandwidth into the desired muscle force.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human muscles are versatile effectors producing forces that span several orders of magnitude. They allow humans to perform a broad range of motor tasks with the same limbs, such as a surgeon closing an incision or a climber who grasps supports on a cliff. This versatility relies on a unique structure that converts neural inputs into muscle force; i.e., the motor unit, which comprises an alpha motoneuron and the muscle fibres it innervates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sherrington, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>). The nervous system controls muscle force by modulating the number of active motor units (recruitment) and their firing rates (rate coding; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Enoka and Duchateau, 2017</xref>). This control strategy involves projecting a substantial level of common excitatory synaptic inputs to motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farina et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farina and Negro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Negro et al., 2016b</xref>) that recruits them in a fixed order following the size principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Henneman, 1957</xref>).</p><p>Although we have a clear understanding of the general strategies used to control muscle force, we still lack a full picture of the detailed organisation of the firing activities of motor units. One of the key challenges in the field is the ability to identify the concurrent firing activity of many motor units spanning the range of recruitment thresholds observed in human muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farina and Holobar, 2016</xref>). Indeed, much of our knowledge on the modulation of motor unit activity still derives from animal preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee and Heckman, 2000</xref>) or from serial recordings of a few concurrent motor units in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Desmedt and Godaux, 1977a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bigland-Ritchie et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kirk et al., 2016</xref>), mainly identified over narrow force ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willem Monster and Chan, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fuglevand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Revill and Fuglevand, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Animal studies have shown two stages in the rate coding of individual motor units to increase muscle force (amplification and rate limiting) in response to linear increases in the net excitatory synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennett et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee and Heckman, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Powers and Binder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2020</xref>). These stages represent the different responses of motoneurons to ionotropic inputs due to modulation of their intrinsic properties by metabotropic inputs acting on the somato-dendritic surfaces of motoneurons through several ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Powers and Binder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2020</xref>). Similar characteristics in firing activity have been observed in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fuglevand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Revill and Fuglevand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>), although these observations have been limited to small samples of motor units (typically &lt;40) with firing activities experimentally decoded over a narrow range of submaximal forces (typically &lt;30% maximal voluntary contraction [MVC] force; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fuglevand et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Revill and Fuglevand, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beauchamp et al., 2023</xref>). It is difficult to infer from these studies a control scheme that is generalisable to an entire motor unit pool and to all contraction levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Luca, 1985</xref>).</p><p>The combination of arrays of electromyographic (EMG) electrodes with modern source-separation algorithms set the path for the identification of populations of active motor units - and their motoneurons - in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Farina and Holobar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Negro et al., 2016a</xref>). Recent studies have identified the concurrent firing activity of up to 60 motor units per contraction and per muscle by increasing the density of electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Muceli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caillet et al., 2023a</xref>). Here, we further extended this approach by tracking motor units across contractions at target forces that ranged from 10% to 80% MVC, based on the unique spatial distribution of motor unit action potentials across the array of surface electrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Martinez-Valdes et al., 2017</xref>). We were able to identify up to ~200 unique active motor units per muscle and per participant in two human muscles in vivo, yielding extensive samples of motor units that are representative of the motoneuron pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caillet et al., 2023b</xref>). With this approach, we described the non-linear transformation of the net excitatory synaptic inputs into firing activity for individual motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2020</xref>). We specifically focused on the non-linearities between the changes in firing rate and force: amplification, saturation, and hysteresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2020</xref>). The results provided a framework picture of the rate coding of motor units during large and slow increases and decreases in an applied isometric force.</p><p>Having access to the rate coding of motoneuron pools allowed us to understand how ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs combine to modulate force, confirming some details of hypothetical force control schemes in humans. For example, experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naufel et al., 2019</xref>) and computational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>) studies have proposed a gain control mechanism driven by neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons. One common conclusion of these studies is that pools of motor units involved in fine motor tasks have a low gain, whereas additional motor units activated during more forceful tasks exhibit a progressively increase in gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naufel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2020</xref>). However, this conclusion is based on results from motor units in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Powers and Binder, 2001</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wei et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Goodlich et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Henderson et al., 2022</xref>) while experimentally modulating inputs, or by fitting a non-linear model predicting muscle activation from excitatory synaptic inputs at multiple contraction levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naufel et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, we addressed this question by identifying the concurrent activity of hundreds of motor units spanning most of the range of recruitment thresholds in vivo in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and tracking of individual motor units</title><p>16 participants performed either isometric dorsiflexion (n=8) or knee extension tasks (n=8) while we recorded the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior (TA - dorsiflexion) or the vastus lateralis (VL - knee extension) with four arrays of 64 surface electrodes (256 electrodes per muscle). The motoneuron pools of these two muscles of the lower limb receive a large part of common input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Negro et al., 2016b</xref>), constraining the recruitment of their motor units in a fixed order across tasks. They are therefore good candidates for an accurate description of rate coding. Moreover, we wanted to determine whether differences in rate coding observed between proximal and distal muscles in the upper limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Luca et al., 1982</xref>) were also present in the lower limb.</p><p>The experimental tasks comprised isometric contractions with a ramp-up, a plateau, and a ramp-down. The ramp-up and ramp-down phases were performed slowly compared with contractile speeds observed during activities of daily living. They were performed at a constant rate of 5% MVC·s<sup>–1</sup> and the force plateau was maintained for either 10 s (70–80% MVC), 15 s (50–60% MVC), or 20 s (10–40% MVC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The target during the plateau ranged from 10% to 80% MVC in increments of 10% MVC (randomised order).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of motor units in two human muscles.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We used a blind-source-separation (BSS) algorithm to decompose the overlapping activity of motor units (MU) into spike trains during a force-matching trapezoidal task (red trace).

First, we simulated a pool of 150 motor units producing forces from 10% to 80% of the maximal excitation. Electromyographic signals were simulated from either 16 intramuscular electrodes (black horizontal line, top panels) or 64 surface electrodes (dark red curves on the left of top panels). Each of the grey elliptical shapes represents the cross-sectional area of the simulated muscle. We identified motor units using blind source-separation, with their territories displayed in red in the top panels. We then calculated the rate of agreement between the series of discharge times identified from the decomposition and simulated. Each data point is a motor unit, and the horizontal black line depicts the median. After this, we used the two-source validation approach, i.e., the comparison of discharge times identified from intramuscular and surface electromyographic signals. A participant performed trapezoidal isometric contractions with plateaus ranging from 10% to 80% of the maximal force while we recorded surface signals with a grid of 128 electrodes and intramuscular signals with 40 electrodes along a thin film that was inserted into the muscle with a hypodermic needle. Intramuscular and surface electromyographic signals were both decomposed and two motor units were matched between intramuscular and surface signals. We calculated the rate of agreement between the series of discharge times. It is worth noting that we identified the same number of discharge times with both methods. A rate of agreements less than 100% reflects misalignments of some discharge times with the surface signals due to the propagation of the action potentials through the tissue and potential overlapping action potentials at the surface of the skin.

To do so, the discharge times were used as triggers to segment the differentiated EMG signals over a window of 25 ms that yielded averaged action potential waveforms for each motor unit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The action potentials were then convolved with the discharge times to obtain trains of action potentials, and all the trains of the identified motor units were summed to reconstruct the synthetic EMG signal. The ratio between the powers of synthetic and experimental EMG signals was calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>): it was 69.3 ± 17.3% (25th–75th percentile: 59.3–83.6%, up to 94.2%) for TA and 55.2 ± 19.5% (25th–75th percentile: 50.0–71.9%, up to 86.5%) for VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

This method was validated by using both simulated EMG signals and two-source validation with simultaneous recordings of firing activity from intramuscular and surface EMG signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On average, we tracked 67.1 ± 10.0% (25th–75th percentile: 53.9–80.1%) of the motor units between consecutive target forces (10% increments, e.g. between 10% and 20% MVC) for TA and 57.2 ± 5.1% (25th–75th percentile: 46.6–68.3%) of the motor units for VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). There are two explanations for the inability to track all motor units across consecutive target forces: (i) some motor units are recruited at higher targets only; (ii) it is challenging to track small motor units beyond a few target forces due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio when larger motor units are recruited, or signal cancellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Keenan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Farina et al., 2014a</xref>).

This was accomplished by calculating the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between their action potentials across the electrodes relative to those of the rest of the motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The RMSE between the action potentials of the same motor unit tracked across contractions was calculated as a reference and compared with the 5th percentile of the distribution of RMSE between motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

This stage corresponds to mechanisms previously referred to as ‘rate limiting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heckman and Binder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>) or ‘saturation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Luca and Contessa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fuglevand et al., 2015</xref>), and was more pronounced for low- than high-threshold motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This difference may be explained by smaller excitatory synaptic inputs onto low- than high-threshold motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Powers and Binder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Heckman and Enoka, 2012</xref>), lower synaptic driving potential of the dendritic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Powers and Binder, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cushing et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Fuglevand et al., 2015</xref>), and longer and larger afterhyperpolarisation phase in low- than high-threshold motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakels and Kernell, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gardiner, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deardorff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caillet et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results show how ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons uniquely combine to generate distinct rate coding across the pool, even if a more direct manipulation of the sources of neuromodulatory and ionotropic inputs will be required to directly estimate their interactions. While the size of the motor unit determines its recruitment threshold, neuromodulatory inputs determine its gain. Thus, in a similar fashion as size imposes a fixed recruitment order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Henneman, 1957</xref>), neuromodulatory inputs determine a spectrum of variations in motor unit firing rates without the need to differentiate the ionotropic inputs to each motoneuron. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bräcklein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chardon et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Škarabot et al., 2023b</xref>). Because high-threshold motor units exhibit a higher gain than low-threshold motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), their firing rate could eventually reach similar or even greater values than that of low-threshold motor units during strong contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gydikov and Kosarov, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moritz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Škarabot et al., 2023b</xref>). This indicates that the onion skin principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Luca and Contessa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Luca and Contessa, 2015</xref>) may not hold in all muscles and for all contraction forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gydikov and Kosarov, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moritz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Oya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Škarabot et al., 2023b</xref>). In addition, rate coding patterns should also vary with the pattern of contractions, with fast contractions lowering the range of recruitment thresholds within motoneuron pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Desmedt and Godaux, 1977b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desmedt and Godaux, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">van Bolhuis et al., 1997</xref>). The variability in rate coding observed here between motor units from the same pool could lead to small deviations from the size principle sometimes observed between pairs of units during isometric contractions with various patterns of force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Desmedt and Godaux, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Marshall et al., 2022</xref>) or during the derecruitment phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bräcklein et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>It is also worth noting that the profile of rate coding mostly followed the same trend during the ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the contraction, but with prolonged firing activity only evident for medium-threshold motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This hysteresis is possible because of the bistability of the membrane potential mediated by inward currents from calcium channels, the two stable membrane states being the resting potential, and a depolarised state that enables self-sustained firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hounsgaard et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Heckman, 1998</xref>). The absence of statistically significant hysteresis in low-threshold motoneurons may be simply explained by their early recruitment during the first percentages of force, mathematically lowering the potential amplitude of their hysteresis. Alternatively, prominent outward currents may attenuate the impact of persistent inward currents on the prolongation of their firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Powers and Heckman, 2015</xref>). Similarly, the absence of hysteresis (TA) and even a negative hysteresis (VL) in high-threshold motoneurons can be explained by a briefer membrane bistability due to a faster decay of inward currents from calcium channels, and a narrower range of membrane depolarisation over which these inward currents are activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee and Heckman, 1998</xref>). This result must be confirmed with a more direct proxy of the net synaptic drive, such as the firing rate of a <italic>reference</italic> low-threshold motor neuron used in the delta F method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gorassini et al., 1998</xref>), or the cumulative spike train of low-threshold motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afsharipour et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The increase in firing rate was also significantly greater for TA motor units than for those in VL. This difference may reflect a varying balance between excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs and neuromodulation due to multiple spinal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heckman and Binder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heckman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chardon et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Škarabot et al., 2023b</xref>). Specifically, the strength of recurrent and reciprocal inhibitory inputs to motoneurons innervating VL and TA, and their proportional or inverse covariation with excitatory inputs, respectively, may explain the differences in rate limiting and maximal firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heckman and Binder, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heckman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Powers and Heckman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chardon et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Škarabot et al., 2023b</xref>). Thus, the motor units from the VL may receive more recurrent inhibition than those of distal muscles, though direct evidence of these differences remains to be found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Windhorst, 1996</xref>). Interestingly, similar differences in rate coding were previously observed between proximal and distal muscles of the upper limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Luca et al., 1982</xref>). However, other muscles that serve different functions within the human body, such as muscles from the face, have different rate coding characteristics with much higher firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kirk et al., 2021</xref>). Future work should investigate those muscles and other to reveal the myriads of rate coding strategies in human muscles.</p><p>Our results on rate coding characteristics of the motor unit pool provide insight on force control strategies. The accurate control of force depends on the firing activity of the population of active motor units, which effectively filters out the synaptic noise of individual motor units and primarily transforms common synaptic inputs into muscle force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dideriksen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farina et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farina and Negro, 2015</xref>). Because the bandwidth of muscle force is &lt;10 Hz during isometric contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Enoka and Farina, 2021</xref>), the activation of inward currents to low-threshold motoneurons at recruitment may enable them to promptly discharge at a rate (&gt;8 pps) that transmits the effective common synaptic inputs (&lt;8–10 Hz) without phase distortion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dideriksen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farina et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farina and Negro, 2015</xref>). This mechanism facilitates the accuracy of force control.</p><p>Moreover, force generation can be described as the filtering of the cumulative firing activity of active motor units with the average twitch force of their muscle units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Farina and Negro, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). From this perspective, at low forces, recruitment of new motor units has a higher impact on force modulation than rate coding since each recruitment impacts both the cumulative firing activity of the pool and the average twitch force. Rate coding only modulates the cumulative firing activity. Thus, the amplification of the firing rate of low-threshold motor units near their recruitment threshold instantly favours rate coding over the recruitment of additional motor units, which likely allows for smoother force control. Similarly, the progressive recruitment of motor units with a higher gain promotes faster changes in firing rates, which promotes force control accuracy across the full force range. On a different note, the steep increase in firing rate over the first percentages of the ramp-up may also enable the motor units to produce the required level of force despite having a more compliant muscle-tendon unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mazzo et al., 2021</xref>). Overall, our results may help to design future non-linear decoders that aim to predict muscle activation or muscle force from descending inputs recorded in the motor cortex, with the will to generalise their performance across movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Naufel et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>16 young individuals volunteered to participate either in the experiment on the TA (n=8; age: 27 ± 3) or on the VL (n=8; age: 27 ± 10).

The grids were positioned over the muscle bellies to cover the largest surface while staying away from the boundaries of the muscle identified by manual palpation. Before placing the electrodes, the skin was shaved and cleaned with an abrasive pad and water. A biadhesive foam layer was used to hold each array of electrodes onto the skin, and conductive paste filled the cavities of the adhesive layers to make skin-electrode contact. For two-source validation of the EMG decomposition, an intramuscular linear array of 40 electrodes on a thin-film (platinum coated, interelectrode distance: 1 mm) was inserted into the TA in one participant at an approximate angle of 30°. The insertion was guided with a portable ultrasound probe (Butterfly IQ+, Butterfly Network, USA). Two bands damped with water were placed around the ankle as ground and reference electrodes. EMG signals were recorded in monopolar derivation with a sampling frequency of 2048 Hz for surface electrodes, 10,240 Hz for intramuscular electrodes, amplified (×150), band-pass filtered (10–500 Hz for surface; 100–4400 Hz for intramuscular), and digitised using a 400 channels acquisition system with a 16-bit resolution (EMG-Quattrocento; OT Bioelettronica, Italy).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>HD-EMG decomposition</title><p>The monopolar EMG signals were band-pass filtered between 20 and 500 Hz with a second-order Butterworth filter, and channels with low signal-to-noise ratio or artefacts were discarded after visual inspection. The EMG signals were decomposed into individual motor unit pulse trains using convolutive blind source separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Negro et al., 2016a</xref>). EMG signals were first extended by adding delayed versions of each channel, with an extension factor, i.e., number of delayed versions, adjusted to reach a total of 1000 extended channels. The extended signals were spatially whitened to make them uncorrelated and of equal power. Thereafter, a fixed-point algorithm was applied to identify the sources of the EMG signals, i.e., the motor unit pulse trains. In this algorithm, a contrast function g(x)=log(cosh(x)) and its derivatives were applied to the extended and whitened EMG signals to iteratively optimise a separation vector that skew the distribution of the values of the motor unit pulse trains towards 0, and thus maximise the level of sparsity of the motor unit pulse train. The high level of sparsity matches the physiological properties of motor units, with a relatively small number of discharges, or 1, per second (&lt;50 discharge times·s<sup>–1</sup> during submaximal isometric contractions). The convergence was reached once the level of sparsity did not substantially vary (with a tolerance fixed at 10<sup>–4</sup>) when compared to the previous iteration. At this stage, the motor unit pulse train contained high peaks (i.e. the discharge times of the identified motor unit) and lower values due to the activities of neighbouring motor units and noise. High peaks were separated from lower values using the MATLAB functions <italic>findpeaks.m</italic> and <italic>kmeans.m</italic> (with two classes). The peaks from the class with the highest centroid were considered as the discharge times of the identified motor unit.</p><p>After this automatic identification of the discharge times, duplicates were automatically removed. For this purpose, the pulse trains of pairs of motor units were first aligned using a cross-correlation function to account for a potential delay due to the propagation time of action potentials along the fibres. Then, two discharge times identified from these pulse trains were considered as common when they occurred within a time interval of 0.5 ms, and two or more motor units were considered as duplicates when they had at least 30% of their identified discharge times in common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Holobar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Negro et al., 2016a</xref>). In principle, the limited level of synchronisation between individual motor units results in a few simultaneous discharge times between pairs of motor units. A threshold of 30% is therefore highly conservative and ensure the removal of all motor units with a level of synchronisation well above physiological values. When duplicates were identified, the motor unit with the lowest coefficient of variation of the inter-spike intervals was retained for the analyses.</p><p>At the end of these automatic steps, all the motor unit pulse trains and identified discharge times were visually inspected, and manual editing was performed to correct the false identification of artefacts or the missed discharge times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Del Vecchio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hug et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avrillon et al., 2024</xref>). The manual editing consisted of (i) removing the spikes causing erroneous discharge rates (outliers), (ii) adding the discharge times clearly separated from the noise, (iii) recalculating the separation vector, (iv) reapplying the separation vector on the entire EMG signals, and (v) repeating this procedure until the selection of all the discharge times is achieved. The manual editing of potential missed discharge times and falsely identified discharge times was never immediately accepted. Instead, the procedure was consistently followed by the application of the updated motor unit separation vector on the entire EMG signals to generate a new motor unit pulse train. Then, the manual editing was only accepted when the silhouette value increased or stayed well above the threshold of 0.9 quantified with the silhouette value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Negro et al., 2016a</xref>).

We set the radius of the muscle to 15 mm and the thicknesses of the subcutaneous and skin layers to 4 and 1 mm, respectively. The motor unit action potentials were detected in the model by a grid of 64 circular surface electrodes with a diameter of 1 mm arranged in 5 columns and 13 rows (interelectrode distance: 4 mm). Following this, we estimated the rate of agreements between simulated and estimated series of motor unit discharge times, calculated as the ratio between correctly identified discharge times and the sum of correctly identified discharge times, missed discharge times, and falsely identified discharge times.</p><p>For the two-source validation, EMG signals were simultaneously recorded with an intramuscular linear array of 40 electrodes on a thin film and two grids of 64 surface electrodes. After the decomposition of both intramuscular and surface EMG signals, identified motor units were matched following the same procedure as for the elimination of duplicates. In short, the motor unit pulse trains were first aligned using a cross-correlation function. Two motor units identified with intramuscular and surface EMG decompositions were considered as matches when they had at least 30% of their discharge times in common. We calculated the accuracy of the decomposition using the rate of agreements between their series of discharge times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Proportion of the EMG signal represented by the decomposition</title><p>A synthetic EMG signal was reconstructed from the cumulative firing activity of the identified motor units.

Second, each differentiated EMG signal was segmented over successive windows of 25 ms centred around the discharge times of a motor unit. All the windows were averaged to estimate the average action potential waveform of that motor unit over the 236 each channel. The action potentials were then convolved with the series of discharge times to obtain trains of action potentials. These steps were repeated for all the identified motor units, and all the trains of action potentials were summed to reconstruct the synthetic EMG signals.

Discharge times are automatically identified from this motor unit pulse train, before visual inspection and manual editing.</p><p>In this study, motor units were tracked by slightly adapting this process. First, EMG signals from two successive contraction levels, say 10% and 20% MVC, were separately decomposed. The motor unit pulse trains, the identified discharge times, and the associated separation vectors were saved for each contraction level. Second, the EMG signals from the highest contraction level (20% MVC) were projected onto the separation vectors identified in the lowest contraction level (10% MVC). A new group of pulse trains was generated, which represented the firing activity of all the motor unit identified at 10% MVC, but during the contraction performed at 20% MVC. When the high peaks were clearly separated from the noise, the discharge times were automatically identified using the MATLAB functions <italic>findpeaks.m</italic> and <italic>kmeans.m</italic>. Third, these new series of discharge times were matched with those that have been initially identified at 20% MVC using the same approach as during two-source validation (&gt;30% of common discharge times, see above). This process ended with three groups of motor units: (i) the motor units only identified at 10% MVC, (ii) the motor units identified at 10% and 20% MVC, and (iii) the motor units only identified at 20% MVC. These steps were repeated between all the successive contraction levels, i.e., from between 20% and 30% MVC to between 70% and 80% MVC. At the end of this iterative process, the following data were saved for each motor unit across the contraction levels where they were tracked: the instantaneous firing rates and force during ramp-up and ramp-down phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the average firing rate during the plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the recruitment threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Motor unit uniqueness</title><p>The accuracy of motor unit tracking was further tested by confirming the uniqueness of each motor unit within the entire sample, assuming that each motor unit must have a unique representation of their action potentials across the array of surface electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Farina et al., 2008</xref>). This was accomplished by calculating the RMSE between their action potentials across contractions and the action potentials of the rest of the motor units. EMG signals from the 256 electrodes were differentiated in the column direction to obtain 236 single-differential EMG channels. For each motor unit, the single-differential EMG signals were segmented around the discharge times and averaged to identify an average action potential waveforms for each channel. The action potential waveforms were concatenated in a matrix of 236 rows (EMG channels) and 102 columns (time samples; 50 ms). This process was repeated for each contraction level where the motor unit was tracked. A first RMSE was calculated between the concatenated action potentials identified across contractions, and this value was defined as a reference. Then, RMSE was calculated between the concatenated action potentials of that motor unit and the concatenated action potentials of the rest of the motor units. A reference value lower than the 5th percentile of the distribution of RMSE calculated between motor units demonstrated that its distribution of action potentials across contractions were more similar than with the rest of the motor units, proving their uniqueness within the entire sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Input-output function of motoneurons</title><p>The input-output function of each motor unit was characterised as the relation between its instantaneous firing rate and the muscle force.

The BIC was calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">C</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>ln</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where n is the number of data samples on which the fit was estimated, sse is the sum of squares error, and p is the number of parameters used in the model.</p><p>The input-output functions of motor units during the ramp-down phase were characterised using the same approach, and we reported in the Results whether the best fit changed between the ramp-up and ramp-down phases.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Rate coding of motor units</title><p>Most of motor units input-output functions were better characterised with a natural logarithm function. This function determines two stages in rate coding: a steep acceleration of firing rate followed by a slower linear increase in firing rate. Therefore, these two stages of the firing rate-force relation were further analysed. To estimate the acceleration of firing rate during the ramp-up phase, the first derivative of the firing rate-force relation fitted with a natural logarithm was computed as:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where a is the parameter of the equation of the natural logarithm function. The initial acceleration of firing rate was calculated as the value of the derivative at the recruitment threshold of the motor unit. The relation between the initial acceleration of firing rate and the recruitment threshold of all motor units across the pool was characterised for each muscle and each participant using non-linear least-squares solvers in MATLAB. The slow linear increase in firing rate that followed the initial steep acceleration of firing rate was characterised by comparing the average firing rate of motor units during the plateaus of force between successive contraction levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Specifically, the rate of increase in firing rate for an increment of 10% MVC were calculated for each motor unit, and the relation between the rate of increase and the recruitment threshold of all motor units across the pool was characterised for each participant and each muscle using a linear fit in MATLAB. Pearson’s r and p-values of these relations were reported in the Results.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Hysteresis between recruitment and derecruitment thresholds</title><p>The relation between recruitment and derecruitment thresholds of all motor units across the pool was characterised for each participant and each muscle using non-linear and linear fits. As for the relations between the firing rate and force of each motor unit, the best fit was selected using the BIC. The differences between the recruitment and derecruitment thresholds (hysteresis) were calculated for each motor unit, with negative values indicating a hysteresis and a positive value indicating a reverse hysteresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed with RStudio (USA). Quantile-quantile plots and histograms were displayed to check the normality of the data distribution. If the distribution was determined not to be normal, they were transformed to remove the skew. All statistical analyses were performed using linear mixed effect models implemented in the R package <italic>lmerTest</italic> with the Kenward-Roger method to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom and the p-values. This method considers the dependence of data points (i.e. individual motor unit) in each participant.

The authors have used new quantitative methods to extract more unique motor units across contractions than prior studies. This was achieved by recording muscle fibre action potentials from four high density surface electromyogram (HDsEMG) arrays, quantifying residual EMG comparing the recorded and data-based simulation (Fig. 1A-B), and developing a metric to compare the spatial identification for each motor unit (Fig. 1D-E).

In the lower limb it is interesting how lower threshold motor units have firing rate responses that saturate, whereas higher threshold units that presumably produce higher muscle contractile forces continue to increase their firing rate. Conceptually, the authors rightly focus on the literature of intrinsic motoneurone properties, but in vivo, other possibilities (that are difficult to measure in awake human participants) are that the form of descending supraspinal drive, spinal network dynamics and afferent inputs may have different effects across motor unit sizes, muscles and types of contractions. These results from single trail contractions and with a larger sample of motor units, supports the summary rate coding profiles of motor units in the extensor digitorum communis muscle (Monster and Chan, 1977).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97085.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript which uses state of the art experimental and simulation approaches to quantify motor unit discharge patterns in the human TA and VL. The non-linear profiles of motor unit discharge were calculated and found to have an initial acceleration phase followed by an attenuation phase. Lower threshold motor units had a larger gain of the initial acceleration whereas the higher threshold motor unit had a higher gain in the attenuation phase.

It is unclear if this will translate to other motor pools. The justification for TA and VL should be provided.</p><p>While in impressive effort was made to identify and track motor units across a range of contractions, it appears that a substantial portion of muscle force was not identified. Though high intensity contractions are challenging to decompose - the authors are commended in their technical ability in recording population motor unit discharge times with recruitment thresholds up to 75% a participant's maximal voluntary contractions. However previous groups have seen substantial recruitment motor units above 80% and even 90% maximum activation in the soleus. Given the innervation ratios of higher threshold motor units, if recruitment continued to 100%, the top quartile would likely represent a substantial portion of the traditional fast-fatigable motor units. It would be highly interesting to understand the recruitment and rate coding of the highest threshold motor units, at a minimum I would suggest using terms other than &quot;entire range&quot; or &quot;full spectrum of recruitment thresholds&quot;</p><p>The quantification of hysteresis using torque appears to make self-evident the observation that lower threshold motor units demonstrate less hysteresis with respect to torque - If there was motor unit discharge there will be force. I believe this limitation goes beyond the floor effects discussed in the manuscript. Traditionally individuals have used the discharge of a lower threshold unit as the measure on which to apply hysteresis analyses to infer ion channel function in human spinal motoneurons.</p><p>The main findings are not entirely novel.

It sounds circular, or the other way around to use the muscle force as an input variable, because the muscle force is the result of motor unit discharges, not the cause that elicits the discharges. More specifically, as a result of non-linear interactions of synchronous and/or asynchronous discharges of a population of a given motoneuron pool that give rise to transient increase/maintenance in twitch force, the gross muscle force is attained. I acknowledge that it is extremely challenging experimentally to measure synaptic currents impinging upon the spinal motoneurons in human subjects and the author has an assumption that the force could be used as a proxy of synaptic currents. However, it is necessary to explicitly provide the caveats and rationale behind that. Force could be used as the input variable for modelling.</p></disp-quote><p>Force is indeed used in this study as a proxy of the common excitatory synaptic currents as their direct measurement is not possible in vivo in humans. It is worth noting that this approach has been extensively used in the past by many groups to study rate coding (e.g., Monsters &amp; Chan, De Luca’s, Heckman’s, and Fuglevand’s groups). Heckman’s, Gorassini’s, Fuglevand’s groups and others have considered the non-linearities in the relation between motor unit firing rates and muscle force in humans as an indicator of the impact of neuromodulation on motor unit behaviour and changes of the intrinsic properties of motoneurons.</p><p>One could also use the cumulative spike train as a more direct estimate of common excitatory inputs, assuming that it is possible to identify a group of motor units not influenced by PICs, as done when selecting a reference low-threshold motor neuron in the delta F method (Gorassini et al., 1998), or the cumulative spike train of low-threshold motor neurons (Afsharipour et al., 2020). However, this approach was not possible in our study as we did not have the same units across contractions to estimate cumulative spike trains. It was therefore not possible to pool the data across contractions as we did to generate force/firing rate relations on the widest range of force.</p><p>We added a sentence in the discussion to highlight this limitation (P19, L470):</p><p>‘This result must be confirmed with a more direct proxy of the net synaptic drive, such as the firing rate of a reference low-threshold motor neuron used in the delta F method (Gorassini et al., 1998), or the cumulative spike train of low-threshold motor neurons (Afsharipour et al., 2020)’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors examine the firing organizations in TA and VL in this study without explicit purposes and rationale for choosing these muscles. The lack of accounts makes it hard for the readers to interpret the data presented, particularly in terms of comparing the results from the different muscles.</p></disp-quote><p>We wanted to compare the rate coding of pools of motor units from proximal (VL) and distal (TA) muscles within the lower limb. Indeed, distal and proximal muscles exhibit differences in rate coding and spatial recruitments (De Luca et al., 1982, J Physiol), potentially due to different levels of recurrent inhibition (Cullheim &amp; Kellerth, 1978, J Physiol; Rossi &amp; Mazzocchio, 1991, Exp Brain Res; Edgley et al., 2021, J Neurosci) or different levels of neuromodulation depending on their involvement (or not) in postural control (Hoonsgaard et al., 1988, J Physiol; Kim et al., 2020, J Neurophysiol).</p><p>We added a paragraph at the beginning of the result section to support our muscle choice (P6; L137): ‘16 participants performed either isometric dorsiflexion (n = 8) or knee extension tasks (n = 8) while we recorded the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior (TA - dorsiflexion) or the vastus lateralis (VL – knee extension) with four arrays of 64 surface electrodes (256 electrodes per muscle). The motoneuron pools of these two muscles of the lower limb receive a large part of common input (Laine et al., 2015; Negro et al., 2016a), constraining the recruitment of their motor units in a fixed order across tasks. They are therefore good candidates for an accurate description of rate coding. Moreover, we wanted to determine whether differences in rate coding observed between proximal and distal muscles in the upper limb (De Luca et al., 1982) were also present in the lower limb.’.</p><p>Another factor that guided our muscle choice was the low risk of crosstalk. For this, we verified with ultrasound that our arrays of 256 electrodes only covered the muscle of interest, staying away from the neighbouring muscles. This was possible as superficial muscles from the leg are bulkier than those from the upper limb. Given the small diameter of each electrode (2 mm), it is unlikely that the motor units from the neighbouring muscles were in the recorded muscle volume (Farina et al., 2003, IEEE Trans Biomed Eng)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In the methods, the author described the manual curation process after applying the blind source separation algorithm. For the readers to understand the whole process of decomposition and to secure rigor and robustness of the analyses, it would be necessary to provide details on what exact curation is performed with what criteria.</p></disp-quote><p>The manual curation of EMG decomposition with blind source separation is different from what is classically done with intramuscular EMG and template-matching algorithms.</p><p>In short, our decomposition algorithm uses fast independent component analysis (fastICA) to retrieve motor unit spike trains from the EMG signals. For this, it iteratively optimises a set of weights, i.e., a separation vector, for each motor unit. The projection of the EMG signals on this separation vector generates a sparse motor unit pulse train, with most of its samples close to zero and only a few samples close to one (Figure 1B). The discharge times are estimated from this motor unit pulse train using a peak detection function and a k-mean classification with two classes to separate the high peaks (spikes) from the low peaks (noise and other motor units).</p><p>The manual curation consists of inspecting the automatic detection of the peaks of the motor unit pulse train and manually add missed peaks (missed discharge times) or remove wrongly detected peaks. Then, the separation vector is updated using the correct discharge times and the motor unit pulse train recalculated. This procedure generally improves the distance between the discharge times and the noise, which confirm the accuracy of the manual curation. If that’s not the case, the motor unit is discarded from the analyses.</p><p>We added a section on manual editing in the methods (P23, L615):</p><p>‘At the end of these automatic steps, all the motor unit pulse trains and identified discharge times were visually inspected, and manual editing was performed to correct the false identification of artifacts or the missed discharge times (Del Vecchio et al., 2020; Hug et al., 2021; Avrillon et al., 2023). The manual editing consisted of (i) removing the spikes causing erroneous discharge rates (outliers), (ii) adding the discharge times clearly separated from the noise, (iii) recalculating the separation vector, (iv) reapplying the separation vector on the entire EMG signals, and (v) repeating this procedure until the selection of all the discharge times is achieved. The manual editing of potential missed discharge times and falsely identified discharge times was never immediately accepted. Instead, the procedure was consistently followed by the application of the updated motor unit separation vector on the entire EMG signals to generate a new motor unit pulse train. Then, the manual editing was only accepted when the silhouette value increased or stayed well above the threshold of 0.9 quantified with the silhouette value (Negro et al., 2016b). Only these motor units were retained for further analysis.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 3, the early recruited units tend to become untraceable in the higher range of contraction. This is more pronounced in the muscle VL. This limitation would ambiguate the whole firing curve along the force axis and therefore limitation and the applicability in the different muscles needs to be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The loss of low threshold motor units in the higher range of contractions was caused either by the decrease in signal-to-noise ratio for small motor units when many larger ones are recruited, or by the cancellation of the surface action potentials of the small units in the interference electromyographic signal, or by the recruitment of a motor unit with a very similar spatio-temporal filter (an example is shown in the figure below). In the latter case, the motor unit pulse train contains peaks that represent the discharge times of both motor units (green and red dots in the simulated example below), making them undistinguishable by the operator during manual editing.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-97085-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>This was discussed in the results (P7; L190):</p><p>‘On average, we tracked 67.1 ± 10.0% (25th–75th percentile: 53.9 – 80.1%) of the motor units between consecutive contraction levels (10% increments, e.g., between 10% and 20% MVC) for TA and 57.2 ± 5.1% (25th–75th percentile: 46.6 – 68.3%) of the motor units for VL (Figure S2). There are two explanations for the inability to track all motor units across consecutive contraction levels. First, some motor units are recruited at higher targets only. Second, it is challenging to track small motor units beyond a few contraction levels due to a lower signal-to-noise ratio for the small motor units when larger motor units are recruited, or signal cancellation (Keenan et al., 2005; Farina et al., 2014a).’</p><p>However, we believe that it had a limited impact on the output of the paper, as the non-linear portion of the rate coding/force relation due to the persistent inward currents occurs during the first seconds after recruitment, before plateauing (for a review see Binder et al., 2020, Physiology).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is unclear how commonly the notion &quot;the long-held belief that rate coding is similar across motor units from the same pool&quot; is held among the community without a reference. Different firing organizations have been modelled and discussed in the seminal paper by Fuglevand et al. (1993) and as far as I understand, the debate has not converged to a specific consensus. As such, any reference would be required to support the claim the notion is widely recognized.</p></disp-quote><p>In the paper of Fuglevand et al., (1993, J Neurophysiol), all the motor units had the same rate coding pattern relative to the excitatory input, though they changed the slope of the relations and the saturation threshold of motor units between simulations. This is similar to the paper of De Luca &amp; Contessa (2012, J Neurophysiol), where the equation used to simulate the rate coding was non-linear, but consistent across motor units.</p><p>We added these citations to the text:</p><p>‘Overall, we found that motor units within a pool exhibit distinct rate coding with changes in force level (Figure 2 and 3), which contrasts with the long-held belief that rate coding is similar across motor units from the same pool (Fuglevand et al., 1993; De Luca and Contessa, 2012).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors claim that the firing behavior as a function of force is well characterized by a natural logarithmic function, which consists of initial steep acceleration followed by a modest increase in firing rate. Arguably the gain modulation in firing rate could be attributed to a neuromodulatory effect on the spinal motoneuron, which has been suggested by a number of animal studies. However, the complexity of the interactions between ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons may require further elucidation to fully understand the mechanisms of neural control; it is possible to consider the differential acceleration among different threshold motor units as a differential combinatory effect of ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs, but it is not trivially determined how differentially or systematically the inputs are organized. Likewise, the authors make an account for the difference in firing rate between TA and VL in terms of different amounts or balances of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the motoneuron pool, but again this could be explained by other factors, such as a different extent of neuromodulatory effects. To determine the complexity of the interactions, further studies will be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s view on this point, as we indeed only indirectly inferred the combination of neuromodulatory and ionotropic inputs to motoneurons in this study. A more direct manipulation of the sources of neuromodulatory and ionotropic inputs will be required in the future to directly highlight the mechanisms responsible for these variations in rate coding within pools. However, it is also worth noting that the acceleration in firing rate, the increase in firing rate during the ramp up, and the hysteresis between ramps up and downs have been used to infer the distribution of ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs from the firing rate/force relations (Johnson et al., 2017; Beauchamp et al., 2023; Chardon et al., 2023). This approach has been validated with hundreds of thousands of simulations using a biophysical model of motor neurons (Chardon et al., 2023). There is also a series of studies in humans showing how the absence of neuromodulation modulated via inhibitory inputs (Revill &amp; Fuglevand, 2017) or medication blocking serotonin receptors (Goodlich et al., 2023) impact the non-linearity of the firing rate/force relation. Therefore, we are confident that the differences observed within and between pools are linked to different distribution of excitatory/inhibitory inputs and neuromodulation.</p><p>We added a sentence in the discussion to highlight this point (P18; L435):</p><p>‘Taken together, these results show how ionotropic and neuromodulatory inputs to motoneurons uniquely combine to generate distinct rate coding across the pool, even if a more direct manipulation of the sources of neuromodulatory and ionotropic inputs will be required to directly estimate their interactions.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) It is unclear with the account &quot; ... the bandwidth of muscle force is &lt; 10Hz during isometric contraction&quot; in the manuscript alone, and therefore, it is difficult to understand the following claim. It appears very interesting and crucial for motor unit discharge and force generation and maintenance because it would pose a question of why the discharge rate of most motor units is higher than 10Hz, despite the bandwidth being so limited, but needs to be elaborated.</p></disp-quote><p>We described the slow fluctuations in smoothed firing rates associated with the variations in force observed during isometric contractions. The bandwidth of muscle force is lower than 10Hz due to the contractile properties of muscle tissues (Baldissera et al., 1998, J Physiol). Having an average firing rate higher than this bandwidth enables the pool of motor neurons to effectively transmit the common inputs (the main discriminant of muscle force) over this bandwidth without distortion (Farina et al., 2014, J Physiol). Increasing the firing rate beyond the muscle bandwidth also increases the power of the spike train at the direct current frequency (frequency equal to 0) since this power is related to the number of spikes per second. Thus, increasing the firing rate well beyond the muscle bandwidth still has a clear effect in force. To illustrate this point, note that electrical stimuli delivered at 100 Hz can lead to an increase in muscle force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The motivation for this study is to provide a comprehensive assessment of motor unit firing rate responses of entire pools during isometric contractions. The authors have used new quantitative methods to extract more unique motor units across contractions than prior studies. This was achieved by recording muscle fibre action potentials from four high-density surface electromyogram (HDsEMG) arrays (Caillet et al., 2023), quantifying residual EMG comparing the recorded and data-based simulation (Figure 1A-B), and developing a metric to compare the spatial identification for each motor unit (Figure 1D-E). From identified motor units, the authors have provided a detailed characterization of recruitment and firing rate responses during slow voluntary isometric contractions in the vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior muscles up to 80% of maximum intensity. In the lower limb, it is interesting how lower threshold motor units have firing rate responses that saturate, whereas higher threshold units that presumably produce higher muscle contractile forces continue to increase their firing rate. In many ways, these results agree with the rate coding of motor units in the extensor digitorum communis muscle (Monster and Chan, 1977). The paper is detailed, and the analyses are well explained. However, there are several points that I think should be addressed to strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their positive appreciation of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>General comments:</p><p>(1) The authors claim they have measured the complete rate coding profiles of motor units in the vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior muscles. However, this study quantified rate coding during slow and prolonged voluntary isometric contractions whereas the function of rate coding during movements (Grimby and Hannerz, 1977) or more complex isometric contractions (Cutsem and Duchateau, 2005; Marshall et al., 2022) remains unexplored. For example, supraspinal inputs may not scale the same way across low and higher threshold motor units, or between muscles (Devanne et al., 1997), making the response of firing rates to increasing isometric contraction force less clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that rate coding strategies may vary with the velocity and the type of contractions (Duchateau &amp; Enoka, 2008, J Physiol). It is thus likely that the firing rate would increase during the first milliseconds of fast contractions, with the occurrence of doublets (Cutsem and Duchateau, 2005, J Physiol; Del Vecchio et al., 2019, J Physiol), or that motor unit firing rate may be lower during lengthening than shortening contractions (Duchateau &amp; Enoka, J Physiol).</p><p>However, the decomposition of EMG signals in non-stationary conditions remains challenging, and is still limited to slow varying patterns of force (Chen et al., 2000, Oliveira &amp; Negro, 2021, Mendez Guerra et al., 2024, Yeung et al., 2024). Future methodological developments will be required to expand our findings to other patterns of force.</p><p>Conceptually, the authors focus on the literature on intrinsic motoneurone properties, but in vivo, other possibilities are that descending supraspinal drive, spinal network dynamics, and afferent inputs have different effects across motor unit sizes, muscles, and types of contractions. Also, the influence from local muscles that act as synergists (e.g., vastii muscles for the vastus lateralis, and peroneal muscles that evert the foot for the tibialis anterior) or antagonists (coactivation during higher contraction intensities would stiffen the joint) may provide differential forms of proprioceptive feedback across motor pools.</p><p>The reviewer is right that differences in spinal network dynamics and afferent inputs may explain the differences in rate coding observed between the two muscles. Indeed, computational models have shown how the pattern of inhibitory inputs may affect the increase in firing rate during linear increase in force (Powers &amp; Heckman, 2017, J Neurophysiol; Chardon et al., 2023, Elife). Specifically, the difference observed between proportional inhibitory inputs vs. a push pull pattern mirror the differences observed here between the TA (push-pull like pattern) and the VL (proportional pattern). This difference may reflect the impact of various pathways of inhibition, such as reciprocal inhibition or recurrent inhibition from homonymous motor units or motor units from synergistic muscles.</p><p>These points have been further discussed in the manuscript (P19; L475):</p><p>‘The increase in firing rate was also significantly greater for TA motor units than for those in VL. This difference may reflect a varying balance between excitatory/inhibitory synaptic inputs and neuromodulation due to multiple spinal circuits (Heckman and Binder, 1993; Heckman et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2017; Powers and Heckman, 2017; Chardon et al., 2023; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Škarabot et al., 2023a</xref>). Specifically, the strength of recurrent and reciprocal inhibitory inputs to motoneurons innervating VL and TA, and their proportional or inverse covariation with excitatory inputs, respectively, may explain the differences in rate limiting and maximal firing rates (Heckman and Binder, 1993; Heckman et al., 2008; Johnson et al., 2017; Powers and Heckman, 2017; Chardon et al., 2023; Škarabot et al., 2023). Thus, the motor units from the VL may receive more recurrent inhibition than those of distal muscles, though direct evidence of these differences remains to be found in humans (Windhorst, 1996). Interestingly, similar differences in rate coding were previously observed between proximal and distal muscles of the upper limb (De Luca et al., 1982). However, other muscles that serve different functions within the human body, such as muscles from the face, have different rate coding characteristics with much higher firing rates (Kirk et al., 2021). Future work should investigate those muscles and other to reveal the myriads of rate coding strategies in human muscles.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The evidence that the entire motor unit pool was recorded per muscle is not clear. There appears to be substantial residual EMG (Figure 1B), signal cancellation of smaller motor units (lines 172-176), some participants had fewer than 20 identified motor units, and contractions never went above 80% of MVC. Also, to my understanding, there remains no gold-standard in awake humans to estimate the total motor unit number in order to determine if the entire pool was decomposed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right that we did not decode the full pool of motor units. As indicated in the initial version of the manuscript (e.g. title, introduction), we considered that we identified an extensive sample of motor units representative of the dynamic of the pool. This claim was supported by the identification of motor units with recruitment thresholds ranging from 0 to 75% of the maximal force.</p><p>This statement was in the introduction (P4; L109): ‘We were able to identify up to ~200 unique active motor units per muscle and per participant in two human muscles in vivo, yielding extensive samples of motor units that are representative of the entire motoneuron pools (Caillet et al., 2023a).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, using four HDsEMG arrays also raises questions about how some channels were placed over non-target muscles, and if motor units were decomposed from surrounding synergists.</p></disp-quote><p>A factor that guided our muscle choice was the low risk of crosstalk. For this, we verified with ultrasound that our arrays of 256 electrodes only covered the muscle of interest, staying away from the neighbouring muscles. This was possible as superficial muscles from the leg are bulkier than those from the upper limb. Given the small diameter of each electrode (2 mm), it is unlikely that the motor units from the neighbouring muscles were in the recorded muscle volume.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors claim (Abstract L51; Discussion L376) that a commonly held view in the field is that rate coding is similar across motor units from the same pool. Perhaps this is in reference to some studies that have carefully assessed lower threshold motor units during lower force ramp contractions (e.g., Fuglevand et al., 2015; Revill and Fuglevand, 2017). However, a more complete integration of the literature exploring motor unit firing rate responses during rapid isometric contractions, comparing different muscles and contraction intensities would be helpful. From Figure 3, the range of rate coding in the tibialis anterior (~7-40 Hz) is greater than the vastus lateralis (~5-22 Hz) muscle across contraction levels. In agreement with other studies, the range of rate coding within some muscles is different than others (Kirk et al., 2021) and during maximal intensity (Bellemare et al., 1983) or rapid contractions (Desmedt and Godaux, 1978). Likewise, within a motor pool, there is a diversity of firing rate responses across motor units of different sizes as a function of isometric force (Monster and Chan, 1977; Desmedt and Godaux, 1977; Kukula and Clamann, 1981; Del Vecchio et al., 2019; Marshall et al., 2022). A strength of this paper is how firing rate responses are quantified across a wide range of motor unit recruitment thresholds and between two muscles. I suggest improving clarity for the general reader, especially in the motivation for testing two lower limb muscles, and elaborating on some of the functional implications.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his input on this question. We have added references to these works and lines of research in the discussion:</p><p>(P18; L449): ‘In addition, rate coding patterns should also vary with the pattern of contractions, with fast contractions lowering the range of recruitment thresholds within motoneuron pools (Desmedt and Godaux, 1977b, 1979; van Bolhuis et al., 1997). The variability in rate coding observed here between motor units from the same pool could lead to small deviations from the size principle sometimes observed between pairs of units during isometric contractions with various patterns of force (Desmedt and Godaux, 1979; Marshall et al., 2022) or during the derecruitment phase (Bracklein et al., 2022).’ (P19; L487): ‘However, other muscles that serve different functions within the human body, such as muscles from the face, have different rate coding characteristics with much higher firing rates (Kirk et al., 2021). Future work should investigate those muscles and other to reveal the myriads of rate coding strategies in human muscles.’</p><p>In addition to the responses above, we have added a section at the beginning of the results to motivate the choice of the muscles (P6; L137):</p><p>‘16 participants performed either isometric dorsiflexion (n = 8) or knee extension tasks (n = 8) while we recorded the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior (TA - dorsiflexion) or the vastus lateralis (VL – knee extension) with four arrays of 64 surface electrodes (256 electrodes per muscle). The motoneuron pools of these two muscles of the lower limb receive a large part of common input (Laine et al., 2015; Negro et al., 2016a), constraining the recruitment of their motor units in a fixed order across tasks. They are therefore good candidates for an accurate description of rate coding. Moreover, we wanted to determine whether differences in rate coding observed between proximal and distal muscles in the upper limb (De Luca et al., 1982) were also present in the lower limb.’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that uses state-of-the-art experimental and simulation approaches to quantify motor unit discharge patterns in the human TA and VL. The non-linear profiles of motor unit discharge were calculated and found to have an initial acceleration phase followed by an attenuation phase.

These relations were consistent across all the participants (Figures 2 to 4), making us confident that increasing the sample size would not change the conclusions of the study.</p><p>It is likely that the differences observed here between the VL and TA will also appear between other muscles of the leg, due to differences in the arrays of excitatory and inhibitory inputs they receive, the pattern of inhibitory inputs during increases in force (recurrent/reciprocal inhibition), and different levels of neuromodulation (Johnson et al., 2017, J Neurophysiol; Beauchamp et al., 2023; J Neural Eng). We have added a paragraph in the results to motivate our choice of muscles (P6; L137):</p><p>‘16 participants performed either isometric dorsiflexion (n = 8) or knee extension tasks (n = 8) while we recorded the EMG activity of the tibialis anterior (TA - dorsiflexion) or the vastus lateralis (VL – knee extension) with four arrays of 64 surface electrodes (256 electrodes per muscle).

Though high-intensity contractions are challenging to decompose - the authors are commended for their technical ability to record population motor unit discharge times with recruitment thresholds up to 75% of a participant's maximal voluntary contractions. However previous groups have seen substantial recruitment of motor units above 80% and even 90% maximum activation in the soleus. Given the innervation ratios of higher threshold motor units, if recruitment continued to 100%, the top quartile would likely represent a substantial portion of the traditional fast-fatigable motor units. It would be highly interesting to understand the recruitment and rate coding of the highest threshold motor units, at a minimum I would suggest using terms other than &quot;entire range&quot; or &quot;full spectrum of recruitment thresholds&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Motor units were indeed identified between 0 and 80% of the maximal force in this study. This is due to the requirements of the decomposition algorithm that needs sustained and stable contraction to converge toward a set of separation vectors that generate sparse spike trains. Thus, it was not possible for our participants to sustain contractions above 80%MVC without generating fatigue.</p><p>However, it is important to note that only a few motor units are recruited above 80% of the maximal force in the TA (Van Cutsem et al., 1998, J Physiol), as well as in other muscles of the lower limb (Oya et al., 2009, J Physiol; Aeles et al., 2020, J Neurophysiol). Thus, we may have only missed a few motor units recruited above 80% of the maximal force. Nevertheless, we removed the terms ‘full spectrum of recruitment thresholds’ and ‘entire range’ from the manuscript to now read ‘most of the spectrum of recruitment thresholds observed in humans.’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The quantification of hysteresis using torque appears to make self-evident the observation that lower threshold motor units demonstrate less hysteresis with respect to torque. If there is motor unit discharge there will be force. I believe this limitation goes beyond the floor effects discussed in the manuscript. Traditionally, individuals have used the discharge of a lower threshold unit as the measure on which to apply hysteresis analyses to infer ion channel function in human spinal motoneurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the hysteresis is classically estimated using the firing rate of a ‘reporter unit’ with the delta F method (introduced in humans by Gorassini et al..), or most recently with the advances in motor unit identification using the cumulative spike train of the identified motor unit. The researchers use this data as a proxy of the synaptic drive, and compare their values at recruitment and derecruitment thresholds of the ‘test unit’.</p><p>As mentioned above in response to reviewer 1, this approach was not possible in our study as we did not have the same units across contractions to estimate cumulative spike trains. It was therefore not possible to pool the data across contractions as we did here to generate force/firing rate relations on the widest range of force. This limitation is now highlighted in the discussion section (P19; L470): ‘This result must be confirmed with a more direct proxy of the net synaptic drive, such as the firing rate of a reference low-threshold motor neuron used in the delta F method (Gorassini et al., 1998), or the cumulative spike train of low-threshold motor neurons (Afsharipour et al., 2020).’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main findings are not entirely novel.

However, we believe that our study shows in humans the incredible variety of rate coding patterns within a pool of motor units that span most of the spectrum of recruitment thresholds observed in humans. It also highlights the variability of rate coding patterns between motor neurons that have a similar recruitment threshold. Finally, we observe differences between pools of motor neurons innervating two different muscles in the lower limb, mirroring what has been done in the past in the upper limb muscle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The wording 'decode' across the manuscript may sound somewhat unsuitable for the context, because 'decode' would involve interpreting the signals and activities to understand how they relate to specific variables or proxies of behavior.

In that way, we were able to sequentially identify motor units recruited from 0% to 75% of the maximal force. A similar approach could be applied to selective intramuscular electrodes.

However, the amplitude of these inhibitory inputs can increase with muscle force. We found that the EMG amplitude of the soleus and the gastrocnemius medialis recorded with bipolar EMG during the dorsiflexion increased with the force. Therefore, the higher inhibitory at higher force may also contribute to the linearisation of the force/firing rate relations observed with high threshold motor neurons, as suggested by Revill and Fuglevand (2017, J Physiol).</p><p>We discussed this point in the new version of the manuscript (P17; L415):</p><p>‘The level of recurrent and reciprocal inhibition has also probably increased with the increase in force during the ramp up, progressively blunting the effect of persistent inward currents for late-recruited motor units (Kuo et al., 2003; Hyngstrom et al., 2007; Revill and Fuglevand, 2017).

This may also explain the larger percentage of high-threshold motor units with a linear fit for the firing rate/force relation (Figure 2), as the integration of larger inhibitory inputs should linearise the firing rate/force relation (Revill and Fuglevand, 2017).’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 433 - intrinsic properties, in particular the afterhyperpolarization, will likely influence maximal discharge rate and provide a ceiling to the change in firing rate.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is now discussed in the draft (P17; L428):</p><p>‘This difference may be explained by smaller excitatory synaptic inputs onto low- than high-threshold motoneurons (Powers and Binder, 2001; Heckman and Enoka, 2012), lower synaptic driving potential of the dendritic membrane (Powers and Binder, 2000; Cushing et al., 2005; Fuglevand et al., 2015), and longer and larger afterhyperpolarisation phase in low- than high-threshold motoneurons (Bakels and Kernell, 1993; Gardiner, 1993; Deardorff et al., 2013; Caillet et al., 2022).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The actual yield per contraction is not entirely clear. Figure S2 is quite nice in this regard, but a table with this and other information on it may be helpful.
