Obesity is a major risk factor for hyperglycemia, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, we show that a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice causes early loss of expression of the glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2) specifically in adipose tissue. Adipose-specific knockout of <italic>Hk2</italic> reduced glucose disposal and lipogenesis and enhanced fatty acid release in adipose tissue. In a non-cell-autonomous manner, <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout also promoted glucose production in liver. Furthermore, we observed reduced hexokinase activity in adipose tissue of obese and diabetic patients, and identified a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>hk2</italic> gene of naturally hyperglycemic Mexican cavefish. Mechanistically, HFD in mice led to loss of HK2 by inhibiting translation of <italic>Hk2</italic> mRNA. Our findings identify adipose HK2 as a critical mediator of local and systemic glucose homeostasis, and suggest that obesity-induced loss of adipose HK2 is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the development of selective insulin resistance and thereby hyperglycemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>obesity</kwd><kwd>glucose</kwd><kwd>lipid

Shulman, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wasserman, 2009</xref>). High blood glucose stimulates pancreatic beta cells to secrete the hormone insulin which in turn promotes glucose disposal in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits glucose production in liver. Although its contribution to glucose clearance is minor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kowalski and Bruce, 2014</xref>), adipose tissue plays a particularly important role in systemic glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shepherd et al., 1993</xref>). Adipose-specific knockout of insulin signaling components, such as the insulin receptor, mTORC2, and AKT, results in local and systemic insulin insensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cybulski et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jiang et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakaguchi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shearin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). However, we and others have reported that diet-induced obesity in mice causes adipose dysfunction, systemic insulin insensitivity, and hyperglycemia despite normal insulin signaling in white adipose tissue (WAT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimobayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>). How does obesity cause systemic insulin insensitivity and hyperglycemia? In other words, how does diet induce hyperglycemia?</p><p>Here, we show that a high-fat diet induces early loss of the glycolytic enzyme HK2 specifically in adipose tissue. Loss of adipose HK2 leads to reduced glucose disposal by adipose tissue and increased glucose production in liver, ultimately causing glucose intolerance. Loss of adipose HK2 also decreased lipogenesis and increased fatty acid release in WAT. This and related findings in Mexican cavefish and adipose tissue of obese patients suggest that diet-induced downregulation of adipose HK2 contributes to hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HK2 is down-regulated in obese mice and humans</title><p>To determine the molecular basis of diet-induced hyperglycemia in mice, we performed an unbiased proteomic analysis on visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) isolated from C57BL/6JRj wild-type mice fed a HFD for 4 weeks or normal diet (ND) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). We detected and quantified 6294 proteins of which 52 and 67 were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in vWAT of HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The glycolytic enzyme Hexokinase 2 (HK2), expressed in adipose tissue and muscle, was among the proteins significantly down-regulated in vWAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We focused on HK2 due to its role in glucose metabolism. HK2 phosphorylates glucose to generate glucose-6-phosphate (G6P), the rate-limiting step in glycolysis, in an insulin-stimulated manner. HK2 is the most abundant (~80%) of the three hexokinase isoforms expressed in vWAT but the only one down-regulated upon HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Quantification by immunoblotting revealed an approximately 60%, 90% and 50% reduction in HK2 expression in vWAT, subcutaneous WAT (sWAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT), respectively, of 4 week HFD mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Consistent with reduced HK2 expression, hexokinase activity was decreased in WAT of HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). HK2 expression was also decreased in WAT of ND-fed <italic>ob/ob</italic> mice, compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), suggesting that loss of HK2 is common to different obesogenic conditions. A longitudinal study of HFD-fed mice revealed that HK2 down-regulation in adipose tissue occurred within one week of HFD and correlated with systemic insulin insensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–F</xref>). HK2 expression was unchanged in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was slightly reduced in vWAT at 4 weeks of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In sWAT, GLUT4 was down-regulated at <underline>&gt;</underline>1 week of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Confirming earlier observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shimobayashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2015</xref>), insulin signaling was normal in WAT at 4 weeks of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2D–E</xref>). However, in BAT, insulin signaling was significantly downregulated within 1 week of HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>).

Importantly, hexokinase activity was particularly low in obese non-diabetic patients with severe insulin resistance, compared to patients with mild insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Although hexokinase activity negatively correlated with insulin resistance in obese patients, this correlation was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), suggesting that loss of hexokinase activity may not be the only cause of insulin resistance in human. We note that Ducluzeau et al. observed a decrease in <italic>HK2</italic> mRNA expression in adipose tissue of diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ducluzeau et al., 2001</xref>). Altogether, the above findings suggest that HK2 down-regulation in adipose tissue is a key event, possibly causal, in obesity-induced insulin insensitivity and hyperglycemia in mouse and human.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A loss-of-function <italic>hk2</italic> mutation in hyperglycemic cavefish</title><p>Mexican cavefish (<italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>), also known as blind fish, are hyperglycemic compared to surface fish from which they are descended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Hyperglycemia, although a pathological condition in mouse and human, is a selected trait that presumably allows cave-dwelling fish to survive in nutrient-limited conditions. Among three independently evolved cavefish isolates, Pachón and Tinaja cavefish (names refer to the caves from which the fish were isolated) acquired a loss-of-function mutation in the insulin receptor gene, causing insulin resistance and hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The third isolate, Molino cavefish, is the most hyperglycemic but contains a wild-type insulin receptor gene and displays normal insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Riddle et al., 2018</xref>). Since the phenotype of Molino fish is similar to that of HFD-fed mice (normal insulin signaling yet hyperglycemic), we hypothesized that this cavefish may be hyperglycemic due to a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>hk2</italic> gene. DNA sequencing of the <italic>hk2</italic> gene of surface fish and the three cavefish variants revealed a mutation in the <italic>hk2</italic> gene uniquely in Molino. The homozygous, missense mutation in the coding region of the Molino <italic>hk2</italic> gene changed highly conserved arginine 42 (R42) to histidine (R42H) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Based on the published structure of HK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nawaz et al., 2018</xref>), R42 forms a salt bridge with aspartic acid 272 (D272) to stabilize the conformation of HK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), predicting that R42H destabilizes HK2 and is thus a loss-of-function mutation. To test this prediction, we expressed surface fish and Molino HK2 in HEK293T cells which have low intrinsic hexokinase activity. Indeed, Molino HK2 displayed little-to-no hexokinase activity compared to surface fish HK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To test whether R42H causes loss of function in mammalian HK2, we examined hexokinase activity of recombinant mammalian HK2 containing the Molino mutation (HK2-R42H). HK2-R42H displayed ~50% hexokinase activity compared to HK2-WT, despite similar expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Thus, the R42H mutation may account for the hyperglycemia in Molino cavefish. In other words, R42H in Molino appears to be a genetically fixed version of what we observe in mice as a physiological down-regulation of HK2 in response to HFD. Although further study is required to link the R42H mutation to the hyperglycemic phenotype in Molino cavefish, the findings in Molino provide orthogonal evidence that the down-regulation of HK2 in mice is physiologically relevant in hyperglycemia.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>A loss-of-function HK2 variant in hyperglycemic Mexican cavefish.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface fish and Mexican cavefish Molino.

Glycolytic metabolites were also decreased in WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Furthermore, insulin signaling was normal in adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) and other tissues (see below) of AdHk2KO mice. ND-fed AdHk2KO mice displayed slightly less fat mass and slightly more lean mass than controls, but no difference in overall body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). No significant difference was observed in the weight of individual organs except for a small decrease in vWAT and a small increase in liver weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). vWAT and sWAT from AdHk2KO and control mice were morphologically indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). AdHk2KO and control mice displayed similar mRNA expression and circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F–I</xref>). Expression of brown adipocyte markers (<italic>Ucp1</italic> and <italic>Dio2</italic>) was also unchanged in AdHk2KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2J</xref>). The above similarities in adipose tissue from AdHk2KO and control mice are not surprising given that the HK2 knockout was induced at 4–5 weeks of age, after adipose tissue is fully developed. However, contrary to controls, ND-fed AdHk2KO mice were insulin insensitive and severely glucose intolerant as measured by conventional tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). Moreover, glucose intolerance was observed in adipose-specific heterozygous <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). These data indicate that partial loss of HK2, as observed in HFD-fed wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), is sufficient to cause glucose intolerance. We also measured the insulin insensitivity of AdHk2KO mice in hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>).

We indeed observed increased glucose production in AdHk2KO mice under hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To test further whether the increased glucose production in AdHk2KO mice is due to enhanced gluconeogenesis, we performed a pyruvate tolerance test (PTT). AdHk2KO mice displayed significantly higher production of glucose upon pyruvate injection, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with the observed increase in pyruvate-dependent glucose production, gluconeogenic genes (<italic>G6pc</italic> and <italic>Pepck</italic>) were upregulated in AdHk2KO liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These findings suggest that enhanced hepatic glucose production accounts for the severity of glucose intolerance in AdHk2KO mice. Thus, loss of adipose HK2 non-cell-autonomously promotes glucose intolerance by enhancing hepatic glucose production.</p><p>We observed enhanced glucose production in AdHk2KO mice despite normal systemic insulin signaling, including in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is an apparent paradox because insulin signaling normally inhibits glucose production. To investigate this paradox, we examined hepatic lipogenic gene expression, another readout for insulin action. The insulin-stimulated transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c (SREBP1c) and carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) activate fatty acid synthesis genes and thereby promote de novo lipogenesis in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Iizuka et al., 2004</xref>).

FASN and ACC protein levels were also slightly increased in liver of AdHk2KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These findings indicate that loss of adipose HK2 does not inhibit hepatic lipogenesis although hepatic glucose production is enhanced. The increased hepatic glucose production and maintained lipogenesis, as observed in AdHk2KO mice, resembles a condition in diabetic patients known as selective insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 2008</xref>; see below). Thus, loss of adipose HK2 causes selective insulin resistance and thereby contributes to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>We note that hepatic triglyceride (TG) levels were unchanged in AdHk2KO mice despite increased expression of lipogenic genes and enzymes in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>) and increased de novo TG synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

Based on these observations, we hypothesized that HFD-induced loss of ChREBP activity and thus lipogenesis in adipose tissue may cause increased hepatic glucose production. To test this hypothesis, we examined <italic>Mlxipl/Chrebp</italic> expression in adipose tissue of AdHk2KO mice. ChREBP has two isoforms. Constitutively expressed ChREBPα promotes transcription of ChREBPβ which then activates lipogenic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herman et al., 2012</xref>).

In this study, we show that HFD causes hyperglycemia by inducing loss of HK2 specifically in adipose tissue. Loss of adipose HK2 is sufficient to cause glucose intolerance, in two ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). First, HK2 loss results in reduced glucose disposal by adipose tissue due to the inability of adipocytes to trap and metabolize non-phosphorylated glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, loss of HK2 in adipocytes de-represses glucose production in liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). We propose that loss of adipose HK2 is a mechanism of diet-induced insulin insensitivity and hyperglycemia.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Diet-induced HK2 in adipose tissue promotes glucose intolerance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HK2 promotes lipogenesis and suppresses NEFA release in adipose tissue (left), suppressing hepatic glucose production (right) and thus maintaining glucose homeostasis.

Paradoxically, in type 2 diabetes, insulin fails to inhibit glucose production yet stimulates lipogenesis, hence the liver is selectively insulin resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, previous findings suggest that selective insulin resistance occurs despite intact hepatic insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Titchenell et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with these previous findings, we observed that loss of adipose HK2 causes selective insulin resistance without affecting hepatic insulin signaling. Thus, we propose that loss of adipose HK2 is a mechanism for selective insulin resistance in liver and ultimately diabetes.</p><p>How does adipose HK2 control hepatic glucose production? As described above, one possible explanation is that decreased lipogenesis and increased NEFA release in adipose tissue, due to loss of HK2, promotes glucose production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Perry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Titchenell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayakumar et al., 2017</xref>). Another interesting possibility is that loss of adipose HK2 causes increased hepatic glucose production via the central nervous system (CNS). Adipose tissue has a sensory nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blaszkiewicz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fishman and Dark, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kreier et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Makwana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Song et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2022</xref>) which may communicate with the liver via the sympathetic nervous system. Sympathetic activity promotes hepatic glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niijima and Fukuda, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shimazu and Fukuda, 1965</xref>). The above two models are not mutually exclusive since released bioactive fatty acids could act directly on the liver and/or adipose sensory neurons. A third possibility to explain increased hepatic glucose production is that increased glucose uptake by the liver due to reduced glucose disposal in adipose tissue may stimulate hepatic glucose production, consistent with the demonstration by Kim et al. that hepatic ChREBP promotes glucose production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The phenotype of AdHk2KO mice is similar to that of adipose-specific GLUT4 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>). Both knockout mice display reduced lipogenesis in adipose tissue and are hyperglycemic due to decreased glucose disposal in adipose tissue and increased glucose production in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayakumar et al., 2017</xref>). The phenotypic similarity of GLUT4 and HK2 knockout mice underscores the importance of adipose glucose metabolism in systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. However, our findings on diet-induced HK2 downregulation provide important new insight on the development of diet-induced hyperglycemia. First, unlike GLUT4, HK2 downregulation in adipose tissue correlates with HFD-induced hyperglycemia in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, it has been shown that glucose or a downstream metabolite(s) promotes ChREBP activity and lipogenesis in metabolic organs including adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ortega-Prieto and Postic, 2019</xref>). Two previous studies demonstrated that HFD prevents ChREBP activation and lipogenesis in adipose tissue, which leads to hyperglycemia due to enhanced hepatic glucose production in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vijayakumar et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, one of these studies showed that HFD inhibits ChREBP activity in adipose tissue independently of GLUT4 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Herman et al., 2012</xref>), concluding that the underlying mechanism of HFD-induced inhibition of ChREBP and hyperglycemia is still unknown. Our findings suggest that the physiological mechanism of HFD-induced inhibition of adipose ChREBP and lipogenesis, and consequently hyperglycemia, may be loss of HK2. Thus, we propose that the primary defect in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice is not at the level of GLUT4 expression and glucose transport, but rather at the level of HK2 expression and glucose phosphorylation.</p><p>Can HFD-resistant HK2 expression in adipose tissue prevent diet-induced insulin insensitivity and hyperglycemia? To this point, our attempts to express HK2 in WAT of HFD-fed mice were unsuccessful (unpublished data), most likely because HK2 expression is tightly controlled at the post-transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Importantly, expression of glucokinase (also known as HK4, hepatic hexokinase) in adipose tissue has been shown to prevent insulin insensitivity in HFD-fed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muñoz et al., 2010</xref>). Elucidating the molecular mechanism of HFD-induced translational repression of HK2 may lead to a novel strategy in the treatment of insulin insensitivity and type 2 diabetes.</p><p>A previous study demonstrated that global heterozygous <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout mice have normal, even better, glucose tolerance compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heikkinen et al., 1999</xref>). How can one explain this apparent discrepancy between global <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout and our adipose-specific Hk2 knockout? We note that adipose-specific GLUT4 knockout mice display glucose intolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2001</xref>), but global GLUT4 knockout mice are glucose tolerant due to a compensatory increase in glucose uptake in liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Katz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ranalletta et al., 2005</xref>). We observed increased systemic glycolysis in AdHk2KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3F</xref>). Global ablation of HK2 mice may provoke an even stronger compensatory response to maintain systemic glucose homeostasis. This may also explain the observation that global heterozygous <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout mice display better glucose handling than wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heikkinen et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We note that <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout did not completely phenocopy to the effect of obesity in mice and humans. While HK2 was decreased approximately 75% in vWAT of AdHk2KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), HK2 expression in HFD-fed mice and HK activity in oWAT from obese patients were decreased only ~60% and~30%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and G</xref>). Is the reduction in HK2 in obese mice and patients sufficient to contribute to systemic insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance? A previous study showed that adipose-specific <italic>Rab10</italic> knockout mice display reduced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane and thus a ~50% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal, in isolated adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vazirani et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, adipose-specific <italic>Rab10</italic> knockout mice failed to suppress hepatic glucose production and were thus insulin insensitive, indicating that a limited disruption in glucose metabolism in adipose tissue can significantly impact systemic insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. Thus, the partial loss of HK2 observed in obese mice and patients may be sufficient to impact systemic insulin sensitivity and thereby glucose homeostasis.</p><p>We found an HK2-R42H mutation in naturally hyperglycemic Mexican cavefish.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David E James (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specifically, a key finding in your study--that adipose HK2 KO causes systemic glucose intolerance--is expected based on previous data on GLUT4, but it doesn't mimic conditions observed in obesity where the inhibition on HK2 expression is not complete. Experiments that would be required to test the effects of adipose HK2 depletion that mirrors what is observed in obesity will be difficult but may be possible. The reviews provided below address other important concerns that reflect what is viewed as a preliminary stage of the study. If you are able in the future to address the several specific points raised in the reviews with additional experiments in a detailed and compelling way, and still wish to have it evaluated by <italic>eLife</italic>, we will do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript which reports effects of adipose HK2 KO in an attempt to determine the role of hexokinase in adipocytes as it relates to whole body metabolism. The data indicate that VAT HK2 is strongly downregulated in obesity/HFD, while SAT shows some decrease as well, although less of an effect than seen in VAT. The adipose tissue selective KO causes marked changes in systemic glucose tolerance. The authors conclude that this ability of adipose HK2 to modify glucose tolerance is due to its requirement for the esterification of FA that is released in lipolysis. Therefore, in HK2KO adipocytes, more FA is released into the circulation and is hypothetically able to induce gluconeogenesis by known mechanisms. The following two most important concerns are noted:</p><p>1. It is not surprising that HK2 KO in adipocytes causes glucose intolerance, as previous work has clearly demonstrated that inhibiting glucose metabolism in adipocytes has this consequence. In this regard, adipocyte GLUT4KO shows a similar phenotype and this has been studied in great detail in the past. Similar to GLUT4, the authors show here that HK2 is also decreased in obesity, and therefore could contribute to decreasing adipocyte glucose metabolism and the effect on glucose tolerance. However, a full KO of HK2 does not mimic the physiological system in obesity since HK2 is diminished but not totally inhibited in the obese state in humans and in the SAT of mice, while the KO completely eliminates the enzyme. Since glucose transport is considered to be rate limiting for glucose uptake, the argument hinges on whether the level of decrease in HK2 in obesity is actually contributing much to a decrease in glucose metabolism compared to the contribution of the decreased GLUT4. A much more informative experiment would be to study het mice where HK2 might be decreased to a more physiological level that is actually seen in obesity rather than the full KO where the result is difficult to interpret.</p><p>2. The text goes beyond the data in attributing correlation to causation. Examples are Figure 5 and Figure 6 legends that ascribe defined mechanisms to what are essentially correlations that are observed. It is not shown definitively in the data of Figure 5, for example, that de novo lipogenesis deficiency causes increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. As a matter of fact, hepatic gluconeogenesis is not measured in this Figure. And the NEFA data are correlative with the decreased adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis. Similarly, Figure 6 doesn't show mechanism, only correlation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is well established that feeding mice with western diets causes insulin resistance in liver, adipose tissue and muscle. There are many studies that propose various mechanisms for this effect. This paper describes a completely new and exciting mechanism involving changes in the expression of hexokinase 2, an important glycolytic enzyme, in adipose tissue. The authors provide sufficient evidence to show that the expression of hexokinase 2 in adipose tissue is able to regulate whole body metabolism. However, there are some issues that the authors could address prior to further consideration of the study. For example, further information that might address the mechanism for the fall in hexokinase 2 would be valuable and an explanation for the disparity between some of the measures of insulin sensitivity are also necessary.</p><p>This is a terrific study that brings new light on this heavily studied problem of metabolic dysfunction in the high fat fed mouse. The data is for the most part of very high quality and the manuscript is well written and researched.</p><p>1. The biggest issue for me with this paper is the huge discrepancy between the 'clamp' data and the other measures of insulin action. I have personally never seen such a massive defect in insulin action by clamp as this. It essentially shows that there is zero response to insulin whatsoever in these mice. Yet all other tests (GTT, ITT etc) show a relatively mild phenotype. The tissue specific glucose uptake is also not in step with this defect in that the liver defect is mild, there is no apparent defect in muscle and the only real defect is in adipose tissue, which theoretically accounts for a small proportion of whole body glucose utilisation. The other issue is that in absolute terms 2DG uptake in muscle is on par with WAT which seems worthy of questioning. I was unable to find the insulin levels generated during the clamp so I am not sure if that is a problem. I strongly urge the authors to go back over these data to see if they can spot a calculation error.</p><p>2. Given that the authors have deep proteomics data from these mice it would be interesting to run a co-regulation analysis (e.g. WGCNA) to determine if there are other proteins in the data that behave like HK2, as this might provide some mechanistic hints.</p><p>3. The mechanism for the loss of insulin regulation of lipolysis in the HK Mice is interesting. I was not particularly convinced by the glycerol data as measures of plasma glycerol are not particularly informative as it probably has a very high flux. So as a minimum I think this part needs expansion.</p><p>4. In your AHA experiments which are very nice it would be valuable if you could show some 'control' proteins that do not behave like HK2.</p><p>5. It would be fascinating to know if deletion of HK2 has affected GLUT4 translocation? I know this might be a bit of a stretch for the authors but it might be easily achievable in your 3T3-L1 cells if you could express t</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Shimobayashi et al. investigate the molecular pathogenesis of high-fat diet induced insulin resistance with a focus on adipose tissue. The authors show that short-term (4 weeks) high-fat diet is sufficient to cause glucose intolerance in male mice. Through a proteomic screen, they identify downregulation of HK2 in visceral fat as one of many changes in the adipose proteome in this timeframe. The authors observe that HK2 expression and HK activity is reduced in adipose tissue in human obesity. The authors propose that down-regulation of adipose HK2 is an early and critical step in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The authors also observe that the hyperglycemic Molino Cavefish sub-species carries an inactivating mutation in HK2 and propose that this contributes to hyperglycemia in this model organism. The authors generate adipose specific HK2 knockout mice and show that this is sufficient to cause peripheral insulin resistance with reduced glucose uptake in WAT and BAT as well as hepatic insulin resistance with increased glucose production. This is a well-written manuscript conducted with sophistication and technical expertise. The comprehensive phenotyping of the adipose HK2 KO mice is a strength and the phenotypes are clear and robust. However, as detailed below, previously published data not discussed in this manuscript indicates that substantial reductions in HK2 activity in vivo are insufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and this undermines the author's conclusion that downregulation of HK2 is the critical step in high-fat diet induced changes in adipose function.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1. Prior literature (PMID: 10428828) indicates that global HK2 heterozygous mice demonstrated a 50% reduction in tissue HK2 activity (in both adipose and muscle) but have normal glucose homeostasis including normal glucose tolerance and insulin action. Although the authors show that complete ablation of adipose HK2 can impair systemic glucose metabolism, the previously published work calls in to question the physiological importance intermediate reductions in adipose HK2 activity that are commonly observed with obesity or dietary interventions. This is particularly true for humans where mean adipose HK activity is reduced by ~ 50% in people with obesity with substantial variance and overlap with those who are lean. The current work must be discussed with respect to this prior literature. Is there a dose-dependent effect of adipose-selective loss of HK2 on glucose homeostasis that is not apparent in global heterozygous mice?</p><p>2. Pg. 4-5, &quot;…. expression of the glucose transporter GLUT4 was not affected in vWAT within 4 weeks of HFD (Figure 1A and Figure S1L).&quot; Although the data in Figure 1A supports this conclusion in vWAT, in Figures S1L it appears there is significant down regulation of GLUT4 at 1 and 2 weeks on HFD in vWAT. Although there is some recovery at week 4, Glut4 levels still appear lower than at week 0. These and other blots throughout the manuscript should be quantified. What is the level of GLUT4 expression in BAT? If GLUT4 is diminished in this time frame, this may require significant revision of the authors' conclusions and discussion.</p><p>3. Figure 1C; G6P, F6P, and F1,6P are not significantly reduced in adipose tissue with HFD which argues against HK2 as the pivotal enzymatic step controlling the rate of glucose flux into adipose in this condition. Measurement of static metabolite levels are likely not sufficient to draw any firm conclusions on this and the authors should consider flux analysis using stable isotopes which may be much more informative.</p><p>4. The authors note that multiple species of cavefish are hyperglycemic and identify a variant in Molino cavefish in the HK2 gene (Figure 2) with reduced activity in vitro. As the authors note, independently evolved Cavefish have repeatedly developed distinct mutations in genes regulating diverse aspects of metabolism and fuel homeostasis including mutations in the insulin receptor and MC4R to survive their nutrient depleted environment. The authors suggest that the HK2 mutation may mediate the hyperglycemia in the Molino sub-species. While the hypothesis is interesting and testable, no experiments are performed in this manuscript that tests the role of HK2 mutant in the glycemic phenotype. As presented, the presence of the HK2 mutation in hyperglycemic fish is entirely correlative and does not provide strong support for the conclusion that HK2 plays a causal role in hyperglycemia.</p><p>5. Pg. 9, line 201: &quot;However, adipose tissue accounts for only &lt;5% of glucose disposal (Jackson et al., 1986; Kowalski and 203 Bruce, 2014).&quot; These estimates do not consider the role of BAT in glucose disposal which is likely substantial in mice as suggested by the author's own data (Figure 4A). How much of the phenotype is driven by reduced BAT glucose uptake? BAT glucose uptake may be less relevant in larger animals including humans which may diminish the importance of these findings for human insulin resistance.</p><p>6. To support the hypothesis that the incomplete reductions in HK2 activity that are observed with high-fat diet in mice or obesity and diabetes in humans are important, the authors should determine with adipose HK2 heterozygosity is sufficient to impair glucose homeostasis.</p><p>7. The data regarding the HK variant in Molino cavefish is intriguing, but correlative and preliminary. It doesn't substantially help the key arguments. The authors should consider crossing Molino fish with surface fish to determine whether the hyperglycemic phenotype segregates with the HK2 mutation.</p><p>8. Figure 1C, 3E. The authors should show heat maps for metabolite levels for all animals rather than an aggregate fold change. It is difficult to interpret these results without some idea of the variance in the measures across animals. Were statistics for metabolites corrected for multiple comparisons?</p><p>9. Pg 5, line 112: &quot;Importantly, hexokinase activity inversely correlated with insulin resistance in obese non-diabetic patients (Figure 1F).&quot; The data shows that mean HK activity is ~ 30% lower in people with high HOMA-IR compared to low HOMA-IR. Correlation was not tested. However, given the substantial overlap in HK activity between groups, this is worth examining. Is the variance in HK activity a major 'contributor' to the variance in HOMA-IR by regression?</p><p>10. Figure 3E. Is this in fed or fasted mice? Does feeding status make a difference in these metabolite levels? The significant difference in pyruvate, but not upstream metabolites suggest important regulation in proximity to pyruvate production or catabolism, and not necessarily at the HK2 step.</p><p>11. What was the insulin infusion rate during the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps?</p><p>12. Adipose HK2 KO increases endogenous glucose production and appears to increase hepatic ChREBP activity along with ChREBP targets. Is this increase in ChREBP activity due to increased liver glucose uptake as a result of impaired WAT/BAT glucose uptake – i.e. shunting of glucose to the liver? Activation of ChREBP in the liver has been shown to regulate G6Pc expression and drive glucose production (PMID: 27669460). Could this be an alternative explanation for the increased glucose production in adipose HK2 KO mice?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Diet-induced loss of adipose Hexokinase 2 triggers hyperglycemia&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

See reviewers' comments.</p><p>One issue that does seem to be critical is to directly address the issue that your HK2 KO and even the Het KO reduce HK2 more than obesity in humans (nearly 100% and about 70%, respectively vs only about 30% in obesity). Further, the improvement in glucose tolerance is very small in the hetKO, which brings into question whether the smaller decrease in HK2 in obesity does actually have a significant contribution to glucose tolerance. No ITT is provided for the hetKO either. Again, if you do not wish to provide further data on this issue, the text should clearly note this result in the Results section and discuss this problem in the Discussion, and include caution on the significance of the decrease in HK2 in obesity in contributing to insulin resistance in humans.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is an excellent study and the authors have properly responded to most of the comments of the reviewers. The study extends previous reports that genetic disruptions of glucose metabolism in adipose (WAT and BAT) affect whole-body glucose homeostasis. Prior studies include KO of GLUT4, RAB10, and ChREBP. Of note, KO of RAB10 in brown fat (UCP1 CRE) also induces whole-body glucose dysregulation. The RAB10 KO studies (PMID: 34303022, PMID: 27207531) should be included in the discussion because RAB10 KO causes an approximate 50% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake yet still has a large whole-body metabolic impact, in line with the argument the authors make about obesity/HFD causing a partial reduction in HK2 that has large whole body effect.</p><p>Some comments for the authors to consider:</p><p>1. There are a couple of instances in which the description of the data does not completely jive with the data presented. For example, on page 3, they state &quot;Consistent with reduced HK2 expression, hexokinase activity, and downstream glycolytic metabolites were decreased in.…&quot;. However, the data in Figure 1d do not support a change in glycolic metabolites. Only 2PG is reduced. Strikingly, there is no reduction in G6P, the product of HK2, and perhaps the metabolite most likely to be changed. Just looking at the data, one would conclude that HFD has little effect on glycolic metabolites. I realize there are potential issues with steady-state versus flux measurements but it doesn't seem appropriate to conclude a change in glycolytic intermediates because that is what is expected if the data do not support the conclusion. If the method is not appropriate to measure a difference, then the steady-state data should be removed from the manuscript or flux performed.</p><p>Similarly, I am not sure how to interpret the data in Figure 1G, H, and I. The data in H show a statistically significant difference between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; HOMO-IR groups in HK activity, although the effect size is very small. The text refers to severe and mild insulin resistance (HOMO-IR) groupings. What is the homo-IR cutoff for this distinction? Is this accepted or is it based on the structure of this data (e.g., quartiles)? What do the data for HK activity look like for the obese diabetic group (from panel G)? Are those all low HK activity?</p><p>The Pearson's correlation in panel I, although trending to a negative correlation, is not significant, which I believe is what one would expect if HK activity was not the only contributor to HOMO-IR. However, the authors suggest the failure to achieve statistical significance is because the measurement (HK activity rather than HK2 amount) is insufficient, which then begs the question of the validity of the measurement for the analyses in panel H.</p><p>I do not mean to be nit-picking here but I believe the major impact of the paper rests on linking a reduction in HK2 to obesity/insulin resistance since, as noted above, it is known that disruptions in glucose metabolism of adipocytes induce whole-body glucose intolerance. Re-describing and or re-analyzing the human data seems in order.</p><p>2. I agree with the authors that the Molino fish data are &quot;cool&quot; but they also disrupt the flow of the work (and as noted in the previous review they are somewhat &quot;superficial&quot; from the metabolism perspective). Might I suggest they move these data to the end of the result section, where they will not disrupt the flow and be appreciated as further support for the hypothesis linking HK2 to hyperglycemia?</p><p>3. I think the 3T3-L1 experiments are of limited value and could be removed without impacting the conclusions of the work. I might be missing the point of these data but I think all they show is that HK2 has a role in in vitro differentiated adipocytes. I am not sure how that impacts the conclusions of the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The response to previous reviews (by other reviewers) seems highly appropriate to this reviewer. Incurring in the analysis of heterozygotic adipocyte HK2 mice addressed major points brought in during that first review. There is an important point that however requires consideration.</p><p>This reviewer would only like to raise the following points that could be attended to with appropriate discussion in the text:</p><p>1. The findings presented do not support that there is a defect in glucose transport in adipocytes. There is a reduction in glucose deposition in adipose tissue during a hyperinsulinemic clamp of adipose-specific HK2 KO mice (Figure 5) and there is lower insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose deposition in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes depleted of HK2. However, there is no change in glucose-6-phosphate levels in adipose tissue of 4-week HFD-fed mice (Figure 1 D) and there is also no difference in the basal 2-deoxyglucose deposition in the HK2-depleted 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure 3E). Since 2-deoxyglucose deposition depends on hexokinase activity, it is not clear why the reduction was only seen in response to insulin. These findings deserve some comment, and the end of the 2nd paragraph of page 13 as well as the 1st paragraph of the Discussion could also be accordingly amended.</p><p>2. The above findings also mean that the model in figure 8 must be modified (it currently shows less glucose transport into adipocytes). The model should also include the other two possibilities for crosstalk with the liver mentioned on page 12 (3rd paragraph of Discussion).</p><p>3.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript which reports effects of adipose HK2 KO in an attempt to determine the role of hexokinase in adipocytes as it relates to whole body metabolism. The data indicate that VAT HK2 is strongly downregulated in obesity/HFD, while SAT shows some decrease as well, although less of an effect than seen in VAT. The adipose tissue selective KO causes marked changes in systemic glucose tolerance. The authors conclude that this ability of adipose HK2 to modify glucose tolerance is due to its requirement for the esterification of FA that is released in lipolysis. Therefore, in HK2KO adipocytes, more FA is released into the circulation and is hypothetically able to induce gluconeogenesis by known mechanisms. The following two most important concerns are noted:</p><p>1. It is not surprising that HK2 KO in adipocytes causes glucose intolerance, as previous work has clearly demonstrated that inhibiting glucose metabolism in adipocytes has this consequence. In this regard, adipocyte GLUT4KO shows a similar phenotype and this has been studied in great detail in the past. Similar to GLUT4, the authors show here that HK2 is also decreased in obesity, and therefore could contribute to decreasing adipocyte glucose metabolism and the effect on glucose tolerance. However, a full KO of HK2 does not mimic the physiological system in obesity since HK2 is diminished but not totally inhibited in the obese state in humans and in the SAT of mice, while the KO completely eliminates the enzyme. Since glucose transport is considered to be rate limiting for glucose uptake, the argument hinges on whether the level of decrease in HK2 in obesity is actually contributing much to a decrease in glucose metabolism compared to the contribution of the decreased GLUT4. A much more informative experiment would be to study het mice where HK2 might be decreased to a more physiological level that is actually seen in obesity rather than the full KO where the result is difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this concern by characterizing adipose-specific heterozygous HK2 knockout mice. The partial loss of adipose HK2 causes glucose intolerance (Figure S5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The text goes beyond the data in attributing correlation to causation. Examples are Figure 5 and Figure 6 legends that ascribe defined mechanisms to what are essentially correlations that are observed. It is not shown definitively in the data of Figure 5, for example, that de novo lipogenesis deficiency causes increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. As a matter of fact, hepatic gluconeogenesis is not measured in this Figure. And the NEFA data are correlative with the decreased adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis. Similarly, Figure 6 doesn't show mechanism, only correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>Relying on known mechanisms (PMID: 29069585, 25662011, and 27238637), we concluded that increased NEFA release and decreased adipose lipogenesis contribute to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis in adipose-specific <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout (AdHk2KO) mice. We agree with this reviewer that we do not provide direct evidence that goes beyond correlation in the current study. Thus, we softened our conclusion for these figures (now Figure 6). In the Discussion, we discuss how loss of adipose HK2 might be linked to increased hepatic glucose production and thus glucose intolerance in AdHk2KO mice (Page 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is well established that feeding mice with western diets causes insulin resistance in liver, adipose tissue and muscle. There are many studies that propose various mechanisms for this effect. This paper describes a completely new and exciting mechanism involving changes in the expression of hexokinase 2, an important glycolytic enzyme, in adipose tissue. The authors provide sufficient evidence to show that the expression of hexokinase 2 in adipose tissue is able to regulate whole body metabolism. However, there are some issues that the authors could address prior to further consideration of the study. For example, further information that might address the mechanism for the fall in hexokinase 2 would be valuable and an explanation for the disparity between some of the measures of insulin sensitivity are also necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Please find our response to these concerns directly below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a terrific study that brings new light on this heavily studied problem of metabolic dysfunction in the high fat fed mouse. The data is for the most part of very high quality and the manuscript is well written and researched.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for finding our study ‘terrific’ and of ‘very high quality.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The biggest issue for me with this paper is the huge discrepancy between the 'clamp' data and the other measures of insulin action. I have personally never seen such a massive defect in insulin action by clamp as this. It essentially shows that there is zero response to insulin whatsoever in these mice. Yet all other tests (GTT, ITT etc) show a relatively mild phenotype. The tissue specific glucose uptake is also not in step with this defect in that the liver defect is mild, there is no apparent defect in muscle and the only real defect is in adipose tissue, which theoretically accounts for a small proportion of whole body glucose utilisation. The other issue is that in absolute terms 2DG uptake in muscle is on par with WAT which seems worthy of questioning. I was unable to find the insulin levels generated during the clamp so I am not sure if that is a problem. I strongly urge the authors to go back over these data to see if they can spot a calculation error.</p></disp-quote><p>We went back over the data and checked calculations. We did not identify an error. As one can see in the glucose infusion data (Figure 5F and its source data), we did not need to infuse glucose in 4 out of 6 KO mice to maintain euglycemia (150 mg/dL, Figure 5E and its source data). Since reduced glucose infusion was already obvious in the raw data, it could not be the case that the defect in insulin action is due to a calculation error.</p><p>Finally, it is important to note that the conclusion drawn from our clamp data is in line with other tests. The clamp data support our conclusion that adipose-specific HK2 loss causes insulin insensitivity and glucose intolerance.</p><p>Please note that 2DG uptake is normalized to the mass of the analyzed tissue (approx.0.05-0.1 g), not to the mass of the whole tissue. Since muscle mass (lean mass, 70-80% of body weight) is much larger than WAT (1-2% of bodyweight) and BAT (0.5% of bodyweight) mass, our data still show that the majority of 2DG (glucose) is disposed in muscle. This is mentioned in the legend of figure 5A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Given that the authors have deep proteomics data from these mice it would be interesting to run a co-regulation analysis (e.g. WGCNA) to determine if there are other proteins in the data that behave like HK2, as this might provide some mechanistic hints.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we performed a co-regulation analysis in the AHA-proteome and RNAseq data to identify proteins whose expression correlated with HK2. We identified 155 proteins whose AHA incorporation was downregulated and correlated with the AHA incorporation of HK2 in WAT of HFD-fed mice. Next, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis to identify pathways regulated like HK2. The top five pathways enriched among the 155 proteins are ribosomal proteins, the electron transport chain (ETC), oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), fatty acid (FA) synthesis, and glycolysis (Figure S9A). Interestingly, similar to HK2, the AHA incorporation into ribosomal proteins and proteins in ETC and OXPHOS was reduced without affecting the level of their encoding RNAs (Figure S9B), suggesting that HK2 might be regulated in a similar way as ribosomal proteins and proteins in ETC and OXPHOS. How these proteins including HK2 are post-transcriptionally regulated is for future investigation. This analysis (Figure S9) is now included in the manuscript in the last section of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The mechanism for the loss of insulin regulation of lipolysis in the HK Mice is interesting. I was not particularly convinced by the glycerol data as measures of plasma glycerol are not particularly informative as it probably has a very high flux. So as a minimum I think this part needs expansion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Since the mechanism of how loss of HK2 causes increased glycerol release is beyond the scope of this study and is not part of our main conclusions, we removed the glycerol data from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. In your AHA experiments which are very nice it would be valuable if you could show some 'control' proteins that do not behave like HK2.</p></disp-quote><p>We had CALX as a control protein in the submitted manuscript. It is still included, now in Figure 7B. Furthermore, in response to this request, we now include all mass spec quantified proteins in the AHA experiment together with RNA seq data as Supplemental Table S3. These data can be informative for the scientific community to further study post-transcriptionally controlled proteins in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors show that short-term (4 weeks) high-fat diet is sufficient to cause glucose intolerance in male mice. Through a proteomic screen, they identify downregulation of HK2 in visceral fat as one of many changes in the adipose proteome in this timeframe. The authors observe that HK2 expression and HK activity is reduced in adipose tissue in human obesity. The authors propose that down-regulation of adipose HK2 is an early and critical step in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. The authors also observe that the hyperglycemic Molino Cavefish sub-species carries an inactivating mutation in HK2 and propose that this contributes to hyperglycemia in this model organism. The authors generate adipose specific HK2 knockout mice and show that this is sufficient to cause peripheral insulin resistance with reduced glucose uptake in WAT and BAT as well as hepatic insulin resistance with increased glucose production. This is a well-written manuscript conducted with sophistication and technical expertise. The comprehensive phenotyping of the adipose HK2 KO mice is a strength and the phenotypes are clear and robust. However, as detailed below, previously published data not discussed in this manuscript indicates that substantial reductions in HK2 activity in vivo are insufficient to cause systemic insulin resistance and this undermines the author's conclusion that downregulation of HK2 is the critical step in high-fat diet induced changes in adipose function.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1.

We addressed this concern by characterizing adipose-specific heterozygous HK2 knockout mice. The heterozygous KO mice are glucose intolerant, compared to controls. This information is now added to the manuscript (Figure S5).</p><p>Indeed, a previous study demonstrated that global heterozygous <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout mice have normal, even better, glucose tolerance compared to controls [PMID: 10428828]. How can we explain this apparent discrepancy? We note that adipose-specific GLUT4 knockout mice display glucose intolerance [PMID: 11217863], but global GLUT4 knockout mice are glucose tolerant due to a compensatory increase in glucose uptake in liver [PMID: 7675081, 15793230]. We observed increased systemic glycolysis in AdHk2KO mice (see Figure S4N). Global ablation of HK2 mice may provoke an even stronger compensatory response to maintain systemic glucose homeostasis. This may also explain the observation that global heterozygous <italic>Hk2</italic> knockout mice display better glucose handling than wild-type controls [PMID: 10428828].

The authors note that multiple species of cavefish are hyperglycemic and identify a variant in Molino cavefish in the HK2 gene (Figure 2) with reduced activity in vitro. As the authors note, independently evolved Cavefish have repeatedly developed distinct mutations in genes regulating diverse aspects of metabolism and fuel homeostasis including mutations in the insulin receptor and MC4R to survive their nutrient depleted environment. The authors suggest that the HK2 mutation may mediate the hyperglycemia in the Molino sub-species. While the hypothesis is interesting and testable, no experiments are performed in this manuscript that tests the role of HK2 mutant in the glycemic phenotype. As presented, the presence of the HK2 mutation in hyperglycemic fish is entirely correlative and does not provide strong support for the conclusion that HK2 plays a causal role in hyperglycemia.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We do not claim that the HK2 variant is the driver for hyperglycemia in Molino cavefish. We are currently breeding surface and Molino cavefish to perform a quantitative trait (QTL) analysis. However, Mexican tetra become sexually mature and can be mated after 8 months but ideally at more than 1 year old, and Molino cavefish are especially difficult to produce (PMID: 30638199). Taking these challenges into account, we need a minimum of 2-3 years of investigations to complete the QTL analysis. In the current manuscript, we only conclude that the HK2 variant (R42H) found in Molino is a loss-of-function mutation based on our enzyme assay (Figures 2F-2G) and add that it is supporting orthogonal evidence that HK2 loss affects glucose homeostasis. Also, it is a very cool result.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Pg 5, line 112: &quot;Importantly, hexokinase activity inversely correlated with insulin resistance in obese non-diabetic patients (Figure 1F).&quot; The data shows that mean HK activity is ~ 30% lower in people with high HOMA-IR compared to low HOMA-IR.

Adipose HK2 KO increases endogenous glucose production and appears to increase hepatic ChREBP activity along with ChREBP targets. Is this increase in ChREBP activity due to increased liver glucose uptake as a result of impaired WAT/BAT glucose uptake – i.e. shunting of glucose to the liver? Activation of ChREBP in the liver has been shown to regulate G6Pc expression and drive glucose production (PMID: 27669460). Could this be an alternative explanation for the increased glucose production in adipose HK2 KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention.

Further, the improvement in glucose tolerance is very small in the hetKO, which brings into question whether the smaller decrease in HK2 in obesity does actually have a significant contribution to glucose tolerance. No ITT is provided for the hetKO either.

The study extends previous reports that genetic disruptions of glucose metabolism in adipose (WAT and BAT) affect whole-body glucose homeostasis. Prior studies include KO of GLUT4, RAB10, and ChREBP. Of note, KO of RAB10 in brown fat (UCP1 CRE) also induces whole-body glucose dysregulation. The RAB10 KO studies (PMID: 34303022, PMID: 27207531) should be included in the discussion because RAB10 KO causes an approximate 50% reduction in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake yet still has a large whole-body metabolic impact, in line with the argument the authors make about obesity/HFD causing a partial reduction in HK2 that has large whole body effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

There are a couple of instances in which the description of the data does not completely jive with the data presented. For example, on page 3, they state &quot;Consistent with reduced HK2 expression, hexokinase activity, and downstream glycolytic metabolites were decreased in.…&quot;. However, the data in Figure 1d do not support a change in glycolic metabolites. Only 2PG is reduced. Strikingly, there is no reduction in G6P, the product of HK2, and perhaps the metabolite most likely to be changed. Just looking at the data, one would conclude that HFD has little effect on glycolic metabolites. I realize there are potential issues with steady-state versus flux measurements but it doesn't seem appropriate to conclude a change in glycolytic intermediates because that is what is expected if the data do not support the conclusion. If the method is not appropriate to measure a difference, then the steady-state data should be removed from the manuscript or flux performed.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we removed the data of Figure 1D and modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, I am not sure how to interpret the data in Figure 1G, H, and I. The data in H show a statistically significant difference between &quot;high&quot; and &quot;low&quot; HOMO-IR groups in HK activity, although the effect size is very small. The text refers to severe and mild insulin resistance (HOMO-IR) groupings. What is the homo-IR cutoff for this distinction? Is this accepted or is it based on the structure of this data (e.g., quartiles)? What do the data for HK activity look like for the obese diabetic group (from panel G)?

I think the 3T3-L1 experiments are of limited value and could be removed without impacting the conclusions of the work.

Incurring in the analysis of heterozygotic adipocyte HK2 mice addressed major points brought in during that first review. There is an important point that however requires consideration.</p><p>This reviewer would only like to raise the following points that could be attended to with appropriate discussion in the text:</p><p>1. The findings presented do not support that there is a defect in glucose transport in adipocytes. There is a reduction in glucose deposition in adipose tissue during a hyperinsulinemic clamp of adipose-specific HK2 KO mice (Figure 5) and there is lower insulin-stimulated 2-deoxyglucose deposition in insulin-stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocytes depleted of HK2. However, there is no change in glucose-6-phosphate levels in adipose tissue of 4-week HFD-fed mice (Figure 1 D) and there is also no difference in the basal 2-deoxyglucose deposition in the HK2-depleted 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Figure 3E). Since 2-deoxyglucose deposition depends on hexokinase activity, it is not clear why the reduction was only seen in response to insulin. These findings deserve some comment, and the end of the 2nd paragraph of page 13 as well as the 1st paragraph of the Discussion could also be accordingly amended.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not argue that there is a defect in glucose ‘transport’ in HK2-depleted adipocytes. Indeed, we conclude, “loss of HK2 decreases glucose disposal in insulin-stimulated adipocytes” (Line 5 on page 6).</p><p>Regarding the observation that there is no difference in basal 2-deoxyglucose “deposition” in HK2 knockdown adipocytes compared to controls, it is well established that insulin promotes HK2 activity by promoting translocation of HK2 to mitochondria where HK2 uses ATP exiting mitochondria to phosphorylate glucose (PMID: 18064042, 11390360). Thus, in the absence of insulin, HK2 is inactive in control adipocytes, and we do not expect to see the deference in basal 2-deoxyglucose disposal in HK2 knockdown adipocytes. To clarify this point, we modified the text as follows on pages 6:</p><p>“Furthermore, although basal glucose accumulation did not differ, insulin-stimulated glucose accumulation was 50% lower in HK2-knockdown adipocytes (Figure 3E), despite normal insulin signaling (Figure 3A). The observation that HK2-knockdown has not effect on basal glucose accumulation is due to the fact that HK2 is inactive in the absence of insulin (Gottlob et al., 2001; Miyamoto, Murphy, and Brown, 2008). Thus, loss of HK2 decreases glucose disposal in insulin-stimulated adipocytes in vitro.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The above findings also mean that the model in figure 8 must be modified (it currently shows less glucose transport into adipocytes). The model should also include the other two possibilities for crosstalk with the liver mentioned on page 12 (3rd paragraph of Discussion).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 8 reflects less glucose disposal, not less glucose transport. To increase clarity, we modified the figure legend. It now reads:</p><p>“B. Diet-induced loss of adipose HK2 triggers glucose intolerance via reduced glucose disposal in adipocytes (left) and de-repressed hepatic gluconeogenesis despite maintained lipogenesis (right).” We refrain from including the other two possible models (the control of hepatic glucose production by neuronal inputs or increased glucose uptake in the liver) in Figure 8 since we did not test them in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
