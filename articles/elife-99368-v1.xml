Dopamine acts through multiple receptors and controls an intricate signaling network to regulate different tasks. While the diverse functions of dopamine are intensely studied, the interplay and role of the distinct dopamine receptors to regulate different processes is less well understood. An interesting candidate is the dopamine receptor Dop1R2 (also known as Damb), as it could connect to different downstream pathways. Dop1R2 is reported to be involved in forgetting and memory maintenance; however, the circuits requiring the receptors are unknown. To study Dop1R2 and its role in specific spatial and temporal contexts, we generated a conditional knockout line using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique. Two FRT sites were inserted, allowing flippase-mediated excision of the dopamine receptor in neurons of interest. To study the function of Dop1R2, we knocked it out conditionally in the mushroom body of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, a well-studied brain region for memory formation. We show that Dop1R2 is required for later memory forms but not for short-term aversive or appetitive memories. Moreover, Dop1R2 is specifically required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe but not in the γ-lobe of the mushroom body. Our findings show a spatially and temporally restricted role of Dop1R2 in the process of memory formation, highlighting the differential requirement of receptors during distinct phases of learning.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>learning</kwd><kwd>DopR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004784</institution-id><institution>Novartis Stiftung für Medizinisch-Biologische Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#23B138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_219348</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IZKSZ3_218514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The dopamine receptor Dop1R2 plays a crucial role in the formation of longer-lasting memories, while it is dispensable for short-term memories.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neuromodulator dopamine is involved in a plethora of brain functions. Among them are learning and memory, reinforcement signaling, reward, arousal, and motor functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Perturbations in the dopaminergic system are associated with diseases like Parkinson’s disease, addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and many more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand dopamine signaling in greater detail, allowing us to develop more effective therapeutics or preventive measures.</p><p>Dopamine is synthesized from tyrosine in dopaminergic neurons (DANs) and binds to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto and Seto, 2014</xref>). These dopamine receptors have seven transmembrane domains, with an intracellular C-terminus and an extracellular N-terminus. The receptors interact with different G-proteins, which are heterotrimeric protein complexes consisting of an α-, β-, and γ-subunit. The G-protein complex binds to the third intracellular loop and the C-terminus of the receptors. Humans and other mammals express five different dopamine receptors, separated into two types. Type 1 dopamine receptors elevate protein kinase A (PKA) signaling and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels via the α-subunit Gα<sub>s</sub>, whereas type 2 receptors inhibit PKA activity via Gα<sub>i/o</sub>, thus reducing cAMP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). Downstream of cAMP and PKA, transcriptional activation mediated by cAMP response element-binding protein leads to the expression of immediate early genes as a response to dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlezonjr et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neves et al., 2002</xref>). This pathway is a key regulator of long-term memory (LTM) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberini and Kandel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaldun and Sprecher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kandel, 2012</xref>). Moreover, dopamine receptors can modulate internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by engaging the phospholipase C signaling pathway. Furthermore, the G-protein β- and γ-subunits can directly modulate voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ledonne and Mercuri, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nishi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>). However, the coordination of the receptors and the different dopamine-mediated processes in specific circuits remains unexplored. Therefore, an accessible and well-characterized model is required, like the olfactory circuit of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. The connectome of this circuit is known and can be manipulated with the sophisticated genetic tools of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to mammals, the fly uses dopamine in learning, memory, forgetting, negative and positive reinforcement, locomotion, and sleep and arousal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sabandal et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sabandal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siju et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tomita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Waddell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto and Seto, 2014</xref>). Additionally, L-DOPA, the precursor for dopamine and a powerful receptor agonist, as well as other pharmaceutics, has been shown to function in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamamoto and Seto, 2014</xref>). Thus, the dopaminergic system can be studied in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, taking advantage of the available genetic tools.</p><p>The fly uses four different dopamine receptors. Dop1R1 (Dumb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sugamori et al., 1995</xref>) and Dop1R2 (Damb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feng et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 1996</xref>) are type 1 receptors. Dop2R is a type 2 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hearn et al., 2002</xref>), and DopEcR is a type 1 dopamine receptor that also uses ecdysone as a ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Srivastava et al., 2005</xref>). All four receptors were shown to be involved in learning, memory, and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karam et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lark et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Qi and Lee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scholz-Kornehl and Schwärzel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). While it is well established that Dop1R1 is crucial for learning and short-term memory (STM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Qin et al., 2012</xref>), the role of the other receptors is less clear. Dop1R2 is an interesting candidate to study, due to its ability to couple to two different G-proteins, Gα<sub>s</sub>, which engages the cAMP pathway, and Gα<sub>q</sub>, which is involved in Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). This could allow Dop1R2 to modulate learning and memory in a complex fashion. The receptor is mainly expressed in the mushroom body (MB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lark et al., 2017</xref>), an important brain region for olfactory associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cognigni et al., 2018</xref>). Previous single-cell transcriptomics data show that Dop1R2 is sparsely found in the whole nervous system (in 7.99% of ventral nerve cord cells, and in 13.8% of cells outside the MB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davie et al., 2018</xref>). Work on a mutant line suggests that Dop1R2 is involved in forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). However, a study using RNAi silencing suggests that the receptor plays a role in memory maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). As these studies used different learning assays – aversive and appetitive, respectively, as well as different methods, it is unclear if Dop1R2 has different functions for the different reinforcement stimuli. To resolve this problem, we generated a transgenic line to conditionally knock out Dop1R2 in a spatially and temporally specific manner. Using CRISPR-Cas9 and homology-directed repair (HDR), we included FRT sites in the endogenous locus of Dop1R2 for flippase-mediated excision. In addition, we inserted an HA-tag to monitor the spatial localization of the receptor. This also allows us to visualize the efficiency of the flip-out. We used this line to study the role of the receptor in learning and memory in the MB for both aversive and appetitive conditioning. Upon flip-out of the receptor in the MB, 2 hr memory and LTM are impaired. Similar results are obtained when we flip out Dop1R2 specifically in the α/β-lobes and α’/β’-lobes of the MB, which are involved in those memory phases. Therefore, Dop1R2 is required in the α/β-lobes and α’/β’-lobes for later memory forms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of the Dop1R2 conditional knockout line</title><p>To be able to study both the requirement of Dop1R2 in specific neurons, as well as the localization of the receptor, we generated a transgenic line that allows defined spatial and temporal knockout of the receptor. In short, we inserted two FRT sites for flippase-mediated excision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Golic and Lindquist, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gratz et al., 2014</xref>), as well as a 3xHA-tag to study the localization of the receptor. The HA-tag was chosen to minimize interference with the receptor structure. A representation of the HA-tagged receptor is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. The third intracellular loop between transmembrane domains (TMDs) five and six, as well as the C-terminal tail, is required for G-protein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Missale et al., 1998</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> gives an overview of the experimental strategy. The endogenous locus is cut twice by CRISPR-Cas9 to replace the first two coding exons of Dop1R2 with the corresponding sequence flanked by FRT sites and fused to the HA-tag, using a donor plasmid as template for HDR. The donor plasmid also contains the region directly upstream and downstream of the exchange site as homology arms to align the plasmid. The plasmid carrying the sequence for the two guide RNAs (gRNAs), as well as the donor plasmid, was injected into embryos with maternal Cas9 expression (nos&gt;Cas9). Using the Gal4-UAS system to express flippase in neurons of interest, the receptor can be irreversibly flipped out in those neurons while keeping it functional in the rest of the brain. The first FRT site was placed in the intron before the first coding exon, which contains all seven TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since Dop1R2 has three transcript isoforms with differences in the C-terminus, the second FRT site was placed at the end of the last common exon. Thus, FLP-mediated recombination will lead to the deletion of the two common coding exons, including all TMDs. Successful insertion was verified by sequencing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of a conditional knockout allele for Dop1R2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the receptor structure and interaction with the G-protein complex.

In short, a group of flies is presented with an odor coupled to an electric shock (aversive) or sugar (appetitive) followed by a second odor without stimulus. For assessing their memory, flies can freely choose between the odors either directly after training (STM) or at a later time point.</p><p>To ensure that the introduced genetic changes to the Dop1R2 locus do not interfere with behavior, we first checked the sensory responses of that line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). The Dop1R2<sup>cko</sup> line shows comparable odor responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>) as well as sugar and shock response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>) to the control line.

Moreover, appetitive STM is also comparable to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, unsurprisingly, the introduced changes to Dop1R2 do not interfere with normal receptor function.</p><p>To test the requirement of Dop1R2 for STM, we assessed memory performance directly after training for flies with flipped-out Dop1R2 in the whole MB or in individual lobes, along with the parental controls. The flies were aged for a week before undergoing classical olfactory conditioning. Both aversive STM and appetitive STM were tested. But first, we ensured that the whole MB flip-out line responds normally to the used odors and stimuli.

Given that the half-life of the receptor remains unknown, we assessed both aversive STM and LTM to determine whether post-eclosion ablation of Dop1R2 in the MB produced differences compared to our previously tested line, in which Dop1R2 was constitutively knocked out from fertilization. To achieve this, flies were maintained at 18°C until eclosion and subsequently shifted to 30°C for 5–7 days. On the fifth day, training was conducted, followed by memory testing. Our results indicate that aversive STM was not significantly impaired in Dop1R2-deficient MBs compared to control flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

To achieve this, FRT sites were inserted in front of the start codon and in the C-terminus of Dop1R2 using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated HDR. In addition, an HA-tag was inserted to be able to visualize the dopamine receptor expression, as well as verify successful flip out. Using an anti-HA-tag antibody, we were able to visualize Dop1R2 in the MB of the generated line. This matches previous reports for the expression of Dop1R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Han et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, upon knocking out Dop1R2 with an MB-specific driver, the HA-tag labeling disappears, indicating that the conditional knockout system works. The HA-tag could also be useful to study the subcellular localization of Dop1R2 within the MB lobes, e.g., if it is close to synapses of DANs.</p><p>To get a better overview of Dop1R2’s role in the MB, we analyzed appetitive memory at different time points after training in the individual MB lobes. Loss of Dop1R2 in the whole MB, as well as the α/β-lobe or the α’/β’-lobe, impairs 24 hr reward memory. This observation matches previous studies. Using Dop1R2-RNAi in the MB, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sun et al., 2020</xref>, showed that STM is intact, while LTM is impaired. When knocking down the Raf/MAPK pathway, they get a similar phenotype. Moreover, expression of a constitutively active Raf allele rescues the Dop1R2-dependent LTM deficit, and Dop1R2 seems to be required for the phosphorylation of the MAPK. Therefore, Dop1R2-dependent activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway is required for stabilization of reward LTM memory. Another study shows that reward LTM requires food with a high energetic value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musso et al., 2015</xref>). This signal seems to be relayed by the DAN MB-MP1 (PPL1-γ1pedc), which showed temporally restricted oscillating activity early post-training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Musso et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of Dop1R2 using RNAi impaired reward LTM while leaving STM intact. Therefore, dopaminergic signaling through MB-MP-1 and Dop1R2 could indicate the energetic value of the reward and decide if LTM should be formed or not. Interestingly, the MB-MP1 DAN arborizes in the spur of the γ-lobe, as well as the inner core of the pedunculus, which consists of the axons of the α/β Kenyon cells (KCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>), which according to our results require Dop1R2 for reward LTM. Loss of Dop1R2 in the MB output neuron MVP2 (MBON-γ1pedc&gt;α/β) also impaired reward LTM while leaving STM intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>). This GABAergic MVP2 MBON forms a feedback circuit with the MB-MP1 DAN. After training, the oscillatory activity of MB-MP1 is enhanced, while MVP2 is inhibited. After 30 min, MVP2 gets activated, and MB-MP1 is inhibited. Moreover, Dop1R2 seems to be required for modulating this feedback loop.</p><p>The MBONs are an important contributor to memory. Moreover, MBONs receive dopaminergic input and seem to express dopamine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We showed that Dop1R2 is required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe for reward LTM formation. Interestingly, MBONs, which are involved in reward LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Plaçais et al., 2013</xref>), have arborization in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe. Thus, Dop1R2 could modulate these connections as well.</p><p>In all, Dop1R2 is required for reward LTM formation, and loss of the receptor impairs LTM. Dop1R2 seems to influence reward LTM in different ways. First, by acting on the Raf-MAPK pathway to stabilize memory; second, by relaying the energetic content of the reward; and third, by modulating the MB-MP1-MVP2 loop.</p><p>For aversive conditioning, we observe that loss of Dop1R2 in the MB leads to impaired 2 hr memory and LTM, whereas STM is intact. Moreover, Dop1R2 seems to be required in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe. A previous study using a mutant for Dop1R2, which also affects the neighboring gene GC1907, observed higher memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). Further, lack of Dop1R2 impairs reversal learning. It is proposed that Dop1R2 acts on the RAC-forgetting pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shuai et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, Dop1R2 can act on two different downstream second messenger systems by using two different G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). By coupling to G<sub>αs</sub>, the cAMP pathway is activated. By coupling to G<sub>αq</sub>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> messenger system is activated. Furthermore, knocking down G<sub>αq</sub> pan-neuronally or in the MB leads to memory enhancement 3 hr after training, but not 6 hr after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, Dop1R2 could regulate the RAC forgetting pathway through G<sub>αq</sub>.</p><p>Some RNA-binding proteins and immediate early genes help maintain identities of MB cells and are regulators of local transcription and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Queiroz et al., 2025</xref>). So, the availability of different G-proteins may change in different lobes and during different phases of memory. The G-protein via which GPCRs signal may depend on the pool of available G-proteins in the cell/subcellular region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermans, 2003</xref>). Therefore, Dop1R2 may signal via different G-proteins in different compartments of the MB and also different compartments of the neuron. We looked at G<sub>αo</sub> and G<sub>αq</sub> as they are known to have roles in learning and forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ferris et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>). We found that Dop1R2 co-expresses more frequently with G<sub>αo</sub> than with G<sub>αq</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While there is evidence for Dop1R2 to act via G<sub>αq</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Himmelreich et al., 2017</xref>), it is difficult to determine whether this interaction is exclusive or if Dop1R2 can also be coupled to other G-proteins. It will be interesting to determine the breadth of G-proteins that are involved in Dop1R2 signaling.</p><p>Berry and colleagues also observed that blocking the output of DANs inhibits forgetting, while activating DANs accelerates forgetting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>). This modulation seems to require ongoing activity of the MP1 DAN together with further DANs. Interestingly, using a spaced training protocol and a Dop1R2 RNAi knockdown, another study showed impaired LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, after spaced training, flies have a higher energy uptake, and the energy metabolism is upregulated in the MB. This increase in energy consumption is mediated by dopaminergic signaling from the MB-MP1 DAN. Loss of Dop1R2 in the MB abolishes the increase in energy consumption. Therefore, Dop1R2 seems to be important for aversive LTM formation by regulating energy consumption. Thus, like for reward LTM formation, aversive LTM seems to require sufficient energy. Starved flies reduce the formation of aversive LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Plaçais and Preat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). This information seems to be relayed through ongoing oscillation of MB-MP1 and Dop1R2 after training. In addition, the MVP2 MBON might also be involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ueoka et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the gating mechanism in both aversive and reward LTM formation seems to require Dop1R2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pavlowsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition, the MAPK signaling pathway might also be required in aversive LTM formation by activating transcription factors like CREB and c-fos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyashita et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Both Dop1R2 and the ongoing activity of MB-MP1 seem to have multiple roles directly after training in a short time window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plaçais et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Plaçais et al., 2012</xref>). The circuit acts like a gating mechanism for LTM to ensure that there is enough energy for continuing LTM formation. The MBON MVP2 acts as a feedback loop to regulate the activity of the DAN. Moreover, both the RAC and the Raf/MAPK signaling pathway seem to be engaged to either forget or stabilize the memory. In aversive memory formation, loss of Dop1R2 could lead to enhanced or impaired memory, depending on the activated signaling pathways. The signaling pathway that is activated further depends on the available pool of secondary messengers in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermans, 2003</xref>), which may be regulated by the internal state of the animal.</p><p>However, it remains unclear how all of these aspects are integrated and if there is a hierarchical order.</p><p>DANs can produce aversive and appetitive associations depending on the temporal presentation of odor cue and reinforcement stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, dopaminergic signaling can modify the KC-MBON synapses bidirectionally. The Dop1R1-G<sub>αs</sub>-cAMP pathway seems to detect the temporal coincidence of the stimuli, whereas the Dop1R2-G<sub>αq</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup> pathway detects the temporal ordering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). Dop1R2 mutant flies seem to be able to form an odor association but are not able to update it. Further, Dop1R2 is required for the potentiation of the KC-MBON synapse following backward pairing.</p><p>Taken together, Dop1R2 has multiple roles during memory formation and integrates different signals, including the detection of the order of stimuli, the internal state, like energy levels and forgetting and maintenance signals.</p><p>The receptor does not seem to be required for STM but for later time points. Previous studies looking at the temporal requirement of the lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>) defined the γ-lobe to be responsible for memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heisenberg et al., 2000</xref>). The α/β-lobe and its output are involved in LTM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akalal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Trannoy et al., 2011</xref>). The function of the α’/β’-lobe seems to be LTM consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). However, both lobes also seem to have a role in middle-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouzaiane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheunemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shyu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Turrel et al., 2022</xref>). As the loss of Dop1R2 in the γ-lobe or the whole MB does not impair STM, we conclude that the receptor is not required for this memory type. However, Dop1R2 is expressed in the γ-lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crocker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Croset et al., 2018</xref>), so it might be required for other types of behaviors.</p><p>The impairment of reward LTM upon knockout of Dop1R2 in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe matches the described role of these neurons. So, both the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe require Dop1R2 for LTM. Interestingly, both lobes also seem to require Dop1R2 for 2 hr memories. As the MB-MP1 DAN is active in this time window as well, this would suggest that Dop1R2 function at this time point is important for correct LTM formation.</p><p>This would indicate that Dop1R1 is the main contributor to STM while Dop1R2 is responsible for later memory stages. It would be interesting to know how the switch from Dop1R1 dependency to Dop1R2 occurs.</p><p>As Dop1R2 is required in the MBON MVP2 for reward LTM, it would be exciting to see if it is also required in other MBONs or neurons outside the MB. Besides learning and memory, the MB also uses dopamine to regulate sleep. This tool offers the opportunity to study both aspects in neurons of interest.</p><p>The genetic tool we generated here to study the role of the Dop1R2 dopamine receptor in cells of interest is not only a good substitute for RNAi knockouts, which are known to be less efficient in insects and in many instances may cause a partial, hypomorphic phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joga et al., 2016</xref>), but also provides versatile possibilities as it can be used in combination with the powerful genetic tools of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>Using this line, we could show that Dop1R2 is specifically required for later memory stages of both aversive and appetitive memory in the α/β-lobe and the α’/β’-lobe.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Primers and guide RNAs (gRNAs) for generating Dop1R2 conditional knockout lines.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top"/><th align="left" valign="top">Primer name</th><th align="left" valign="top">Sequence</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" colspan="3">Dop1R2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="6">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_5’_fw_SpeI</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCTGCAGACTAGTCAGCCACCACA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_5’_re_SmaI</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGAACCCGGGGATAAACTTTACCATAATGC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_fragment_fw_AgeI</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GTTCGACCGGTGATTGCATTGTGTTCACCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_fragment_re_BstEII</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGGCTTGGTAACCACGACGAATCTTGCGTGGACAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_3’_fw_XhoI</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATTCTCGAGAAGTATCAACCCACGATGCGTTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_3’_re_Acc65I</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGCAACGGTACCAGATGCAGATACCG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="2">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_gRNA_5’</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ACGAACTTAAGATAAAGTGTCGG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_gRNA_3’</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCATCGTGGGCTGGTACTTCCGG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="middle" rowspan="6">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_Screening_for</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TATCCCTATGACGTCCCGGAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_Screening_re</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GACAGGTTGAGTGATGCGCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_5’FRT_for</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGCTACACATCATTTTATGCCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_5’FRT_re</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GTTCCTGTGCCTGATTCTGTTC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_3’FRT_for</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCCTAACTGGCTTCTCTTCC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Dop1R2_3’FRT_re</td><td align="left" valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">AGCGCTTAATTCACGAAAGC</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> both male and female</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">y[1] w[*] P{y[+t7.7]=nos-phiC31\int.NLS}X;

Afterward, the flies in each arm were counted, and a preference index was calculated.</p><p>For testing the odor response, the flies could choose between one of the odors in the same concentration as used for the behavior experiment and the same amount of paraffin oil for 120 s.</p><p>Preference index PI = ((N<sub>air</sub> – N<sub>odor</sub>)100)/N<sub>total</sub>.</p><p>For shock response, the flies could freely choose for 60 s between a copper-grid lined tube getting pulses of 100 V or a copper-grid lined tube getting no electric shock. Preference index PI = ((N<sub>No shock</sub>–N<sub>shock</sub>)100)/N<sub>total</sub>.</p><p>For testing sugar sensitivity, a group of flies was starved for 1–21 hr in a tube with damp cotton on the bottom. They could choose for 120 s between a tube lined with filter paper that was soaked in 1.5 M sucrose solution the day before or a tube lined with filter paper that was soaked in distilled water the day before. Preference index PI = ((N<sub>sucrose</sub> − N<sub>water</sub>)100)/N<sub>total</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To compare performance indices between different groups, we used one-way ANOVA (analysis of variance) with post hoc Tukey’s HSD (honestly significant difference) test calculator for comparing multiple treatments in R with the package multcomp.

The metadata containing the annotations was also downloaded and used to annotate the clusters. The clustering and further transcriptomic analyses were performed using the Seurat (version 5.2.1) package for R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hao et al., 2024</xref>). The clustering was done at 0.5 Seurat resolution. And the UMAP was computed using the top 10 principal components. The LogNormalize method from Seurat was used to calculate log-normalized gene expression values.

Dop1R2 is a type 1 Dopamine receptor that can act both through Gs-cAMP and Gq-ERCa2+ pathways. The authors first developed a sophisticated tool where tissue-specific knock-out mutants can be generated using Crispr/Cas9 technology in combination with the Gal4/UAS gene-expression toolkit.They direct the K.O. mutation to intrinsic neurons of the main associative memory centre fly brain: the mushroom body (MB). There are three main types of MB-neurons, or Kenyon cells, according to their axonal projections: a/b; a'/b' and g neurons.</p><p>Kaldun et al. found that, while not required for short-term memory, dop1R2 is necessary in a/b and a'/b' but not in gamma neurons to display normal appetitive and aversive middle-term (2h) and long-term (24h) memory. These results showcase a compartmentalized role of Dop1R2 in specific neuronal subtypes of the main memory centre of the fly brain for the expression of middle and long-term memories.</p><p>The conclusions of this paper are very well supported by the data, and the authors systematically addressed the requirement of a very interesting type of dopamine receptor in both appetitive and aversive memories. These findings are important for the fields of learning and memory and dopaminergic neuromodulation, among others.</p><p>Importantly, the authors of this paper produced a tool to generate tissue-specific knock out mutants of dop1R2. Although reports on the requirement of this gene in different memory phases exist, the genetic tools used here represent the most sophisticated approach to induce a loss of function phenotypes in neurons of interest.</p><p>Overall, the authors generated a very useful tool to study dopamine neuromodulation in any given circuit when used in combination with the powerful genetic toolkit available in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The reports on this paper confirmed a previously described role of Dop1R2 in the expression of aversive and appetitive LTM providing spatio-temporal resolution and additionally, they mapped these effects to two types of memory neurons in the fly brain, shedding light into the intricate modulation of dopamine in memory circuits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99368.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaldun</surname><given-names>Jenifer C</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/022fs9h90</institution-id><institution>University of Fribourg</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Calia</surname><given-names>Emanuele</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bangalore Mukunda</surname><given-names>Ganesh Chinmai</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/022fs9h90</institution-id><institution>University of Fribourg</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fritsch</surname><given-names>Cornelia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Komarov</surname><given-names>Nikita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/022fs9h90</institution-id><institution>University of Fribourg</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Fribourg</named-content></addr-line><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic tool for the dopamine receptor dop1R2.

This receptor has complex roles in supporting different stages of memory, and the neural mechanisms for these functions are poorly understood. The authors are able to localize Dop1R2 function to the vertical lobes of the mushroom body, revealing a role in later (presumably middle-term) aversive and appetitive memory. In general, the experimental design is rigorous, and statistics are appropriately applied. While the manuscript provides a useful tool, it would be strengthened further by additional mechanistic studies that build on the rich literature examining the roles of dopamine signaling in memory formation. The claim that Dop1R2 is involved in memory formation is strongly supported by the data presented, and this manuscript adds to a growing literature revealing that dopamine is a critical regulator of olfactory memory. However, the manuscript does not necessarily extend much beyond our understanding of Dop1R2 in memory formation, and future work will be needed to fully characterize this reagent and define the role of Dop1R2 in memory.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The FRT lines generated provide a novel tool for temporal and spatially precise manipulation of Dop1R2 function. This tool will be valuable to study the role of Dop1R2 in memory and other behaviors potentially regulated by this gene.</p><p>(2) Given the highly conserved role of Dop1R2 in memory and other processes, these findings have a high potential to translate to vertebrate species.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The authors state Dop1R2 associates with two different G-proteins. It would be useful to know which one is mediating the loss of aversive and appetitive memory in Dop1R2 knockout flies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for the insightful comment. We agree that it would be very useful to know which G-proteins are transmitting Dop1R2 signaling. To that extent, we examined single-cell transcriptomics data to check the level of co-expression of Dop1R2 with G-proteins that are of interest to us. (Figure 1 S1)</p><p>Lines 312-325</p><p>“Some RNA binding proteins and Immediate early genes help maintain identities of Mushroom body cells and are regulators of local transcription and translation (de Queiroz et al., 2025; Raun et al., 2025). So, the availability of different G-proteins may change in different lobes and during different phases of memory. The G-protein via which GPCRs signal, may depend on the pool of available G-proteins in the cell/sub-cellular region (Hermans, 2003)., Therefore, Dop1R2 may signal via different G-proteins in different compartments of the Mushroom body and also different compartments of the neuron. We looked at Gα<sub>o</sub> and Gα<sub>q</sub> as they are known to have roles in learning and forgetting (Ferris et al., 2006; Himmelreich et al., 2017). We found that Dop1R2 co-expresses more frequently with Gα<sub>o</sub> than with Gα<sub>q</sub> (Figure 1 S1). While there is evidence for Dop1R2 to act via Gα<sub>q</sub> (Himmelreich et al., 2017). It is difficult to determine whether this interaction is exclusive, or if Dop1R2 can also be coupled to other G-proteins. It will be interesting to determine the breadth of G-proteins that are involved in Dop1R2 signaling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be interesting to examine 24hr aversive memory, in addition to 24hr appetitive memory.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an important point and we agree that it will complete the assessment of temporally distinct memory traces. We therefore performed the Aversive LTM experiments and include them in the results.</p><p>Lines 208-228</p><p>“24h memory is impaired by loss of Dop1R2</p><p>Next, we wanted to see if later memory forms are also affected. One cycle of reward training is sufficient to create LTM (Krashes &amp; Waddell, 2008), while for aversive memory, 5-6 cycles of electroshock-trainings are required to obtain robust long-term memory scores (Tully et al., 1994). So, we looked at both, 24h aversive and appetitive memory. For aversive LTM, the flies were tested on the Y-Maze apparatus as described in (Mohandasan et al., 2022).</p><p>Flipping out Dop1R2 in the whole MB causes a reduced 24h memory performance (Figure 4A, E). No phenotype was observed when Ddop1R2 was flipped out in the γ-lobe (Figure 4B, F). However, similar to 2h memory, loss of Ddop1R2 in the α/β-lobes (Figure 4C, G) or the α’/β’-lobes (Figure 4D, H) causes a reduction in memory performance. Thus, Dop1R2 seems to be involved in aversive and appetitive LTM in the α/β-lobes and the α’/β’-lobes.</p><p>Previous studies have shown mutation in the Dop1R2 receptor leads to improvement in LTM when a single shock training paradigm is used (Berry et al., 2012). As we found that it disrupts LTM, we wanted to verify if the absence of Dop1R2 outside the MB is what leads to an improvement in memory. To that extent, we tested panneuronal flip-out of Dop1R2 flies for 6hr and 24hr memory upon single shock using the elav-Gal4 driver. We found that it did not improve memory at both time points (Figure 4 S1). Confirming that flipping out Dop1R2 panneuronally does not improve LTM (Figure 4 S1C) and highlighting its irrelevance in memory outside the MB.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The manuscript would be strengthened by added functional analysis. What are the DANs that signal through Dop1R. How do these knockouts impact MBONs?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this question. We indeed agree that it is a highly relevand and open question, how distinct DANs signal via distinct Dopamine receptors. Our work here uniquely focusses on Dop1R2 within the MB. We aim to investigate other DopRs and the connection between DANs in the future using similar approaches.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Also in Figure 2, the lobe-specific knockouts might be moved to supplemental since there is no effect. Instead, consider moving the control sensory tests into the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this suggestion and understand that in Figure 2 no significant difference is seen. However, we have emphasized in the text that the results from the supplementary figures are just to confirm that the modifications made at the Dop1R2 locus did not alter its normal function.</p><p>Lines 156-162</p><p>“We wanted to see if flipping out Dop1R2 in the MB affects memory acquisition and STM by using classical olfactory conditioning. In short, a group of flies is presented with an odor coupled to an electric shock (aversive) or sugar (appetitive) followed by a second odor without stimulus.

Dop1R2 is a type 1 Dopamine receptor that can act both through Gs-cAMP and Gq-ERCa2+ pathways. The authors first developed a very useful tool, where tissue-specific knock-out mutants can be generated, using Crispr/Cas9 technology in combination with the powerful Gal4/UAS gene-expression toolkit, very common in fruit flies.</p><p>They direct the K.O. mutation to intrinsic neurons of the main associative memory centre fly brain-the mushroom body (MB). There are three main types of MB-neurons, or Kenyon cells, according to their axonal projections: a/b; a'/b', and g neurons.</p><p>Kaldun et al. found that flies lacking dop1R2 all over the MB displayed impaired appetitive middle-term (2h) and long-term (24h) memory, whereas appetitive short-term memory remained intact. Knocking-out dop1R2 in the three MB neuron subtypes also impaired middle-term, but not short-term, aversive memory.</p><p>These memory defects were recapitulated when the loss of the dop1R2 gene was restricted to either a/b or a'/b', but not when the loss of the gene was restricted to g neurons, showcasing a compartmentalized role of Dop1R2 in specific neuronal subtypes of the main memory centre of the fly brain for the expression of middle and long-term memories.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The conclusions of this paper are very well supported by the data, and the authors systematically addressed the requirement of a very interesting type of dopamine receptor in both appetitive and aversive memories. These findings are important for the fields of learning and memory and dopaminergic neuromodulation among others. The evidence in the literature so far was generated in different labs, each using different tools (mutants, RNAi knockdowns driven in different developmental stages...), different time points (short, middle, and long-term memory), different types of memories (Anesthesia resistant, which is a type of protein synthesis independent consolidated memory; anesthesia sensitive, which is a type of protein synthesis-dependent consolidated memory; aversive memory; appetitive memory...) and different behavioral paradigms. A study like this one allows for direct comparison of the results, and generalized observations.</p><p>(2) Additionally, Kaldun and collaborators addressed the requirement of different types of Kenyon cells, that have been classically involved in different memory stages: g KCs for memory acquisition and a/b or a'/b' for later memory phases. This systematical approach has not been performed before.</p><p>(3) Importantly, the authors of this paper produced a tool to generate tissue-specific knock-out mutants of dop1R2. Although this is not the first time that the requirement of this gene in different memory phases has been studied, the tools used here represent the most sophisticated genetic approach to induce a loss of function phenotypes exclusively in MB neurons.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Although the paper does have important strengths, the main weakness of this work is that the advancement in the field could be considered incremental: the main findings of the manuscript had been reported before by several groups, using tissue-specific conditional knockdowns through interference RNAi. The requirement of Dop1R2 in MB for middle-term and long-term memories has been shown both for appetitive (Musso et al 2015, Sun et al 2020) and aversive associations (Plaçais et al 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We believe that the main takeaway from the paper is the elegant tool we developed, to study the role of Dop1R2 in fruit flies by effectively flipping it out spatio-temporally. Additionally, we studied its role in all types of olfactory associative memory to establish it as a robust tool that can be used for further research in place of RNAi knockouts which are shown to be less efficient in insects as mentioned in the texts in line 394-398.</p><p>“The genetic tool we generated here to study the role of the Dop1R2 dopamine receptor in cells of interest, is not only a good substitute for RNAi knockouts, which are known to be less efficient in insects (Joga et al., 2016), but also provides versatile possibilities as it can be used in combination with the powerful genetic tools of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The approach used here to genetically modify memory neurons is not temporally restricted. Considering the role of dopamine in the correct development of the nervous system, one must consider the possible effects that this manipulation can have in the establishment of memory circuits. However, previous studies addressing this question restricted the manipulation of Dop1R2 expression to adulthood, leading to the same findings than the ones reported in this paper for both aversive and appetitive memories, which solidifies the findings of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this comment and we agree that it would be important to show a temporally restricted effect of Dop1R2 knockout. To assess this and rule out potential developmental defects we decided to restrict the knockout to the post-eclosion stage and to include these results.</p><p>Lines 230-250</p><p>“Developmental defects are ruled out in a temporally restricted Dop1R2 conditional knockout.</p><p>To exclude developmental defects in the MB caused by flip-out of Dop1R2, we stained fly brains with a FasII antibody. Compared to genetic controls, flies lacking Dop1R2 in the mushroom body had unaltered lobes (Figure 4 S2C).</p><p>Regardless, we wanted to control for developmental defects leading to memory loss in flip-out flies. So, we generated a Gal80ts-containing line, enabling the temporal control of Dop1R2 knockout in the entire mushroom body (MB). Given that the half-life of the receptor remains unknown, we assessed both aversive short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) to determine whether post-eclosion ablation of Dop1R2 in the MB produced differences compared to our previously tested line, in which Dop1R2 was constitutively knocked out from fertilization. To achieve this, flies were maintained at 18°C until eclosion and subsequently shifted to 30°C for five to seven days. On the fifth day, training was conducted, followed by memory testing. Our results indicate that aversive STM was not significantly impaired in Dop1R2-deficient MBs compared to control flies (Figure 4 S3), consistent with our previous findings (Figure 2). However, aversive LTM was significantly impaired relative to control lines (Figure 4 S3), which also aligned with prior observations. These findings strongly indicate that memory loss caused by Dop1R2 flip-out is not due to developmental defects.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors state that they aim to resolve disparities of findings in the field regarding the specific role of Dop1R2 in memory, offering a potent tool to generate mutants and addressing systematically their effects on different types of memory. Their results support the role of this receptor in the expression of long-term memories, however in the experiments performed here do not address temporal resolution of the genetic manipulations that could bring light into the mechanisms of action of Dop1R2 in memory. Several hypotheses have been proposed, from stabilization of memory, effects on forgetting, or integration of sequences of events (sensory experiences and dopamine release).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for this comment. We agree that it would be interesting to dissect the memory stages by knocking out the receptor selectively in some of them (encoding, consolidation, retrieval). However, our tool irreversibly flips out Dop1R2 preventing us from investigating the receptor’s role in retrieval. Our results show that the receptor is dispensable for STM formation (Figure 2, Figure 4 Supplement 3), suggesting that it is not involved in encoding new information. On the other hand, it is instead involved in consolidation and/or retrieval of long-term and middle-term memories (Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the authors generated a very useful tool to study dopamine neuromodulation in any given circuit when used in combination with the powerful genetic toolkit available in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The reports in this paper confirmed a previously described role of Dop1R2 in the expression of aversive and appetitive LTM and mapped these effects to two specific types of memory neurons in the fly brain, previously implicated in the expression and consolidation of long-term associative memories.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) On the first view, the results shown here are different from studies published earlier, while in the same line with others (e.g. Sun et al, for appetitive 24h memories). For example, Berry et al showed that the loss of dop1R2 impairs immediate memory, while memory scores are enhanced 3h, 6h, and 24h after training. Further, they showed data that shock avoidance, at least for higher shock intensities, is reduced in mutant (damb) flies. All in all, this favors how important it is to improve the genetic tools for tissue-specific manipulation. Despite the authors nicely discussing their data with respect to the previous studies, I wondered whether it would be suitable to use the new tool and knock out dop1R2 panneuronally to see whether the obtained data match the results published by Berry et al.. Further, as stated in line 105ff: &quot;As these studies used different learning assays - aversive and appetitive respectively as well as different methods, it is unclear if Dop1R2 has different functions for the different reinforcement stimulus&quot; I wondered why the authors tested aversive and appetitive learning for STM and 2h memory, but only appetitive memory for 24h.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. To that extent, as mentioned above in response to reviewer #2, we included in the results the aversive LTM experiment (Figure 4). Moreover, we performed experiments along the line of Berry et al. using our tool as shown in Figure 4 S1. Our results support that Dop1R2 is required for LTM, rather than to promote forgetting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 165ff: I can´t find any of the supplementary data mentioned here. Please add the corresponding figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In that line we don’t refer to any supplementary data, but to the Figure 1F, showing the absence of the HA-tag in our MB knock-out line. We have clarified this in the text (lines 151-153)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I can't imagine that the scale bar in Figure 1D-F is correct. I would also like to suggest to show a more detailed analysis of the expression pattern. For example, both anterior and posterior views would be appropriate, perhaps including the VNC. This would allow the expression pattern obtained with this novel tool to be better compared with previously published results. Also, in relation to my comment above (1), it may help to understand the functional differences with previous studies, especially as the authors themselves state that the receptor is &quot;mainly&quot; expressed in the mushroom body (line 99). It would be interesting to see where else it is expressed (if so). This would also be interesting for the panneuronal knockdown experiment suggested under (1). If the receptor is indeed expressed outside the mushroom body, this may explain the differences to Berry et al.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this, there was indeed a mistake in the scale bar which we now fixed. Since with our HA-tag immunostaining we could not detect any noticeable signal outside of the MB, we decided to analyze previously existing single cell transcriptomics data that showed expression of the receptor in 7.99% of cells in the VNC and in 13.8% of cells outside the MB (lines 98-100) confirming its sparse expression in the nervous system. The lack of detection of these cells is likely due to the sparse and low expression of the protein. The HA-tag allows to detect the endogenous level of the locus (it is possible that a Gal4/UAS amplification of the signal might allow to detect these cells).</p><p>Regarding the panneuronal knockout, we decided to try to replicate the experiment shown in Berry et al. in Figure 4 S1 and found that Dop1R2 is required for LTM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Related to learning data shown in Figures 2-4, the authors should show statistical differences between all groups obtained in the ANOVA + PostHoc tests. Currently, only an asterisk is placed above the experimental group, which does not adequately reflect the statistical differences between the groups. In addition, I would like to suggest adding statistical tests to the chance level as it may be interesting to know whether, for example, scores of knockout flies in 3C and 3D are different from the chance level.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this correction, we agree with the fact that the way significance scores were shown was not informative enough. We fixed the point by now showing significance between all the control groups and the experimental ones. We also inserted the chance level results in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Unfortunately, the manuscript has some typing errors, so I would like to ask the authors to check the manuscript again carefully.</p><p>Some Examples:</p><p>Line 31: the the</p><p>Line 56: G-Protein</p><p>Line 64: c-AMP</p><p>Line 68: Dopamine</p><p>Line 70: G-Protein (It alternates between G-protein and G-Protein)</p><p>Line 76: References are formatted incorrectly</p><p>Line 126: Ha-Tag (It alternates between Ha and HA)</p><p>Line 248: missing space before the bracket...is often found</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noticing these errors, we have now corrected the spelling throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the figures the axes are labelled Preference Index (Pref&quot;I&quot;).
