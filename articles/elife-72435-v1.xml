cortical circuits. We previously reported that the development of callosal axon projections, one of the major long-range axonal projections in the brain, is activity dependent. However, what sort of activity and when activity is indispensable are not known. Here, using a genetic method to manipulate network activity in a stage-specific manner, we demonstrated that network activity contributes to callosal axon projections in the mouse visual cortex during a ‘critical period’: restoring neuronal activity during that period resumed the projections, whereas restoration after the period failed. Furthermore, in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging revealed that the projections could be established even without fully restoring highly synchronous activity. Overall, our findings suggest that spontaneous network activity is selectively required during a critical developmental time window for the formation of long-range axonal projections in the cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebral cortex</kwd><kwd>activity dependent</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003382</institution-id><institution>Core Research for Evolutional Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tagawa</surname><given-names>Yoshiaki</given-names></name><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institute for AI and Beyond</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25221001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25117004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H01006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19H05642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ohki</surname><given-names>Kenichi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16 K06992</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tagawa</surname><given-names>Yoshiaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K06374</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tagawa</surname><given-names>Yoshiaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Neural Diversity and Neocortical Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23123508 and 25123707</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tagawa</surname><given-names>Yoshiaki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dynamic Regulation of Brain Function by Scrap &amp;

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Spitzer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>). The roles of sensory-driven and spontaneously generated neuronal activity in circuit formation are well documented in the mammalian visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wong, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huberman et al., 2008</xref>). Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), output neurons in the retinal circuit, exhibit spontaneously generated, highly correlated neuronal activity (called retinal waves) before photoreceptor cells develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galli and Maffei, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meister et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wong et al., 1993</xref>). Such activity is transmitted to the lateral geniculate nucleus and the superior colliculus, where it plays an instructive role in the formation and reorganization of neuronal connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Penn et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stellwagen and Shatz, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chandrasekaran et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>). The connectivity once formed is further sculpted by sensory-driven neuronal activity after visual inputs are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hooks and Chen, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The developing cerebral cortex also exhibits robust spontaneous network activity, ranging from highly synchronous to less correlated patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). This is partly generated intracortically and partly originates from retinal waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gribizis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2018</xref>). In rodents, a highly synchronous pattern of spontaneous neuronal activity emerges during early postnatal periods when cortical neurons still undergo maturation and circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garaschuk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Allène et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). Such activity indicates a heterogeneous traveling pattern in the developing cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garaschuk et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>). Subsequently, a more desynchronized pattern becomes dominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rochefort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Golshani et al., 2009</xref>). Based on findings in the visual system and other systems, these patterns of activity have been thought to play important roles in the development of cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Khazipov and Luhmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Winnubst et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakazawa et al., 2020</xref>). However, their role in many aspects of cortical circuit formation remains to be fully elucidated.</p><p>The callosal axon projection, a long-range axonal projection connecting the two cortical hemispheres, is essential for integrating information processed in the hemispheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hubel and Wiesel, 1967</xref>). It is important for higher cognitive functions and its alterations have been noted in patients with developmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Paul, 2011</xref>). It has been a good model for studying activity-dependent mechanisms of cortical circuit formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De León Reyes et al., 2020</xref>). Callosal axons derived from layer 2/3 callosal projection neurons in one hemisphere project to the other hemisphere through several successive stages by postnatal day 15 (P15) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagawa and Hirano, 2012</xref>). This axonal projection is activity-dependent: several groups, including ours, have previously shown that exogenous expression of Kir2.1 (an inward rectifying potassium channel), a genetic method to reduce neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johns et al., 1999</xref>), impairs callosal axon projection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Suárez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodríguez-Tornos et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, when we expressed Kir2.1 in only a small number of neurons and examined the cell-autonomous effect of activity reduction on their axonal projections, we observed that the effect was less than that when we expressed Kir2.1 in a larger number of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2010</xref>). We also found that Kir2.1 expression in a large number of neurons reduced not only the activity of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>) but also spontaneous network activity in the cortex during early postnatal periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>). As mentioned above, the pattern of spontaneous cortical network activity changes during the period when callosal axons undergo maturation. These results led us to assume that there might be a specific temporal window in which cortical network activity is indispensable for the formation of long-range axonal projections of callosal neurons.</p><p>In this report, we sought to determine what sort of activity and when activity is indispensable for callosal axon projections. To this end, we used genetic methods to reduce and restore spontaneous network activity in a stage-specific manner in the developing mouse cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Callosal axons require neuronal activity during P6-15 for their projection</title><p>In the visual cortex, callosal axons project densely to a narrowly restricted region at the border between the primary and secondary visual cortex, in which they terminate primarily in layer 2/3 and less so in layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olavarria and Montero, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This region- and lamina-specific projection pattern forms by P15 in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). Our group, as well as others, previously showed that Kir2.1 expression disturbs callosal axon development primarily in the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagawa and Hirano, 2012</xref>). We also reported that Kir2.1 expression strongly reduced spontaneous cortical network activity at P9-10 and P13-14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>). These results suggest that network activity around the second postnatal week is involved in the formation of callosal axon projections. In the current study, we sought to confirm this by conducting ‘rescue’ experiments, in which we attempted to restore the activity during P6-15 and asked whether such restored activity could recover the axonal projections.</p><p>To control spontaneous network activity in a stage-specific manner during early postnatal periods, we used the Tet-off system to express Kir2.1.

We then reared the second group with Dox throughout development (from E15 to P15: see Methods: <italic>n</italic>=8 mice). Under this condition, we observed that RFP-labeled callosal axons projected normally to the contralateral cortex in a region- and lamina-specific manner at P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, we used the same set of plasmids for in utero electroporation and began Dox treatment during the postnatal period. Dox treatment for 4 days was almost enough to suppress gene expression in the Tet-off system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>; regarding the apparent low-level expression of Kir2.1EGFP after Dox treatment, please see the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We started Dox treatment from P6 and continued it until P15 (<italic>n</italic>=10 mice). Under this condition, we observed that RFP-labeled callosal axons reached the innervation area in the contralateral cortex and ramified in a laminar specific manner at P15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). This projection pattern appeared comparable to the normal pattern of callosal axon projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>). Because reaching and ramifying in layer 2/3 is a critical developmental step for the formation of callosal axon projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tagawa and Hirano, 2012</xref>), we quantified the strength of RFP signals in layer 2/3. Quantitative analyses suggested that the density of RFP-labeled callosal axons arriving and ramifying in the target cortical layer (see Methods) was comparable between the Dox P6-15 and Dox E15-P15 groups (p=0.96, Tukey–Kramer test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and that it was greater in the Dox P6-15 group than in the no Dox group (p=9.0 × 10<sup>–4</sup>, one-way ANOVA; p=2.3 × 10<sup>–3</sup>, Tukey–Kramer test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Analyses of the width of callosal axon innervation zone, as well as densitometric line scans across all cortical layers, suggest that some aspects of callosal projections might be partially recovered in Dox P6-15 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that Dox treatment at P6-15, which likely shut off Kir2.1 expression from P8-10 to P15, was effective for the formation of callosal axon projections, implying that callosal axons require neuronal activity during P6-15 to form their projections.</p><p>An important role of neuronal activity in P10-15 was suggested by another experiment using the DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) method. DREADD is a method to increase or decrease neuronal activity using a nonendogenous ligand clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). Activation of hM3DGq, one of the artificial G-protein-coupled receptors used in DREADD technology, in hippocampal neurons causes depolarization of the membrane potential, resulting in an increase in neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander et al., 2009</xref>). We transfected layer 2/3 cortical neurons with the expression vector pCAG-hM3DGq, together with the pCAG-TurboRFP and pCAG-Kir2.1 plasmids, by in utero electroporation at E15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We observed that the electroporated mice with daily CNO injections from P10 to P14 (<italic>n</italic>=11 mice) exhibited a region- and lamina-specific projection pattern of RFP-labeled callosal axons in the contralateral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Our findings add new evidence of the critical role of spontaneous network activity in cortical circuit formation and demonstrate that not only local circuits but also long-range axonal projections require spontaneous activity for their normal development.</p><p>A recent study showed that a developmental change in the firing mode of callosal projection neurons, regulated by transcription factor Cux1-driven Kv1 channel expression, was critically involved in activity-dependent callosal axon projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodríguez-Tornos et al., 2016</xref>). Because they assessed the firing property of neurons using in vitro slice preparations, what aspect(s) of activity in vivo contribute to axonal projection is not known. Our study extends their findings by demonstrating that spontaneous activity in vivo is critical for callosal axon projections.</p><p>The ‘rescue’ effect was only observed during P6-15 but not afterward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A similar developmental time window for the formation of axonal projections was reported in the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). In the previous study, we showed that callosal axons could reach the innervation area almost normally under activity reduction, and that the effects of activity reduction became apparent afterward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). Callosal axons elaborate their branches extensively in P10-P15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2010</xref>), and axon branching is regulated by neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). It is likely that activity is required for the processes of formation, rather than the maintenance of the connections already formed by P10, but the current study employed massive labeling of callosal axons which is not suited to clarify this. In addition, the restoration of activity in the Tet-off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or DREADD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) experiment may not completely rescue the ramification pattern of individual axons. Single-axon tracing experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dhande et al., 2011</xref>) would be required to clarify this. Nonetheless, our findings suggest that callosal axons retain the ability, or are permitted, to grow and make region- and lamina-specific projections in the cortex during a limited period of postnatal cortical development under an activity-dependent mechanism.</p><p>Patterned spontaneous activity in the developing neocortex can be classified as a highly synchronous pattern (H events) and a less correlated pattern (L events) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>). What could be the roles of these patterns of activity in axonal projections? In retinothalamic and retinocollicular projections, network activity in the retina (retinal waves) is proposed to provide spatial information for axonal projections. It is proposed that two adjacent RGCs, which likely fire together in a spontaneous network event would project their axons to an adjacent location in the target tissue. On the other hand, two RGCs located distantly, or even in the left and right eyes, are unlikely to fire together, projecting axons to distinct locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wong, 1999</xref>). The highly synchronous network activity in the cortex recruits more than 60% of neurons in an imaging field, clearly exceeding the proportion of callosal projection neurons. Callosal projection neurons are intermingled with other types of cortical neurons that project axons intracortically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mitchell and Macklis, 2005</xref>), suggesting that both the former and the latter contribute to H events once they occur. If the highly synchronous activity in the cortex exerts a similar role as retinal waves, it may provide topographic information to callosal axons and other axons projecting to other cortical regions at the same time.</p><p>We have shown that the projections could be established even without fully restoring highly synchronous activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). L events, but not H events, were present in P13 cortex after Dox treatment at P6. L events may be sufficient for the formation of callosal projections. Alternatively, any form of activity with certain level(s) (i.e. ‘sufficiently’ high activity with no specific pattern) could be permissive for the formation of callosal connections. In a recent study, we showed that callosal projection neurons preferentially make synaptic connections with neighboring callosal projection neurons and form local subnetworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hagihara et al., 2021</xref>). Some of the L events observed in this study may reflect the correlated subnetwork activity of callosal projection neurons, and such correlated activity may be critical for their axonal projections. This consideration may lead to a more general and intriguing idea that L events might be coactivations of locally connected cortical neurons, sending axons to the same target region(s). Future experiments would be able to test this important possibility by combining retrograde labeling of callosal (and other projection) neurons and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in developing mice.</p><p>Network activity may also function to induce some trophic factors. If this is the case, the effect of reducing the activity of a small number of cells could be less than that of global activity reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mizuno et al., 2010</xref>) because surrounding unperturbed cells can supply a ‘trophic factor’ for the perturbed cells. Spitzer et al. showed that BDNF could exert such a function in <italic>Xenopus</italic> spinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014</xref>). They showed that spontaneous firing causes the release of BDNF, which non-cell-autonomously functions to trigger TrkB receptor activation and activity-dependent transmitter switching in the surrounding neurons. BDNF may function in callosal axon projections. BDNF expression is activity-dependent in the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tao et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lein and Shatz, 2000</xref>). It has also been shown that callosal axons require BDNF secretion for their projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shimojo et al., 2015</xref>). Activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, or other factor(s), may be associated with the network activity.</p><p>In the activity manipulation experiments using the Tet-off system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>), there may have been residual Kir2.1 expression after Dox treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, it remains uncertain precisely when activity levels returned and what patterns of spontaneous activity emerged during the Dox-treated period. Highly and/or less synchronous activity can be instructive or permissive to the formation of cortical circuits. As mentioned above, L events may be a mixture of different patterns of activity with mixed populations of neurons in the cortex. Some pattern(s) of network activity embedded in L events may play a role in the formation of callosal projections and cortical connections in general.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The ICR strain of mice was used.

Briefly, pregnant mice were anesthetized at E15.5 with somnopentyl (pentobarbital sodium; 50 mg per kg of body weight; Kyoritsu-seiyaku) in saline with or without isoflurane. A midline laparotomy was performed to expose the uterus. For DNA microinjection, glass capillary tubes (GD-1; Narishige) were pulled using a micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments). Embryos were injected into the lateral ventricle with 1 μl of DNA solution (expression plasmids other than pCAG-tTA2<sup>s</sup>, 0.6–1.0 mg ml<sup>–1</sup>; pCAG-tTA2<sup>s</sup>, 0.04–0.1 mg ml<sup>–1</sup>), and square electric pulses (50 V; 50 ms) were delivered five times at the rate of one pulse per second using an electroporator (CUY21EDIT; NepaGene). After electroporation, the uterus was repositioned, the abdominal cavity was filled with prewarmed PBS, and the wall and skin were sutured. Animals were allowed to recover on a heating pad for approximately an hour before returning to their home cage. Plasmids used were as follows. pCAG-tTA2<sup>s</sup> and pTRETight2-Kir2.1 express Kir2.1 under the control of the Tet-off gene expression system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>). pCAsal-EGFP, pCAG-TurboRFP, and pCAG-FP635 express fluorescent proteins and pCAG-Kir2.1 for the expression of Kir2.1 under the control of the CAG promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). pTRETight2-TurboRFP for expression of the fluorescent protein under the control of the Tet-off gene expression system. pTRETight2-Kir2.1EGFP (EGFP was fused with the C terminus of Kir2.1) was used to confirm the expression of Kir2.1. pCAG-hM3DGq for DREADD experiments. After birth, animals that did not show fluorescent signals in the visual cortex of the electroporated hemisphere were excluded from further histological or imaging experiments. For histological analyses, animals were anesthetized at P6, P8, P10, P15, P18, or P21 with an overdose of somnopentyl and decapitated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Doxycycline and clozapine-N-oxide administration</title><p>Dox (#9891: Sigma-Aldrich) was added to drinking water (2 mg ml<sup>–1</sup>) with 10% sugar.

Pups were exposed to Dox through the mother’s milk; electroporated pups were transferred to a foster mother from P6 (or P9 or P12 in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) that had been given Dox via the drinking water for a week.

Coronal brain slices (50 μm) were sectioned using a freezing microtome (LM2000R; Leica). Fluorescent histological images were acquired using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus). The expression of Kir2.1EGFP was assessed with anti-GFP antibody (rat monoclonal Ab from Nacalai, Japan, GF090R; the secondary antibody, 488-anti Rat IgG from Invitrogen, A11006) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). To obtain the projection patterns of fluorescently labeled callosal axons for each tissue section (50 μm in thickness), serial confocal images were collected at 3 μm intervals to create a z-axis image stack. Quantification of the callosal axon projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>) was performed as previously described with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mizuno et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, in each brain section, boxes (300 μm in width, 100 μm in height) were drawn to enclose the fluorescently labeled callosal axon fibers in layers 1–3 and the WM on the projection side of the cortex, and the density of the fluorescent signal in each box was computed (these are raw values of the signal intensity in layers 1–3 and WM on the projection side). Then, a background level of signal was computed in adjacent areas of the cortex and subtracted (background-subtracted values of the signal intensity in layers 1–3 and WM on the projection side). To compensate for variability in the efficacy of labeling callosal axons with fluorescent proteins, the average WM fluorescent signal was obtained on the electroporated side of the cortex and used to normalize the signal intensity on the projection side of the cortex at each brain section (i.e. the normalized signal intensity in layers 1–3 and WM on the projection side was calculated by dividing the signal from layers 1–3 or WM on the projection side by the WM signal on the electroporated side; background-subtracted value of the signal intensity in layers 1–3 or WM on the projection side/background-subtracted value of the signal intensity in WM on the electroporated side). To quantify widths of callosal axon arborization in L2/3 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A, B</xref>), confocal images were first Gaussian filtered (kernel size: 30 pixels) and then binarized by one of the authors who was blind to experimental conditions. Widths of positive regions that correspond to L2/3 and 5 arborizations in the binarized images were manually quantified. For densitometric line scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>), original confocal images were tilt-adjusted and cropped into 900 pixel × 900 pixel images so that pia to WM were covered. Pixel intensities of each row of the preprocessed images, which corresponds to a cortical depth, were averaged. For KirGFP expression level quantification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), individual neurons were manually detected and rectangular ROIs were placed. Pixel intensities in green and red channels in each ROI were then averaged. For comparison across Dox treatment conditions, the ratio between the averaged green and red channel intensities from individual neurons was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Spontaneous neuronal activity recording and data analyses</title><p>Mice were prepared for in vivo calcium imaging as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>). In brief, mice were anesthetized using isoflurane (3.0% for induction, 1.0–2.0% during surgery). A custom-made metal plate was mounted onto the skull, and a craniotomy was carefully performed before calcium imaging approximately above V1 using stereotaxic coordinates. After surgery, the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.7%. Because the level of spontaneous activity is greatly affected by the anesthesia level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegel et al., 2012</xref>), the isoflurane concentration was carefully controlled, and we started recording at least 1 hr after the reduction in isoflurane concentration. We dissolved 0.8 mM Oregon Green 488 BAPTA-1 AM (OGB-1) in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) with 20% pluronic acid and mixed it with Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing 0.05 mM Alexa594 (Alexa; all obtained from Invitrogen, CA, USA). A glass pipette (3–5 μm tip diameter) was filled with this solution and inserted into the cortex around the center of a craniotomy to a depth of approximately 250 µm from the surface, and then the solution was pressure-ejected from the pipette using a Picospitzer (Parker, USA) (−0.5 psi for 1–5 s, 5–10 times). After confirming loading, the craniotomy was sealed with a cover glass. We aimed to record spontaneous neuronal activity in putative binocular zones in V1 based on relative coordinates to lambda. Since the boundaries between V1 and higher visual areas, AL (anterolateral)/LM (lateromedial) are not as obvious as those in adult, our recordings likely contained lateral monocular V1 and AL/LM. Changes in calcium fluorescence in the cortical neurons were monitored using a two-photon microscope (Zeiss LSM7MP or Nikon A1MP), which was equipped with a mode-locked Ti:sapphire laser (MaiTai Deep See, Spectra Physics). The excitation light was focused with a 25× Olympus (NA: 1.05) or Nikon (NA: 1.10) PlanApo objective. The average power delivered to the brain was &lt;20 mW, depending on the depth of focus. OGB-1 and FP635 were excited at 920 nm. The emission filters were 517–567 nm for OGB-1 and 600–650 nm for FP635. Care was taken to shield the microscope objective and the photomultipliers from stray light. Images were obtained using Zeiss Zen software or Nikon NIS Elements software. A rectangular region (281.6 µm × 140.8 µm) from layer 2/3 (depths of 150–300 µm from the surface) was imaged with 512 × 256 pixels at 4 Hz.</p><p>Images were analyzed using custom-written in-house software running on in MATLAB (Mathworks) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ohki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hagikent/CallosalRescue">https://github.com/hagikent/CallosalRescue</ext-link>). Images were motion corrected by maximizing the correlation between frames. The cell outlines were automatically identified using template matching. The identified cell outlines were visually inspected, and the rare but clear errors were manually corrected. FP635 positive or negative neurons were manually identified. The time courses of individual cells were extracted by averaging the pixel values within the cell outlines, and then, high-cut (Butterworth, <italic>n</italic>=10; cutoff, 1 s) and low-cut (Gaussian, cutoff, 2 min) filters were applied. Those time courses were further corrected to minimize out-of-focus signal contamination. This process is important because of the highly synchronous characteristics of spontaneous network activity during the developmental stage. To achieve this, neuropil signals were subtracted from cell body signals after multiplying the contamination ratio as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kerlin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagihara et al., 2015</xref>).

Based on the comments, we have revised the manuscript extensively. Regarding the “Essential Revisions” #1 and #2, we have conducted additional experiments/analyses and added new results (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and 4). Regarding the “Essential Revisions” #3, we added Discussions in the manuscript.</p><p>Regarding the “Essential Revisions” #1, we conducted new experiments using pTRE-Tight2Kir2.1EGFP, with which EGFP signals reflect localization of over-expressed Kir2.1, and examined when the expression of Kir2.1EGFP went down after Dox treatment at P6. At P6 (before Dox treatment), the signals of Kir2.1EGFP (stained with anti-GFP antibody) were observed in the periphery of the soma and along dendrites, implying that Kir2.1EGFP was transported to the cellular membrane. At P10 and P15 (4 days and 9 days after Dox treatment), Kir2.1EGFP signals were not observed in the periphery of the soma and along dendrites. We noted that low-level green signals were observed in the central part of the cell body. These may stem from low-level expression of Kir2.1EGFP in nuclei or cytosol even after Dox treatment. Alternatively, and more likely, these may reflect bleed-through of RFP signals into GFP channel. Overall, we confirmed that Kir2.1 proteins that were localized to the cellular membrane were largely down-regulated. We described these observations in detail in the figure legend of Figure 1—figure supplement 3, and added the result as Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Regarding the “Essential Revisions” #2, we added analyses of the pattern of callosal projections; the width of callosal axon innervation zone in layers 2/3 and 5, and densitometric line scans across all cortical layers. We added these results as Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p><p>Regarding the “Essential Revisions” #3, we removed the term “patterned activity” throughout the manuscript and revised the title, abstract, introduction, results, and discussion extensively. The suggested new experiment (suggested by Reviewer #2), retrograde labeling of callosal projection neurons and performing in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging to investigate to what extent retrogradely labeled callosal projection neurons participate in each L event, is a key to test the hypothesis. This experiment can be conducted easily in the mature brain, but difficult in the neonatal period. Firstly, retrograde labeling takes several days from dye injection to fully labeling of target neurons; If we want to perform Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging at P12, we need to inject dye around P9 when callosal axons do not fully reach and ramify in the contralateral cortex. Secondly, it is desired to label almost 100% of callosal projection neurons in this experiment. L events are network activity with intermediate-level synchrony (some neurons are participated but many other neurons are not), and it would be difficult to determine quantitatively to what extent the two populations of neurons, retrogradely labeled callosal projection neurons and neurons that participate in each L event, are overlapping if retrograde labeling is not perfect. Because the neonatal period is when the formation of callosal projections is still ongoing, complete retrograde labeling is difficult. Another way to label callosal projection neurons is genetic labeling, but we havenʼt found a perfect genetic tool to specifically label callosal projection neurons. We have conducted preliminary experiments, but it will take more time and is too hard to complete within a reasonable time span. We therefore revised the text in the Discussion as follows.</p><p>Page 8, line 228-231:</p><p>“This consideration may lead to a more general and intriguing idea that L events might be coactivations of locally connected cortical neurons, sending axons to the same target region(s). Future experiments would be able to test this important possibility by combining retrograde labeling of callosal (and other projection) neurons and Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in developing mice.”</p><p>Page 8, line 241-244:</p><p>“Highly and/or less synchronous activity can be instructive or permissive to the formation of cortical circuits. As mentioned above, L events may be a mixture of different patterns of activity with mixed populations of neurons in the cortex. Some pattern(s) of network activity embedded in L events may play a role in the formation of callosal projections and cortical connections in general.”</p><p>We respond to each reviewerʼs comment one-by-one as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>What would strengthen the paper considerably would be to use calcium imaging to better characterize the restoration of activity during the critical period rather than just at the end both as a validation of the tet-off model and to precise the actual critical period window.

If this is the case, the effect of reducing the activity of a small number of cells could be less than that of global activity reduction (Mizuno et al., 2010) because surrounding unperturbed cells can supply a “trophic factor” for the perturbed cells. Spitzer et al. showed that BDNF could exert such a function in <italic>Xenopus</italic> spinal neurons (Guemez-Gamboa et al., 2014). They showed that spontaneous firing causes the release of BDNF, which non-cell-autonomously functions to trigger TrkB receptor activation and activity-dependent transmitter switching in the surrounding neurons. BDNF may function in callosal axon projections. BDNF expression is activity-dependent in the cortex (Tao et al., 1998; Lein and Shatz, 2000). It has also been shown that callosal axons require BDNF secretion for their projections (Shimojo et al., 2015). Activity-dependent secretion of BDNF, or other factor(s), may be associated with the network activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 232 states &quot;the rescue effect was only observed during P10-15&quot;.

Then, a background level of signal was computed in adjacent areas of the cortex and subtracted (background-subtracted values of the signal intensity in layers 1-3 and WM on the projection side). To compensate for variability in the efficacy of labeling callosal axons with fluorescent proteins, the average WM fluorescent signal was obtained on the electroporated side of the cortex and used to normalize the signal intensity on the projection side of the cortex at each brain section (i.e., the normalized signal intensity in layers 1-3 and WM on the projection side was calculated by dividing the signal from layers 1-3 or WM on the projection side by the WM signal on the electroporated side; background-subtracted value of the signal intensity in layers 1-3 or WM on the projection side / background-subtracted value of the signal intensity in WM on the electroporated side).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures</p><p>Bar graphs showing mean {plus minus} SEM fail to convey the real variability of the data.
