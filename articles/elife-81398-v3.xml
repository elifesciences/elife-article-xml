cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors (‘orphans’) or are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening are not optimized for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for the deorphanization of ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high-value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass transmembrane (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding assays. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine-like protein that binds to killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human-secreted and membrane proteomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>protein-protein interaction</kwd><kwd>screen</kwd><kwd>secreted proteome</kwd><kwd>ligand</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>G Harold and Leila Y Mathers Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 RO1 GM150125</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garcia</surname><given-names>K Christopher</given-names></name><name><surname>Zinn</surname><given-names>Kai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A proteo-genomic CRISPR activation screening workflow to accelerate the identification of novel interactions between the secreted and membrane proteome with the potential to define new biological processes and identify future therapeutic targets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human proteome can be envisioned as an array of nodes grouped into local communities, where each node represents one protein and each local community represents a protein complex or network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budayeva and Kirkpatrick, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huttlin et al., 2017</xref>). These communities determine physiological function and subcellular localization. Many communities include secreted protein ligands, their cell surface receptors, and signaling molecules that bind to the receptors. The human secretome on its own constitutes approximately 15% of all human genes and encodes more than 4000 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uhlén et al., 2019</xref>) with a wide range of tissue expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

ECD interactions are often of low affinity, with K<sub>D</sub>s in the micromolar range, and can have fast dissociation rates, rendering them difficult to detect since they may not produce stable complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honig and Shapiro, 2020</xref>). As a consequence, ECD interactions are generally underrepresented in screens that rely on the formation of such complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martinez-Martin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Söllner and Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wojtowicz et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, many putative ECD interactions reported by AP/MS and Y2H protein interaction databases have the tendency to be false positives. AP/MS produces false positives for cell surface proteins due to incomplete solubilization of membranes, leading to identification of indirect interactions. Y2H examines interactions inside the cell, but most ECDs have disulfide bonds and glycosylation sites. To acquire these modifications and fold correctly, cell surface and secreted proteins must move through the secretory pathway. Because of this, ECD interactions detected by Y2H are often false positives due to domain misfolding. Similar issues apply to phage display and to microarrays in which mRNAs are translated on a chip. Thus, while these high-throughput methods can identify interactions with the cytoplasmic domains of receptors, they usually fail to find genuine ECD interactions.</p><p>Successful high-throughput screens to detect weak ECD interactions in vitro have taken advantage of avidity effects by expressing ECDs as fusions with multimerization domains. In such binary interaction screens, one protein (the bait) is applied to a surface, and the other (the prey) is in solution. Prey binding to the bait is assessed using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. These methods include AVEXIS, ECIA, apECIA, alpha-Screen, and BPIA, which are carried out using ELISA plates, chips, or beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braun et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bushell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martinez-Martin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shilts et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taouji et al., 2009</xref>). However, in vitro screens have limitations. They require robotic high-throughput instrumentation and are time-consuming and expensive to carry out on a large scale, since they require synthesis of ECD coding regions and expression of individual bait and prey proteins. In addition, in vitro screens cannot usually assess binding to ECDs of receptors that span the membrane multiple times, because such ECDs are often composed of noncontiguous loops and cannot be easily expressed in a soluble form. Furthermore, in vitro binary interaction mapping technologies lack the natural spatial context of the cell membrane. They may also fail in cases where cofactors and/or post-translational modifications are required for binding.</p><p>To address these issues, several groups have successfully developed cell-based screens for phenotypical screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Han et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kamber et al., 2021</xref>), uncovering signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Breslow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wisnovsky et al., 2021</xref>) or to study interactions between cell surface receptors using receptor ECDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2018</xref>), that take advantage of CRISPR technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jinek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mali et al., 2013</xref>). In CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens such as the one described here, gene expression is induced by targeting transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tycko et al., 2017</xref>) to their control elements using sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kampmann, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>). Utilizing CRISPRa pooled sgRNA libraries eliminates the need to create expensive collection of synthetic genes, and in addition allows a forward positive screening workflow which enables a higher dynamic range compared to loss-of-function screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doench, 2018</xref>). Libraries of cells, each with an sgRNA targeting one receptor, can be easily stored and screened for binding to soluble ligands.</p><p>Here, we describe a CRISPRa enrichment workflow that employs customized, pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with magnetic bead-based selection (magnetic-activated cell sorting [MACS]) to enrich for receptor-expressing cells. This approach allows cost-efficient parallel screening with multiple ligands. We created two cell libraries, comprising all single-pass transmembrane (TM1) and multi-pass transmembrane (TM2+) receptors, and screened them with a collection of secreted ligands. To define a set of high-priority ligands, we first curated the human-secreted proteome and selected and expressed 20 at levels sufficient for screening the TM1 and TM2+ libraries. We identified new receptor candidates in more than half of these screens. These were validated using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and/or cell binding assays. These studies define new receptors for several secreted ligands that function in the immune and nervous systems and provides a resource for future investigations of relationships between the human-secreted and membrane proteome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A CRISPR activating enrichment screening platform</title><p>A large variety of different second-generation dCas9 activator (CRISPRa) systems are currently in use. A recent study directly compared a large number of published Cas9 activators systems and found the VPR, SunTag, and SAM approaches perform equally effective across a number of different cell lines and target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chavez et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kampmann, 2018</xref>). The SunTag system was initially developed in K562 cells (myeloid leukemia cell line K562) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>), a highly characterized (ENCODE, The Protein Atlas) and easy to handle suspension cell line that is widely used for CRISPR screens and highly suitable for MACS-based applications. CRISPR-mediated activation of transcription using the SunTag system (termed sunCas9) is a precise and scalable method for inducing expression of endogenous genes across a high dynamic range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). This system uses a dead Cas9 (dCas9) variant fused to a SunTag, a multicopy epitope tag that recruits the VP64 transcriptional activator via binding to a cytoplasmic scFV-nanobody-VP64 fusion protein. sgRNAs guide this complex to the enhancer region of the gene of interest and facilitate target-specific gene activation and expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tanenbaum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate the performance and feasibility of CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation of cell surface proteins for a receptor/ligand interaction discovery platform, we first selected 10 well-characterized cell surface receptors with varying mRNA expression levels ranging from not detected to highly expressed in K562 human myeloid leukemia cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uhlén et al., 2019</xref>). We then generated a pooled lentiviral mini-library of 10 sgRNAs per enhancer (100 sgRNA elements), matched with 100 control sgRNAs derived from scrambled sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>) and transduced K562 cells stably expressing the sunCas9 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Each library plasmid contained a single sgRNA targeting one of the 10 genes, a GFP fluorescent marker and a puromycin resistance marker. The library-transduced cells were puromycin selected for 5 days to obtain &gt;90% GFP positive cells. The expression levels of the 10 cell surface receptors were then evaluated by cell surface staining (CSS) using APC- (allophycocyanin) labeled antibodies against the respective targets (CD122 was used as a control). In summary, the majority (8 out of 10) targets showed elevated cell surface expression to varying degrees in comparison to non-transduced K562 sunCas9 cells or a control receptor (CD122) that was not part of the mini-library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).</p><p>We then used human interleukin 2 (IL-2), which has a high affinity receptor subunit termed CD25 (IL2RA), to validate our screening workflow in two parallel screens, simulating two library sizes by diluting the 10 target (100 sgRNA) K562 sunCas9 mini-library by 1:20 and 1:200 with non-transduced K562 sunCas9 cells, corresponding to final library sizes of 200 and 2000 targets, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-F</xref>). Both library pools were incubated with magnetic streptavidin microbeads complexed with biotinylated IL-2, and IL-2 binding cells were isolated in a positive selection workflow by MACS, using Miltenyi LS-MACS columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). After labeling, washing, and elution, positively selected cells were expanded and stained using an APC-labeled anti-CD25 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Genomic DNA was extracted from both consecutive rounds of selection as well as the naïve K562 sunCas9 mini-library itself, followed by barcoding and deep sequencing for both libraries.</p><p>Deep sequencing data for each round of selection was analyzed and hits were identified using the robust casTLE statistical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>) and results were analyzed, filtered, and visualized. We calculated casTLE metrics for each round of selection in comparison to the naïve library. Using casTLE, both IL-2 CRISPRa screens successfully identified IL-2 receptor alpha (IL2RA; CD25) as the top hit with the highest confidence (casTLE Score), casTLE Effects, and significance (pValue) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We first compiled a comprehensive list of cell surface receptors by carefully curating the human membrane proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We chose a targeted cell surface library approach instead of a genome-wide approach, allowing a smaller library size, resulting in a better signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and avoiding unwanted transcriptional upregulation of non-membrane proteins. We utilized several databases including HUGO, UniProt, the Human Protein Atlas, and bioinformatic tools (SignalP, TMHMM) to compile two cell surface target lists covering both TM1 and TM2+ cell surface proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For the CRISPRa-mediated transcriptional activation of cell surface proteins, we synthesized and cloned two pooled sgRNA libraries, a TM1 and a TM2+ library, each with 10 sgRNAs per target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). Both libraries include matched controls targeting genomic locations without annotated function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D</xref>). K562 cells stably expressing the sunCas9 system were infected with both libraries (TM1; TM2+) at low, medium, and high multiplicity of infection (MOI), then selected with puromycin until the cell population was at least 90% GFP positive, indicating the presence of lentivirus. Cells were recovered and expanded, and representative aliquots were saved as naïve library stocks in liquid nitrogen with at least ×1000 cell number coverage per sgRNA to maintain maximum library complexity. Sufficient sgRNA representation of the naïve library was confirmed by deep sequencing after puromycin selection and showed the highest coverage and diversity at low MOI with at least 91% of reads with at least one reported alignment (R=0.97) for both libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). Library information including sgRNA target IDs and sequences for both libraries (TM1; TM2+) can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CRISPRa benchmark screen using human IL-2</title><p>After library cloning and validation, we benchmarked the sensitivity and robustness of our screening platform with a proof of concept screen using human IL-2, following the protocols used for the mini-library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We successfully recovered CD25 (IL2RA) as the top hit after two rounds of enrichment, deep sequencing, and analysis following the outlined workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Initially, the naïve TM1 library showed no positive IL-2 binding by tetramer staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Library enrichment was monitored by IL-2 tetramer staining (IL-2:SA647; 200 nM) throughout the selection workflow, and after only one round of positive selection we observed a significant enrichment of IL-2 selected cells, from 0.1% to 13.3% IL-2 tetramer positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; middle FACS plot). After expanding the cells from the first round and subjecting them to a second round of CRISPRa enrichment screening, we observed a further robust increase of IL-2 tetramer positive from 13.3 to 95% IL-2 tetramer positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; right FACS plot).</p><p>After each consecutive round of selection, enriched cells were expanded and genomic DNA was extracted, followed by barcoding and deep sequencing. Genomic DNA from the K562 sunCas9 TM1 naïve library itself served as the baseline. Following deep sequencing, data from both rounds of consecutive IL-2 selections was analyzed and visualized using the casTLE statistical framework. To predict high-confidence interaction pairs from each dataset, a custom score was then computed for each potential interaction pair by combining all three metrics (casTLE Score, casTLE Effect, and pValue) into one ESP score: (casTLE-Effect + casTLE Score)/pValue. CD25 was identified as the top hit with the highest confidence (casTLE Score), pValue (significance), and casTLE Effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). Furthermore, we used the casTLE ESP metrics from each round to plot trajectories of CD25, which allows for a direct evaluation of sgRNA enrichment throughout the selection workflow and shows a positive trajectory for CD25 in the selection workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), validating the sensitivity and robustness of our screening pipeline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Selection and production of secreted proteins for CRISPRa screening</title><p>We first generated a secreted proteome master list from several databases, including HUGO, UniProt, the Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Uhlén et al., 2019</xref>), and bioinformatic tools (SignalP, TMHMM) to identify potential high-priority secreted proteins for our screening workflow. After curation of the human-secreted proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), approximately 60% of the ~1600 genes were classified as encoding enzymes (mostly proteases), enzyme inhibitors, serum proteins, or components of saliva, tears, or other fluids (these include carrier proteins), structural, extracellular matrix proteins, antimicrobial proteins, complement factors, coagulation factors, lectins, or unknown. The remaining ~40% of genes were identified as likely to encode secreted ligands acting through cell surface receptors and further examined through literature searches. We classified products of 419 genes as ligands with known receptors that can adequately account for their biology. Finally, we identified 206 gene products either as ‘orphans’ with no identified receptor or as ligands that are likely to have additional, as yet unidentified receptors in addition to those that have been described. From these 206, we ultimately selected a total of 80 high-priority targets (one per gene; we did not consider isoforms generated through alternative splicing). These had a wide range of tissue expression with many of the chosen secreted ligands being expressed in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) covering a broad range of molecular function and processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).

In addition to the Expi293F expression system, we explored whether insect expression could serve as viable alternative expression strategy to rescue some of the secreted ligands that failed to express in the Expi293F expression system. To test this strategy, we selected a total of 12 candidates that were subcloned for expression in insect cells (Hi5): 10 candidates that showed no expression from Expi293F cells and an additional 2 candidates that were previously successfully expressed in Expi293F (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN). While the control candidates (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN) showed some low level of expression from insect cells, none of the other 10 candidates tested showed any positive expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>).

In general, screening results of the final round of enrichment were subjected to a first-pass filter using the following cut-offs: casTLE-Effect &gt; 2, casTLE-Score &gt; 2, pValue &lt; 0.05, candidates outside the secreted and membrane proteome and common false positive contaminants were removed. To integrate data analysis and visualization, we used the combined ESP score to rank sort interaction pairs for every screen.

Hence, screening results were augmented by using phylogenetic homology analysis (PHA), a strategy that has proven to be highly effective to predict additional PPIs between subfamily members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wojtowicz et al., 2020</xref>). Furthermore, in an effort to explore potential functional relationships between orphan-secreted ligands and newly discovered interactions, mRNA expression profiles from healthy tissues were obtained from The Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>) to perform hierarchical clustering and correlation analysis.</p><p>We selected a subset of CRISPRa enrichment screens with high ranking predicted ESP scores for potential interaction pairs for further validation using orthogonal methods, including SPR and CSS. Bona fide PPIs are expected to display distinct association and dissociation kinetics, which can be observed with high sensitivity by SPR, the ‘gold’ standard to measure biomolecular interactions. CSS was utilized as an alternative orthogonal validation method to show PPIs in a cellular context using a fluorescent-tetramerization-based approach by flow cytometry for high sensitivity detection of putative PPIs on the cell surface. In a first-pass analysis we selected the validated hits of the CRISPRa enrichment screens and performed database searches to calculate overlaps between our screening results and the aggregate of BioGrid, BioPlex, and STRING databases (physical interactions; membrane and secreted proteome).

phosphorylation is a fundamental regulatory step in intracellular signal transduction and is orchestrated in a coordinated fashion by activities of protein tyrosine kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). PTPs play essential roles in the regulation of growth, differentiation, oncogenic transformation, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Julien et al., 2010</xref>). The classical PTPs include cytoplasmic PTPs and transmembrane RPTPs, which can be classified into distinct subfamilies according to their domain architecture. Most RPTPs display features of cell adhesion molecules with a diverse domain repertoire including MAM (meprin, A-5) domains, Ig (immunoglobulin-like) domains, and FN (fibronectin) Type III repeats in their extracellular segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tonks, 2006</xref>). In our human in vitro interactome screen, we identified new cell surface binding partners for multiple RPTPs that are likely to mediate cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wojtowicz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In our CRISPRa screen with oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMG), we observed the Type R2B subfamily member PTPRU as the top-ranking hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) with a positive enrichment trajectory over all three rounds of selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We confirmed binding of OMG to PTPRU by SPR, with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~70 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We also identified two members of the R2A subfamily, PTPRF and PTPRS, as well as the R4 subfamily member PTPRA as enriched in the OMG screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Type R2A (PTPRD, PTPRF, PTPRS), R2B (PTPRK, PTPRM, PTPRT, PTPRU), and R3 (PTPRB, PTPRH, PTPRJ, PTPRO, PTPRP) are the largest RPTP subfamilies. They all share large ECDs that include FN-III repeats. R2A RPTPs also have Ig domains, and R2B RPTPs have both Ig and MAM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). PPIs often occur between phylogenetically related proteins both within and between subfamilies. We examined binding of OMG to all R2A and R2B subfamily members as well as PRPRJ (R3) by SPR. Binding in the micromolar affinity range was observed for all three R2A RPTPs (PTPRD, PTPRF, PTPRS) but only for PTPRU among R2B RPTPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hierarchical clustering by healthy tissue expression correlations may infer functionally related communities. We therefore examined healthy tissue mRNA expression profiles for OMG, R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP family members from the Human Protein Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karlsson et al., 2021</xref>) and performed a multivariate clustering analysis. OMG clustered with several RPTP family members including binding partners PTPRU and PTPRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In the nervous system, these RPTPs are expressed primarily in neurons, and could function as receptors for OMG, which is expressed in oligodendrocytes and some neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>PTPRU binds to Osteocrin (OSTN), a primate-specific brain ligand</title><p>PTPRU was also identified as a potential hit in a screen for Osteocrin (OSTN). Although our initial ESP ranking showed PTPRJ, a RPTP member of the R3 subfamily, as the top-ranking hit for OSTN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), analyzing the enrichment trajectories over all three rounds of selections revealed that PTPRJ actually followed a negative trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). By contrast, the R2B family member PTPRU showed a significant positive enrichment trajectory over the course of the screening workflow compared to PTPRJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We therefore analyzed binding of OSTN to a panel of R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP members and found that OSTN exclusively bound to PTPRU, with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~12 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I, J</xref>) and none of the other R2A or R2B subfamily members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>OSTN (Musclin) is a 130 aa peptide hormone that was originally identified in mouse bone and muscle. It regulates bone growth, supports physical endurance, and mediates diverse cardiac benefits of physical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Subbotina et al., 2015</xref>). These actions could be mediated through OSTN’s binding to the natriuretic peptide clearance receptor (NPR-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moffatt et al., 2007</xref>). By binding to NPR-C, OSTN decreases clearance of natriuretic peptides and thereby increases signaling through the NPR-A and NPR-B receptors. In primates, however, the OSTN gene has acquired neuron-specific regulatory elements, and primate OSTN is expressed in cortical neurons and is induced by depolarization in in vitro cultures and by sensory stimuli in vivo. OSTN restricts dendritic growth after depolarization. OSTN expression peaks during the onset of synaptogenesis in fetal development, but it continues to be expressed in neocortex in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ataman et al., 2016</xref>). A pairwise correlation of normal human tissue mRNA expression data for OSTN and the R2A, R2B, and R3 RPTP subfamilies showed correlation only with PTPRU and its close relative PTPRT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).

While the R2A subfamily members cluster closely within their family, the R2B subfamily appears to be more diverse with two subclusters (PTPRM and PTPRT, PTPRK, and PTPRU) and might be due to the fact that MAM domains are less conserved than FN or Ig domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The growth arrest specific 1 protein (GAS1) binds to PTPRA</title><p>PTPRA was identified as the highest-ranking hit in the growth arrest specific 1 (GAS1) screen, with the highest ESP score and a consistent positive enrichment over three rounds of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>), followed by lower scoring PTPRU and PTPRJ with low enrichment trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). PTPRA is a member of the R4 RPTP subfamily (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>), which have short, highly glycosylated ECDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tonks, 2006</xref>). GAS1 bound exclusively to PTPRA, with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). No binding was observed to PTPRU or PTPRJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>) by SPR. We also showed that tetramerized GAS1 (GAS1:SA647) exhibits increased binding to K562 cells that overexpress PTPRA, demonstrating that GAS1 is a soluble ligand for cell surface PTPRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). A multivariate clustering showed that GAS1 is clustering more closely to PTPRA than to PTPRU or PTPRJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>PTPRA is ubiquitously expressed, while GAS1 has a more restricted expression pattern with a stronger correlation with PTPRA in fibroblasts, Muller glia cells, and skeletal myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, Clusters 6–8). GAS1 and PTPRA are both involved in RET tyrosine kinase signaling through SRC, as well as in other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biau et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mustelin and Hunter, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). GAS1 is related to the GFR1 family of transmembrane proteins, which are coreceptors for the RET receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). RET-GFR1 complexes bind to glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), leading to RET autophosphorylation and activation of downstream Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. GAS1 interacts directly with RET and recruits it to lipid rafts. GAS1 binding causes a reduction in GDNF-induced Akt phosphorylation, suggesting that it is a negative regulator of RET signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabrera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">López-Ramírez et al., 2008</xref>). PTPRA also associates with RET signaling complexes and can directly dephosphorylate RET, causing inhibition of RET signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yadav et al., 2020</xref>). Elevated levels of PTPRA leads to promotion of lung cancer and is associated with poor prognosis and overall survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2020</xref>) through c-Src activation. PTPRA has not been demonstrated to directly bind to RET, however, and a linkage between PTPRA and RET might be provided by GAS1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>TAFA-2 selectively interacts with inhibitory KIRs</title><p>A CRISPRa enrichment screen with TAFA-2 (FAM19A2; chemokine-like family member 2) identified two inhibitory killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs), KIR3DL1 and KIR3DL3, which are selectively expressed on natural killer (NK) cells, as the highest-ranking hits by ESP scoring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) with a positive trajectory during the selection workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). KIRs are a polymorphic subfamily of MHC class I receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Mariuzza, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pende et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sivori et al., 2019</xref>). KIR3s have D0, D1, and D2 Ig-like domains. By contrast, KIR2s have only D1 and D2 domains, except for KIR2DL5, which has a D0 and D2 but lacks D1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The structure of KIR3DL1 complexed to an HLA-B reveals that the helices and bound peptide of the HLA engage with the D1 and D2 domains of the KIR, while the D0 domain extends down toward the β-2-microglobulin subunit and engages sequences that are highly conserved among all HLA-A and B alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li and Mariuzza, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We observed binding of TAFA-2 to KIR3DL1 to by SPR, with a K<sub>D</sub> of ~1.7 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Binding to KIR3DL3 was at the limit of detection and did not saturate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To examine binding at the cell surface, fluorescent TAFA-2 tetramers (TAFA2:SA647) were incubated with NKL or NKL cells expressing either full-length KIR3DL1 or KIR2DL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; left panels). Flow cytometry analysis revealed concentration-dependent binding of TAFA-2 to cells expressing KIR3DL1, but not to those expressing KIR2DL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; right panel).</p><p>Interestingly, a PHA of inhibitory KIR family members revealed that D0 domain containing KIRs are more closely related by sequence than KIRs without a D0 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Hence, to further define KIR binding specificity, we tested binding of TAFA-2 tetramers (TAFA2:SA647) to K562 cells expressing KIR3DL1, KIR3DL2, KIR3DL3, KIR2DL2, or KIR2DL5A. We observed higher concentration-dependent binding of TAFA-2 to cells expressing the KIR3s or KIR2DL5A, which all have D0 domains, compared to KIR2DL2, which does not have a D0 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest that D0 domains are required for optimal TAFA-2 binding.</p><p>TAFA-2 is a member of a highly conserved 5-gene family (TAFA1-5) of chemokine-like peptides (neurokines) expressed in the brain. Like other chemokines, TAFAs 1, 4, and 5 bind to G protein-coupled receptors. TAFAs 1–4 all complex with neurexins during their passage through the ER/Golgi pathway, leading to formation of disulfide-bonded cell surface neurexin-TAFA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Khalaj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sarver et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tom Tang et al., 2004</xref>). Although TAFA-2 has only been examined in the brain, the gene is also expressed in the immune system. Its expression is restricted to naïve and memory regulatory T cells (T-regs), basophils, and neutrophils, with the highest expression levels being observed in basophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Neurexins are not expressed in these cell types, so TAFA-2 may be secreted as a monomer or complexed to another protein. The observed interactions of TAFA-2 with D0 domains of KIRs suggest that expression of the chemokine by T-regs or basophils might modulate KIR signaling in NK cells in response to binding of HLA on target cells. In addition to HLA, KIR3DL3 was more recently discovered as a novel interaction partner for HHLA2 (a immune checkpoint member of the B7 family), which has both immune inhibitory and activating abilities and is expressed in many human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, KIR3DL3 and TMIGD2, another HHLA2 interaction partner, were simultaneously able to bind to different sites of HHLA2. This would open another intriguing way of regulating signaling KIR3DL3/TMIGD2-HHLA2 with regard to the newly discovered KIR3DL3-TAFA2 interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Screening results for pleiotrophin family members (MDK, PTN), neurokine superfamily members (TAFA-2, TAFA-5), and a SPARC-related ligand (SMOC1)</title><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we show results of additional screens with shared hits for the pleiotrophin family members midkine (MDK) and pleiotrophin (PTN), and the neurokine family members TAFA-2 and TAFA-5.</p><p>We analyzed the top 20 highest ranking candidates for MDK, PTN, TAFA-2, and TAFA5 and found a strong overlap of hits for several candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

In general, the E3 ligase family (~600 predicted RING E3’s) still remains highly elusive and the majority of PA-TM-RING E3 ligases remain orphans, mostly due to the nature of the ubiquitylation cascade, which are being characterized by very weak affinity and fast kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duan and Pagano, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>).

To examine potential binding of these secreted ligands to CD36 on the cell surface, fluorescent tetramers of LY6H, NRN1, VW2CL, and SCRG1 were incubated with 293F cells or 293F cells expressing full-length CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed binding of LY6H, NRN1, VW2CL, and SCRG1 to CD36 by FACS. SPRC, which showed no enrichment of CD36 in its screen, served as a control and did in fact not bind to CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). All CD36 enriched secreted ligands (LY6H, NRN1, NRN1L, VWC2L, SCRG1) except for KRTDAP show a strong correlation and cluster in brain tissue, which expresses CD36 mRNA only at low levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

We defined a list of 80 high-priority secreted ligands that are likely to have receptors that have not been previously identified. Twenty of these were successfully expressed, biotinylated, coupled to streptavidin magnetic beads, and used in our CRISPRa enrichment screening workflow. After three consecutive rounds of selections and deep sequencing of enriched cells, casTLE statistical analysis enabled high-confidence prediction and identification of interaction pairs from each dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>).</p><p>To validate the results of the screens, we used SPR and cell binding methods (CSS) to prove that the receptor candidates actually bound to the ligands used for screening. We then expanded the set of receptor candidates by taking advantage of homology (PHA), examining other members of the gene families identified in the initial screens for binding. Using these approaches, we identified 14 candidate receptors for 12 screened secreted ligands.</p><p>Interestingly, in some cases (OMG, TAFA-2), a single ligand bound to multiple receptors in the same family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), while in other cases (CD36, RNF167), a single receptor bound to several unrelated ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Our results highlight the inability of standard high-throughput in vitro screening methods to identify genuine ECD interactions, because none of the hits from our screens were found in the aggregate of commonly used protein interaction databases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and attests for the sensitivity and robustness of our screening strategy for secreted ligands. This was previously observed when the results of ELISA-based in vitro screens using multimeric ECD fusion proteins were compared with PPIs represented in these databases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martinez-Martin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Özkan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ranaivoson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Söllner and Wright, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Taouji et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Verschueren et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wojtowicz et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>PPIs often occur between phylogenetically related proteins both within and between subfamilies and PPI modules with tight functional relationships similarly are more likely to be co-expressed. While tissue expression correlations can be used as a predictive tool for physical interactions, poor correlations do not necessarily suggest a lack of biological significance especially in the case of secreted ligands which are not restricted to the tissue origin of expression. In agreement with this hypothesis, we observed that many of the protein pairs newly identified from the CRISPRa enrichment screens displayed tissue-dependent associations. In some cases, correlations were observed between secreted ligand and the receptor (GAS1, OSTN, OMG, TAFA-2), while in other cases correlations very strongly correlated between hit candidates (CD36).</p><p>Our results suggest that the cell-based screening strategy is primarily limited by two factors. First, fewer than one-third of the high-priority ligand candidates were expressed at high enough levels to allow purification for screening. If it were possible to express all of the 206 ligands we identified as targets, one might expect to be able to identify receptors for more than 100 of them. However, it is unclear how this might be accomplished. Second, while a positive selection strategy using CRISPRa has a higher dynamic range compared to loss-of-function screens, successful enrichment and recovery of a potential cell surface receptor PPI is dependent on the efficiency and level of CRISPRa-mediated expression of cell surface receptors. Also, many functional receptors are protein complexes and interactions might involve coreceptors or require chaperones that might not be present in K562 cells. In these cases, sgRNA-driven expression of single genes by CRISPRa would not be able to generate cells that make functional receptor complexes, unless the parental K562 cell line also made the other receptor complex components.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>New biology revealed by CRISPRa enrichment screens</title><p>The most striking finding from our screen was the identification of three new ligands for RPTPs, a diverse set of cell signaling receptors whose functions are less well understood than those of RTKs. OMG, a ligand expressed by oligodendrocytes and some neurons, binds to all three R3 RPTPs and to one of the R2B RPTPs, PTPRU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). All of these RPTPs are expressed in the brain. Most interestingly, OSTN, a hormone that regulates bone and muscle growth in rodents but has acquired brain-specific expression and function in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ataman et al., 2016</xref>), binds only to PTPRU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). OSTN was reported to be a ligand for NPR-C, which regulates the levels of natriuretic peptides, but this is unlikely to explain its function in the primate brain. PTPRU, however, is expressed in the brain and is closely related to the three other R2B RPTPs, which are homophilic adhesion molecules that regulate cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Moreover, PTPRU cannot mediate cell adhesion on its own, and is thought to lack phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hay et al., 2020</xref>), so it may have a distinct function from the other R2B RPTPs.</p><p>GAS1, a regulator of Ret signaling involved in control of cell growth and a mediator of cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cabrera et al., 2006</xref>), binds to PTPRA, an R4 RPTP that has no known ligand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). PTPRA is a ubiquitously expressed signaling protein that both positively and negatively regulates tyrosine kinase signaling via dephosphorylation of Src family tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mustelin and Hunter, 2002</xref>). GAS1 may provide a link of PTPRA to RET RTK signaling complexes.</p><p>Furthermore, we discovered an unexpected association between TAFA-2, which is known as a neurokine (brain chemokine), and KIRs, which are inhibitory MHC class I receptors that are expressed only by NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The TAFA2 gene is also expressed by T-regs and basophils, and TAFA-2 might be a soluble ligand that modulates NK signaling in response to MHC class I engagement. Furthermore, the newly discovered KIR3DL3-TAFA2 interaction may represent another intriguing way of modulating the KIR3DL3/TMIG2-HHLA2 signaling axis within the tumor microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we also found several shared interactions between the PA-TM-RING E3 ligase RNF167, pleiotrophin, and neurokine family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Most notably members of the PA-TM-E3 ligase family are RNF43 and ZNRF3 which both modulate the WNT signaling pathway by targeting FZD receptor protein homeostasis. Interestingly, both E3 ligases are regulated by the secreted WNT agonists R-spondin (RSPO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clevers and Nusse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Janda et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zebisch and Jones, 2015</xref>). Ubiquitin E3 ligases are notoriously challenging to study due to the highly transient, catalytic nature of the ubiquitylation cascade and the transmembrane PA-TM-RING E3 ligase family is no exception with the majority still being orphans and their functions unknown.</p><p>In summary, we implemented a proteo-genomic screening workflow, combining CRISPRa pooled cell surface libraries with a MACS enrichment strategy, in order to accelerate the identification of interactions between the secreted and membrane proteomes. We report new receptor-secreted ligand PPIs that are potentially involved in a wide variety of signaling processes. Implementation of cell-based screening strategies based on our approach might allow elucidation of receptor-ligand relationships for many proteins that are currently orphans, and has the potential to identify novel therapeutically relevant targets and define new biological processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Suspension cells were grown in plain bottom, vented flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific), adherent cells were grown in T25 or T75 flasks (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

For elution of positively selected cells, the column is removed from the separator (magnet) and the magnetically labeled cells are flushed into a 15 ml Falcon tube with fresh media (RPMI complete), washed once, resuspended, and transferred to a T25 culture flask for expansion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Genomic DNA extraction, library amplification, and deep sequencing</title><p>Genomic DNA was isolated using QiaAmp DNA Blood Maxi or QiaAmp DNA mini kits (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, genomic DNA was then amplified using Herculase II polymerase (Agilent) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deans et al., 2016</xref>). To prepare the sgRNA sequencing library, the integrated sgRNA-encoding constructs were PCR amplified using Agilent Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase, followed by a second PCR amplification introducing sample-specific Illumina index barcodes and adapters for deep sequencing.

K562 cells were used for pre-evaluation of potential base line binding for all secreted proteins used in the CRISPRa screening workflow. HEK293F cells were transfected using Fugene6 according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega) with expression plasmids encoding full-length proteins containing an N-terminal tag (FLAG). Two days following transfection, cultures were harvested, cells were spun down for 4 min at 1600 rpm (~400× <italic>g</italic>), washed twice with cold MACS buffer (Miltenyi) and resuspended to a final density of ~3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. To generate tetramerized secreted ligands to test for binding to cells expressing full-length proteins, FPLC-purified biotinylated proteins (see above) were incubated with streptavidin tetramers conjugated to Alexa647 Fluor (SA-647) (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 4:1 molar ratio on ice for at least 15 min. To assess cell surface expression of full-length or ECD displayed proteins, 1:200 mouse anti-FLAG-647 (CST) or anti-HA antibody (CST) staining of cells was also performed in parallel where indicated. Approximately 150,000 cells were incubated with Protein:SA-647 complexes or antibody in a final volume of 100 µl in 96-well round-bottom plates (Corning) for 1 hr at 4°C protected from light. Following incubation, cells were washed two times with 200 µl cold MACS buffer and resuspended in 200 µl cold MACS buffer with 1:3000 PI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Immunofluorescence staining was analyzed using a Cytoflex (Beckman Coulter), and data were collected for 20,000 cells. Data were analyzed using FlowJo v10.4.2 software. All data report MFI. Concentration-dependent binding of Protein:SA-647 to full-length receptor expressing, but not mock control cells, was deemed indicative of cell surface binding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>SPR experiments</title><p>SPR experiments were performed using a Biacore T100 instrument (GE Healthcare). FPLC-purified biotinylated proteins (ligands) in HBS-P+ Buffer (GE Healthcare) were captured on a Streptavidin (SA) Series S Sensor Chip (GE Healthcare). Chip capture was performed in HBS-P+ buffer (GE Healthcare) to aim for ~100–200 ligand response units (RU). Flow cell 1 was left empty to use this flow cell as a reference flow cell for online subtraction of bulk solution refractive index and for evaluation of non-specific binding of analyte to the chip surface using Biacore T100 Control Software (v3.2) (GE Healthcare). FPLC-purified non-biotinylated protein was used as analyte. Analytes were run in HBS-P+ buffer using twofold increasing protein concentrations to generate a series of sensorgrams. Binding parameters were either determined based on a 1:1 Langmuir model or at equilibrium using the accompanying Biacore T100 evaluation software. A table of all SPR conditions for each ligand-analyte pair tested including concentration range of twofold analyte dilutions, injection rate, injection and dissociation times, regeneration conditions, and meta data can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata5">Figure 2—source data 5</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Deep sequencing results for each round of selection were analyzed using the casTLE statistical framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morgens et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, casTLE compares each set of gene-targeting guides to the negative controls, using both safe-targeting and non-targeting controls and selecting the most likely maximum effect size (casTLE-Effect). A pValue is then generated, representing the significance of this maximum effect by permuting the results (n=10,000 permutation). Screening results of the final round of enrichment for each of the 20 secreted proteins were subjected to a first-pass filter using the following cut-offs: casTLE-Effect &gt; 2, casTLE-Score &gt; 2, pValue &lt; 0.05. Next, hits outside the secreted and membrane proteome and common false positive contaminants were removed. To predict high-confidence interaction pairs from each dataset, a custom score was then computed for each potential interaction pair by combining all three metrics into one ESP score: (casTLE-Effect + casTLE Score)/pValue. To integrate data analysis and visualization, we used the combined ESP score to rank sort interaction pairs for every screen and created trajectory plots to ensure positive enrichment over the three consecutive rounds of selection for the predicted hits and allows elimination of false positive candidates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Database integration</title><p>Interaction datasets were downloaded from BioGRID (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://thebiogrid.org">https://thebiogrid.org</ext-link>, 4.4.210, physical interactions), Bioplex (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu">https://bioplex.hms.harvard.edu</ext-link>, Hek293 v3.0 and HCT116 v1.0) and STRING (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://string-db.org/">https://string-db.org/</ext-link>; v11.5; physical dataset; interaction score &gt;0.4).

TCGA cancer tissue RNA-seq data was obtained from 17 cancer types representing 21 cancer subtypes and were processed as median FPKM (number fragments per kilobase of exon per million reads) and visualized as a hierarchical clustering heatmap using JMP Pro (v16). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of normalized mRNA gene expression by tissue was performed with Ward linkage and correlation distance were plotted as heatmaps using JMP Pro (v16). Tissue expression correlation analysis of normalized mRNA gene expression for candidate genes was performed using multivariate analysis tool in JMP Pro (v16) and expression correlation results were visualized as heatmaps where intense red color indicates a strong positive correlation and intense blue color indicates a strong negative correlation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec

The authors use a CRISPRa-based approach to overexpress membrane proteins in cells and then use magnetic cell sorting to identify receptors that bind candidate ligands. This approach led to the identification of several novel interaction pairs that were then validated biochemically, including receptor tyrosine phosphatase ligands and other interactions with implications for immune system function. The work is likely to be relevant to a wide variety of fields including biochemistry and signal transduction research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81398.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kruse</surname><given-names>Andrew C</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Harvard Medical School</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.06.22.497261">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.06.22.497261v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly enthusiastic about the work but raised a variety of small points for clarification which should be addressed in a revised manuscript. Some additional experiments were suggested (see reviewer 3 point 10) but reviewers agreed that this new data is not strictly essential, although it could strengthen the manuscript if it were to be added. We leave this latter decision to the authors' discretion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript is well-written and made the workflow for a complex screen easy to follow for non-specialists. The data is rigorous and includes all appropriate controls. I have only a few comments/critiques:</p><p>1) It was surprising that CD36 was identified as a receptor for 4 out of 20 ligands tested on the screen. Can the authors comment on the potential of scavenger receptors or other promiscuous binders to outcompete other top hits? Did CD36 score highly for the other 16 ligands screened?</p><p>2) The authors should speculate on why TAFA-2 would selectively bind to D0-containing KIRs. Are KIR subtypes expressed on certain subsets of tissues or cells such that this makes biological sense?</p><p>3) The identification of PTPRU as the bona fide receptor for OSTN was notable in that it was not the top hit and required trajectory analysis of the three rounds of selection. On a high-throughput basis, deep sequencing of this many samples could become quite costly. The authors should comment on whether they recommend trajectory analysis as a routine operation in hit identification, or whether it could it be possible to circumvent this by performing additional rounds of selection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) The authors should more clearly state their use of the Chong et al., 2018 method paper as the starting point for this work. That paper describes a CRISPR activation screen that included sgRNAs targeting the whole human secretome in HEK 293 cells, which is then used to query soluble biotinylated GPCRs to identify novel interactions. The current authors should elaborate on the similarities and any specific differences between their approach and the Chong paper. The current treatment appears to give the Chong paper short shrift and reduces the purported novelty of the work.</p><p>2) The authors could go into more detail regarding their selection of the 80 soluble targets for expression. Contrary to statements made, many of the targets are directly related to one another (Ex: 8/80 are angiopoietin-related proteins). Also, over half of the targets screened are primarily found in the brain, so the tissue distribution doesn't seem that broad either. The text mentions that disease associations were taken into account; however, there are no data supporting this claim.</p><p>3) Have any of the 60 query proteins that failed to express been successfully expressed using other recombinant protein systems? Did the authors consider any rescue strategies for improving recombinant expression success rates?</p><p>4) Why were K562 cells chosen for this study as opposed to using HEK 293 cells that were used in other published CRISPRa screens? Are there observed differences in the CRISPR activation efficiency between these cell lines? HEK 293 cells are well established as a model system for high protein expression, especially for secreted and membrane proteins, suggesting it might be a better choice. Were other candidate cell lines tested?</p><p>5) What fraction of the library genes are upregulated to significant levels? In the assessment of the small TM1 screen, it is claimed that all 10 of the genes showed elevated cell surface expression. However, looking at the FACS plots in Figure S1 (B), this does not seem to be accurate. CD5 and IL6ST showed no change and others exhibited very modest increases in expression. Is this level of expression sufficient to identify known ligands of these proteins (e.g., weak binders)? This information would help to assess the robustness of this approach and how consistently it identifies targets with a range of different expression levels and different binding affinities.</p><p>6) The IL-2/CD25 test demonstrates that the TM1 screen can efficiently identify a high affinity (Kd ~10-8) interaction with high confidence. However, several of the interactions identified have affinities in the range of 10-6 or lower. The authors should consider running control screens against the full TM1 and TM2 libraries using soluble queries (CD80, CD200, etc.) that bind known receptors with μM affinities. These controls would help evaluate how well this approach identifies established, biologically relevant, low-affinity interactions.</p><p>7) In some of the screens (e.g., OMG, GAS1) other genes also show high ESP scores. Were any of the second or third highest scoring &quot;hits&quot; characterized further for potential enrichment in subsequent rounds of screening? The scale of the ESP plots also changes significantly depending on the screen. In the original Chong et al., paper, only one round of enrichment was used and all of the ERA plots are set to the same scale. They used a larger library and clearly demonstrated to ability to identify known weak interactions. Do multiple rounds of enrichment increase the potential for amplifying screening artifacts/nonspecific/nonrelevant interactions? The scoring scheme is also slightly different from Chong et al., making it difficult to directly compare the two studies.</p><p>8) In the OSTN screen no enrichment of PTPRU was observed until 3 rounds of selection, even though the measured affinity is higher than that determined for the OMG/PTPRU interaction. Is there an explanation as to why that was the case? The overall level of enrichment also seems lower. There is also a target gene (red dot) in Figure 3G between PTPRJ and PTPRU. Is there a strong correlation between rounds of enrichment and Kd? What is the identity of that target and what was its trajectory during the 3 rounds of enrichment?</p><p>9) For the SPR experiments, many of the runs required high analyte protein concentrations (80uM for TAFA2, 60uM for OMG). Are the authors confident that the proteins used for SPR were not forming soluble aggregates at the highest analyte concentrations used for binding? Soluble aggregates notoriously bind nonspecifically and can mimic low-affinity interactions.</p><p>10) For the cell binding experiments, negative control tetramer titrations should also be performed using a tetramerized protein not expected to bind. Also, the cell binding titrations do not saturate and the binding only appears statistically significant from controls at the highest concentrations used. Do the reciprocal cell experiments also show binding? These data would benefit from the inclusion of representative FACS plots and a description of the gating strategy used.</p><p>11) There are target genes (red dots) with relatively high ERA scores in the TM2+ screens that are not CD36 (For example in the NRN1L, TICN1, SCRG1, and MK screens). What are these targets and was binding further characterized for any of them? As CD36 seems to act as a scavenger receptor, are there sequence similarities or other shared characteristics between the receptors CD36 interacts with?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81398.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This manuscript is well-written and made the workflow for a complex screen easy to follow for non-specialists.

We are delighted that this reviewer described our screening method as of “immediate scientific interest given the growing need to identify receptors for orphan ligands”, “powerful new tool for ligand deorphanization in the extracellular space”. We address his/her specific criticisms below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) It was surprising that CD36 was identified as a receptor for 4 out of 20 ligands tested on the screen.

Since the screening platform is based on a bead based enrichment workflow using MACS (Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting) it is of course always a possibility that one early round binder might outcompete other low affinity binders.</p><p>CD36 only specifically enriched for 6 secreted ligands: LY6H, KRTDAP, NRN1, NRN1L, VWC2L and SCRG1. We tested 4 secreted ligands (LY6H, NRN1, VWC2L, SCRG1) against CD36 with 1 screen (SPRC) that did not show any enrichment, that was used as a negative control for the cell surface tetramer staining in addition to non CD36 transduced cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors should speculate on why TAFA-2 would selectively bind to D0-containing KIRs. Are KIR subtypes expressed on certain subsets of tissues or cells such that this makes biological sense?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s interest in the newly discovery interaction between TAFA2 and certain members of the D0 domain containing inhibitory KIR receptor family. We share the enthusiasm of this interaction in the greater context of HHLA2 and HLA and added HHLA2 as a point of interest in the Result and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The identification of PTPRU as the bona fide receptor for OSTN was notable in that it was not the top hit and required trajectory analysis of the three rounds of selection.

For future screens, a trajectory score could be considered as a useful metric. In our experience with this study and other screens, additional rounds of selections did not improve beyond three rounds of selections, at this point the CRISPRa libraries were usually depleted, and further screening only resulted in increased false positive binders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) The authors should more clearly state their use of the Chong et al., 2018 method paper as the starting point for this work.

The current treatment appears to give the Chong paper short shrift and reduces the purported novelty of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments. However, we would like to point out that we did not use the MS2-p65-HSF1 transcriptional activator platform that was described in Gavin Wright’s elegant study to screen interactions between cell surface receptors using receptor ECDs by FACS sorting (Chong et al., 2018). In the study presented here, we focused on interactions between the secreted and membrane proteome and used the SunTag system developed in Ron Vale’s lab (Tanenbaum et al., 2014) and was then adapted by Jonathan Weissman’s group for CRISPRa termed sunCas9 (Gilbert et al., 2014; Horlbeck et al., 2016). Since we planned on screening a large number of secreted ligands, we developed a MACS based enrichment workflow to screen many ligands in parallel without special instrumentation.</p><p>A large number of different CRISPRa transcriptional activator systems are currently in use and a direct comparison of different 2<sup>nd</sup> generation systems showed that VPR, SunTag, and SAM approaches perform equally effective across a number of different cell lines (Chavez et al., 2016; Kampmann, 2018). To better describe the rationale, we refined the text sections in the main text accordingly:</p><p>“To address these issues, several groups have successfully developed cell-based screens for phenotypical screens (Bassik et al., 2013; Han et al., 2020; Kamber et al., 2021), uncovering signaling cascades (Breslow et al., 2018; Wisnovsky et al., 2021) or to study interactions between cell surface receptors using receptor ECDs (extracellular domains) (Chong et al., 2018), that take advantage of CRISPR technology (Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). In CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screens such as the one described here, gene expression is induced by targeting transcriptional activators (Chavez et al., 2016; Chong et al., 2018; Tycko et al., 2017) to their control elements using sgRNAs (Kampmann, 2018; Morgens et al., 2016; Tanenbaum et al., 2014).</p><p>“A large variety of different 2nd generation dCas9 activator (CRISPRa) systems are currently in use. A recent study directly compared a large number of published Cas9 activators systems and found the VPR, SunTag, and SAM approaches perform equally effective across a number of different cell lines and target genes (Chavez et al., 2016; Kampmann, 2018b). The SunTag system was initially developed in K562 cells (myeloid leukemia cell line K562) (Tanenbaum et al., 2014b), a highly characterized (ENCODE, The Protein Atlas) and easy to handle suspension cell line that is widely used for CRISPR screens and highly suitable for MACS (Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting) based applications.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors could go into more detail regarding their selection of the 80 soluble targets for expression.

Details with regard to the selection of the 80 secreted targets can be found in the Result section “Selection and production of secreted proteins for CRISPRa screening.”, where we outlined the selection workflow. We agree with the reviewer’s comment with regard to the tissue mRNA expression distribution and refined this section accordingly to address this point:</p><p>“From these 206, we ultimately selected a total of 80 high priority targets (one per gene; we did not consider isoforms generated through alternative splicing). These had a wide range of tissue expression with many of the chosen secreted ligands being expressed in brain tissue (Figure 2A) covering a broad range of molecular function and processes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B).”</p><p>In addition, we added two panels to Figure 2 that include cancer related mRNA expression data (TCGA) (Figure 2B) and gene disease association data (GDA) (Figure 2C) for the 20 candidates that were ultimately used in the screening workflow. A GDA related cytoscape network was visualized in Figure 2—figure supplement 4A and the full GDA data for all of the 20 candidates was included in Figure 2-source data 3 and a fully annotated node/edge GDA network in cytoscape (Figure 2-source data 3.cys). To reflect the additional panels we refined the text section accordingly:</p><p>“The 20 high priority targets show a wide spectrum of tissue expression in normal, healthy tissue (Figure 2A) and a broad range of expression in cancer (Figure 2B) with several candidates enriched in brain tissue and clustering in Glioma (GBM, brain tissue and in various locations in the nervous system, including the brain stem and spinal column). In addition, the majority of targets show a strong gene disease association (GDA) with many reported diseases (Figure 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, Figure 2-source data 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Have any of the 60 query proteins that failed to express been successfully expressed using other recombinant protein systems? Did the authors consider any rescue strategies for improving recombinant expression success rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s question with regard to rescuing some of the secreted ligands by using an alternative expression system. We did in fact explore whether insect expression could serve as viable alternative expression strategy to rescue some of the secreted ligands that failed to express in the Expi293F expression system. To test this strategy we selected a total of 12 candidates that were subcloned for expression in insect cells (HI5): 10 candidates that showed no expression in the Expi293F expression system (PODN_HUMAN ,NOE1_HUMAN ,MYOC_HUMAN ,NPTX1_HUMAN ,ITGBL_HUMAN ,FGFP2_HUMAN ,CCBE1_HUMAN ,ANGL7_HUMAN ,ANGL3_HUMAN ,ANGL1_HUMAN) and an additional 2 candidates that were previously successfully expressed in Expi293F (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN). While the 2 (CC134_HUMAN; SPRC_HUMAN) control candidates showed some low level of expression in Hi5, none of the other 10 candidates showed any positive expression in insect cells. We included the alternative approach in the Results section and updated Figure 2-source data 2 to include the expression data for Expi293F and insect expression data accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Why were K562 cells chosen for this study as opposed to using HEK 293 cells that were used in other published CRISPRa screens?

In addition, we added the anti-CD122 antibody staining panel and an Isotype control staining panel to Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and added the missing color legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The IL-2/CD25 test demonstrates that the TM1 screen can efficiently identify a high affinity (Kd ~10-8) interaction with high confidence.

Since CD80 or CD200 are members of the single transmembrane receptor superfamily and not secreted ligands, we felt it would be more in the general reader’s interest to see a benchmark screen with a real secreted ligand instead of receptor ECD (extracellular domain) based benchmarking of the libraries. However, we agree with the reviewer that in addition to screening orphan secreted ligands, our screening workflow could easily be adopted to screen for orphan transmembrane receptor protein-protein interactions using their respective receptor ECD’s (extracellular domains) including CD80 or CD200 among others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In some of the screens (e.g., OMG, GAS1) other genes also show high ESP scores.

Do multiple rounds of enrichment increase the potential for amplifying screening artifacts/nonspecific/nonrelevant interactions? The scoring scheme is also slightly different from Chong et al., making it difficult to directly compare the two studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments and agree that unless both studies would employ the exact same baits, dCas9 transactivation system, library design, gRNA sequences, cell line, screening workflow and statistical analysis, a direct side by side comparison of screening results and metrics from both strategies is very difficult. Regarding plots with either linear or log10 scale ESP, we tried to visualize the results of the casTLE statistical analysis as best as possible. In cases where we compared several candidate genes in trajectory plots, the scale was only changes to improve visualization for the reader.</p><p>In several screens presented here, other candidates that showed enrichment or where the result of a phylogenetic homology analysis were tested. In the GAS1 screen we tested interactions of PTPRA, PTPRU and PTPRJ by SPR. For the OMG and OSTN screen, we tested a panel of 8 PTPR sub family members by SPR. For the TAFA-2 screen, the top 3 tanking hits (KIR3DL1, KIR3DL3 and RNF167) were tested. For the PTN, MK, TAFA-2 and TAFA-5 screen several shared hits were tested. Additional SPR results were included in the supporting Supplemental figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A+C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A+B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A+B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A+B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) In the OSTN screen no enrichment of PTPRU was observed until 3 rounds of selection, even though the measured affinity is higher than that determined for the OMG/PTPRU interaction.

Is there a strong correlation between rounds of enrichment and Kd? What is the identity of that target and what was its trajectory during the 3 rounds of enrichment?</p></disp-quote><p>Since the screening platform is based on a bead based enrichment workflow using MACS (Magnetic-Activated Cell Sorting) we have the advantage to follow the enrichment of a candidate over the rounds of selections after deep sequencing and analysis for the different rounds. However, multiple factors might contribute to levels of enrichment e.g. level of activation, gRNA usage, fitness, number of binders, among others and might not reflect the actual affinity of a ligand to it’s receptor or molecular function. In cases where several binders where observed they might compete with each other during the enrichment workflow in earlier rounds while in other cases where there is only one binder, it outcompetes non-binders in earlier rounds of the selection. In general, we did not observe a clear correlation between enrichment and measured affinity. Figures were refined to include annotations for additional hits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) For the SPR experiments, many of the runs required high analyte protein concentrations (80uM for TAFA2, 60uM for OMG). Are the authors confident that the proteins used for SPR were not forming soluble aggregates at the highest analyte concentrations used for binding? Soluble aggregates notoriously bind nonspecifically and can mimic low-affinity interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>To detect interactions in the μm affinity range as observed for some of the hits a 10x concentration over Kd is necessary for SPR. It is possible that soluble aggregates could bind, and we cannot be sure that these do not exist in our preparations. However, as the reviewer might appreciate, we included sensograms of non binding candidates for the indicated screens in the supplemental to show specificity of the positive binders (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A+C, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A+B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A+B, Figure 6—figure supplement 1A+B). Furthermore, to validate the results, SPR is backed up by cell surface staining, which should not be subject to artifacts produced by soluble aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) For the cell binding experiments, negative control tetramer titrations should also be performed using a tetramerized protein not expected to bind. Also, the cell binding titrations do not saturate and the binding only appears statistically significant from controls at the highest concentrations used. Do the reciprocal cell experiments also show binding? These data would benefit from the inclusion of representative FACS plots and a description of the gating strategy used.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ question and would like to direct the reviewer’s attention to Figure 7B/C, where we used SA647:SPRC tetramers to show that a screen not enriched for CD36 also shows no binding to CD36 expressing cells. In general, cell surface staining assays were performed in transduced and non-transduced cells and SA647:Biotin was used as a unrelated negative control. In addition we included sensograms of non binding candidates for the indicated screens in the supplemental to show specificity of the positive binders (see also response 9).</p><p>Reciprocal binding assays were considered but due to the fact that the baits are secreted ligands, they would be secreted into the media and detection by tetramer cell surface staining rendered unfeasible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) There are target genes (red dots) with relatively high ERA scores in the TM2+ screens that are not CD36 (For example in the NRN1L, TICN1, SCRG1, and MK screens). What are these targets and was binding further characterized for any of them? As CD36 seems to act as a scavenger receptor, are there sequence similarities or other shared characteristics between the receptors CD36 interacts with?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for observations and questions, we refined Figure 7A accordingly by adding annotations for the following screens: LY6H, NRN1L, MYOC, TICN1, SCRG1, OMG and MK. As the reviewer will appreciate the 2<sup>nd</sup> top scoring hit for the aforementioned screens generally scored thousands of ESP units lower than the top hit e.g., in the LY6H screen CD36 scored at ESP=441.000 ESP while the 2<sup>nd</sup> best hit CMTM5 scored at ESP: 81.500. The fold change difference between the 1<sup>st</sup> (CD36) and 2<sup>nd</sup> highest scoring hit generally ranges between 2 to 10 fold changes, we therefore focused our analysis on the top scoring ESP candidate to predict high-confidence interaction pairs from each dataset. In addition, the top scoring candidate for TICN1, OMG and MK was identified asTMEM14A. While TMEM14A was annotated as multi-pass membrane protein with 3 transmembrane helices, it appears to be mainly localized to ER and mitochondrial membranes and was therefore not further considered. We added the annotations and changed the text section accordingly.</p><p>Furthermore, to explore potential functional relationships between CD36 as the top scoring hit and its baits, we added a phylogenetic homology analysis calculated from a multiple sequence alignment of the CD36 enriched screens (Figure 7E) and updated the text section accordingly:</p><p>“A phylogenetic homology analysis of all screens enriched for CD36 shows that VWC2L, LY6H, NRN1, NRN1L and to some extend SCRG1 are mor closely related to each other by sequence than KRTDAP (Figure 7E).”</p><p>We would also like to direct the reviewer to the result section “The Scavenger Receptor CD36 acts as a receptor for a broad range of secreted ligands.”, where we performed a hierarchical clustering analysis (Figure 7D) and a multivariate correlation analysis (Figure 7E) as indicated to provide potential gene expression connectivity:</p><p>“Similarly, a multivariate analysis depicts a strong correlation of all secreted ligand with the exception of KRTDAP and CD36 itself (Figure 7F) in normal tissue. However, CD36 protein is expressed in brain microglia, and interestingly CD36-mediated debris uptake regulates brain inflammation in neurodegenerative disease models (Dobri et al., 2021; Grajchen et al., 2020).”</p><p>References</p><p>Chong ZS, Ohnishi S, Yusa K, Wright GJ. 2018.
