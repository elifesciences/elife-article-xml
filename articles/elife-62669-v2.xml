However, the identification of individual, causal regulatory variants is challenging. Here, we used a massively parallel reporter assay to measure the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory consequences of 5832 natural DNA variants in the promoters of 2503 genes in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We identified 451 causal variants, which underlie genetic loci known to affect gene expression. Several promoters harbored multiple causal variants. In five promoters, pairs of variants showed non-additive, epistatic interactions. Causal variants were enriched at conserved nucleotides, tended to have low derived allele frequency, and were depleted from promoters of essential genes, which is consistent with the action of negative selection. Causal variants were also enriched for alterations in transcription factor binding sites. Models integrating these features provided modest, but statistically significant, ability to predict causal variants. This work revealed a complex molecular basis for <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory variation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>eQTL</kwd><kwd>genetic variation</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM124676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Frank Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruglyak</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Frank Wolfgang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Collectively, these variants contribute to variation in many phenotypic traits by altering the expression of one or multiple genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Albert and Kruglyak, 2015</xref>). The presence of individual DNA variants that alter gene expression can be detected by mapping genomic regions called ‘expression quantitative trait loci’ (eQTLs). Among these, ‘local’ eQTLs are located close to or in the gene whose expression they influence. Eukaryotic species ranging from yeast to human carry large amounts of local regulatory variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brem et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hasin-Brumshtein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heyne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rockman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Stranger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">West et al., 2007</xref>). In human populations, most genes are affected by one or multiple local eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">GTEx Consortium et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, in a cross between two genetically different yeast isolates, 74% of genes are influenced by local eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). Most of these local eQTLs arise from DNA variants that perturb <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ronald et al., 2005</xref>). When such <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants are located in a gene’s transcribed region, they may alter mRNA stability, splicing, polyadenylation, or regulation by RNA-binding proteins. <italic>Cis</italic>-acting variants in promoters or enhancers may alter the transcription of their target genes.</p><p>As a consequence of genetic linkage in experimental crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>) and linkage disequilibrium in outbred populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">GTEx Consortium et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kita et al., 2017</xref>), regions mapped as eQTLs almost always contain multiple sequence variants. Typically, it is assumed that most of these variants have no effect, obscuring the identity of one or a few causal variants in each eQTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although the causal variants in several local eQTLs have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Claussnitzer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lutz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Musunuru et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ronald et al., 2005</xref>), most causal variants remain unknown. Because of this lack of systematic information, many questions about local eQTLs remain open, including whether local eQTLs are typically caused by one or multiple variants, if multiple variants interact in a non-additive fashion, what evolutionary forces act on causal variants, which molecular mechanisms causal variants perturb, and whether it may ultimately be possible to combine the answers to these questions to construct models that can predict the consequences of regulatory variants from genome sequence.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of MPRA design.</title><p>At the top, two native genes in the genome with multiple promoter variants (stars) are shown.

Note that in Protocol 1, the PCR step can exponentially amplify only cDNA but not plasmid molecules that may have escaped DNA degradation during RNA extraction because both PCR primers bind to overhangs added in the previous steps. If, during the single extension step, ‘common_ORF_v4’ uses plasmid DNA as a template, the product lacks the p5 overhang, which contains the binding site for ‘Illumina_PCR_R’. Conversely, if during single extension, ‘RT_PCR_R_long’ (which is still present in the reaction) primes off a plasmid molecule, the product lacks the p7 overhang required by ‘RT_PCR_D7xx_F’. In protocol 2, the primers ‘common_ORF_v2’ and ‘RT_PCRPD7xx_F’ are replaced by primers ‘RT_PCR_F_long_D7xx’. These primers permit direct amplification from plasmids and from first strand cDNA but require multiple long primers for multiplexing and provide less protection against inadvertent plasmid amplification.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62669-fig1-figsupp6-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s7" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 7.</label><caption><title>Reproducibility of oligo expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlations of expression driven by oligos among replicates in the TSS library.

These significant variants also agreed well in the direction of variant effect, that is whether the RM allele drives higher or lower expression than the BY allele (FET: p=0.007, OR = 6.1). Second, 527 variants were assayed in both the TSS and the Upstream libraries, where they were embedded in oligos that had the same strand orientation but differed in the exact window of DNA surrounding each variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Among these, variants that were significant in at least one library were likely to also be significant in the other (FET p=0.007, OR = 4), with significant directional agreement (FET p=0.046, OR = 2.9).

Specifically, we turned to local eQTLs mapped in 1012 recombinant individuals obtained by crossing BY and RM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). Because of genetic linkage in the cross, the effects of neighboring variants create one aggregated, spread-out signal of local variation at each gene. For 2884 genes, these effects were strong enough to be detected as local eQTLs at genome-wide significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). We asked to what extent these local eQTLs can be explained by individual causal variants identified here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Initially, we considered all 2300 genes with available data from both the cross and the MPRA, irrespective of whether their local effect had reached significance in the cross. Likewise, we summed the MPRA effects of all assayed variants for a given gene, irrespective of their significance. There was a significant correlation between local eQTL effects and summed MPRA effects (rho = 0.1, p=1e-6). This overall correlation is likely degraded by noise in both datasets, in particular for small, non-significant effects. Therefore, we first restricted our analyses to variants with significant (5% FDR) MPRA effects. The summed effects of these significant variants showed a stronger correlation with eQTL effects than did those of all variants (rho = 0.24, p=5e-6). Next, to also avoid noise in the eQTL effect estimates, we further restricted the comparison to the 238 genes with strong local eQTLs—those with a LOD score of at least 50. This filter again improved the correlation with summed significant MPRA effects (rho = 0.47, p=2e-5). Allele-specific expression in diploid hybrids provides an independent estimate of the aggregated effect of all <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants that affect a given gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Emerson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ronald et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wittkopp et al., 2004</xref>).

For example, we detected two variants located 47 bases apart in the promoter of the <italic>UFO1</italic> gene that had effects of similar magnitude but in opposite direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>UFO1</italic> does not have a significant local eQTL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that this gene is influenced by two variants whose effects cancel each other out.</p><p>Together, these observations suggest that the molecular basis of local eQTLs spans a range of scenarios. Some local eQTLs are due to single causal variants, while others arise from joint effects of multiple causal variants. When multiple variants have effects in the same direction, they sum to create a stronger eQTL. When their effects are in the opposite directions, they may be invisible in a cross.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The effects of individual variants may be influenced by nucleosome binding</title><p>Our plasmid-based MPRA tested variants in a molecular context that differs from the native genomic context in two respects: in the DNA sequence beyond that present on the oligos and, potentially, in the chromatin state in which each variant is embedded. Specifically, nucleosomes influence gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Han and Grunstein, 1988</xref>), and may mask or otherwise alter the effects of variants they bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rando and Winston, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). We asked whether the effects of variants located in nucleosome-free regions in the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>) were better captured by our MPRA than those of nucleosome-bound variants. Indeed, the summed effects of significant variants in nucleosome-free regions correlated better with strong local eQTLs than those of nucleosome-bound variants, which showed no significant correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). A similar difference was seen for the single most significant MPRA variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This better agreement between the genome and the MPRA for the effects of variants in nucleosome-free regions would be expected if these variants are also not bound by nucleosomes on the plasmids, and are thus exposed to a molecular environment that resembles that in the genome. More broadly, this result suggests that nucleosome occupancy and chromatin state may alter the regulatory effects of genomic variants, consistent with MPRAs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Inoue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Maricque et al., 2019</xref>) and with the fact that many human local eQTLs vary among tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">GTEx Consortium et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Yao et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Non-additive interactions among promoter variants</title><p>The presence of multiple causal variants in single promoters raises the question of whether these variants have independent, additive effects or if the effects of some variants are modulated by the presence of the other variant(s) in a non-additive, epistatic interaction. To address this question, we made use of the fact that the TSS library included 342 variant pairs for which there were oligos representing all four combinations of the two alleles at the two variants. For each such variant pair, we tested whether the joint effect of both variants differed from the sum of their individual effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>There were five variant pairs that showed evidence for non-additive effects at an FDR of ≤ 20%. While the π<sub>1</sub> statistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Storey and Tibshirani, 2003</xref>) suggested that at least 34% of variant pairs have non-additive effects, the majority of these cases could not be detected at individual significance, presumably due to limited statistical power.</p><p>The five significant pairs showed a range of epistatic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

RM carries a derived allele at each of these variants, indicated by the fact that the BY alleles are present in a strain from the Taiwanese clade of yeast isolates, which split early from other isolates (including BY and RM) during <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Peter et al., 2018</xref>). Both derived alleles are found at high and nearly identical frequencies in the yeast population (~74%), and the two variants, which are separated by only two nucleotides, show very high linkage disequilibrium (D’=0.999, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.99). Thus, these two epistatic variants form a tightly linked haplotype that increases gene expression only when both RM alleles are present, perhaps because both variants are needed to create a binding site for a transcriptional activator.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Epistasis among promoter variants.</title><p>Each panel shows, for one gene, MPRA expression driven by four oligos with the indicated combination of BY and RM alleles at the two variants.

These results suggest that a common promoter variant reduces the expression of <italic>RTT101</italic>.

To address this question, we assembled a set of 2998 features describing each variant.

For variants located in divergent promoters that were assayed in both orientations, the results from the two orientations were considered separately. For this reason, the number of causal variants in these analyses was slightly higher than the 451 unique variants reported above. We used logistic regression to test the association of each feature with variant causality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

Variants in the promoters of essential genes were less likely to be causal (FDR = 6%). Causal variants were also less likely to occur in promoters of genes with many synthetic genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), which tends to be a property of essential genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>).

The observation that natural variants in promoters of essential genes are less likely to perturb gene expression is consistent with negative selection acting to purge causal variants from essential gene promoters. In further support of this hypothesis, causal variants had lower derived allele frequencies than non-causal variants (FDR = 10%), as expected if negative selection prevents variants that affect gene expression from rising to higher frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ronald and Akey, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Causal variants alter predicted transcription factor binding</title><p>Gene expression is shaped by chromatin state as well as by the binding of TFs to <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rando and Winston, 2012</xref>). Previous work suggested that while <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs can perturb multiple aspects of chromatin, these molecular changes tend to ultimately be caused by sequence-directed differences in TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Degner et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kasowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kilpinen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McVicker et al., 2013</xref>). To explore the influence of single causal variants on TF binding, we computed the expected propensity of each of 196 TFs to bind to the two alleles at each variant. Because some TFs have different affinities for the two DNA strands at their binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>), we separately considered binding to the sense and the antisense strand, as well as in a strand-agnostic manner. TFs bind to individual ‘strong’ sites that closely match their motif, as well as to weaker sites with imperfect motif matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>). To capture this distinction, we computed separate feature sets that considered only strong or only weak binding sites. These analyses cannot disambiguate sharing of similar binding motifs by different TFs but probe the overall role of perturbed TF binding in variant causality. Finally, we also aggregated the 196 TF-specific feature sets into summary features that reported maximum and average allelic differences at each variant across the 196 TFs (Materials and methods).</p><p>Overall, TF binding was strongly and broadly associated with variant causality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Across the 2,940 TF-specific features, 481 features for 139 distinct TFs showed significant associations at an FDR of 5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). All of the 27 summary features were significant at this threshold. For example, causal variants were more likely to result in gains or losses of strong binding sites (62%; n = 286) than non-causal variants (49%; n = 1,846; FET p=6e-8). These associations were found on both DNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>Causality was associated with differences in strong as well as weak TF binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). While yeast promoters harbor relatively few strong binding sites, they contain many binding sites that are individually weak but that in combination greatly influence promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>). In our logistic regression analyses of the 196 individual TFs, differences in the various weak TF-binding metrics showed stronger associations with causality than those in the strong TF-binding metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Because of the relatively low density of strong binding sites, many natural variants change no or only a small number of these sites. In contrast, the high density of weak binding sites presents a large mutational target, such that essentially every variant perturbs one or more weak binding sites. Evidently, these subtle differences can result in detectable expression changes. Overall, these analyses provided clear evidence that variants predicted to perturb TF binding are more likely to alter gene expression than variants not predicted to do so.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Prediction of causal variants</title><p>The prediction of the effects of individual variants in a given genome is a major challenge for modern genetics and genomics.

We tested whether this model was capable of predicting individual variant effects in our data. Using the DNA sequence centered on each variant in our library as input, we predicted reporter gene expression driven by each oligo in our libraries. These predicted expression values showed a significant correlation with measured expression in our MPRA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We then computed the predicted fold change of each variant as the difference between the predicted expression for the respective BY and RM oligos. The predicted and measured fold-changes of all variants correlated significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This correlation increased for variants that were causal in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), although this subset would be unknown during variant effect prediction from genome sequence alone. When we ignored the direction of the fold-changes, prediction performance was reduced for all variants (rho = 0.09, p=1e-8), and degraded completely for causal variants (rho = 0, p=0.9). This suggests that much of the ability of this independent model to predict variant effects in our data derives from the model’s ability to correctly capture whether altered binding of individual transcription factors to a given allele increases or decreases expression.</p><p>In summary, models based on individual features trained on our variant effects, as well as a completely independent model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>), showed similar ability to predict variant effects from DNA sequence.

These significant variants reflected the effects of known local eQTLs, suggesting that we have identified causal variants that underlie natural regulatory variation. Several insights emerged from in-depth analysis of these causal variants.</p><p>First, the molecular basis of local eQTLs can include single (as for <italic>OLE1</italic>) or multiple (as for <italic>CWP1</italic>) causal variants. Studies seeking to identify the molecular basis of QTL regions often implicitly assume that each QTL is driven by a single causal variant. However, efforts to fine-map QTLs for organismal traits often find that multiple, linked causal variants exist in a region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Kroymann and Mitchell-Olds, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sinha et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Steinmetz et al., 2002</xref>). Whether multiple variants also underlie QTLs for molecular traits such as gene expression was less clear, especially for local eQTLs in yeast, given the small mutational target size of the compact regulatory regions. Our results show that the molecular basis of local regulatory variation can involve multiple causal variants even in a single pair of yeast strains.</p><p>In some promoter regions (as for <italic>UFO1</italic>), we detected variants with effects in opposing directions that cancelled each other out, resulting in no local eQTL signal, demonstrating that QTL mapping can miss linked causal variants of opposite effect. Similarly, recent work has shown that the number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci affecting gene expression throughout the genome may have been greatly underestimated due to linkage in experimental crosses with limited recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Metzger and Wittkopp, 2019</xref>). These results paint an emerging picture of a highly polygenic architecture of gene expression variation, with dozens of <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brion et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Metzger and Wittkopp, 2019</xref>), each of which may harbor multiple causal variants.</p><p>Second, we detected several instances of non-additive epistatic interactions between variants in the same promoter. Previous work revealed epistatic eQTL pairs that influence the expression of a given gene, including between <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs as well as between <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brem et al., 2005</xref>). Very few of these cases have been resolved to individual variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Brem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lutz et al., 2019</xref>). Our results show that there can also be epistasis between multiple causal variants within a single local eQTL. Nevertheless, most of our assayed variant pairs act additively. Even for pairs with the most significant epistasis, the quantitative departures from additivity tended to be small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> &amp;S10). This result is consistent with searches for epistatic QTLs for various growth traits in this cross. Although examples of higher-order epistatic interactions with profound effects on some traits have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Forsberg et al., 2017</xref>), most of the hundreds of detected epistatic pairs involve small deviations from additivity that account for minuscule fractions of phenotypic variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloom et al., 2015</xref>), as expected from quantitative genetic theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hill et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Third, <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants showed signals of evolving under negative selection, in that the derived alleles of causal variants tended to have reduced population frequencies and were less likely to be found in the promoters of essential genes. Similar results reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Signor and Nuzhdin, 2018</xref> have been reported in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kita et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ronald and Akey, 2007</xref>), plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Josephs et al., 2015</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battle et al., 2014</xref>), but were based on studies in crosses subject to linkage among neighboring variants, or in natural populations subject to both linkage disequilibrium and differences in statistical power for variants with different population frequencies. Our MPRA results are free from confounding effects of linkage and population frequency and extend the observation of negative selection to single, causal <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants.</p><p>Fourth, causal variants were enriched for sequence changes that altered predicted transcription factor binding. This enrichment was present for strong binding sites, as well as weak sites that do not pass strict binding site detection thresholds. Emerging evidence suggests that in addition to strong, high-affinity binding sites, intergenic DNA harbors an abundance of weak, low-affinity binding sites with imperfect motif matches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tanay, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wunderlich and Mirny, 2009</xref>). This latter group provides a larger mutational target than the few strong exact motif matches. As a consequence, almost every natural variant may perturb one or multiple weak binding sites. The joint effects of perturbations to weak sites could further contribute to molecular architectures in which several causal variants shape the overall activity of a given promoter in a given individual. While more work is needed to explore the consequences of alterations to weak binding sites, they may also help explain why many inferred causal variants in human diseases are located close to, but do not obviously change, recognizable TF motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Farh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Our approach had several limitations. First, not all potential <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants were assayed in our libraries, including roughly half of intergenic variants as well as variants in gene regions such as the most proximal bases of the core promoter, the gene body, the 3’UTR, and the terminator. Future work with dedicated libraries to study these variants will likely reveal many additional causal effects. Meanwhile, the concordance of our results with local eQTLs suggests that we have discovered a non-trivial fraction of causal variants, and that, by extension, many <italic>cis</italic>-acting variants do indeed reside in promoter regions. Second, causal variants typically have small effects on gene expression, necessitating replicate assays to ensure high statistical power. Higher levels of replication, as well as further optimization of assay design, are likely to improve variant detection and effect quantification. Finally, our plasmid-bound assay cannot capture the full chromatin state of variants in the genome. Nevertheless, our causal variants correlated with local eQTL effects measured in the native genomic context, showing that chromatin state does not override the effects of all variants. This agreement was stronger for variants that reside in nucleosome-free regions than for nucleosome-bound variants. If nucleosomes do not form on the plasmids, such regulatory variants may be exposed to a regulatory environment similar to that in the genome. More broadly, the precise chromatin context in which a variant is embedded likely influences its exact effect on gene expression, consistent with the considerable differences revealed by MPRAs inserted at different sites in the human genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Maricque et al., 2019</xref>), as well as with the high degree of tissue-specificity of human <italic>cis</italic>-eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">GTEx Consortium et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The prediction of the consequences of individual DNA variants is a major area of research, especially given that accurate predictions could aid discovery of disease-causing mechanisms and diagnosis of individual patients with unknown genetic disorders. As a consequence, a plethora of computational methods aiming to predict the severity or molecular consequences of individual variants has been developed (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kircher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhou and Troyanskaya, 2015</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Nishizaki and Boyle, 2017</xref>). Although our models integrating various features to predict the identity and effect size of causal variants performed better than chance, no single feature and no simple combination of features achieved high prediction accuracy. While the size of our dataset, which included several hundred causal variants, may be insufficient to train predictors with better performance, an independent model trained on millions of DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>) and applied to our data performed similarly. Our prediction accuracies are also comparable to those obtained from state-of-the-art machine-learning tools applied to human MPRA data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kircher et al., 2019</xref>) and to simulated genetic architectures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). Clearly, prediction of variant effects remains a challenging problem even in comparatively simple yeast promoters. Models trained in a range of environmental conditions, which would provide variation in chromatin contexts, as well as on MPRA data with longer and more diverse flanking sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kircher et al., 2019</xref>) may further improve predictive accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BY4741</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref> (doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.35471">10.7554/eLife.35471</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">RCP83 plasmid</td><td valign="top">This paper; (Addgene plasmid #163466)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Plasmid backbone</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">SurePrint Oligonucleotide Libraries</td><td valign="top">Agilent</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Custom DNA oligo library</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Aequorea victoria</italic>)</td><td valign="top">yEGFP</td><td valign="top">pKT0127 (Addgene plasmid #8728)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Reporter gene</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R version 3.5.0</td><td valign="top"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Data analysis</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>MPRA design and analysis code generated for this paper is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/frankwalbert/promoterVariants">https://github.com/frankwalbert/promoterVariants </ext-link>(copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:e9626267bba430e5ba9d045629260763ff262441;origin=https://github.com/frankwalbert/promoterVariants;visit=swh:1:snp:3b5aa5fe84982530521c07efc43f79ef4b4fb634;anchor=swh:1:rev:fb7e232981f63281d944ccf273fdafa24ac2272d/">swh:1:rev:fb7e232981f63281d944ccf273fdafa24ac2272d</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albert, 2020</xref>). Unless otherwise specified, analyses were performed in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org">https://www.r-project.org</ext-link>), using various packages from the tidyverse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/index.html">https://tidyverse.tidyverse.org/index.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wickham et al., 2019</xref>) and Bioconductor (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioconductor.org">https://www.bioconductor.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huber et al., 2015</xref>).

Because the BY strain is nearly identical to the genome reference strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Engel et al., 2014</xref>), RM alleles are by definition ‘alternative’ alleles. Variants close to the telomeres were excluded as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2014b</xref>. Variants included SNVs and short indels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). When multiple alternative alleles were reported for a variant, we used the alternative allele with the highest likelihood. We obtained gene annotations for the sacCer3 yeast reference genome build from SGD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.yeastgenome.org">https://www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cherry et al., 2012</xref>). Coding genes, as well as tRNAs, snoRNAs, snRNAs, and other non-coding RNAs were included in the design. Noncoding genes that overlapped a coding gene were removed, along with genes on the mitochondrial and 2µ plasmid genomes.</p><p>We defined transcription start sites based on full-length yeast transcript isoforms obtained by capturing and sequencing both the 5’ cap and 3’ polyadenylation site of yeast RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we considered transcript isoforms reported in Supplementary Data S2 from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pelechano et al., 2013</xref> that completely contained their annotated gene, avoiding isoforms that initiated transcription inside of annotated gene models or that terminated transcription prematurely. For each gene, we summed the number of reported counts for all isoforms that started at the same 5’ base in YPD medium. Based on these summed counts, we selected the 5’ position with the most read counts to represent the transcription start site for the given gene.</p><p>For the TSS library, we included DNA variants between BY and RM located within the 144 bp upstream of the transcription start site for each gene. We designed ‘oligo blocks’, sets of oligos carrying allelic versions of these 144 bp sequences. We extracted the reference genome sequence for these regions to form oligos carrying BY alleles at all variants. For each variant in the 144 bp, we created one additional oligo carrying the RM allele at this variant. We also generated one oligo per block that carried RM alleles at all variants. The TSS library comprised such oligo blocks for all genes that harbored variants in the design space of this library.</p><p>For the Upstream library, we considered all variants located between 72 bp upstream of the start codon of each gene and the coding sequence of the next upstream gene, up to a maximum distance of 1 kb. For each such variant, we created an oligo block consisting of one oligo that carried the BY allele at the variant flanked by the reference genome sequence centered on the variant and one oligo that carried the same flanking sequence but with the RM allele at the variant. At any other variants within the sequence covered by the oligo block, both oligos carried the BY allele such that each oligo block assayed a single variant. We subsampled 4547 variants from this design. Specifically, we included all variants located in promoters whose genes had at least some evidence (nominal p&lt;0.05) of allele-specific expression (ASE) in either of two ASE datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014a</xref>). We also included variants from 1000 randomly selected genes without evidence of ASE (p&gt;0.2), as well as 2062 additional variants selected at random from the remaining variants.</p><p>Both designs were strand-specific, such that for genes located on the plus strand we designed oligos based on the reference genome sequence, while for genes located on the minus strand, we used the reverse-complement of the reference sequence. Thus, in the finished reporter constructs, all oligos were correctly oriented with respect to the fluorescent reporter gene.</p><p>We removed oligo blocks in which at least one oligo happened to contain a restriction site that would be recognized by the restriction enzymes we used during cloning. We also removed oligo blocks in which RM insertion variants increased the length of at least one oligo to more than the synthesis limit of 200 bp.</p><p>In both libraries, we included an identical set of 200 oligos based on promoter fragments studied by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>. Because the promoter fragments in that study were shorter (103 bp) than ours (144 bp), we added a random DNA sequence (<named-content content-type="sequence">TATAGAACGGAATCACCTCTGACAAGTAGCGTCAAATCGGT</named-content>) between the AscI cloning site and the p2 priming site such that this random sequence was removed during cloning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This extra sequence safeguarded against preferential PCR amplification of what would otherwise have been shorter oligo molecules.</p><p>To each designed oligo sequence, we added restriction sites and library-specific priming sites as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>. The resulting oligos had a median length of 195 bp. RM insertion variants increased the length of some oligos, such that the maximum oligo length was 200 bp. Because oligo synthesis is challenging for sequences rich in adenine (which are enriched in promoter sequences), we reverse-complemented the designed sequences of oligos that carried more adenines than thymines. Because the single-stranded oligo libraries are amplified by PCR prior to use, these reverse-complement oligos behaved equivalently equivalent to the designed oligos in downstream experiments. Oligos were purchased as one pool from Agilent Technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reporter design</title><p>Inspired by the design of prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>), we placed the promoter fragment library upstream of a fluorescent yEGFP gene on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kosuri et al., 2013</xref>, we measured reporter gene expression by quantifying yEGFP mRNA instead of fluorescence signal. Plasmids carried a CEN/ARS origin of replication and an <italic>ADH1</italic> terminator downstream of the reporter constructs. We included random 20 bp barcodes downstream of the yEGFP gene, such that the barcodes were transcribed as part of the yEGFP mRNA. Prior to insertion of the yEGFP gene into plasmids, we used paired-end sequencing to generate a dictionary linking each random barcode to the promoter fragment it tagged. We amplified the barcode from plasmid DNA or yEGFP cDNA to generate Illumina sequencing libraries. Reporter expression was quantified by high-throughput sequencing and counting of barcode reads. Details on these procedures are given below.</p><p>For the TSS library, the designed promoter fragments were inserted immediately upstream of the yEGFP ORF. For the Upstream library, an invariant <italic>HIS3</italic> minimal promoter was inserted between the oligo sequences and the yEGFP ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Initial library amplification and barcoding</title><p>The TSS and Upstream libraries were selectively amplified from the common oligo pool (Agilent). Per library, each of eight parallel reactions contained 0.2 µL of oligo pool diluted 1:10 in TE buffer for ~10 ng template DNA, 5 µL of 2x Kapa library amplification mix (Roche, KK2702), 0.2 µL forward primer (10 µM; TSS: orc281, Upstream: orc279), 0.2 µL reverse primer (10 µM; TSS: orc285; Upstream: orc283), and 4.4 µL water.

Cycling was performed as follows: 98 °C for 2 min, 14 cycles (TSS) or 12 cycles (Upstream) of 98 °C for 3 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min, and a hold at 10 °C. The eight parallel reactions per library were combined, cleaned up using QiaQuick PCR purification kits, eluted in 30 µL EB buffer, and quantified with Qubit HS DNA kits.</p><p>Because the barcodes are part of the reporter mRNA molecules, their sequence potentially influences mRNA abundance in <italic>cis</italic>, for example by affecting mRNA stability. Indeed, pilot experiments suggested that barcodes with a high number of guanines had lower expression, in line with known effects of guanines in the 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Shalem et al., 2015</xref>). Barcodes starting with two guanines had particularly low expression, and an adenine at the first position increased expression variance. To increase overall library expression while maintaining high barcode complexity, all experiments reported here used random barcodes in which (1) the first base was either cytosine or thymine, (2) the next three positions and every remaining even position contained no guanines but each of the other three DNA bases at equal frequency, and (3) the remaining odd positions carried each of the four bases at equal frequency.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Plasmid library generation</title><p>The base plasmid ‘RCP83’ was generated synthetically (Gen9/Ginkgo Bioworks) with a bacterial ampicillin marker and a yeast kanMX resistance cassette (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> contains the map of this plasmid after completed library construction; the RCP83 backbone is available at Addgene under ID #163466). The barcoded library was directionally ligated into the plasmid at an SfiI site. Upstream of this site, the plasmid contained the ‘PS1’ priming site used in barcode annotation (see below). Downstream of the SfiI site, the plasmid carried an <italic>ADH1</italic> terminator, ensuring efficient termination of the reporter constructs. We isolated RCP83 from <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures by maxi-prep using Qiagen Plasmid Plus Purification kits (Qiagen #12963, #12965) and quantified plasmid DNA using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher #Q32854).

To prevent religation of the backbone, we added 10 µL of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (NEB #M0371L) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr. We purified the digested vector from a 0.8% agarose gel (1.2 g agarose Fisher #21-255-00GM) in 150 mL 1x TAE (Fisher #FERB49) using a QiaQuick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen #28706) and quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit.</p><p>We digested 1 µg of barcoded library using 5 µL SfiI enzyme, 10 µL 10x NEB CutSmart buffer, and water to 100 µL at 50 °C for 2 hr.

The parallel transformations were combined and mixed with a total of 9.5 mL of recovery medium. To estimate the number of transformants obtained, we plated a dilution series (10-fold dilution steps from 1:100 to 1:10<sup>6</sup>) on LB carbenicillin (100 µg / mL) plates, grew the plates overnight at 30 °C and counted colonies after 24 hr. We obtained an approximate of 25 million and 230 million transformants for the TSS and Upstream libraries, respectively. Negative controls, for which we had performed the ligation and transformation with digested backbone but no insert, yielded negligible numbers of colonies. The transformed cells were plated on 15 cm LB + carbenicillin plates (500 µL per plate), grown overnight at 30 °C, and scraped into a total of 25 mL LB medium. The optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) of these cells suspensions was determined, and 2 OD<sub>600</sub> units (~1 billion cells) were grown overnight at 30 °C in 400 mL LB + carbenicillin. After 24 hr, plasmids were isolated from 200 mL of these cultures using Qiagen Plasmid Plus Purification kits (Qiagen #12963, #12965).

To generate the sequencing libraries, we performed four parallel PCR reactions each for the TSS and the Upstream library. In each reaction, we combined 800 ng of plasmid library with 25 µL 2x Kapa library amplification mix (Roche, #KK2702), 1 µL forward primer (10 µM; orc295), 1 µL reverse primer (10 µM; orc296), and water to 50 µL. PCR was performed as follows: 98 °C for 2 min, 10 cycles of 98 °C for 3 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension at 72 °C for 2 min with a hold at 12 °C. The four reactions were combined, and clean-up performed using 360 µL AmPure XP beads for 200 µL combined reactions. Beads were incubated with the library at room temperature for 5 min, separated on a magnetic rack, washed twice with 500 µL 80% EtOH, and eluted from the beads with 50 µL elution (TE) buffer for 5 min. Sequencing libraries were quantified using qPCR Library Quantification kits (Roche, #KK4824).</p><p>We sequenced these annotation libraries in paired-end configuration with 250 bp read length on two lanes of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument. At this read length, both of the paired reads covered the barcode and the associated oligo entirely. This configuration aided in distinguishing sequencing errors, which are present on only one of the paired reads, from synthesis and PCR errors in the sequenced molecule and are therefore present in both paired reads. Paired reads were merged using PEAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) using parameters -v 75 m 250 j 8 -y 2G -c 40 -b 64. Between 75 and 85% of read pairs were merged successfully.</p><p>We retained merged reads that contained two invariant sequences expected to be present in well-formed sequencing reads: in between the oligo and the barcode (TSS: <named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGCAGGGGTTTAGCCGGCGTG</named-content>; Upstream: <named-content content-type="sequence">CCTGCAGGGTTCCGCAGCCACAC</named-content>; these correspond to the AscI, p2, and SbfI sequences; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) and upstream of the oligo (<named-content content-type="sequence">GGCCGTAATGGCC</named-content> in both libraries; corresponding to the SfiI-A site included in the synthetic oligo sequences; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). These invariant sequences were used to locate the positions of the barcode and oligo in each read. This filter retained ~ 170 million reads in the TSS library and ~125 million reads in the Upstream library, representing 24 million (TSS) and 46 million (Upstream) unique barcodes. Most of these unique barcodes were rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), as indicated by median read counts per barcode of two (TSS) and one (Upstream). We did not group barcodes with similar sequences at this stage.</p><p>We examined barcodes that appeared to tag multiple oligos and concluded that the overwhelming majority of barcodes tagged a single oligo. Specifically, for the overwhelming majority of cases apparent tagging of multiple oligos, a single ‘primary’ oligo dominated the barcode, usually making up at least 90% of oligo reads for the barcode. Examination of the ‘secondary’ oligos showed that these usually differed from the primary oligo by a single nucleotide, most often involving a skipped base. Because our paired-end sequencing strategy reduced sequencing errors, we deemed it likely that these secondary oligos arose as PCR errors during barcoding or Illumina sequencing library generation. In downstream analyses, we only considered the primary oligo as the oligo tagged by the given barcode.</p><p>We next mapped these primary oligos to our designed sequences. Synthesis and PCR errors result in oligos that do not match the designed sequences perfectly. Because our interest was in the effects of individual sequence variants that usually alter just a single nucleotide, errors in the oligo molecules run the risk of dominating the modest effects exerted by natural regulatory variants. Therefore, we retained only barcodes for which the primary oligo perfectly matched a designed oligo. In the TSS library, we retained 9.2 million barcodes (38% of unique barcodes), while in the Upstream library we retained 20 million barcodes (43%).</p><p>In the TSS library, these barcodes tagged 6565 oligos, which was 91% of all designed TSS oligos. In the Upstream library, the barcodes tagged 9646 oligos, representing 98% of the design. Examination of designed oligos that were not present in the cloned libraries revealed that oligos starting with a guanine had lower representation in the library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), especially for oligos that started with two guanines. This technical bias was more apparent in the TSS library, in which a higher fraction of oligos started with disfavored nucleotides than in the Upstream library.</p><p>Raw data and barcode assignments to oligos are available under GEO accession GSE155944 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155944">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE155944</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Reporter subcloning</title><p>After plasmid library generation, the fluorescent reporter gene was subcloned in between the promoter fragments and the barcodes of the annotated plasmid libraries by restriction digestion and ligation.

In each sample, we counted the number of reads that contained a unique barcode. Only barcodes that had been previously observed in the annotation runs were retained. Barcode reads that did not perfectly match the annotation were excluded. While this also excluded reads with sequence errors that could in principle be added to the analyses, the resulting data loss was minor: across all DNA and RNA samples, a median of 85% (a range of 75–90%) of reads mapped to known barcodes. Barcode counts for technical replicates, in which multiple indexed libraries had been created from the same growth culture, were summed. As a metric for the expression driven by each promoter oligo, we considered the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of summed RNA counts of all barcodes assigned to a given oligo, divided by the summed DNA counts. We used these ratios for visualization and comparison to other data, but not in significance testing (see below).</p><p>For two out of twelve TSS samples and two out of six Upstream samples, DNA counts were unavailable.

These different treatments did influence how many variants reached statistical significance, but only very slightly altered the estimated variant effect sizes (fold-changes). Eliminating the two Upstream samples with missing DNA would have resulted in fewer significant variants than we chose to report here, presumably due to reduced power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Myint et al., 2019</xref>).

PhastCons scores, which quantify nucleotide conservation across seven <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>), were obtained for the positions corresponding to our variants from the UCSC genome browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html">https://genome.ucsc.edu/index.html</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haeussler et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Quantifying variant effects on predicted transcription factor binding</title><p>We obtained position weight matrices (PWMs) for 196 TFs from the ScerTF database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spivak and Stormo, 2012</xref>). For each variant and TF, we computed how well sequences containing the variant matched the TF’s PWM. Higher ‘TFBS scores’ represent better matches between the sequence and the PWM, increasing the probability that the TF binds the given sequence.</p><p>For a given variant, we calculated TFBS scores in sliding windows of width equal to the length of the PWM, which we moved over the variant in one-base-pair increments. To compute the TFBS scores, we summed the position weights from the PWM for the bases dictated by the sequence of the given window. We computed these windowed TFBS scores for the BY and the RM allele. For each allele, we retained the best (i.e. the highest) and the mean TFBS score across windows. In the text, we report results based on the absolute difference between the best TFBS scores of the two alleles. Differences between the mean TFBS scores of the two alleles yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>For each TF, the ScerTF database provides sequence score cutoffs, above which the given sequence is considered to be a ‘strong’ match to the PWM. We deemed TFBS scores below these thresholds to be ‘weak’ TFBSs. We computed TFBS scores separately for strong and weak matches. For strong TFBSs, we considered only sequence windows in which the TFBS score exceeded the sequence score cutoff. We also computed the number of strong binding sites for each TF by counting the number of windows that exceeded the cutoff. For weak TFBSs, we only considered TFBS scores below the cutoffs for each TF.</p><p>Together, these analyses yielded five metrics for how a variant is predicted to perturb the binding of a given TF: the allelic difference in (1) the best and (2) the mean TFBS score across windows for strong TFBSs, (3) the number of strong binding sites, (4) the best and (5) the mean TFBS score across windows for weak TFBSs.</p><p>To consider strand-specificity in variant effects on TF-binding, these five allelic TFBS metrics were computed across three strand contexts, for a total of 15 features per TF: (1) the sense (or ‘plus’) strand, that is the 5’ to 3’ sequence of nucleotides upstream of the reporter gene; (2) the antisense (or ‘minus’) strand, by analyzing the reverse complement of the plus strand; (3) ‘strand-agnostic’, in which we computed the difference between the best and mean scores across windows irrespective of which strand these scores came from. Across the 196 TFs, these features comprised a total set of 2940 features.</p><p>To obtain the aggregated TF features that summarized the 196 TF-specific sets of features, we computed the following 27 features for each variant. In each of the three strand contexts, we counted the total number of strong TFBSs changed (three features). Separately for strong and weak binding, we also computed the maximum difference in best or mean TFBS score across all TFs (12 features), and the average difference in best or mean TFBS score across all TFs (12 features).</p><p>To annotate individual TFBSs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, we extracted the genome reference sequence flanking the two variants shown in the figure, up to a number of bases corresponding to the longest TF motif annotated in the Yeastract database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Monteiro et al., 2020</xref>), and then uploaded these sequences with either the BY or the RM allele to the Yeastract web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastract.com">http://www.yeastract.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Logistic regression tests of single features</title><p>We used logistic regression to test if each feature influenced the classification of a variant as causal. Causal variants were defined as those variants detected at an FDR of 5% or better. We contrasted this set to a set of non-causal variants with an unadjusted p-value larger than 0.2.

These 112 models differed in whether they considered the non-TF features, whether they included TF features from the plus, minus, and/or the strand-agnostic set, whether they considered strong and/or weak TF metrics, whether they included the aggregated TF summary features, and whether they included only features that had been significant in the single regression analyses. Details on each model are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>For each of the 112 feature subsets, we built a logistic regression model to predict variant causality. For building these models, we first divided the variants also used in single-feature analyses into a training set comprising 90% of the data, and a test set comprising 10% of the data. Training was performed using repeated 10-fold cross validation as follows. The training set was split ten times, each time considering one of ten possible non-overlapping fractions of 10% of the training set as a validation set. In each of these ten splits, we used the remaining 90% of the training set to fit the model and computed Cohen’s Kappa on the given validation set. This process was repeated five times, on five different 10-fold splits of the training data. The models were trained to maximize Cohen’s Kappa on the validation sets. After training, each of the 112 models was applied to the 10% test set that had been held out from training. Model accuracy for the logistic regression models was measured by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Elastic-net logistic regression was performed using the ‘caret’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuhn et al., 2020</xref>). We excluded 35 features with an ‘NA’ value (27 aggregated TFBS features, expression level of the associated gene, two measures of dNdS, PPI, three measures of synthetic genetic interactions, nucleosome score).</p><p>Linear regression models to predict variant effects (expressed as absolute log-fold changes) were performed using the same repeated 10-fold cross-validation scheme and trained to minimize the root-mean squared error (RMSE). Prediction accuracy was measured using Spearman correlation coefficients between predicted and actual data on the test set. All model training was done using the ‘caret’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuhn et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the case of multiple linear regressions, we also calculated model fit as the R<sup>2</sup> on the entire set of variants used in the single-feature regressions. These linear models were fit using the ‘lm’ function in R.</p><p>Elastic-net regression models predicting variant effects followed the same splitting and training strategy as for the 112 non-regularized models. We tuned the model across 10 by 10 combinations of the mixing parameter (alpha) and the regularization parameter (lambda) to select the model with the lowest RMSE in cross-validation. The best model was used to predict on the 10% test set, and model accuracy was measured as above. Elastic nets were trained using the ‘caret’ package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kuhn et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Predicting variant effects on our data using the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref> model</title><p>To predict gene expression corresponding to our variants, we used the non-positional YPD model with pTpA embedding from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">de Boer et al., 2020</xref>. Among the models trained in that study, this model is least sensitive to the surrounding sequence context, which differs between our sequences and those used by de Boer et al. We used the model trained in YPD medium; the same medium we used in our experiments. The model uses 110 bp of promoter sequence as input to predict gene expression. Because our oligos were 144 bp long, we could not use the complete oligo sequence for prediction. Instead, we used 110 bp of DNA centered on each variant. For each variant, we used two 110 bp sequences, one containing the BY allele and the other containing the RM allele. The sequences were one-hot encoded using code from de Boer et al. and then fed into the model.</p><p>The predicted expression values for the BY and RM alleles of each variant were subtracted to predict fold change between alleles. Predicted expression and variant effects were compared to those observed in our experiments. As observed oligo expression values, we used the ‘AveExpr’ value in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> as the expression of the BY allele, and the sum of the ‘AveExpr’ and ‘logFC’ as the expression of the RM allele. The ‘logFC’ was used as the observed variant effect.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Joshua Bloom, Chad Myers, and Henry Ward for input on data analysis.

The results show that some promoter regions often have multiple SNPs affecting gene expression. The authors find that some of these regulatory SNPs show epistatic interactions and that natural selection may keep regulatory SNPs at low frequency in natural populations. SNPs affecting gene expression are also enriched in known transcription factor binding sites.</p><p>The three reviews are highly positive. However, for the paper to be considered further, it would be important to perform some additional analyses and revise some of the interpretations of the results. This is particularly the case for some of the recommended analyses aimed at disentangling the relationships between different factors associating with regulatory SNPs because these often covary. If it is impossible to completely estimate their independent contribution, this issue should at least be addressed in the Results and Discussion.</p><p>I have kept the three full reports below because they are complementary and well detailed. We expect no additional experiments at this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study investigates the molecular origin of differential transcription in the well-studied BY-RM cross. SNPs and indels in promoters between these two strains were reciprocally exchanged in order to measure their effects by sequencing barcoded transcripts. The authors use this method to do a deep dive into the genetic determinants of local eQTLs, in which they identify causal variants and give examples of proximal variants with non-additive interactions. They also explore the nature of the causal variants and work to predict variants and expression. In my opinion, this article is very well written, well measured, well explained, and well thought through. I have no major comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Renganaath et al. uses a reporter assay and Illumina sequencing to estimate the effects on gene expression of thousands of naturally occurring promoter variants between two yeast strains. They identify a large number of variants that have significant effects on expression, greatly expanding the catalog of known individual regulatory variants. They use this catalog to test long standing ideas about the molecular and evolutionary nature of these regulatory variants. Overall, the experiments use a good design with the necessary controls and replication to identify variants with moderate and large effects on gene expression. In general I think the work makes a good contribution to the field and I only have a few comments and concern about the models used and the strength of the conclusions made from these models.</p><p>1) First, the authors have a number of potential explanatory variables and test each one individually for association with whether a variant significantly alters gene expression or not. The results from these regression analyses are taken as is, with no attempt to account for correlations among the factors themselves. The authors seem to be aware of this issue; one of the largest individual correlates is gene essentiality which the authors note is often associated with some of the other covariates used. Because of this issue, significant associations cannot be interpreted as meaning a particular covariate is important, and causal connections can't be made from this kind of analysis. Furthermore, the authors take a number of significant covariates and interpret them as being consistent with negative selection, but whether these covariates are all significant once others are accounted for is unknown. The different covariates may be detecting similar signals, in which case they are not independent. A more comprehensive modeling scheme would allow the most important covariates to be identified and lead to a better understanding of what signals actually exist in the data. For example, using regularization techniques (which the authors do use later in another analysis) on a model including all of the covariates would help to avoid non-independent covariates.</p><p>2) Similar arguments can be made for the regression analyses that incorporate transcription factor binding; the PWMs of TFs are not independent and many have similarities due to similar modes of binding. In addition, the data does not clearly show 'evidence that causal variations often perturb TF binding'. Instead, the data shows that variants predicted to alter the binding of TFs are correlated with whether a variant is causal. Again, direct causality from this type of analysis is difficult to do. This is made even more difficult to follow with the “weak” TF binding as it appears that the authors are arguing for a model where individual single nucleotide variants affect expression by altering the binding of multiple TFs, each of which has a low individual probability of being bound. While it is well known that many weak TFBS are present in DNA, I'm not familiar with changes to these weak TFBS being proposed in the literature as a major route by which gene expression is altered in nature. Two things could help make this claim stronger. First, it would help to see a clear example that was found in the data, e.g. of a causal variant that was predicted to alter a single strong TFBS and one that was predicted to affect multiple weak TFBS. Second, functional validation of some of these variants as affecting the predicted TF binding (and not some other, unknown and untested factor) would significantly increase the impact of this section. This later route would likely require substantial effort, but at the very least, that such functional analysis has not been done needs to be recognized and the claims moderated in this section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Renganaath and colleagues described a high-throughput assay for testing how natural genetic variants influence gene expression, as well as finding patterns that allow us to predict such effects. The main novelty of their approach is in its single-variant resolution. Other methods such as eQTL mapping and allele-specific expression (ASE) do not have this level of resolution, so MPRA is a valuable addition to the yeast genetics toolkit. The ability to test epistatic interactions of neighboring variants is also a nice feature.</p><p>1) The role of individual variants in contributing to ASE is key to understanding cis-regulatory logic. The authors designed MPRA oligos focusing on previously identified ASE genes and added randomly selected genes as controls. It would be interesting to see an aggregated statistic on whether ASE genes are more likely to harbor causal variants than non-ASE genes; and if upstream variants differ from TSS variants in such patterns.</p><p>2) Prediction of causal regulatory variants is a holy grail of functional genomics. In this study, the predictions show slightly (but significantly) better than random performance. It is worth noting that there are more non-causal variants that causal variants, resulting in imbalanced classification problem. Oversampling of the minority labels could be a good start to balance data distribution and improve prediction performance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62669.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper by Renganaath et al. uses a reporter assay and Illumina sequencing to estimate the effects on gene expression of thousands of naturally occurring promoter variants between two yeast strains.

Instead, in our view, when multiple related features are associated with causality, this hints at the influence of an underlying phenomenon that may not be perfectly captured by any one feature alone. To stay with the example highlighted by the reviewer, the associations of variant causality with 1) lower derived allele frequency, 2) occurrence in the promoters of non-essential genes, and 3) occurrence in the promoters of genes with fewer synthetic genetic interactions, are all consistent with an underlying signal of negative selection against variants that alter the expression of essential genes.</p><p>To make this point obvious to the reader, we have added the following statement: “While these analyses cannot isolate the individual contributions of features that are correlated with each other, they provide an overview of the characteristics of causal variants.”</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion of attempting to account for correlated features via regularization, we have extended our existing linear elastic net models (in which we had modeled variant effect size as a quantitative response variable) to logistic elastic net models of whether or not a variant is causal. Briefly, we fit all features in one model with 10-fold repeated cross-validation (5 repeats). This model predicted variant causality fairly poorly, with an area under the ROC of 0.53 on a 10% held-out test set. In this model, 1,812 predictors had a non-zero importance score. We also fit our 112 logistic regression models of various feature subsets with elastic net regularization. The best of these models, which included non-TF features and individual TF features in the strand agnostic configuration that had been significant in the univariate analyses, achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.71, identical to the best model without regularization. We have added these results to the paper (subsection “Prediction of causal variants”).</p><p>We draw two conclusions from these results. First, regularization alone does not improve predictions. We suspect that our dataset of a few hundred causal variants, each in a different promoter context, is not large enough to permit more accurate predictions. Second, and more directly to the reviewer’s concern, the feature associations we detected in our univariate logistic regressions do not trivially collapse to a small set of highly correlated features.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similar arguments can be made for the regression analyses that incorporate transcription factor binding; the PWMs of TFs are not independent and many have similarities due to similar modes of binding. In addition, the data does not clearly show “evidence that causal variations often perturb TF binding”. Instead, the data shows that variants predicted to alter the binding of TFs are correlated with whether a variant is causal. Again, direct causality from this type of analysis is difficult to do.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our concluding statement for this section (“…provided clear evidence that causal variations often perturb TF binding”) was worded too strongly. Closely following the reviewer’s suggestion, we now conclude this section with “Overall, these analyses provided clear evidence that variants predicted to perturb TF binding are more likely to alter gene expression than variants not predicted to do so.”</p><p>As we pointed out in response to the reviewer’s first comment above, our intention in these analyses was not to assign independent contributions to binding of individual factors. As the reviewer points out, doing so would be extremely challenging due to sharing of motifs by different factors. To make this point clear for readers, we have added the statement “These analyses cannot disambiguate sharing of similar binding motifs by different TFs but probe the overall role of perturbed TF binding in variant causality.” Together with our reworded concluding sentence, we believe that this clarifies how we interpret the results on altered TFBSs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is made even more difficult to follow with the “weak” TF binding as it appears that the authors are arguing for a model where individual single nucleotide variants affect expression by altering the binding of multiple TFs, each of which has a low individual probability of being bound. While it is well known that many weak TFBS are present in DNA, I'm not familiar with changes to these weak TFBS being proposed in the literature as a major route by which gene expression is altered in nature. Two things could help make this claim stronger. First, it would help to see a clear example that was found in the data, e.g. of a causal variant that was predicted to alter a single strong TFBS and one that was predicted to affect multiple weak TFBS. Second, functional validation of some of these variants as affecting the predicted TF binding (and not some other, unknown and untested factor) would significantly increase the impact of this section. This later route would likely require substantial effort, but at the very least, that such functional analysis has not been done needs to be recognized and the claims moderated in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we argue for “a model where individual single nucleotide variants affect expression by altering the binding of multiple TFs, each of which has a low individual probability of being bound.”, although we do not strongly argue that such variants always have to alter binding of <italic>multiple</italic>​ TFs. Note that in the Discussion, we wrote “[variants] may perturb one or multiple weak binding sites”.​</p><p>This finding of strong association of causal variants with changes to weak TFBSs is supported by a recent study by de Boer et al., 2020, which we repeatedly cite in our Results and Discussion sections. The authors conducted a massively parallel reporter assay of more than 100 million random promoter fragments to build a highly predictive model of transcriptional regulation of RNA expression. In in-silico​ experiments probing their model, the authors set the level of individual TFs to zero and tested the influence of these “deletions” on gene expression. Strong regulatory effects (i.e., those that altered expression by more than 2-fold) of individual transcription factors were rare and accounted for only ~6% of the average expression driven by a typical promoter fragment. By contrast, the remaining 94% of the expression driven by a typical promoter fragment were attributed to the vast majority (99.9%) of interactions between a TF and a fragment that were individually weak. A key conclusion of the de Boer et al. paper is that (emphasis added) “[…] random DNA has diverse expression levels (Figure 1) that can be explained by TF binding (Figure 2), which regulate expression primarily through weak interactions​ (Figure ​ 6) that, in turn, can easily be perturbed​ [by changes to DNA sequence] (Figure 5).”. Here, we​ extend this reasoning by de Boer et al. to natural variants.</p><p>To help the reader understand these points about weak binding sites, we have added a new Figure 5—figure supplement 1, which shows an example of a variant with a clear change to a strong TFBS (panel A), as well as a variant that does not change any recognizable strong TFBSs, but does change predicted binding at multiple weak TFBSs (panel B).</p><p>We do acknowledge that additional work (which is outside of the scope of the current manuscript) will be required for a fuller understanding of the role of weak binding sites in regulatory variation. We have modified the Discussion section to make this point more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Renganaath and colleagues described a high-throughput assay for testing how natural genetic variants influence gene expression, as well as finding patterns that allow us to predict such effects. The main novelty of their approach is in its single-variant resolution. Other methods such as eQTL mapping and allele-specific expression (ASE) do not have this level of resolution, so MPRA is a valuable addition to the yeast genetics toolkit. The ability to test epistatic interactions of neighboring variants is also a nice feature.</p><p>1) The role of individual variants in contributing to ASE is key to understanding cis-regulatory logic. The authors designed MPRA oligos focusing on previously identified ASE genes and added randomly selected genes as controls. It would be interesting to see an aggregated statistic on whether ASE genes are more likely to harbor causal variants than non-ASE genes; and if upstream variants differ from TSS variants in such patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for this suggestion. We turned to ASE mRNA data previously gathered and integrated with local eQTL results in Albert et al.​​, 2018. Those data contain two independent BY/RM hybrid ASE datasets. Here, genes that had shown genome-wide significant ASE in at least one of these two datasets were more likely to have a causal MPRA variant (Fisher’s exact test: odds ratio = 3.2, p &lt; 2.2e-16). We have added this result to the Results section and a corresponding Materials and methods paragraph.</p><p>This agreement between ASE data and our MPRA assay is further bolstered by a correlation between the number of causal MPRA variants and either the number of ASE datasets with a significant result for the given gene (rho = 0.23, p &lt; 2.2e-16) or the absolute magnitude of ASE (rho = 0.14, p = 2e-8). These results were similar for variants in the TSS and Upstream MPRA libraries (<xref ref-type="table" rid="resptable1">Author response table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="resptable1" position="anchor"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Library</th><th>Fisher’s exact test (odds ratio)</th><th>Fisher’s exact test (p-value)</th><th>Correlation w/ number significant <break/>ASE <break/>datasets (rho)</th><th>Correlation w/ number significant <break/>ASE <break/>datasets (p-value)</th><th>Correlation with ASE magnitude <break/>(rho)</th><th>Correlation with ASE magnitude (p-value)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>TSS</td><td>3.1</td><td>3e-7</td><td>0.18</td><td>2e-8</td><td>0.11</td><td>0.0009</td></tr><tr><td>Upstream</td><td>2.8</td><td>6e-10</td><td>0.21</td><td>3e-12</td><td>0.13</td><td>0.00001</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>In the interest of brevity, we chose not to include these more detailed analyses in the paper. Note that the ASE data we used in the analyses above differ slightly from those we had used for designing the MPRA. This is simply because more ASE data has become available since we designed the MPRA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Prediction of causal regulatory variants is a holy grail of functional genomics. In this study, the predictions show slightly (but significantly) better than random performance. It is worth noting that there are more non-causal variants that causal variants, resulting in imbalanced classification problem. Oversampling of the minority labels could be a good start to balance data distribution and improve prediction performance.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the class imbalance in the training sets of our classifiers and thank the reviewer for this suggestion. To test if oversampling improves predictions, we oversampled causal variants to an equal representation of causal and non-causal variants in the training set used to train our classifiers. As expected, the classifiers with oversampling of the minority class were more stable during training and performed better in predicting on the <italic>validation</italic>​​ sets: across the 112 models, median average Cohen’s Kappa increased from 0.02 without oversampling to 0.22 with oversampling (see the top left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; the red line denotes equality). There was a marginal improvement in the AUC-ROC when predicting on the <italic>test</italic>​ set (the best model improved from 0.71 to 0.73; see the top right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>; this best classifier used the same features in the training stage as in our analyses in the paper). However, the average performance across the 112 models remained similar (bottom panel; the red line corresponds to equal performance; note that the points are symmetric around this line indicating that there is no overall trend for better performance). Given this absence of a systematic improvement, we have chosen not to include these results in the paper.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62669-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
