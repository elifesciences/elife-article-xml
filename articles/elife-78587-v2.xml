However, since melanoma cells are highly heterogeneous, it has been challenging to use affected genes to predict tumour aggressiveness, metastatic evolution, and patients’ outcomes. We hypothesized that common aggressive hypermethylation signatures should emerge early in tumorigenesis and should be shared in aggressive cells, independent of the physiological context under which this trait arises. We compared paired melanoma cell lines with the following properties: (i) each pair comprises one aggressive counterpart and its parental cell line and (ii) the aggressive cell lines were each obtained from different host and their environment (human, rat, and mouse), though starting from the same parent cell line. Next, we developed a multi-step genomic pipeline that combines the DNA methylome profile with a chromosome cluster-oriented analysis. A total of 229 differentially hypermethylated genes was commonly found in the aggressive cell lines. Genome localization analysis revealed hypermethylation peaks and clusters, identifying eight hypermethylated gene promoters for validation in tissues from melanoma patients. Five Cytosine-phosphate-Guanine (CpGs) identified in primary melanoma tissues were transformed into a DNA methylation score that can predict survival (log-rank test, p=0.0008). This strategy is potentially universally applicable to other diseases involving DNA methylation alterations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenomics</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>chromosome clusters</kwd><kwd>patient outcome</kwd><kwd>oriented approach</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ATIP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arimondo</surname><given-names>Paola B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Region Midi Pyrenees - Equipe d'excellence</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arimondo</surname><given-names>Paola B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Region Midi Pyrenees - FEDER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arimondo</surname><given-names>Paola B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation InnaBioSante</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpAM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Arimondo</surname><given-names>Paola B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005984</institution-id><institution>Adelson Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoon</surname><given-names>Dave SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Bustos</surname><given-names>Matias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An original molecular multi-step approach integrating DNA methylome and chromosome-cluster localization cross-analysis identified a DNA methylation signature of patient outcome supporting that the core DNA methylation for a given trait is independent of the physiological context under which it arises.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cutaneous metastatic melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer, and its occurrence is growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moran et al., 2018</xref>). The recent development of targeted and immune therapies has dramatically improved patient’s outcomes. Indeed, median overall survival (OS) of patients with advanced-stage melanoma has increased from ~9 months to at least 2 years since 2011 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Luke et al., 2017</xref>). OS is better after targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Teterycz et al., 2019</xref>) or immunotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weiss et al., 2019</xref>), but there are still non-responders and neo/acquired resistants. Despite these advances, there is place for improvement in particular to discover novel early prognostic markers and potential avenue for adjuvant therapies.</p><p>DNA methylation in malignant melanoma has been studied to identify specific DNA methylation changes and decipher their impact. Melanoma has a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tanemura et al., 2009</xref>), and several methylated genes are associated with melanoma progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Micevic et al., 2017</xref>), with aggressive clinical and pathological features and poor survival in patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Unamuno Bustos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref>), are candidate epigenetic drivers of melanoma metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>), or are implicated in immunotherapy resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emran et al., 2019</xref>). Such DNA methylation changes have been studied at different stages of the metastatic disease but not in primary cutaneous tumour. Importantly, DNA methylation has been shown to occur very early in tumour formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michalak et al., 2019</xref>) and thus has the potential to provide early biomarkers indicating the metastatic potential of the tumour. However, the field currently lacks a genomic strategy that can both account for genetic environment and identify early DNA methylation markers that predict the aggressiveness of the melanoma.</p><p>Here, we developed a strategy that leverages the DNA methylome from different pairs of human melanoma cells lines. Cells within pairs share a common genetic background, but one counterpart has been selected for aggressiveness in different in vivo contexts (human vs murine). We proposed that the DNA methylation signature of tumour aggressiveness would be independent of the physiological context; starting from a human tumour, shared signatures relevant to aggressiveness should emerge independent on whether this trait were acquired in humans, or whether cells have been implanted into rats or mice. In a multi-step selection process, we identified hypermethylated sites common to the most aggressive melanoma forms, analysed the distribution of these sites in the genome, and validated these methylation peaks in cell lines and patient samples. This strategy identified a DNA methylation signature of five CpG sites in four gene promoters in primary tumours that could predict the OS of the patients and thus has potential diagnostic application. This strategy, which overcomes heterogeneity in tumours due to the environment, can potentially be generalized to other cancers involving DNA methylation alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A three-step strategy identifies differentially methylated genes that identify melanoma aggressiveness</title><p>To identify genes whose DNA methylation state is related to the metastatic melanoma aggressiveness, we designed a strategy to compare the DNA methylome of three pairs of melanoma cell lines. Each pair was derived from the same patient melanoma cell lines that differed in aggressiveness and microenvironmental exposure with respect to their clinical origin or subsequent in vivo experimental processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The first pair consisted of the WM115 and WM266-4 cell lines, derived from a vertical growth phase (VGP) primary melanoma and a cutaneous metastasis from the same patient, respectively, thus comparing a less and more aggressive pair of human melanoma cells. The second and the third pairs include a cell line established from a human lymph node metastasis (M4Be) and two metastatic variants selected for their increased metastatic potential in xenograft experiments either in mouse (M4BeS2) or in rat (TW12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, step 1). It is important to note that in each pair, the aggressive cell line is derived from the same genetic background, but the most aggressive lines emerged in different in vivo contexts: human, mouse, and rat, respectively. We hypothesized that common aggressive DNA hypermethylation signatures should emerge early in tumorigenesis and should be shared in aggressive cells, independent of the physiological context under which this trait arises. Careful cell culture practice was applied to limit cell culture process-related divergence of DNA methylation between the cell lines to be compared.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy for identifying differentially methylated gene signatures of aggressive melanoma.</title><p>The strategy is based on the analysis of three pairs of human melanoma cell lines with an aggressive variant derived under different physiological contexts: human, mouse, and rat. In each pair, the cell line defined as more aggressive is indicated in bold characters. (<bold>A</bold>) Step 1: the methylation status of more than 480,000 CpG positions was compared in each cell line pair using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation 450 K BeadChip technology. 229 common genes showing at least three CpGs positions with methylation levels increased by 20% in the aggressive cell line were retained (hypermethylated genes). (<bold>B</bold>) Step 2: two strategies for data analysis were used: the oriented strategy is based on a statistical analysis of the distribution of the hypermethylated genes across the genome, and the non-oriented strategy uses Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software to identify potential links to described networks and functions. (<bold>C</bold>) Step 3: experimental validation of the selected genes, by bisulfite pyrosequencing for DNA methylation and RT-PCR for gene expression, was performed in the WM115 and WM266-4 cell lines prior to analysis in patient samples. After applying this differential threshold to at least three CpG positions for each gene, we found that 2783, 1645, and 1641 genes were hypermethylated in WM266-4 vs WM115, M4BeS2 vs M4Be, and TW12 vs M4Be, respectively (<bold>A</bold>). 229 genes, comprising 5590 CpG sites, were common to all three pairs of cell lines. These 229 genes were further analysed using the human WM115/WM266-4 pair. 1287 (23%) CpGs were hypermethylated (&gt;20%) in WM266-4 cells of which 788 (61%) were located in promoter regions (TSS1500-TSS200-5’UTR-first exon), 452 (35%) in gene bodies and 47 (4%) in 3’UTR regions.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78587-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Top functions associated by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to the 229 hypermethylated genes in the aggressive cell lines.</title><p>Among the 229 genes, 116 were associated to IPA canonical functions.

A first global analysis showed that nearly half of the analysed genes displayed at least one CpG position, where methylation levels are increased over 20% in the aggressive cell line compared to its respective counterpart. We made the choice to restrict the analysis to CpGs in promoters or first exons to consider correlations to key biological processes associated to DNA methylation changes in cutaneous melanoma. Following this first step of selection, we adopted two complementary approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An oriented strategy, based on the genomic mapping of the 229 hypermethylated genes common to the aggressive melanoma cell lines, allowed us to identify clusters of hypermethylation. Clusters consisted of at least two hypermethylated genes that are either direct neighbours or separated within 3 megabases (Mb) of one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

The final score was obtained by summing points attributed to each gene so that scores range from 0 to 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). A threshold of 2 (i.e. with at least two genes matching this condition) was used to include patients with a methylation score ≥2. The methylation score was represented as a function of survival in months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Patients with a methylation score ≥2 (red line) had a shorter life expectancy (≤1 year) than those with a methylation score value &lt;2 (blue line).

Then, we compared the methylation score to the clinical parameter used in clinic, the Breslow index. Based on the melanoma American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging (T1, T2, T3, and T4), we confirmed that on our 49 patient samples, an increased Breslow depth of the primary tumour is a prognostic factor for survival probability (Kaplan–Meier plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). As our cohort contained only one sample of T1 grade (primary tumour’s depth less than 1 mm), we then compared the survival probability between two groups: Breslow index below 2 mm (T1 and T2) or above 2 mm (T3 and T4). We obtained no statistical difference between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref> and E) in contrast to what obtain upon use of the methylation signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>).

It is important to underline the starting point. We reasoned that since epigenetic changes are linked to cell plasticity and biological environment changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feinberg and Fallin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg et al., 2006</xref>), any common DNA methylation changes acquired by the most aggressive cells in different in vivo contexts (human, mouse, and rat) would highlight a robust and relevant trait of melanoma tumour cell plasticity and aggressiveness despite their heterogeneity. Indeed, melanoma is highly heterogeneous tumour, and until now it has been difficult to find a signature in primary melanoma, either based on DNA methylation or gene expression that help to predict prognosis as well as Breslow index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalla et al., 2019</xref>). Several DNA methylation studies have been conducted comparing patient samples at different stages of cutaneous melanoma to normal samples, i.e., melanocytes or nevi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Marzese et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sigalotti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marzese et al., 2015</xref>) or using cell lines derived from multi-grade patient samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2017</xref>). While such studies have identified genes regulated by DNA methylation, none have yet identified a common pattern or a specific signature of melanoma aggressiveness. In contrast, the unique approach used in our study yielded a potential DNA methylation signature that correlates with outcomes. We report the following main and original results: (i) the observation that robust DNA methylation traits of aggressiveness are independent of the physiological context; (ii) the methodology of combining DNA methylome analysis and chromosome cluster-based analysis that can be applied beyond melanoma; and (iii) the identification of the methylation of five CpGs (and not genes) that provide a predictive value of the aggressiveness of the melanoma in primary tumours.</p><p>Considering that the cellular models utilized have experienced very different experimental microenvironments, we assumed that the common 229 identified hypermethylated genes represented genes either playing a direct role in or being associated with the aggressiveness of melanoma. Next, we applied a bootstrap analysis of the distribution of these hypermethylated genes revealing that they are not randomly distributed along the chromosomes but are instead organized in clusters of hypermethylated genes. This observation of clustered genes regulated by DNA methylation is reminiscent of the mechanism underlying parental imprinting and its spreading on imprinted genes during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis and Reik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lindsay and Adams, 1996</xref>). It is also coherent with the association of hypermethylated regions with long range epigenetic silencing (LRES) described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frigola et al., 2006</xref> in colon cancer and with the fact that LRES regions containing hypermethylated genes extend up to 4 Mb and are correlated with gene extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coolen et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, guided by the hypothesis that these clustered genes correspond to early changes in CpG methylation during tumour progression and may thus constitute a starting point for spreading of DNA methylation, we concentrated our efforts on these. We concentrated our efforts on CpGs that could play a role in cancer progression, and an IPA of the corresponding biological functions related to tumorigenesis or resistance to therapy facilitated selection of eight potential genes that could be early signals of the aggressiveness of the disease. The DNA methylation signature at these eight genes was analysed in additional melanoma cell lines (WM983A and WM983B) derived from the same patient and in patient metastatic and primary tumour samples, highlighting four genes of interest. All four genes are demethylated upon treatment with 5AzadC in WM266-4 metastatic melanoma cells and displayed the strongest methylation differential.</p><p>In the last part of our study, we challenged the methylation status of these four gene promoters in 59 patient samples. Surprisingly, five CpGs were significantly differentially methylated between patients with a short OS (&lt;1 year, SS) and those with a longer OS (&gt;1 year, LS). This led to the discovery of an early and robust signature of melanoma progression that is only based directly on the primary tumour that can significantly predict patient outcome (p=0.0008). Several studies have described different methylation patterns at various stages of melanoma disease, but only one reported a difference in methylation profile among primary tumour samples linking it to an ulceration status and thus a poor clinical outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rakosy et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2019</xref> identified four DNA methylation biomarkers by analysing all melanoma types in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database but without validating this on another patient cohort. Importantly, we have discovered five CpG sites that are key to metastatic melanoma formation and are grouped in genomic clusters. This signature is unique, as is the integrated approach and the baseline assumption used to identify it. Importantly, patients samples were from different regions and continents (France, Italy, Portugal, and USA). Going forward, the signature could be further developed to predict the much-needed progression risk of the melanoma directly in primary tumours. For example, the methylation level of the five CpGs combined with the Breslow score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) could be explored to confirm if it can be applied to identify the patients that are at risk when primary tumours are collected and removed.</p><p>Recently, a DNA methylation signature based on four CpGs was shown to prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lyskjær et al., 2022</xref>).

Importantly, the five CpGs are located on four different genes, and it is not the expression of the genes that is monitored. Our method was based on two main concepts; the first one being that aggressive traits marked by DNA hypermethylation appear early in the disease and are independent of physiological context. The second concept is that hypermethylated sites in metastatic forms of melanoma are gathered in genomic clusters. On the methodological side, we combined analysis of the DNA methylome with chromosomal location. Following these general concepts, this integrated approach can be applied not only to other cancer types but also to other diseases or biological processes where DNA methylation changes are identified.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WM115</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1676</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WM-266–4</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-1675</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WM983A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Coriell Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WC00048</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WM983B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Coriell Institute</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WC00066</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M4Be</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailly and Doré, 1991</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Not applicable</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TW12</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailly and Doré, 1991</xref>;

Methylation data were extracted as raw signals with no background subtraction or data normalization. The obtained ‘ß’ values, i.e., the methylation scores for each CpG range from 0 (unmethylated, U) to 1 (fully methylated, M) on a continuous scale, were calculated from the intensity of the M and U alleles as the ratio of fluorescent signals (ß = [Max(M,0)]/[Max(M,0)+Max(U,0)+100]).</p><p>All pre-processing, correction, and normalization steps were performed using an improved version of the in-house developed pipeline using subset quantile normalization based on the relation to sequence annotation provided by Illumina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Touleimat and Tost, 2012</xref>).

The performance of individual CpGs was assessed testing the absolute DNA methylation difference between samples of the two phenotypes of interest with different thresholds and permitting a small number of misclassifications. At the same time, a vector quantization method (nearest centroid classifier) was used to define CpGs that separate, at a given threshold, the two phenotypes of interest.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including C Daniela Robles-Espinoza as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Florian A Karreth (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. As some of the cell lines were derived from the same patient but not by the researchers themselves (they were purchased from companies), do they know how different these cell lines are (genetically or epigenetically) purely due to factors such as time of sample collection (i.e. were primaries and metastases taken at the same time, time in tissue culture, etc?) Do the companies provide this information? In the opinion of a reviewer, this is important to consider due to the possibility that more genes may be methylated for other reasons as more time passes, therefore complicating the analysis.</p><p>2. Please explain why gene function was one of the means (non-oriented strategy) used for selecting candidate hypermethylated genes. A biomarker does not have to also have a cancer-associated function.</p><p>3. How do the hypermethylated genes compare with those that have been identified by other groups that study melanoma metastasis (e.g. these papers PMID 26091043, 32406600)? Do they overlap? Do the genes identified in Carrier et al. constitute a 'methylation group' as identified by these other works? If the signature is as robust as claimed, shouldn't it come up in other studies? A thorough comparison with other findings should be made, especially if the detected signature is being proposed as a clinical biomarker.</p><p>4. The robustness of the signature seems to be calculated from the same data from where it was derived (well, more tumours were added but the original from where the signature was derived remains in the dataset). A reviewer points out that for calculating the robustness it would need to be tested on a completely independent set of tumours. In order to claim that it is a robust signature for predicting outcome, and as the authors are proposing to make a kit from it, a higher number of independent tumours should be evaluated. Can the signature be tested in TCGA data? What about the influence of ethnicity or other factors in outcome/methylation, that would maybe influence the clinical applicability of the signature?</p><p>5. Other than the listed justification for selecting the 8 genes for validation, was there a unifying rationale? The selection appears very arbitrary.</p><p>6. There seems to be a difference between cell lines and patient samples for MYH1, which is hypermethylated in the former but hypomethylated in the latter. Can the authors speculate why that is? Is MYH1 a good marker if the methylation status is different in cells and patient specimens?</p><p>7. In line 524, it says &quot;Going forward, a signature could be used to develop a much-needed early diagnostic DNA methylation kit&quot;. Do the authors envision that these genes can help in the diagnosis of melanoma? But these were derived from comparing metastasis/aggressive cell lines vs their counterpart – perhaps it would potentially be more useful in predicting metastasis?</p><p>8. Why was 1 year chosen to separate short and long survival? Is there a clinical or scientific rationale?</p><p>9. In the Discussion, it would be good to add why the authors think these four specific genes came up – what do they do in isolation that seems so critical for tumour progression? Also, are four genes really enough to generate a clinically applicable signature for metastasis/survival? Wouldn't other factors (e.g. mutations, or gene expression) need to be taken into account to predict this phenomenon? Are the 4 methylated genes also differentially expressed and do expression levels correlate with survival? Could the expression of these 4 genes be used to create a score for prognosis?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;DNA methylome combined with chromosome cluster-oriented analysis provides an early signature for cutaneous melanoma aggressiveness&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by W Kimryn Rathmell (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1. Both reviewers agree that it is unclear why the authors state that the methylation status need not be consistent between cell lines and patient samples to be a useful biomarker, and the reviewers consider that further discussion is warranted. The authors state throughout the manuscript and in the response to the reviewers that their prognostic signature relies on 5 CpGs but not on the 4 genes themselves. If so, why were genes with putative functions in cancer prioritized in the first place? Conversely, if the CpG harboring genes have roles in cancer, as the authors have shown for miR-199 and PCDHB15, wouldn't the methylation state (hyper vs hypo in the case of MYH1) be important? In other words, is it valid to simply score for changes in methylation rather than increase vs decrease for a biomarker, and if so, why? This seemingly shifting focus should be better discussed.</p><p>2. A reviewer argues that, although they understand the authors' explanation that the identified methylated regions are not all measured in publicly available datasets, the fact remains that the signature has not been validated in a larger dataset. Therefore, they consider it a little premature to claim that the identified methylated regions can be incorporated into a kit to test melanoma progression risk. We recommend that this section in the discussion is softened.</p><p>3. If the score for BCL2L10 is the mean of the two CpGs, then isn't it possible that this marker will not score in cases where methylation of one CpG is increased while the other is decreased and they cancel each other out? This should also be discussed.</p><p>4. Finally, we ask that some explanations provided for the reviewers also be included in the main text, specifically, the answer to major points #2, #5 (which are not clear from the revised text), #7, and #8.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78587.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

According to the information provided by the American Type Culture Collection, the sampling ages were 55 years for both WM115 and WM266-4 cell lines (established from a female patient), and 54 years for the WM983A and WM983B cell lines (male patient). This suggests that the compared cell lines were established either simultaneously or with a short delay. After reception from ATCC, the cell lines were amplified and rapidly frozen in order to perform experiments with low-passage cells (&lt;20). The same was done with the cell lines M4Be, TW12 and M4BeS2 that are lab strains. Whereas one cannot exclude that some modifications of DNA methylation occurred through the process of establishing and culturing the cells, careful cell culture practices and experimental planning were applied to limit the cell culture process-related divergence of DNA methylation between the cell line to be compared.</p><p>To clarify this point, the material and methods section was modified at page 4 and a comment was added in the Results section at page 9.</p><p>Noteworthy, the bias induced by the in vitro culture of the cell lines should be minimized by our working hypothesis i.e.; the methylation traits of aggressiveness are independent of the context and common among pairs of cell lines for which the aggressiveness is obtained in different settings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Please explain why gene function was one of the means (non-oriented strategy) used for selecting candidate hypermethylated genes. A biomarker does not have to also have a cancer-associated function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referee for raising this point. Indeed, biomarkers do not need to be associated to a cancer function and the 5 CpGs that we have found are on 4 different gene promoters and are not necessarily associated to the expression of the corresponding gene. Nevertheless, in the initial selection strategy, we made the opportunistic choice to restrict the analysis to CpGs in promoters or first exons that are associated to key biological processes to have the possibility to focus in parallel on candidates having a biological function associated to DNA methylation changes in cutaneous melanoma. This analysis allowed us to identify that miR199-3p is silenced by promoter hypermethylation promoting metastasis formation (Dejobert et al. Clin. Epigenetics 2019, doi: 10.1186/s13148-018-0600-2) and that one of the 4 genes that bear the 5 CpGs of the signature plays a role in inhibiting invasion, aggregation and lung metastasis formation in vivo when stably overexpressed in metastatic melanoma cells (manuscript submitted, attached as supplementary file for the referees only). Finally, we have also analyzed the expression level and the impact of the DNA demethylation treatment by 5AzadC on the expression of the 8 genes to assess the reversibility by RT-PCR and Rt-qPCR, but this was only informative and was not used in the selection process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. How do the hypermethylated genes compare with those that have been identified by other groups that study melanoma metastasis (e.g. these papers PMID 26091043, 32406600)? Do they overlap? Do the genes identified in Carrier et al. constitute a 'methylation group' as identified by these other works? If the signature is as robust as claimed, shouldn't it come up in other studies?

We have selected these because the showed the highest methylation changes in the first set of patient samples that we used. In addition, the first paper cited, PMID 260991043, performed genome sequencing looking for mutations and measured expression and protein levels but not DNA methylation profiles. Whereas reference PMID32406600, as discussed in the Discussion section at page 20, analyzed the DNA methylation only by the Illumina 450k array without using another complementary technique, thus the data are not available for all the five CpGs that we selected. However, as suggested by the referees, we have calculated a score for the 2 CpG available in this study (MYH1 and BCL2L10) and we obtain a similar trend with a p=0.01 with the log rank test and non significant with the wilcoxon test. To have a significant score we need the methylation values of the 5 CpGs simultaneously.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78587-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This has been clarified in the Discussion part at page 19. It is however important to underline that we did proceed in two steps. The first was the selection of the CpGs that showed the most significant changes among a first set of 18 patient samples from primary and metastatic tumors (data not shown).</p><p>This highlighted the difference between the primary and metastatic tumors and a clustering of the primary in two subsets that were found related to the delay of survival. Then we analyzed the selected CpGs in a bigger cohort of primary tumors collected from different centers (49 in total) reported in Figure 4 of the manuscript. The application of the signature of 5 CpGs that we have identified as clinical biomarker are beyond the scope of the manuscript, but it is something that we are pursuing. The fact that the signature consists in the methylation level of 5 CpG has the advantage that it can be multiplexed in one assay. However, primary tumors are mainly detected and removed at town dermatologists so it is important to develop an assay that can be readily used. We are investigating several options. Here we report, the following main and original results: (1) the observation that robust DNA methylation traits of aggressiveness are independent of the physiological context; (2) the methodology of combining DNA methylome analysis and chromosome cluster-based analysis that can be applied beyond melanoma, and (3) the identification of the methylation of 5 CpGs (and not genes) that provide a predictive value of the aggressiveness of the melanoma in primary tumors.Concerning the influence of other factors, we analysed the Breslow factor and the combination of the two has a very positive impact on the hazard ratio (Figure 4-Supplement 2). Other additional factors were not analysed because of the limited size of the cohort, however it is important to underline that the samples we collected in centers located in different countries in Europe (France, Portugal and Italy) and in the US (California), and that the signature is robust across these diverse environments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Other than the listed justification for selecting the 8 genes for validation, was there a unifying rationale? The selection appears very arbitrary.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for the comment as we realize that this point needed to be clarified. he choice was not arbitrary. The 8 genes chosen among the 19 common genes obtained from the oriented and non-oriented strategies have the following features: (1) they were distributed on chromosomes with clusters of methylation, (2) they correspond to peaks of hypermethylation and 3/ have a potential function role in cancer formation. For example, we were interested in genes that were not described in melanoma but showed a functional role in other cancers, as the PCDHB and MYH clusters. This has been clarified in the Results section at page 13 before the description of the genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. There seems to be a difference between cell lines and patient samples for MYH1, which is hypermethylated in the former but hypomethylated in the latter. Can the authors speculate why that is? Is MYH1 a good marker if the methylation status is different in cells and patient specimens?</p></disp-quote><p>We were looking for the most important changes in the methylation values at single CpGs independently of the decrease or increase. The CpG found in MYH resulted to be correlated to a decrease in methylation rather than an increase in the first set of patient samples and thus we kept it considering this feature. It is important to note that here we did not focus on genes but rather on CpGs and in total five CpGs that are located on four different genes showed the most important DNA methylation changes. This is in agreement with comment #2 that the biomarkers do not need to be associated to cancer functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In line 524, it says &quot;Going forward, a signature could be used to develop a much-needed early diagnostic DNA methylation kit&quot;. Do the authors envision that these genes can help in the diagnosis of melanoma? But these were derived from comparing metastasis/aggressive cell lines vs their counterpart – perhaps it would potentially be more useful in predicting metastasis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is exact. We have clarified the sentence in the text that was confusing. The 5 CpGs do not help to diagnose melanoma, they show, in primary tumors, a predictive score of the aggressiveness of the melanoma meaning the survival rate. Thus, the methylation level of the five CpGs combined for example with the Breslow score (Figure 4-Supplement 2) can be used to identify the patients that are at risk when primary tumors are collected and removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Why was 1 year chosen to separate short and long survival? Is there a clinical or scientific rationale?</p></disp-quote><p>One year was chosen because at the time of the sampling and the beginning of the study it was the average overall survival of diagnosticated cutaneous melanoma. Recently it has been extended thanks to immune therapies but it is still not applicable at all cutaneous melanomas. In addition, the delay of one year well distinguished the two group of long and short survival.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In the Discussion, it would be good to add why the authors think these four specific genes came up – what do they do in isolation that seems so critical for tumour progression? Also, are four genes really enough to generate a clinically applicable signature for metastasis/survival? Wouldn't other factors (e.g. mutations, or gene expression) need to be taken into account to predict this phenomenon? Are the 4 methylated genes also differentially expressed and do expression levels correlate with survival? Could the expression of these 4 genes be used to create a score for prognosis?</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to underline that it is not 4 genes but 5 CpGs located in 4 different genes. The purpose is not to use gene expression – that is not regulated by a single CpGs-, but the difference in methylation levels of these CpGs. For a biomarker, 5 CpGs can be sufficient. Lyskjaer et al. have recently shown that the methylation at 4 CpGs is a prognostic biomarker for osteosarcoma (Lyskjaer et al. Eur J Cancer. 2022 doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2022.03.002). This has been underlined in the discussion and the reference has been added at page 22.</p><p>As suggested by the referees, we have indeed looked at the expression of the genes aiming at identifying potential functional candidates for melanoma aggressiveness. This led to the identification of the PCDHB cluster and in particular PCDHB15 that we have further characterized.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1.

If so, why were genes with putative functions in cancer prioritized in the first place? Conversely, if the CpG harboring genes have roles in cancer, as the authors have shown for miR-199 and PCDHB15, wouldn't the methylation state (hyper vs hypo in the case of MYH1) be important? In other words, is it valid to simply score for changes in methylation rather than increase vs decrease for a biomarker, and if so, why? This seemingly shifting focus should be better discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment because it indicates that it is not clear in our text. As we wanted to identify specific methylation states monitoring melanoma aggressiveness, we chose not to focus on gene expression, but rather on CpGs that were highly differentially methylated (40%) in aggressive melanoma compared to the non-aggressive counterpart and CpGs that are common in whatever physiological environment the melanoma acquired the aggressive trait (Figure 1 and page 4, lines 107-109 and added text lines 117-120 and page 6 lines 147-149 in the tracked version of the manuscript). DNA methylation of promoters is commonly associated to gene repression as it can shut down genes but it is not the only factor and for example treatment with DNA methylation inhibitors, such as azacitidine and decitabine, alone does not always reactivate gene expression. That is why we underline that we are not looking at the genes and their expression but specifically at the methylation status of certain CpGs. In addition, there is no clear indication that the methylation of one single CpG is regulator of gene expression. But as the referees suggest these methylated CpGs play a role in cancer formation and progression and certainly are a way of monitoring cancer formation and progression, that is on what is based our work. We thus first looked for the genomic distribution of the methylated CpGs and selected CpGs that are highly methylated, are regrouped in clusters and form peak of methylation (Figure 2). This was based on two hypothesis (described in the beginning of the Discussion section at page 13): highly methylated CpG sites correspond to peaks of methylation and could be the start of the spreading of DNA methylation, as shown in the literature, occurring very early in formation of the cancer. We considered that if they are common to melanoma cells that acquired aggressivity in very different physiological context then they would be early markers and important for cancer progression, thus potentially appropriate biomarkers. This oriented strategy, as indicated in figure 1, selected 34 genes. Then we reasoned, as the referees underlined in their comment, that, if this specific methylation is common to different aggressive melanoma, it should play a role in cancer and thus we carried out an IPA analysis (non-oriented strategy, page 7, figure 1) leading to 19 common genes to both strategies and after the analysis of the literature to 8 genes (page 8 lines 197-200 and page 14 lines 347-348). The explanation has been added in the Results section at lines 180-182 page 7. In parallel, this analysis also allowed us to identify the role of miR-199 and PCDHB15 in melanoma aggressiveness, but this role of tumour suppressor genes is not fundamental for the identification of biomarkers and is independent of it. For example, the CpGs of miR-199 were not confirmed for the methylation signature from the beginning of the pipeline process.</p><p>What we want to underline is that the signature proposed here is based on DNA methylation not on gene expression and more importantly on a strong and specific difference of DNA methylation level. For the development of potential biomarkers based on DNA methylation it is not necessary that there is correlation with gene expression (Lyskjaer et al. Eur J Cancer. 2022 doi: 10.1016/j.ejca.2022.03.00).</p><p>It is not surprising to see DNA methylation differences between patient samples and cells lines as it is also known that the environment, as cell culture, can affect DNA methylation. To increase the robustness of the results, we looked for patient samples from different regions (France, Italy, Portugal and California, as specified in the Materials and methods and added at page 14 line 369) to help identify the CpGs which difference in methylation level was the most robust and independent of the context. Thus, the initial original hypothesis that leverages the heterogeneity of melanoma and the robustness of the DNA methylome together with the multi-step process identified 5 CpGs, which showed the highest and most consistent difference in methylation levels. Finally, the methylation score is possible by the combination of the methylation status of the CpGs but not their role in expression of the corresponding gene. It is this methylation score that enables to classify the patient samples and not one by one or other combinations (Figure 4 and supplements).</p><p>We have modified the text to clarify this point, by adding in the results session our reasoning that previously was only described in the introduction and Discussion section. We have also added lines 328 to 333 at page 13 to underline the originality of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. A reviewer argues that, although they understand the authors' explanation that the identified methylated regions are not all measured in publicly available datasets, the fact remains that the signature has not been validated in a larger dataset. Therefore, they consider it a little premature to claim that the identified methylated regions can be incorporated into a kit to test melanoma progression risk. We recommend that this section in the discussion is softened.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and we have modified the text at page 15 lines 370374.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. If the score for BCL2L10 is the mean of the two CpGs, then isn't it possible that this marker will not score in cases where methylation of one CpG is increased while the other is decreased and they cancel each other out? This should also be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As underlined by the referee, the two CpGs are indeed close to each other (Figure 3 and supplement dataset1). In all our sampling the methylation level moved in the same way with similar levels for both CpG. This can be seen in the dot plot in Figure 4B in which the two CpG have been reported separately and in the heatmap below of metastasis and primary samples.</p><p>Since they move in the same direction and have a comparable difference in methylation between short-survival and long-survival samples, we took the mean value for the methylation score. In case, the two CpGs levels move in different direction it is true that they will cancel each other, but it i will be compensated by the other three CpGs of the signature. This has been added in the text at page 12 lines 289-291.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Finally, we ask that some explanations provided for the reviewers also be included in the main text, specifically, the answer to major points #2, #5 (which are not clear from the revised text), #7, and #8.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added point #2 at page 6 lines 147-149 and at page 15 lines 379-382, #5 at page 8 lines 197-200, #7 at page 15 lines 370-374 and #8 at page 10 lines 256-259.</p></body></sub-article></article>
