N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) can rapidly induce an extremely immersive state of consciousness characterized by vivid and elaborate visual imagery. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of the DMT-induced altered state from a pool of participants receiving DMT and (separately) placebo (saline) while instructed to keep their eyes closed. Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed a spatio-temporal pattern of cortical activation (i.e. travelling waves) similar to that elicited by visual stimulation. Moreover, the typical top-down alpha-band rhythms of closed-eyes rest were significantly decreased, while the bottom-up forward wave was significantly increased. These results support a recent model proposing that psychedelics reduce the ‘precision-weighting of priors’, thus altering the balance of top-down versus bottom-up information passing. The robust hypothesis-confirming nature of these findings imply the discovery of an important mechanistic principle underpinning psychedelic-induced altered states.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N,N, Dimethyltryptamine</kwd><kwd>DMT</kwd><kwd>travelling waves</kwd><kwd>eeg oscillations</kwd><kwd>visual hallucinations</kwd><kwd>conscious perception</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015904</institution-id><institution>Alexander Mosley Charitable Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carhart-Harris</surname><given-names>Robin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ad Astra Chandaria Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carhart-Harris</surname><given-names>Robin L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015904</institution-id><institution>CRCNS ANR-NSF</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-NEUC-0004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanRullen</surname><given-names>Rufin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica de Chile</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Timmermann</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Psychedelics induce a pattern of cortical activity very similar to the one observed during visual perception, despite participants had shut eyes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a mixed serotonin receptor agonist that occurs endogenously in several organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Christian et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nichols, 2016</xref>) including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smythies et al., 1979</xref>), albeit in trace concentrations. DMT, which is a classic psychedelic drug, is also taken exogenously by humans to alter the quality of their consciousness. For example, synthesized compound is smoked or injected but it has also been used more traditionally in ceremonial contexts (e.g. in Amerindian rituals). When ingested orally, DMT is metabolized in the gastrointestinal (GI) system before reaching the brain. Its consumption has most traditionally occurred via drinking ‘Ayahuasca’, a brew composed of plant-based DMT and <italic>β</italic> –carbolines (monoamine oxidize inhibitors), which inhibit the GI breakdown of the DMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckholtz and Boggan, 1977</xref>). Modern scientific research has mostly focused on intravenously injected DMT. Administered in this way, DMT’s subjective effects have a rapid onset, reaching peak intensity after about 2–5 min and subsiding thereafter, with negligible effects felt after about 30 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strassman, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strassman, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Previous electrophysiological studies investigating changes in spontaneous (resting state) brain function elicited by ayahuasca have reported consistent broadband decreases in oscillatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>), while others have noted that the most marked decreases occur in α-band oscillations (8–12 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schenberg et al., 2015</xref>). Alpha decreases correlated inversely with the intensity of ayahuasca-induced visual hallucinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valle et al., 2016</xref>) and are arguably the most reliable neurophysiological signature of the psychedelic state identified to-date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>) – with increased signal diversity or entropy being another particularly reliable biomarker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schartner et al., 2017</xref>). In the first EEG study of the effects of pure DMT on on-going brain activity, marked decrease in the α and β (13–30 Hz) band power was observed as well as increase in signal diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>). Increase in lower frequency band power (δ = 0.5–4 Hz and θ = 4–7 Hz) also became evident when the signal was decomposed into its oscillatory component. Decreased alpha power and increased signal diversity correlated most strongly with DMT’s subjective effects – consolidating the view that these are principal signatures of the DMT state, if not the psychedelic state more broadly.</p><p>Focusing attention onto normal brain function, outside of the context of psychoactive drugs, electrophysiological recordings in cortical regions reveal distinct spatio-temporal dynamics during visual perception, which differ considerably from those observed during closed-eyes restfulness. It is possible to describe these dynamics as oscillatory ‘travelling waves’, i.e. fronts of rhythmic activity which propagate across regions in the cortical visual hierarchy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sato et al., 2012</xref>). Recent results showed that travelling waves can spread from occipital to frontal regions during visual perception, reflecting the forward bottom-up flow of information from lower to higher regions. Conversely, top-down propagation from higher to lower regions appears to predominate during quiet restfulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Halgren et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Taken together these results compel us to ask how travelling waves may be affected by DMT, particularly given their association with predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Friston, 2019</xref>) and a recent predictive coding inspired hypothesis on the action of psychedelics (‘REBUS’) – which posits decreased top-down processing and increased bottom-up signal passing under these compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). Moreover, DMT lends itself particularly well to the testing of this hypothesis as its visual effects are so pronounced. Given that visual perception is associated with an increasing in forward travelling waves and eyes-closed visual imagery under DMT can feel as if one is ‘seeing with eyes shut’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Araujo et al., 2012</xref>) – does a consistent increase in forward travelling waves under DMT account for this phenomenon?</p><p>Here we sought to address these questions by quantifying the amount and direction of travelling waves in a sample of healthy participants who received DMT intravenously, during eyes-closed conditions. We hypothesized that DMT acts by disrupting the normal physiological balance between top-down and bottom-up information flow, in favour of the latter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>). Moreover, we ask: does this effect correlate with the vivid ‘visionary’ component of the DMT experience? Providing evidence in favour of this hypothesis would indicate that forward travelling waves do play a crucial role in conscious visual experience, irrespective of the presence of actual photic stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Quantifying travelling waves</title><p>As demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nunez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>), in most systems, including the human brain, travelling waves occur in groups (or packets) over some range of spatial wavelengths having multiple spatial and temporal frequencies. Given any configurations of electrodes, only parts of these packets can be successfully detected, i.e. waves shorter than the spatial extent of the array, and waves longer than twice the electrode separation distance (Nyquist criterion in space). In scalp recordings, the shorter waves may be mostly removed by volume conduction. As a consequence, waves recorded directly from the cortex emphasize shorter waves than the scalp recorded waves. Specifically, in the case of small cortical arrays, the overlap between cortical and scalp data may be minimal, and the estimated wave properties (including propagation direction) may differ. Additionally, it is important to consider that when waves are travelling in multiple directions at nearly the same time in ‘closed’ systems (e.g. the cortical/white matter), waves either damp out or interfere with each other to form standing waves (e.g. alpha waves travelling both forward and backward). It is reasonable to assume that the behaviour of these properties will relate to global brain and mind states, and be sensitive to state-altering psychoactive drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nunez, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nunez and Srinivasan, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Practically, we measure the waves’ amount and direction with a method devised in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). We slide a one-second time-window over the EEG signals (with 0.5 s overlap). For each time-window, we generate a 2D map (time/electrodes) by stacking the signals from five central mid-line electrodes (Oz to FCz, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For each map, we then compute a 2D-FFT, in which the upper- and lower-left quadrant represent the power of forward (FW) and backward (BW) travelling waves, respectively (since the 2D-FFT is symmetrical around the origin, the lower- and upper-right quadrants contain the same information). From both quadrants we extracted the maximum values, representing the raw amount of FW and BW waves in that time-window. Next, we performed the same procedure after having shuffled the electrodes’ order, thereby disrupting spatial information (including the waves’ directionality) while retaining the same overall spectral power. In other words, the surrogate measures reflect the amount of waves expected solely due to the temporal fluctuations of the signal. After having computed the maximum values for the FW and BW waves of the surrogate 2D-FFT spectra one hundred times (and averaging the 100 values), we compute the net amount of FW and BW waves in decibel (dB), by applying the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Quantifying cortical waves.</title><p>From each 1 s EEG epoch we extract a 2D-map, obtained by stacking signals from five midline electrodes. For each map we compute a 2D-FFT in which the maximum values in the upper- and lower-left quadrants represent respectively the amount of forward (FW – in blue) and backward (BW – in red) waves. For each map, we also compute surrogate values by shuffling the electrodes’ order 100 times, so as to retain temporal fluctuations while disrupting the spatial structure of the signals (including any travelling waves). Eventually, we compute the wave strength in decibel (dB) by combining the real and the surrogate values.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59784-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>where W represents the maximum value extracted for each quadrant (i.e. forward FW or backward BW), and Wss the respective surrogate value. Importantly, this value – expressed in decibel – represents the net amount of waves against the null distribution. In other words, it is informative to compare this value to zero, to assess the significance of waves. On the other hand, a direct comparison between FW and BW waves in each time-bin is not readily interpretable, as it is possible to simultaneously record waves propagating in both directions—as observed during visual stimulation epochs (see below). In addition, it’s important to note that our waves’ analysis focuses on the sensor level, as source projections presents a number of important limitations, such as impairing long-range connections, as well as smearing of signals due to scalp interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Freeman and Barrie, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nunez, 1974</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Does DMT influence travelling waves?</title><p>After defining our measure of the waves’ amount and direction, we investigated whether the intake of DMT alters the cortical pattern of travelling waves. Participants underwent two sessions in which they were injected with either placebo or DMT (see Materials and methods for details). Importantly, during all of the experiments, participants rested in a semi-supine position, with their eyes closed. EEG recordings were collected 5 min prior to drug administration and up to 20 min after. The left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the amount of BW and FW waves in the 5 min preceding and following drug injection (either placebo or DMT). Consistent with previous observations on independent data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>), during quiet closed-eyes restfulness a significant amount of BW waves spread from higher to lower regions (as confirmed by a Bayesian t-test against zero for both DMT and Placebo conditions, BFs<sub>10</sub> &gt;&gt;100, error &lt;0.01%, 95% Credible Intervals (CI) DMT: [0.221, 0.637], Placebo: [0.273, 0.666]), whereas no significant waves propagate in the opposite FW direction (Bayesian t-test against zero: BFs<sub>10</sub> &lt;0.15, error &lt;0.01%; 95% CI DMT: [−0.424, 0.088], Placebo: [−0.372, 0.110]). However, after DMT injection, the cortical pattern changed drastically: the amount of BW waves decreased (but remaining significantly above zero – BFs<sub>10</sub> = 12.6, 95% CI: [0.057, 0.322]), whereas the amount of FW waves increased significantly above zero (BF<sub>10</sub> = 5.4 95% CI: [0.027, 0.336]). These results, obtained by comparing the amount of waves before and after injection (pre-post factor) of Placebo or DMT (drug factor), were confirmed by two Bayesian ANOVA performed separately on BW and FW waves (all factors including interactions reported BFs<sub>10</sub> &gt;&gt;100, error &lt;2%), and were not confounded by differences in dosage (see Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This suggests that the dominant natural propagation spread of travelling waves is along the axis that connects the furthest posterior and frontal recording channels. As a control, we additionally demonstrated that waves propagating from leftward to rightward regions (and vice versa), were not affected by DMT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Furthermore, we ran a more temporally precise analysis, on a minute-by-minute scale, testing the amount of FW and BW waves in the two conditions, as shown in the right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. in-line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strassman, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Strassman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>), the changes in cortical dynamics appeared rapidly after intravenous DMT injection, and began to fade after about 10 min. Confirming our previous analysis, we observed an increase in FW waves (asterisks in the upper-right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> show FDR-corrected significant p-values when testing against zero) and a decrease in BW waves, which, nonetheless, remained above zero (all FDR-corrected p-values&lt;0.05). To our initial surprise, the dynamics elicited by DMT injection were remarkably reminiscent of those observed in another study, in which healthy participants alternated visual stimulation with periods of blank screen, without any drug manipulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2020</xref>). Although a direct comparison is not statistically possible (because the two studies involved distinct subject groups and different EEG recording setups), we indirectly investigated the similarities between these two scenarios.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparison with perceptual stimulation</title><p>We recently showed that FW travelling waves increase during visual stimulation, whereas BW waves decrease, in-line with their putative functional role in information transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2020</xref>).

Remarkably, mutatis mutandis, both FW and BW waves share a similar profile across the two conditions, increasing and decreasing respectively following DMT injection or visual stimulation. If we consider the absolute (maximum) power values derived from the 2D-FFT of each map (i.e. before estimating the surrogates and the waves’ net amount in decibel) as an estimate of spectral power, we can read the results reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> as an overall decrease in oscillatory power following DMT injection, more specifically in the frequency band with the highest power values (i.e. alpha band, but see next paragraph) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schenberg et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>). Such decrease in oscillatory power is also matched by a similar decrease induced by visual stimulation (all Bayesian t-test BFs<sub>10</sub> &gt;&gt;100). These results demonstrate that, despite participants having their eyes-closed throughout, DMT produces spatio-temporal dynamics similar to those elicited by true visual stimulation. These results therefore shed light on the neural mechanisms involved in DMT-induced visionary phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Does DMT influence the frequency of travelling waves?</title><p>Previous studies showed that DMT alters specific frequency bands (e.g. alpha-band <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schenberg et al., 2015</xref>), mostly by decreasing overall oscillatory power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Riba et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we investigated whether DMT influences not only the waves’ direction but also their frequency spectrum. We compared the frequencies of the maximum peaks extracted from the 2D-FFT (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) before and after DMT or Placebo injection. Before infusion, both FW and BW waves had a strong alpha-range oscillatory rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, labeled ‘PRE’). Remarkably, following DMT injection, the waves’ spectrum changed drastically, with a significant reduction in the alpha-band, coupled with an increase in the delta and theta bands, for both FW (δ-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 391.16, θ-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 19.23, α-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 16.04, β-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.64; all errors &lt; 0.001%) and BW waves (δ-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 82.56, θ-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 30.58, α-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 549.54, β-band: BF<sub>10</sub> = 1.43; all errors &lt; 0.005%).

In an attempt to understand the overall relationship between FW and BW waves, we focused on the minutes when both BW and FW waves were significantly larger than 0 (minutes 2 to 5 after DMT injection, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On these data we performed a moment-by-moment correlation between their respective net amount (as measured in decibel – see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found a clear and significant negative relationship (Bayesian t-test against zero, pre-DMT BF<sub>10</sub> = 393.1, error &lt;0.0001%, 95% CI: [−0.448,–0.212]; Post-DMT BF<sub>10</sub> = 381.9, error &lt;0.0001%, 95% CI: [−0.479,–0.226]), very consistent across participants and irrespective of DMT injection (difference between pre- and post-, Bayesian t-test BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.225; error&lt;0.02% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, first panel). This result demonstrates that, in general, FW waves tend to be weaker whenever BW waves are stronger, and vice versa. In other words, FW and BW remain present after drug injection, sum to a consistent total amount, and remain inversely related; it is only the ratio of contribution from each that changes after DMT (i.e. less BW, more FW waves).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Travelling waves directions.</title><p>There is a negative correlation between the net amount of FW and BW waves, which is not influenced by the ingestion of DMT (left panel).

Specifically, for 20 min after DMT injection participants provided an intensity rating every minute and, when subjective effects faded, participants filled various questionnaires that addressed different aspects of the experience (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref> for details). First, we found a robust correlation between minute-by-minute intensity rates and the amplitude of the waves, as shown in the first panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. This result reveals that the developing intensity of the drug’s subjective effects and changes in the amplitude of waves correlate positively (FW) or negatively (BW) across time, both peaking a few minutes after drug injection. Second, treating each time point independently, we again correlated intensity ratings with the amount of each wave type, across subjects. The middle panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows a clear trend for the correlation coefficients over time. Despite the limited number of data-points (n = 12), the correlation coefficients reach high values (~0.4), implying that, around the moment where the drug had its maximal effect (2–5 min after injection), those subjects who reported the most intense effects were also those who had the strongest travelling waves in the FW direction, and the weakest waves in the BW direction. Finally, we correlated the amount of FW and BW waves with ratings focused specifically on visual imagery: remarkably, ratings of all of the relevant questionnaire items correlated strongly with the increased amount of FW waves under DMT. As the same relationship was not apparent for the BW waves, this consolidates the view that visionary experiences under DMT correspond to higher amounts of FW waves in particular. Taken together with previous results from visual stimulation experiments independent of DMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), these data strongly support the principle that cortical travelling waves (and increased FW waves in particular) correlate with the conscious visual experiences, whether induced exogenously (via direct visual stimulation) or endogenously (visionary or hallucinatory experiences).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Travelling waves vs subjective ratings.</title><p>The first panel shows the correlation between intensity rate and waves amplitude across time-points.

The last panel shows the correlation coefficients between the visual imagery specific ratings provided at the end of the experiment (i.e. Visual Analogue Scale, see methods) and the net amount of waves (measured when both BW and FW were significantly different than zero, i.e. from minutes 2 to 5): for all 20 items in the questionnaire there was a positive trend between the amount of FW waves and the intensity of visual imagery, as confirmed by a Bayesian t-test against zero (BF for FW waves &gt;&gt; 100).

DMT has been evoking particular interest in recent decades, with new studies into its basic pharmacology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dean et al., 2019</xref>), endogenous function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 2012</xref>) and effects on cortical activity in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Artigas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Riga et al., 2014</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Daumann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Araujo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Valle et al., 2016</xref>). There has been a surprising dearth of resting-state human neuroimaging studies involving pure DMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palhano-Fontes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>) which, given its profound and basic effects on conscious awareness, could be viewed as a scientific oversight.</p><p>Previous work involving ayahuasca and BOLD fMRI found increased visual cortex BOLD signal under the drug vs placebo while participants engaged in an eyes-closed imagery task – a result that was interpreted as consistent with the ‘visionary’ effects of ayahuasca (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Araujo et al., 2012</xref>). Despite some initial debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bartolomeo, 2008</xref>), it is now generally accepted that occipital cortex becomes activated during visual imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fulford et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pearson, 2019</xref>).

Future work could extend this principle to other apparently endogenous generated visionary experiences such as dream visions and other hallucinatory states. We would hypothesize a consistent favouring of FW waves during these states. If consistent mechanisms were also found to underpin hallucinatory experiences in other sensory modalities – such as the auditory one, a basic principle underlying sensory hallucinations might be established.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Pharmacological considerations</title><p>As a classic serotonergic psychedelic drug, DMT’s signature psychological effects are likely mediated by stimulation of the serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor subtype.

In addition to its role in mediating altered perceptual experiences under psychedelics, the 5-HT2A receptor has also been linked to visual hallucinations in neurological disorders, with a 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist having been licensed for hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson’s disease with additional evidence for its efficacy in reducing consistent symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballard et al., 2018</xref>).

According to predictive coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang and Rao, 2011</xref>), the brain strives to be a model of its environment. More specifically, based on the assumption that the cortex is a hierarchical system – message passing from higher cortical levels is proposed to encode predictions about the activity of lower levels. This mechanism is interrupted when predictions are contradicted by the lower-level activity (‘prediction error’) – in which case, information passes up the cortical hierarchy where it can update predictions. Predictive coding has recently served as a guiding framework for explaining the psychological and functional brain effects of psychedelic compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pink-Hashkes et al., 2017</xref>). According to one model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019</xref>), psychedelics decrease the precision- weighting of top-down priors, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow. Various aspects of the multi-level action of psychedelics are consistent with this model, such as the induction of asynchronous neuronal discharge rates in cortical layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Celada et al., 2008</xref>), reduced alpha oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muthukumaraswamy et al., 2013</xref>) increased signal complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schartner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>) and the breakdown of large-scale intrinsic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carhart-Harris et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent empirically supported modelling work has lent support to assumptions that top-down predictions and bottom-up prediction-errors are encoded in the direction of propagating cortical travelling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>).

Although we are restricted to speculation by the lack of direct experimental manipulation of top-down and bottom-up sensory inputs, our prior assumptions were so emphatically endorsed by the data, including how propagation-shifts related to subjective experience, that, in-line with prior hypotheses and motivations for the analyses, we were persuaded to infer about both the functional relevance of cortical travelling waves and brain action of psychedelics. Additional studies manipulating bottom-up and top-down analysis of sensory inputs with alternative perceptual designs will be required to confirm the relation between predictive coding, alpha-band oscillatory travelling waves and psychedelics states. Moreover, future studies can now be envisioned to examine how these assumptions translate to other phenomena such as non-drug induced visionary and hallucinatory states.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present analyses were applied to the first EEG data on the effects of DMT on human resting- state brain activity. In-line with a specific prior hypothesis, clear evidence was found of a shift in cortical travelling waves away from the normal basal predominance of backward waves and towards the predominance of forward waves – remarkably similar to what has been observed during eyes-open visual stimulation. Moreover, the increases in forward waves correlated positively with both the general intensity of DMT’s subjective effects, as well as its more specific effects on eyes-closed visual imagery. These findings have specific and broad implications: for the brain mechanisms underlying the DMT/psychedelic state as well as conscious visual perception more fundamentally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants and experimental procedure</title><p>In this study we analysed a dataset presented in a previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref>), to address a very different scientific question using another analytical approach.

Additionally, we aimed at ensuring familiarity with the research environment and the study team before providing the psychedelics compound. Given the lack of human data with DMT, progressively increasing doses were provided to different participants (four different doses were used: 7, 14, 18 and 20 mg, to 3, 4, 1, and 5 successive participants, respectively). EEG signals were recorded before and up to 20 min after drug delivery. Participants rested in a semi-supine position with their eyes closed during the duration of the whole experiment. The eyes-closed instruction was confirmed by visual inspection of the participants during dosing. At each minute, participants provided an intensity rating, while blood samples were taken at given time-points (the same for placebo and DMT conditions) via a cannula inserted in the participants’ arm. One day after the DMT session, participants reported their subjective experience completing an interview composed of several questionnaires (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Timmermann et al., 2019</xref> for details).

Eventually, we computed the actual amount of waves in decibel (dB), considering the log-ratio between the actual and the surrogate values:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">F</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>It is worth noting that this value represents the amount of significant waves against the null distribution, that is against the hypothesis of having no FW or BW waves.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All the analyses regarding the EEG signals were performed in MATLAB. Bayesian analyses were run in JASP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Team, 2018</xref>). We ran separate Bayesian ANOVA for FW and BW conditions, and we considered as factors the time of injection (pre-post, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and drug condition (DMT vs Placebo). Subjects were considered to account for random factors. Regarding the minute-by-minute analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right panels), we performed a t-test at each time-bin against zero, and we corrected all the p-values according to the False Discovery Rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2005</xref>).

DMT is a serotonergic psychedelic drug that elicits vivid hallucinations.

The authors herein propose that DMT provokes a relative change in strength of forward- and backward- α traveling waves recorded with non-invasive EEG.

For example, what if DMT influence and visual stimulation share a common primary direction, as is found, but DMT waves are more left posterior to right anterior and visual stimulation is more right posterior to left anterior (or vice versa)?</p><p>2) The sections on predictive coding are only tenuously supported by the data. In particular, I can see no discussion on how directional differences in the α band may be significant in this regard. What about situations where anterior-posterior differences are found in the δ band (Alexander et al., 2006; 2009)? Or if directional results were in another band? Because of the lack of specificity to this discussion, and the lack of explicit tests of this theoretical framework, I suggest these concepts be given a more appropriate weighting (less).</p><p>3) An obvious objection to the analysis is that it is sensor level. The authors need to address their reasons for doing this e.g. that source projections destroy real long-range correlations as well as blurring by the scalp and other tissues. See Nunez, 1974; Nunez et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2000; 2003 and Alexander et al., 2019, for a summary of these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study of the effects of the drug DMT on the direction and occurrence of EEG traveling waves seems generally plausible to me, although some important aspects are not discussed. I don't have major criticisms. However, as one who has studied EEG traveling and standing waves for many years, I worry that those unfamiliar with EEG wave phenomena may misinterpret some of these results given their partial dependence on the specific experimental methods employed. While I have not read previous papers by these authors that may fill in some of the important gaps, I list below some ideas that any reader interested in EEG waves and their neuro-scientific interpretation must be aware of. A summary paragraph in the section &quot;Quantifying travelling waves&quot; is recommended concerning the following basic concepts that must be understood if the results are to be interpreted correctly.</p><p>1) In all but the simplest systems, traveling waves occur in groups (packets) over some range of spatial wavelengths (multiple spatial frequencies, k). This is to be expected in brains, based on both theory and experiment (see Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006; 2014; Nunez, 2000).</p><p>2) Any experimental electrode array will be sensitive to only parts of these wave packets, e.g. only waves shorter than the spatial extent of the array and waves longer than twice the electrode separation distance (Nyquist criterion in space) can be resolved. In scalp recordings, the shorter waves may be mostly removed by volume conduction.</p><p>3) As a consequence of #2, waves recorded directly from the cortex (as indicated in several recent studies) will emphasize shorter waves than the scalp recorded waves. In the case of small cortical arrays, the ECoG overlap with scalp data may be minimal. Thus, the different estimated wave properties (including propagation direction) need not agree.</p><p>4) When waves are traveling in multiple directions at nearly the same time in &quot;closed&quot; systems (e.g., the cortical/white matter), there are only two possible results. Either the waves must damp out or they combine (interfere) to form standing waves (e.g. α waves traveling both forward and backward). One expects that the actual behavior depends on brain state, including the influence of drugs (see Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006; 2014; Nunez, 2000).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59784.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>I highlight three main issues that need to be addressed in a revised paper.</p><p>1) All three reviewers highlight specific points re. the limitations of the current analysis (e.g. a prior choice of electrodes) and the choice for quantifications of the traveling waves.

As explained in detail in what follows (and in the revised manuscript) we included a new analysis considering different lines of electrodes, spanning from posterior to anterior, but also left to right brain regions. We also performed an additional complementary analysis based on the suggestions of reviewer 2, showing similar results as our original analysis. Finally, as suggested by reviewer 3, we integrated the current “Quantifying travelling waves” paragraph with his generous suggestions, improving the readability of the manuscript to a non-specialized audience. We believe that these modifications will satisfy both the editor and all the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All three reviewers raised substantial concerns about the interpretability of scalp level recordings in relation to the generators of the signals as well as the inference that can be made on the traveling pattern. Reviewer 1 raised concerns about the full spectral changes that can be seen and reviewer 3 suggested the possibility of interference patterns.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the concerns raised by both reviewers, and we have included an additional analysis (now Figure 3B in the revised manuscript) that addresses specifically these concerns. Regarding the spectral changes, our new analysis avoids choosing <italic>a priori</italic> a single frequency band (i.e. the one corresponding to the global maximum in the 2D-FFT) but instead analyze the changes in all the spectrum. This novel approach, besides confirming our previous results, provides a fuller view of the overall changes in the spectral pattern induced by DMT. Concerning the source generators of the travelling waves pattern, we discuss this point in the revised manuscript, arguing that a sensor analysis is more appropriate in this case because it circumvents some limitations related specifically to source analysis (e.g. source projections impair long-range connections). Finally, as shown in Figure 4, backward and forward waves were negatively correlated on a trial by trial basis, which will tend to limit the possibility suggested by reviewer 3 of having interference patterns (resulting in standing waves).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewers 1 and 2 consider the predictive coding hypothesis a far-stretched inference of current results, and thus needs to be refined.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed carefully this point by giving overall less weight to the Predictive Coding hypothesis in the Discussion, as suggested by both reviewers. Additionally, as suggested specifically by reviewer 2, we clarify in the revised Discussion the link between Predictive Coding, α oscillations and travelling waves, and the motivation behind our original hypothesis and the relationship with the present results. More precisely, we previously demonstrated how a model based on Predictive Coding principles and implementing biologically plausible constraints gives rise to α-band travelling waves, whose direction of propagation depends on the “cognitive” state of the model/subject (FW during visual stimulation, BW during closed-eyes resting state). Then, starting from the premise that psychedelics disrupt prior distributions encoded in hierarchically high-level properties of brain function (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019), we formulated the specific hypothesis that DMT could specifically disrupt α-band travelling waves, enhancing their feed-forward propagation while decreasing the feed-back direction. All in all, we found it remarkable that such a specific hypothesis received such clear support in the data. However, we understand that interpretations can always be queried and more work is needed to scrutinize the one we offer based on our specific prior hypothesis. We have now rephrased our interpretation substantially in the revised version of the manuscript, to soften our conclusions and emphasize the need for more research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, Alamia and colleagues describe the effect of N,N, Dimethyltryptamine DMT on the resting-state dynamics of α traveling waves.

Regarding the relationship between the spectral changes in the EEG and the changes in the amount of waves, we performed an additional analysis quantifying these changes as a function of each frequency (i.e. extracting in the 2D-FFT the maximum value separately for each frequency). The first row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> (integrated in the revised version of the manuscript as figure 3B) shows the amount of FW and BW waves (in dB –as compared to the surrogate distribution) before and after DMT or Placebo infusion (i.e. Pre and Post). The second row shows the difference in the amount of waves between DMT and Placebo for each frequency. Interestingly the largest changes occur in the α band frequency for both forward and backward waves, even though after correcting for multiple comparison we found a significant reduction only in the BW α band. This analysis shows that, as suggested by the reviewer, the changes in the spectral fingerprint of the EEG do influence the waves’ propagation in several frequencies, but the largest changes systematically occur in the α band. This additional analysis has been introduced in the Results section (paragraph: “Does DMT influence the frequency of travelling waves?”)</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>The upper panels show the amount of waves computed at each frequency of the 2D-FFT (i.</title><p>e. not considering the maximum power per quadrant as in A, but considering it separately for each frequency), for FW and BW waves, pre- and post- infusion. The lower panels show the difference between DMT- and placebo-induced waves for each condition. As shown in the previous analysis, DMT induces an overall decrease of the waves’ amplitude, especially pronounced (and significant) in the α band BW waves, with the notable exception of FW waves in the α range, where an DMT-induced increase is observed.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59784-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding the relationship between FW and BW waves, our analysis –shown in Figure 4 of the manuscript- suggests that after DMT –or during photic visual stimulation- FW and BW waves do not co-occur simultaneously, but tend to alternate temporally, as revealed by the negative correlation. We agree with the reviewer that moving dipoles could be responsible for the generation of these signals, as reported in an in-depth analysis of a previous paper investigating the source localization of similar waves patterns (Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019). In line with a similar comment from reviewer 2, we added in the manuscript a reference to source vs sensors analysis (“In addition, it is important to note that our waves’ analysis focuses on the sensor level, as source projections present a number of important limitations, such as impairing long-range connections, as well as smearing of signals due to scalp interference (Alexander et al., 2019; Freeman and Barrie, 2000; Nunez, 1974).” Lastly, a previous analysis on the same dataset (Timmermann et al., 2019) identified a correlation between theta- and δ-band spectral power changes and subjective behavior, but not for changes in the α range. This suggests that the correlation reported in Figure 5 is not a direct consequence of changes in the EEG spectral power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors present a sensor level analysis of traveling waves in the EEG, during dosage with DMT or saline.

As correctly noticed, our current method to detect travelling waves focuses exclusively on the Anterior-Posterior axis, in line with our previous studies (Alamia and VanRullen, 2019; Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019; Pang et al., 2020). However, we agree that more can be inferred from the data from other electrodes (see next point and comment to reviewer 1 for waves’ quantification on other axes). We applied a method similar to Alexander et al., 2006, 2009 and 2016, thus considering the phase of the signal over the entire array of electrodes. Specifically, we computed the phase of the α band-pass filtered signals pre- and post- DMT infusion, and referenced it to the central electrode Cz. The relative phase thus describes the propagation of the wave as compared to this electrodes: positive lags (in yellow in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>) characterize earlier components, whereas negative lags (in blue) are associated with signals lagging behind. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> summarizes the results in all conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Relative phase obtained by computing the difference between the phases of the α band-pass filtered signal of each channel and Cz.</title><p>Reassuringly, the pattern of results confirms the disruption of the top-down flow, counterbalanced by a bottom-up component, specifically after the infusion of DMT, in line with our original analysis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59784-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Interestingly, we observed that after placebo, the typical top-down propagation of α-band waves remains unaltered, whereas after DMT, waves propagate both FW and BW, as revealed by an overall phase distribution around zero. Overall these results confirmed the one obtained with the 2D-FFT approach. We opted for keeping the latter for consistency with our previous studies (but we mentioned this result in the revised manuscript along with the references)</p><p>“Besides, in line with previous work on travelling waves (Alexander et al., 2013, 2006), an additional analysis based on relative phases of the α band-pass signals over all channels confirmed the same results, with DMT disrupting the typical top-down propagation of α-band waves (not shown).”</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the approach used by (Massimini et al., 2004), would allow to identify the detailed path of the waves, and potentially their velocity. However, in their work, Massimini and colleagues targeted slow 1Hz waves (the signal was actually low-pass filtered at 4Hz); for each cycle waves were tracked based on the localization of the main (negative) peak whose voltage was below a threshold of -80 V. This approach, which provides reliable results for low-frequency waves, may present some non-trivial additional limitations when applied to higher frequencies. Specifically, the identification of each peak/cycle may not be straightforward for higher frequencies (e.g. α band); in Massimini et al. the time window used to identify the peak spanned between +/-800ms to the earliest peak, but such a window should be proportionally much shorter to isolate single peaks in the α range, and thus be increasingly more sensitive to jittered noise. We therefore favored the 2D-FFT approach, which –despite its own limitations- seemed more suitable to describe waves with higher temporal frequencies. Finally, regarding the waves speed, it is possible to estimate their velocity from the 2D-FFT, considering both spatial and temporal frequencies as shown in our previous study (Alamia and VanRullen, 2019). The reported results are consistent with the speed recorded for cortical waves (macroscopic scale, speed ~1.5 – 2.0 m/s (Muller et al., 2018)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It seems possible that important features of the data have been missed by limiting the analysis to electrodes FCz to Oz.

Accordingly, and in line with the concerns of reviewer 1, we explored different lines of electrodes, to identify other axes of propagation. As shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, comparing PRE and POST DMT infusion reveals an increase of waves propagating from posterior to anterior regions considering an array of electrodes arranged from right posterior to left anterior (diag1 in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Bayesian t-test BF=4.059, error=0.002%) and from left posterior to right anterior (diag2 in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Bayesian t-test BF=4.848, error=0.0001%), similarly to the results obtained considering the main posterior-anterior axis (Bayesian t-test BF=5.4, error=0.001%). Additionally, we revealed a significant amount of waves (larger than 0 dB) propagating along the coronal line of electrodes (i.e. leftward and rightward), but those waves were not influenced by DMT infusion (for both leftward and rightward waves BF&lt;0.4, error~0.02%). We included these analyses in the Results section and as Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</p><p>“In order to explore different propagation axes than the midline, we ran the same analysis on one array of electrodes running from posterior right to anterior left regions, and one from posterior left to anterior right ones: in both cases we obtained similar results as for the midline electrodes, that is, an increase and a decrease of FW and BW waves respectively following DMT infusion (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2).This suggests that the waves’ propagation spread to most posterior and frontal recording channels As a control, we additionally demonstrated that waves propagating from leftward to rightward regions (and vice versa) were not affected by DMT, as predicted by our hypothesis (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The sections on predictive coding are only tenuously supported by the data. In particular, I can see no discussion on how directional differences in the α band may be significant in this regard. What about situations where anterior-posterior differences are found in the δ band (Alexander et al., 2006; 2009)? Or if directional results were in another band? Because of the lack of specificity to this discussion, and the lack of explicit tests of this theoretical framework, I suggest these concepts be given a more appropriate weighting (less).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and thank the reviewer for pointing out this shortcoming in the Discussion. The focus on the α-band originates from our previous study (Alamia and VanRullen, 2019) in which we demonstrated how a minimal Predictive Coding model implementing biologically plausible constraints (i.e. temporal delays in the communication between regions and time constants) generates α-band travelling waves whose direction of propagation is matched by experimental data. This result was the starting hypothesis that motivated the investigation of α-band travelling waves after DMT-infusion, under the hypothesis of the REBUS model (psychedelics disrupt prior distributions in higher brain regions- Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). In the revised version of the manuscript, we clarify the link between Predictive Coding, α oscillations and travelling waves. However, we agree with this reviewer (and reviewer 1 and the editor) that the Predictive Coding interpretation may not be directly but only indirectly supported by the current data, and so we have rephrased the relevant section and substantially softened it in the revised version of the manuscript, in accordance with this valid point.</p><p>“Specifically, these simulations demonstrated that a minimal Predictive Coding model implementing biologically plausible constraints (i.e. temporal delays in the communication between regions and time constants) generates α-band travelling waves, which propagate from frontal to occipital regions and vice versa, depending on the “cognitive states” of the model (input-driven vs prior-driven), as confirmed by EEG data in healthy participants (in that case, processing visual stimuli vs. closed-eyes resting state). The view that Predictive Coding could be the underlying principle explaining both the propagation of α-band travelling waves, and the neural changes induced by psychedelics opened-up a tantalizing opportunity for testing assumptions both about the nature of travelling waves and how they should be modulated by psychedelics (Carhart-Harris and Friston, 2019). Although we are restricted to speculation by the lack of direct experimental manipulation of top-down and bottom-up sensory inputs, our prior assumptions were so emphatically endorsed by the data, including how propagation-shifts related to subjective experience, that, in-line with prior hypotheses and motivations for the analyses, we were persuaded to infer about both the functional relevance of cortical travelling waves and brain action of psychedelics. Additional studies manipulating bottom-up and top-down analysis of sensory inputs with alternative perceptual designs will be required in order to confirm the relation between Predictive Coding, α-band oscillatory travelling waves and psychedelics states. Moreover, future studies can now be envisioned to examine how these assumptions translate to other phenomena such as non-drug induced visionary and hallucinatory states.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An obvious objection to the analysis is that it is sensor level. The authors need to address their reasons for doing this e.g. that source projections destroy real long-range correlations as well as blurring by the scalp and other tissues. See Nunez, 1974; Nunez et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2000; 2003 and Alexander et al., 2019, for a summary of these issues.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the useful reminder. We included in the “Quantifying the waves” paragraph of the revised manuscript a few sentence addressing this issue:</p><p>“In addition, it’s important to note that our waves’ analysis focuses at the sensor level, as source projections presents few important limitations such as impairing long-range connections, as well as smearing the signals due to the scalp inference (Alexander et al., 2019; Freeman and Barrie, 2000; Nunez, 1974)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study of the effects of the drug DMT on the direction and occurrence of EEG traveling waves seems generally plausible to me, although some important aspects are not discussed. I don't have major criticisms. However, as one who has studied EEG traveling and standing waves for many years, I worry that those unfamiliar with EEG wave phenomena may misinterpret some of these results given their partial dependence on the specific experimental methods employed. While I have not read previous papers by these authors that may fill in some of the important gaps, I list below some ideas that any reader interested in EEG waves and their neuro-scientific interpretation must be aware of. A summary paragraph in the section &quot;Quantifying travelling waves&quot; is recommended concerning the following basic concepts that must be understood if the results are to be interpreted correctly.</p><p>1) In all but the simplest systems, traveling waves occur in groups (packets) over some range of spatial wavelengths (multiple spatial frequencies, k). This is to be expected in brains, based on both theory and experiment (see Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006; 2014; Nunez, 2000).</p><p>2) Any experimental electrode array will be sensitive to only parts of these wave packets, e.g. only waves shorter than the spatial extent of the array and waves longer than twice the electrode separation distance (Nyquist criterion in space) can be resolved. In scalp recordings, the shorter waves may be mostly removed by volume conduction.</p><p>3) As a consequence of #2, waves recorded directly from the cortex (as indicated in several recent studies) will emphasize shorter waves than the scalp recorded waves. In the case of small cortical arrays, the ECoG overlap with scalp data may be minimal. Thus, the different estimated wave properties (including propagation direction) need not agree.</p><p>4) When waves are traveling in multiple directions at nearly the same time in &quot;closed&quot; systems (e.g., the cortical/white matter), there are only two possible results. Either the waves must damp out or they combine (interfere) to form standing waves (e.g. α waves traveling both forward and backward). One expects that the actual behavior depends on brain state, including the influence of drugs (see Nunez and Srinivasan, 2006; 2014; Nunez, 2000).</p></disp-quote><p>We are very grateful to the reviewer for her/his overall positive opinion on our work, and her/his useful suggestions. As recommended, we integrated in the “Quantifying travelling waves” paragraph all the points listed above, with the corresponding references. We believe such changes improved the readability of the paper for those unfamiliar with EEG analysis, and hopefully will be satisfying and adequate for the reviewer.</p><p>“As demonstrated by both theoretical and experimental evidence (Nunez, 2000; Nunez and Srinivasan, 2014, 2009), in most systems, including the human brain, traveling waves occur in groups (or packets) over some range of spatial wavelengths having multiple spatial and temporal frequencies. Given any configurations of electrodes, only parts of these packets can be successfully detected, i.e. waves shorter than the spatial extent of the array, and waves longer than twice the electrode separation distance (Nyquist criterion in space). In scalp recordings, the shorter waves may be mostly removed by volume conduction. As a consequence, waves recorded directly from the cortex emphasize shorter waves than the scalp recorded waves. Specifically, in the case of small cortical arrays, the overlap between cortical and scalp data may be minimal, and the estimated wave properties (including propagation direction) may differ. Additionally, it is important to consider that when waves are traveling in multiple directions at nearly the same time in &quot;closed&quot; systems (e.g., the cortical/white matter), waves either damp out or interfere with each other to form standing waves (e.g. α waves traveling both forward and backward). It is reasonable to assume that the behavior of these properties will relate to global brain and mind states, and be sensitive to state-altering psychoactive drugs (Nunez, 2000; Nunez and Srinivasan, 2014, 2009).”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>Massimini M, Huber R, Ferrarelli F, Hill S, Tononi G. 2004.
