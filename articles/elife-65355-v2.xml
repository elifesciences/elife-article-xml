of bacterial biofilms, such that the cells inside them are protected. It is not known whether these phages are still infectious and whether they pose a threat to newly arriving bacteria. Here, we address these questions using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and its lytic phage T7. Prior work has demonstrated that T7 phages are bound in the outermost curli polymer layers of the <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm matrix. We show that these phages do remain viable and can kill colonizing cells that are T7-susceptible. If cells colonize a resident biofilm before phages do, we find that they can still be killed by phage exposure if it occurs soon thereafter. However, if colonizing cells are present on the biofilm long enough before phage exposure, they gain phage protection via envelopment within curli-producing clusters of the resident biofilm cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>bacteriophage</kwd><kwd>spatial ecology</kwd><kwd>invasion</kwd><kwd>community

are found alongside each other in nearly every environment examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez-Brito et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zablocki et al.,

2021</xref>). Phages inject their genomes into the cytoplasm of their hosts, and in the case of obligate lytic phages, immediately begin co-opting host resources to replicate. Eventually, host cells are lysed to release a new cohort of phage virions. Predatory pressure from phage attack drives bacterial evolution, diversification, and ultimately the community structure of many microbiomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blazanin and Turner, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lenski and Levin, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abedon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gómez and Buckling, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keen and Dantas, 2018</xref>). The mechanistic, ecological, and evolutionary features of phage-bacteria interactions have a deep history of study, including many seminal theoretical and experimental papers that have characterized the population and evolutionary dynamics of phage-bacteria interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koskella and Brockhurst, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abedon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Susskind and Botstein, 1978</xref>). The traditional literature in this area mostly considers well-mixed culture conditions such as those in shaken liquids, which can reveal fundamental aspects of phage-bacteria interactions without spatial structure. However, in nature bacteria often reside in spatially constrained, surface-bound communities, or biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hellweger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flemming et al., 2016</xref>). The limited work that has focused on phage infection in biofilm environments has often found outcomes that differ substantially from those observed in mixed liquid environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hansen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin and Bull, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Abedon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schrag and Mittler, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Simmons et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chaudhry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pires et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A defining feature of biofilm populations is the presence of a self-secreted adhesive polymer matrix that modulates cell-cell and cell-surface interactions, in addition to influencing collective biofilm architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nadell et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erskine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Teschler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colvin et al., 2012</xref>). Several recent papers have demonstrated that the biofilm matrix can be central to phage-host coevolution. <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic> and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> rapidly evolve mucoid colony phenotypes – which reflect increased and/or altered matrix secretion – when they are under phage attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Scanlan and Buckling, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chaudhry et al., 2020</xref>). Curli fibers, a proteinaceous component of the <italic>E. coli</italic> matrix, can block biofilm-dwelling cells from T7 and T5 phage exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>). In this case, phages can be seen directly enmeshed in the curli mesh without infecting biofilm cells unless the integrity of the curli layer is compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>). Recent papers by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darch et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Díaz-Pascual et al., 2019</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunsing et al., 2019</xref>, respectively, suggest a similar pattern of matrix-dependent phage protection in <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>, and <italic>Pantoea stewartii</italic>. Earlier work from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kay et al., 2011</xref> used plaque-forming unit (PFU) count assays to show that if phage-exposed biofilms are disassociated by a matrix-degrading agent, the phage titer in the surrounding media increases, suggesting that phages released from the matrix are potentially still infectious. It is not known, however, whether phages remain threatening to newly arriving bacteria while the phages are still embedded in the intact biofilm matrix; it could be, for example, that matrix-embedded phages are mostly degraded or trapped in configurations that render them unable to infect host cells. The answer to this question may have a significant impact on the processes of population assembly as cells encounter and attempt to colonize pre-existing biofilms.</p><p>Inspired by the findings above, we investigated the consequences of phage entrapment in the matrix for biofilm population assembly. If they remain infectious, these phages could pose a threat to new cells that attempt to colonize the biofilm surface. Here, we explored this possibility by studying how matrix-embedded phages influence the invasion of bacteria into pre-existing biofilm populations, and whether biofilm-invading cells can integrate into the existing matrix and gain phage protection. To address these questions, we used a combination of microfluidic culture, phage infection reporter techniques, high resolution confocal microscopy, and detailed spatial analysis of the resulting image data. We find that matrix-trapped phages do indeed remain infectious and reduce the ability of newly arriving cells to colonize existing biofilms, and that this effect is dependent on the relative timing of the arrival of phages and colonizing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Influence of matrix-trapped phages on invading planktonic cells</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> produces a variety of matrix components at different times during biofilm formation, including flagellar filaments, curli amyloid fibers, and polysaccharides such as colanic acid and cellulose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beloin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnhart and Chapman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans and Chapman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hammar et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pesavento et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serra et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 2013b</xref>). Curli fibers are the single matrix component known to be essential for T7 phage protection in <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>) and are assembled by extracellular polymerization of CsgA monomers on an outer membrane baseplate comprised of CsgB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Evans and Chapman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barnhart and Chapman, 2006</xref>). Curli proteins secreted by <italic>E. coli</italic> localize primarily in the upper half of the biofilm-dwelling population, and introduced phages become trapped in the outer part of this curli matrix layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serra et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The biofilm-dwelling cells amongst and below the curli fiber matrix layer thus become protected against T7 exposure in the absence of the evolution of physiological resistance to T7 phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>). Although these phages are blocked from diffusing into the biofilm interior, we hypothesized that trapped phage particles may remain capable of infecting cells that reach them from the liquid environment that surrounds the biofilm. To test this hypothesis, we first grew biofilms of <italic>E. coli</italic> AR3110 for 62 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>); prior work has established this growth period as optimal for full curli expression along the biofilm front (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>), and we confirmed this result in our microfluidic growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The resident cells harbored a chromosomal construct for constitutive expression of the far-red fluorescent protein mKate2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shcherbo et al., 2007</xref>) to make them visible with fluorescence time-lapse microscopy. The biofilms were then exposed to a 1 hr pulse of media containing lytic T7 phages at 2x10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL, such that phages could accumulate in the outer matrix curli layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The phages contained a <italic>sfGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>) expression construct engineered into their genome, allowing us to visualize any cells that became phage-infected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>). For a control comparison, we performed the same procedure but exposed the resident biofilms to sterile media containing no phages. Following phage exposure or control treatment, we performed a population invasion step in which high-density planktonic cultures of phage-susceptible wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> AR3110 (OD<sub>600</sub> = 6.0) were added to the chambers for 3 hr to colonize the resident biofilms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The full experimental procedure for these experiments is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Colonizing cells were isogenic to resident wild-type cells, except they constitutively expressed mKO-κ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tsutsui et al., 2008</xref>) so that they could be distinguished from resident cells during imaging.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visualization and quantification of biofilm invasion with or without phage exposure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Visualization of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm (red) with stained curli matrix (white), including one x-y optical section (main image) and z-projection (inset).

The colonizing cells were restricted to the outer surface of the resident biofilms and could not enter the biofilm interior, similar to what we have seen previously for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nadell et al., 2015</xref>). However, when resident biofilms were pre-exposed to phages, colonization by phage-susceptible cells was almost completely eliminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,I</xref>). Further, most invading cells that were detected on phage-exposed biofilms were fluorescent in the sfGFP channel, indicating that they had been phage-infected but not yet lysed.</p><p>Our interpretation of this result is that susceptible invading cells encounter phages in the curli matrix, become infected, and lyse to release new phages, or fail to divide further. We assessed this idea quantitatively by measuring the cell cluster size distributions of invading cells on biofilms with or without phage-pre-exposure. Without pre-exposure, we found numerous instances of cell clusters with 20 cells or more, indicating several rounds of division in the 10 hr between invasion and imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). On biofilms exposed to phages prior to invasion of new <italic>E. coli</italic> cells, there were almost no groups larger than one or a few cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), indicating few or no divisions in the period between invasion and imaging. This is consistent with the observation noted above that on phage pre-exposed biofilms, any remaining invading cells were expressing the phage infection reporter, which would preclude further growth and division.</p><p>Another (though not mutually exclusive) explanation for our results is that phages, by occupying potential sites of attachment, block the physical interaction of invading cells with the biofilm outer surface. We tested this possibility by repeating the experiment above with invading cultures of an <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant harboring a clean deletion of <italic>trxA;</italic> this strain does not allow for phage amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qimron et al., 2006</xref>). The Δ<italic>trxA</italic> deletion mutant was found to invade resident biofilms at equal rates whether or not the resident was pre-exposed to T7 phages, which suggests that phages do not block attachment sites for invading cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H,I</xref>). Noting that the Δ<italic>trxA</italic> deletion mutant undergoes abortive infection upon exposure to phage T7, the fact that Δ<italic>trxA</italic> can colonize resident biofilms, while WT <italic>E. coli</italic> cannot, indicates that phage amplification from initial sites of infection may be important for elimination of phage-susceptible invading cells.</p><p>Phages that are trapped in the curli matrix of <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms are thus persistent as a threat to incoming susceptible bacteria. This result also implies that in the event that curli-protected cells within resident biofilms disperse individually or <italic>en masse</italic>, they may too be susceptible to phages that are released from the biofilm exterior. This remains an important question for future work.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Invading cells gain phage protection, after a delay</title><p>Once we determined that matrix-embedded phages could infect recently attached susceptible cells, we asked whether invading cells fare better if they arrive prior to the phage pulse.

Chambers were separated into two groups: In the first group, phages were pulsed into the chamber immediately after colonization by the invading cell population. In the second group, biofilms were incubated post-invasion for 10 hr – the time at which we observed the colonized biofilms to reach a population steady-state – and then subjected to a phage pulse. This experimental procedure is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. Images were taken of each chamber approximately 10 hr after the phage pulse, allowing for multiple infection and lysis cycles to occur and the system to reach its new equilibrium. When phage pulses occurred immediately after biofilms were colonized by an invading strain, the invading cells were mostly killed by T7 phage exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

Given that phage protection is dependent on being embedded in curli polymers of the biofilm matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>), it is possible that colonizing cells produce their own curli after an initial transition period following attachment to the resident biofilm. Alternatively, invading cells could co-opt matrix produced by the resident population. We tested these possibilities using a combination of experiments in which either the invading strain or the resident strain produced a 6xHis-labeled variant of CsgA, allowing us to localize and quantify curli production as a function of time and space inside biofilms via immunostaining. His-labeling of CsgA has been shown previously not to influence curli function in live biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 2013b</xref>).

It was not clear why colonizing cells do not more rapidly produce their own curli, despite occupying conditions presumably identical to those experienced by resident cells on the biofilm surface; we speculate that the progression of the curli expression program must be quite slow relative to the time scale of surface occupation of the invading strain in our experiments. This could be the case, for example, if curli production were dependent on cell-cell packing that emerges gradually over the course of biofilm growth. By contrast, when cells in the resident biofilm harbored the His-labeled variant of <italic>csgA</italic>, abundant anti-His staining was detectable in the upper surface of the resident biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–F</xref>), including the surroundings of the colonizing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serra et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 2013b</xref>). These two observations indicate that invading cells do not gain phage protection in the 10 hr following colonization because they produce their own curli fibers, but rather because they coopt the curli fibers being produced by cells in the resident biofilm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To support this interpretation, we used image analysis to quantify curli accumulation in the immediate neighborhood of resident and colonizing cell biomass following invasion; this analysis showed a steadily increasing amount of curli in the immediate neighborhood of colonizing cells over the course of 10 hr following their arrival to the outer surface of the resident biofilm. At the 10 hr mark, invading cells were surrounded by the same amount of curli as the resident strain at the beginning of the invasion experiment.</p><p>We next asked if the invading strain directly or indirectly co-opts curli matrix material from the resident biofilm. Invading cells producing CsgB baseplates could potentially collect freely diffusing CsgA monomers being released by the resident biofilm population, accumulating curli matrix material and thus phage protection. This might not necessarily be the case, as our experiments above showed that the invading cells were not producing CsgA, whose corresponding gene is in the same operon as <italic>csgB</italic>; one would typically not expect the production of one without the other. Alternatively, without directly sequestering resident-produced CsgA to their cell surface, invading cells could become enveloped within curli-producing clusters of the resident biofilm population with enough curli in their surroundings to block phage diffusion. This would be an indirect way of exploiting the phage protection of the resident biofilm’s curli layer.</p><p>To differentiate between these two possibilities, we repeated the post-invasion phage pulse experiments using a <italic>ΔcsgB</italic> mutant that cannot produce its own CsgB base plate, and which therefore cannot nucleate CsgA polymerization on its outer surface. Here, as above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), few cells survived if phages arrived immediately after invading cells colonized the resident biofilm surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, despite lacking CsgB curli baseplates, invaders were still protected after a 10-hr delay prior to phage exposure in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This prompted the interpretation that invading cells do not have to be able to directly polymerize CsgA on their exterior to gain phage protection over the 10 hr after attaching to the biofilm surface. Rather this result suggests that the invading cells – despite remaining distinct physiologically from the resident cells by virtue of not producing CsgA or CsgB themselves – <italic>indirectly</italic> coopt curli produced by the resident biofilm by becoming sufficiently enveloped amidst clusters of resident cells that their exposure to incoming phages is greatly reduced or eliminated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that matrix-embedded T7 phages can remain infectious on the curli-protected <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm surface and kill newly arriving susceptible bacteria. In this sense, biofilm-dwelling microbes, by trapping phages on the biofilm periphery, can incidentally weaponize them against incoming phage-susceptible cells. On the other hand, we found that if invading <italic>E. coli</italic> cells attach to a resident biofilm and have sufficient time to become entangled in the curli matrix, they too gain protection from subsequent phage exposure. This protection is obtained by indirect exploitation of the resident biofilm’s curli matrix: invading cells did not significantly use resident-produced curli monomers to polymerize curli on their own exterior, but rather became sufficiently enveloped in curli-producing groups of resident biofilm cells that they were no longer exposed to an incoming phage attack.</p><p>Our observations bear an interesting analogy to those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barr et al., 2013</xref>, who found that phages trapped in host mucosal linings can kill incoming bacteria (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate on the basis of our results here that phage entrapment and their blocking effect against bacterial colonization is important not just in host associated mucosal environments but even more broadly to many biofilm contexts in which phage-trapping matrix material could potentially influence the pattern of community succession. We would not say that obligate lytic phages like T7 evolved to serve this function per se; their evolutionary interest is to infect host cells, replicate, and spread to new hosts. But the biofilm matrix almost certainly did evolve in part to protect the cells within from external threats, including exposure to phages; when phages are trapped in the matrix and remain viable, they can subsequently influence whether other incoming bacteria (depending on their phage susceptibility) colonize the resident biofilm surface.</p><p>As a demonstration of principle, we studied here the effect of matrix-embedded T7 phages on the colonization ability of cells isogenic to those in the resident <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm, showing that biofilm colonization by susceptible cells was effectively eliminated by the presence of phages on the biofilm surface. This does not constitute a proof of generality that matrix-trapped phages always block colonization by susceptible bacteria, but we would think that this phenomenon is not unique to <italic>E. coli</italic>. We hope our report will prompt further tests for other bacterial and phage species; recent reports from other groups have suggested matrix-dependent protection against and potentially sequestration of incoming phages, but it remains to be seen whether phages remain active against other incoming cells in these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Díaz-Pascual et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunsing et al., 2019</xref>). The centrally important and open question for future work prompted by our results is whether multi-species biofilm consortia trap multiple phage types of different strain and species specificities, and whether some or all of these trapped phages have the potential to kill off invading cells of their target host range. In this regard, the spatial ecology of biofilm-phage interaction may play a key role in the successional dynamics of polymicrobial biofilm communities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Strains</title><p><italic>E. coli</italic> strains used in these experiments were all derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> AR3110 and are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> below.

ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bonilla et al., 2016</xref>. Briefly, AR3110 wild type <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures were grown overnight in 5 mL lysogeny broth at 37°C at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick orbital shaking incubator. The host strain was then back diluted 1:20 into 100 mL lysogeny broth and allowed to grow to mid exponential phase (0.3–0.5 OD<sub>600</sub>). At this time, T7 phages were spiked in from a frozen stock and MgSO<sub>4</sub> was added to a final concentration of 5 mM. The culture was placed back into the incubator for 3–4 hr, until the culture clarified. The entire volume was then vacuum filtered (0.22 µm filter Millipore Sigma). Phage titer was determined by traditional plaque assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Adams, 1959</xref>). Briefly, host <italic>E. coli</italic> was grown overnight and sub-cultured as described above to achieve mid exponential phase (0.3–0.5 OD<sub>600</sub>). Phage preparation was serially diluted by passing 10 µL into 990 µL for 100-fold dilutions. Top agar (0.5% agar, lysogeny broth) was melted and aliquoted into 3 mL volumes. Subsequently, 50 µL of a dilution was added to each sample along with MgSO<sub>4</sub> (5 mM). Molten top agar was then poured evenly onto lysogeny broth plates and placed at 37°C for 3 hr. Plates were removed and plaques were counted in order to calculate plaque forming units (PFU) per milliliter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Biofilm phage pretreatment invasion assay</title><p>We measured attachment and growth of exogenously added planktonic cells to curli protected biofilms with and without the prior addition of T7 phage. <italic>E. coli</italic> AR3110 expressing mKate2 was cultured in 5 mL lysogeny broth overnight at 37°C at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick orbital shaking incubator. <italic>E. coli</italic> AR3110 was used due to its strong biofilm formation ability relative to other K12 domesticated lab strains of <italic>E. coli</italic>, and the literature history of establishing the timing and components of matrix expression in this strain background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Simmons et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serra et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Serra et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serra and Hengge, 2014</xref>). Cultures were then pelleted and washed twice with 0.9% NaCl and standardized to OD<sub>600</sub>=0.2 prior to inoculation into microfluidic devices. The inoculum was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature (approximately 22°C). Media syringes (1 mL BD plastic) were prepared by loading 1 mL of 1% tryptone broth (W/V) and attaching a 25-gauge needle. Tubing (#30 Cole palmer PTFE ID 0.3 mm) was then carefully attached to the needle and syringes were subsequently placed in Harvard Apparatus syringe pumps. After affixing inlet and outlet tubing to the microfluidic devices, a 40 s pulse at 40 µL/min was conducted to remove unattached cells, before standard flow regime (0.1 µL/min) was started. Biofilms were grown at room temperature for 62 hr at which time, tubing was swapped from clean media to either purified phages (2x10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL) or clean media control. Flow was continued at 0.1 µL/min for 1 hr. After phage pretreatment, tubing was again removed and switched to syringes containing invading cells expressing mKO-κ for three hours at 0.1 µL/min. Invading cells were prepared prior to this step. Cells were grown overnight as previously described before in lysogeny broth. Invading cells were then sub-cultured 1:20 into 100 mL of 1% tryptone broth for 3 hr at 37°C at 250 rpm. Cells were then pelleted, concentrated, and standardized to OD<sub>600</sub>=6.0 (~5x10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL). Following the conclusion of the invasion, microfluidic chambers were allotted 10 hr of incubation at room temperature under standard flow conditions for growth and phage infection to occur. Three to five image fields (150 µm x 150 µm x 25 µm; length x width x height, slice interval 0.5 µm) were then acquired on a Zeiss 880 LSCM and image analysis performed using BiofilmQ software tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Biofilm phage posttreatment invasion assay</title><p>Attachment and growth of invading <italic>E. coli</italic> were measured under two different regimes. Invasions of resident biofilms were conducted prior to phage application in this assay; however, timing of the phage application was varied. Resident biofilms were cultured in the same manner described above in the pretreatment invasion assay. At 62 hr of growth, clean media tubing was exchanged for invading cells (prepared in an identical manner as above) and allowed to flow for 3 hr at 0.1 µL/min. Following the conclusion of the invasion, chambers were separated into two groups corresponding to phage treatment regime. Half of the chambers were exposed to phage treatment (2x10<sup>8</sup> PFU/mL at 0.1 µL/min for 1 hr) immediately following the invasion, while the other half was incubated for 10 hr at room temperature prior to the phage treatment. In both regimes, images were acquired in the manner described above. Imaging took place 10 hr following their respective phage treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Curli matrix localization assay</title><p>Curli matrix monomers, CsgA, were labeled with a 6X-His tag as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vidakovic et al., 2018</xref>). Curli fibers were detected via direct fluorescent immunostaining with an α−6X-His antibody (Invitrogen) conjugated to a fluorescent dye, Alexafluor647. Antibody was added to clean media at 0.1 mg/mL and flowed continuously throughout the course of the experiment.

Representative images for each experiment (with <italic>n</italic> independent replicates as indicated in each figure legend) were taken at random locations throughout the corresponding microfluidic devices. The sfGFP fluorescent protein was excited using a 488 nm laser line, the mKO-κ fluorescent protein was excited using a 543 nm laser line, the mKate2 fluorescent protein was excited using a 594 nm laser line, and Alexafluor647 was excited using a 633 nm laser line. All image stacks were trimmed if necessary (e.g. if area outside of the microfluidic devices had been acquired in addition to the biofilm itself) using the native Zeiss Zen Blue software. All subsequent quantifications were performed using the BiofilmQ image analysis framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartmann et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to members of the Nadell lab at Dartmouth for feedback on the project.

On the other hand, reviewers realize that perhaps, the strength of this paper is in quantitative methodology. Thus, you may choose to make it a Method/Resource paper (but you will need to state the novelty and the applicability of the Methods), or you can do more experiments to argue that the phenomenon is observed for other type(s) of phages.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Biofilm matrix-dependent phage protection has been observed in a variety of bacteria. Using techniques including microfluidic culture, single-cell resolution confocal microscopy, and phage infection reporter, authors show here that phages are trapped in curli fibres of outer <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm layer, and that these phages can attack newly-arriving susceptible cells. Invading cells that arrived at the biofilm 10 hrs prior to phage arrival are protected by using the existing curli fibre as protection.</p><p>The experiments are nicely illustrated and well-done. The article is also well-written. I just have one question: What happens to the long-term fate of biofilm? Presumably, a fraction of cells can still grow in the biofilm and a fraction of cells will detach from the biofilm. How might the presence of phage affect these processes? Speculation is fine.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The motivation for this study is right on and important. In the real world, bacteria and bacteriophage (phage) live in physically structured habitats, where the bacteria exist as colonies or microcolonies are often embedded and stuck together in polymeric matrices known as biofilms. As the authors point out, most theoretical and experimental studies neglect this inconvenient reality. They use mass action models and their empirical analog, bacteria, and phage in well-agitated liquid culture. A full understanding of the population biology, ecology, and evolution of bacteria and phages require an understanding of how these populations intact in physically structured habitats.</p><p>This state-of-the-art study presents compelling evidence that the phage T7, which the authors have previously shown to be embedded in the matrices of biofilms are viable and capable of replicating on sensitive bacteria. It is not clear why these phages would not be viable and capable of replicating under these conditions. Is there evidence that suggests that phages are unable to replicate in biofilm populations of their host bacteria? If so, they should present this evidence.</p><p>This study considers only one form of physically structured bacterial populations, biofilms of <italic>E. coli</italic> on the surfaces of plastic tubes, and a single phage, T7. Does this result not obtain when the <italic>E. coli</italic> exist as colonies? Is this result unique to this rapid lysis phage? Will the same results obtain with other lytic phages, like T4? On surfaces and soft agar, the phage infection dynamics in these physically structured populations are different for these phages. T4 will be an excellent phage to examine whether rapid lysis is needed for this result; rapid lysis mutants of T4 can be obtained.</p><p>This study seems to have an agenda to provide evidence for, rather than broadly test, the hypothesis that lytic phages embedded in biofilms reduce the likelihood of those biofilms being colonized by other bacteria. The demonstration that matrix embedded phage T7 can reduce the likelihood of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonizing an established biofilm under the limited conditions of this experiment is of little general interest. Biofilms are commonly composed of multiple species of bacteria. The host range of phages is usually limited within a species and among strains of those species. The embedded phages of one species or strain of bacteria will not prevent colonization by other bacterial species.</p><p>More consideration should be given to the population and evolutionary dynamics of the phage in biofilm populations of bacteria. Do the phages in these <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms continue to replicate and maintain their populations? What about resistance?

Using techniques including microfluidic culture, single-cell resolution confocal microscopy, and phage infection reporter, authors show here that phages are trapped in curli fibres of outer <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm layer, and that these phages can attack newly-arriving susceptible cells. Invading cells that arrived at the biofilm 10 hrs prior to phage arrival are protected by using the existing curli fibre as protection.</p><p>The experiments are nicely illustrated and well-done. The article is also well-written. I just have one question: What happens to the long-term fate of biofilm? Presumably, a fraction of cells can still grow in the biofilm and a fraction of cells will detach from the biofilm. How might the presence of phage affect these processes? Speculation is fine.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the referee for their positive evaluation of our work, and their inquiry regarding the downstream consequences of phage trapping for biofilm-dwelling cells. This is an excellent question and one which we hope to pursue in the future experimentally. For the time being, we can say that with sufficient time, biofilms of <italic>E. coli</italic> grow large enough that they eventually slough off of the surface to which they are attached. As our work shows that matrix-trapped phages remain infectious, the phage population presumably disperses with them and may infect newly planktonic cells. A key question is whether the resulting phage propagation is sufficient to halt further surface colonization by surviving bacteria and another round of biofilm growth. We have added a note in the text to this end, and we look forward to reporting on this question in future work (Lines 132-135).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The motivation for this study is right on and important. In the real world, bacteria and bacteriophage (phage) live in physically structured habitats, where the bacteria exist as colonies or microcolonies are often embedded and stuck together in polymeric matrices known as biofilms. As the authors point out, most theoretical and experimental studies neglect this inconvenient reality. They use mass action models and their empirical analog, bacteria, and phage in well-agitated liquid culture. A full understanding of the population biology, ecology, and evolution of bacteria and phages require an understanding of how these populations intact in physically structured habitats.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate the referee’s agreement on the timeliness of the research questions pursued in our paper. We are very much of the same mind that phage-host interactions in nature can be completely different in the biofilm context. The referee brings up a number of important and constructive criticisms below, and we have endeavored at all junctures to address them. Some would require more experimental work than we currently have the ability to perform, so we are hopeful that a combination of new experiments and expanded discussion will be sufficient.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This state-of-the-art study presents compelling evidence that the phage T7, which the authors have previously shown to be embedded in the matrices of biofilms are viable and capable of replicating on sensitive bacteria. It is not clear why these phages would not be viable and capable of replicating under these conditions. Is there evidence that suggests that phages are unable to replicate in biofilm populations of their host bacteria? If so, they should present this evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the referee’s comments here. The rationale for questioning whether curli-trapped phages might not be active against cells is that they either degrade after being embedded in the matrix, or that they become embedded in orientations that prevent them from being able to readily infect cells that are arriving on the biofilm surface. This possibility had not been tested previously to our knowledge. For biofilms that are not protected by matrix (including <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms before they begin producing curli fibers) phages are able to diffuse among and infect biofilm-dwelling bacteria. This was shown previously by the Vidakovic et al. paper to which the referee refers in the comment above. To clarify this point, we have added new text to the introduction in support of the rationale for the paper (Lines 59-62).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study considers only one form of physically structured bacterial populations, biofilms of E. coli on the surfaces of plastic tubes, and a single phage, T7. Does this result not obtain when the <italic>E. coli</italic> exist as colonies? Is this result unique to this rapid lysis phage? Will the same results obtain with other lytic phages, like T4? On surfaces and soft agar, the phage infection dynamics in these physically structured populations are different for these phages. T4 will be an excellent phage to examine whether rapid lysis is needed for this result; rapid lysis mutants of T4 can be obtained.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all excellent suggestions, and we appreciate the insight on the part of the referee. The spatiotemporal matrix composition of colonies grown on agar and biofilms grown in flow chambers may differ substantially, although Regine Hengge’s work and the Vidakovic et al. paper also show some surprising similarities in matrix localization despite the different directions from which nutrients enter the cell groups in the different assays. While it would certainly be interesting to determine if our results hold in agar colony models, the level of single-cell level resolution fluorescence imaging required for our work is generally not possible for agar colonies. A main goal of the present paper, which demonstrates that matrix-trapped phages kill off invading cells, is to motivate further work on this question by others in the biofilm and phage fields using different growth conditions, host bacteria, and phages. We would respond similarly for the question of whether the same results hold for phage T4. We are not able to make this assessment at present due to lab restrictions, but testing the generality of these results is an important avenue for further work. We added new emphasis in the conclusion section of the paper to make it clear that our work established a proof of principle, but not a proof of generality across all environments, all bacteria, and all phages, and that we hope other researchers in the field will join us to address this question in the future (Lines 231-236).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This study seems to have an agenda to provide evidence for, rather than broadly test, the hypothesis that lytic phages embedded in biofilms reduce the likelihood of those biofilms being colonized by other bacteria. The demonstration that matrix embedded phage T7 can reduce the likelihood of <italic>E. coli</italic> colonizing an established biofilm under the limited conditions of this experiment is of little general interest. Biofilms are commonly composed of multiple species of bacteria. The host range of phages is usually limited within a species and among strains of those species. The embedded phages of one species or strain of bacteria will not prevent colonization by other bacterial species.</p></disp-quote><p>While we understand the skepticism on the part of this referee, we do not agree that our results will be of little general interest. First, the microfluidic flow conditions used in our experiments are an excellent model system that reflects many natural settings in which biofilms grow on a solid-liquid interface. Though we only examine a single-species and single-phage condition, this is the first result of its kind and meant as a demonstration of principle, not proof of universality, to spark interest in the question of how trapped phages influence bacterial colonization of resident. We agree that since phages are species and strain-specific, they will not kill all invading bacteria; in fact, we demonstrate this directly using a T7-resistant mutant of invading <italic>E. coli</italic> in the paper. Our results prompt the question of whether natural biofilms might trap phages of many different origins and then become resistant to colonization by the species/strains to which those trapped phages are virulent. An important future step is to determine whether this is the case, as we originally highlighted in the conclusion section of the paper. With this referee comment in mind, though, we understand we did not emphasize the caveats of our paper in sufficient depth, and we have expanded this section of the conclusion (to the extent possible given space constraints for <italic>eLife</italic> short reports) to make it clear what questions are left open by our results. We hope this modification to the conclusion will be more effective in prompting the readership to include similar assays in their work (Lines 236-244).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More consideration should be given to the population and evolutionary dynamics of the phage in biofilm populations of bacteria. Do the phages in these E. coli biofilms continue to replicate and maintain their populations? What about resistance? As is commonly seen in liquid cultures of bacteria and lytic phages, resistance evolves, and the dominant population of bacteria is not susceptible to the phage. It would be of some interest and add generality to this study to know if the <italic>E. coli</italic> in the biofilms are sensitive or resistant to T7, and how that affects their premise that these embedded phages prevent colonization biofilms.</p><p>Biofilms are often associated with the pathogenesis of bacteria and resistance to antibiotics. It would be of some interest to know what the results presented in this study relate to these practical elements of biofilms' biology.</p></disp-quote><p>These are also appreciated criticisms from the referee, and we can address the majority based on our previously published work. The phages trapped in the curli matrix might be able to replicate to a degree, but not to the extent that they any major impact on net positive growth of the biofilm. This was shown by Vidakovic et al. (2018). But overall, the phages are trapped in the curli matrix of mature <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilms, and neither proliferate nor degrade. Our central question in this paper was whether these phages can in principle infect and replicate and newly arriving, non-curli-protected cells arrive, and we find that the answer is yes.</p><p>We have shown in a previous publication that in a naïve resident biofilm typical of those used in our experiments, there are about 4x10<sup>6</sup> resident <italic>E. coli</italic>, of which ~15 cells are de novo resistant mutants. In all likelihood these mutants are buried in the biofilm in random locations and remain unexposed to phages blocked on the biofilm periphery. Among cells in the invading population, clearly few or none are resistant mutants because they are all killed by phages trapped on the resident biofilm exterior. The population sizes we are working with are orders of magnitude smaller than those in well-mixed experiments in test tubes – because the number of de novo resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> cells is small relative to the whole population, and phage-host interactions are spatially constrained, phage resistance evolution is very unlikely to make any difference to the outcome of our experiments. We have added new text stating this point and appreciate the note from the reviewer to make sure there is no confusion among readers (Lines 85-87).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although well-designed and well-executed, the inferences drawn from his study of <italic>E. coli</italic> and T7 in biofilms are too limited to support the publication of this manuscript in eLife.</p><p>Specific Comments and Suggestions:</p><p>– The abstract does a fine job of summarizing the main points of the paper.</p><p>– Line 44: How do they differ?

In order to obtain replicable <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm conditions, we must start experiments with the surface density of cells that is shown in the first submission. As noted above, the subsequent growth period for 62 hours is needed for sufficient curli production to trap phages after exposure. Presumably, the effect of phages killing incoming susceptible cells might be weakened with very few phages trapped in the matrix, i.e. lower MOI. In principle this could be tested in the future, but given the difficulty of these experiments and current limitations on lab work, this is not feasible at the present time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 99: There is no consideration of the dynamics of phage infection, particularly the latent period.

One might imagine that the phage burst resulting from lysis of an invading cell would lead to a locally high phage density and a high chance of the entire invading cell cluster being eliminated rather than some small number of cells surviving-something like a microscopic analog of clear plaques on a plate.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that this portion of the figure needs some additional explanation in the text. Figure 1J and K depict the change in cluster size distribution of invading cells in the absence (J) and presence (K) of curli-trapped phages on the resident biofilm’s surface. They show that when phages are absent when invading cells arrive, the invading strain is able to establish cell clusters over time that most likely result from several rounds of division by one or a few cells that attach to a given location on the resident biofilm surface. When phages are present, on the other hand, the majority of invading cells are killed, and so there are almost no changes for larger cell clusters to develop. We have added new text to the Results section to make sure this interpretation is explained clearly (Lines 115-124).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) It's curious that invading cells, being in locally near-identical environments to their neighboring curli-producing resident cells, do not begin producing curli within 10 h of colonization. Speculation on this phenomenon would be welcome. If invading cells do eventually begin producing curli, what toggles the switch? If not, how do resident and invader cells &quot;know&quot; that they belong to different populations despite being congenic?</p></disp-quote><p>On the basis of our His-labeling experiments, we are confident that the invading <italic>E. coli</italic> strain does not begin producing their own curli on the 10 h time scale before phages are introduced, but from a mechanistic perspective we are not entirely sure as yet why this is the case. From our experience, cells colonizing surface from the planktonic phase take at least 2 days before they begin to produce curli. Though the curli regulon has been explored in detail by other groups, it is not fully clear what mechanisms control this timing. We now add direction discussion of this point (Lines 170-175). We can speculate that invading cells, which do not appear to be expressing the <italic>csg</italic> operon and therefore most likely do not have a CsgB baseplate on their exterior, cannot directly coopt the CsgA produced by curli-producing resident biofilm cells, and that this controls the separation of the two populations despite the fact that they are congenic. As we show, though, the invading strain does appear to be folded into the growing front of the resident biofilm, despite the fact that the invading strain does not appear to be activating the <italic>csg</italic> operon. Additional commentary on this point is now provided at the end of this results subsection (Lines 206-210).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) Image acquisition and analysis could be described in more detail. As is, it's unclear how many fields of view are examined per experimental replicate and how the fields of view were selected (for instance, in invasion experiments are the fields selected randomly for biovolume calculation or are fields showing invasion events specifically selected?).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this input from the referee and have updated the methods section to make it clear that image locations were selected randomly, and to highlight sample sizes as directly as possible for each quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reference:</p><p>1.

The authors suggested that the phage provided a kind of defense system for the coral against bad bacteria.

The authors never mentioned this obvious point.</p><p>In this case (from the abstract), as with Rowher's group, there is an implied purpose to the defense rather than more benign explanations. I don't like that, as it's almost as if they are trying to create a story. (The text may be more reasonable.)</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback from the 4<sup>th</sup> informal referee. We are also familiar with the Rohwer study, and in fact this was one of the main motivations for this paper. The Rohwer study and our results’ connection to it was a central part of the original submission’s Discussion section, and remains so. As to the interpretation that phages evolved to help the biofilms in which they become trapped, we never held this interpretation and agree with the referee that the fact that phages may help biofilms repel invading cells would be a coincidental benefit to the fact that the matrix is trapping the phages and preventing them from harming the biofilm-resident cells in the first place; this latter function is what we would presume to be the primary evolutionary explanation for the biofilm matrix- <italic>i.e.</italic> protecting the biofilm from threats, including phages. The fact that the trapped phages may help the biofilm-resident cells, even if a coincidental benefit, is nevertheless a potentially important ecological phenomenon. This is the main message of the paper. In response to this note and that of referee #2 above, we have modified the title of the paper to be more descriptive, and we have modified the text of the conclusion so as not to give the impression that we are arguing phages have evolved to help biofilms (Lines 228-233).</p></body></sub-article></article>
