evolution. We report an ancient family of GCNA (germ cell nuclear antigen) proteins that arose in the earliest eukaryotes, and feature a rapidly evolving intrinsically disordered region (IDR). Phylogenetic analysis reveals that GCNA proteins emerged before the major eukaryotic lineages diverged; GCNA predates the origin of a dedicated germline by a billion years. <italic>Gcna</italic> gene expression is enriched in reproductive cells across eukarya – either just prior to or during meiosis in single-celled eukaryotes, and in stem cells and germ cells of diverse multicellular animals. Studies of <italic>Gcna-</italic>mutant <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mice indicate that GCNA has functioned in reproduction for at least 600 million years. Homology to IDR-containing proteins implicated in DNA damage repair suggests that GCNA proteins may protect the genomic integrity of cells carrying a heritable genome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19993.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19993.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19993.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sex allows two individuals of a species to combine their genetic information and generate new offspring. As such, and unlike most of the cells that make up an organism, reproductive cells carry DNA that will be passed to the next generation. To prepare for sexual reproduction, reproductive cells undergo a process whereby they give up half of their DNA. Moreover, in many species, reproductive cells undergo dramatic changes in size and shape to become specialized as eggs or sperm.</p><p>For two decades, research scientists have made use of an antibody that specifically targets and labels reproductive cells in mice and rats, long before they become recognizable as sperm or eggs. However, nothing was known about the protein that this antibody recognizes.</p><p>Now, Carmell et al. have found that the antibody recognizes a protein called GCNA. This protein was previously thought to be limited to mice and rats. However, GCNA is in fact a member of a far-flung family of proteins that had gone unnoticed by researchers due to their unusual composition and large unstructured regions. Carmell et al. show that this protein family extends beyond rodents and even mammals, and actually exists in all branches of eukaryotic life, including plants and single-celled organisms. In most species examined, the genes encoding these proteins are most active in reproductive cells.</p><p>The most important next step is to figure out precisely what GCNA proteins are doing in reproductive cells. This will also hopefully explain why these proteins appear to have been conserved for more than 2 billion years, throughout the entire history of eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19993.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19993.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>GCNA</kwd><kwd>TRA98</kwd><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>Wss1</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>Spartan</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmell</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name><name><surname>Dokshin</surname><given-names>Gregoriy A</given-names></name><name><surname>Skaletsky</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yueh-Chiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Igarashi</surname><given-names>Kyomi J</given-names></name><name><surname>Bellott</surname><given-names>Daniel W</given-names></name><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name><name><surname>Mello</surname><given-names>Craig C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009559</institution-id><institution>Life Sciences Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carmell</surname><given-names>Michelle A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GCNA proteins comprise a previously unnoticed family of proteins that has been enriched in cells carrying a heritable genome since the invention of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes, and has had reproductive function for at least 600 million years.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is accomplished through meiosis, a specialized cell cycle that generates genetically diverse derivatives. Meiosis is believed to have evolved once, in the common ancestor of extant eukaryotes, about two billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramesh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Villeneuve and Hillers, 2001</xref>). At the same time, special protection for heritable genomes evolved in the form of an RNAi pathway that likely functioned in defense against transposons and viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shabalina and Koonin, 2008</xref>). Sexual reproduction via meiosis and utilization of specialized genome defense mechanisms are characteristics of many unicellular eukaryotes, in which every cell contributes to the next generation. These properties became germline specific when the distinction between germ cells and somatic cells was made in multicellular organisms, with the germline being tasked with guarding the heritable genome. Accordingly, certain critical genes encoding proteins associated with the sexual cycle, as well as those required for integrity of the heritable genome, share a deep, common evolutionary origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Uanschou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kumar et al., 2010</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">; Cerutti and Casas-Mollano, 2006</xref>). In metazoans, this reproductive assemblage expanded to encompass proteins not directly involved in meiosis but nonetheless expressed exclusively in germ cells; these include the RNA binding proteins DAZL/BOULE, VASA, and NANOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ewen-Campen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Juliano et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Mouse is the most widely used model to study the germline in mammals. Across 22 years of research, and &gt;425 publications in mouse reproductive biology, investigators have employed antibodies to two antigens – GCNA1 and TRA98 – to distinguish germ cells from somatic cells. Nonetheless, the identity of the antigens themselves has remained unknown. The striking qualities of these markers, together with their importance to the research community, led us to attempt to discover the underlying antigens. Here, we identify the antigen recognized by both antibodies as a single, unannotated protein in the mouse. We name this protein GCNA and describe its ancient and ubiquitous association with sexual reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GCNA1 and TRA98 antibodies recognize the same previously unannotated protein</title><p>The mouse germline is first distinguished from the surrounding soma as a population of primordial germ cells that migrates toward the developing genital ridge. Upon arrival, germ cells undergo a critical transition and commit to sexual differentiation, eventually giving rise to oocytes or spermatozoa.

To clone the GCNA1 antigen, we carried out immunoprecipitation from an adult mouse testis lysate, followed by mass spectrometry. We detected 26 unique peptides representing 51% coverage of an unannotated protein specifically in the immunoprecipitate, enabling us to confidently identify it as GCNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Mouse GCNA contains four distinct repeat classes that comprise the majority of the protein, and its theoretical isoelectric point of 4.17 makes it more acidic than 98.9% of all mouse proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bjellqvist et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The developmental timing and cell type specificity of labeling with GCNA1 resembles that of TRA98, a second antibody with an unknown antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tanaka et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Inoue et al., 2011</xref>). The subcellular localization of GCNA1 and TRA98 also show striking similarities; we find that GCNA forms a distinctive coating around condensed chromosomes in meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), and TRA98 has been noted to have a similar reticular or netlike localization in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Inoue et al., 2011</xref>). Due to these parallels, we hypothesized that the TRA98 antibody recognized the same antigen as GCNA1. Indeed, immunoprecipitation using TRA98 yielded 24% coverage of the GCNA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

Additionally, we disrupted the gene encoding GCNA in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and found that antigens recognized by both antibodies were depleted, confirming that GCNA1 and TRA98 antibodies recognize the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mouse GCNA is predicted to be entirely disordered</title><p>The repetitive structure and biased amino acid composition of mouse GCNA is characteristic of intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs).

We found that each region has a unique signature found only in GCNA orthologs, allowing us to unambiguously identify such orthologs in a diverse array of eukaryotic species, more than two hundred in all (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, even though we discovered GCNA orthologs using alignable structured domains, our amino acid charge/hydropathy analysis reveals that, almost invariably, the proteins have a large non-alignable IDR at their N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Despite a lack of primary sequence conservation, the overall amino acid composition of IDRs is often conserved in orthologous disordered protein families, as it is not the exact sequence of amino acids, but the overall character of the IDR – such as an abundance of residues that may be post-translationally modified, net charge, and amino acid enrichments and depletions – that confers function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, a comparison of mouse and human GCNA proteins showed that, while they were not readily aligned using conventional approaches, they do share highly repetitive and acidic IDRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nolte et al., 2001</xref>). A survey of the IDR composition of over 100 GCNA proteins across eukarya revealed that GCNA IDRs have characteristic amino acid enrichments and depletions – some shared with proteins in a disordered dataset (DisProt) and others specific to the GCNA family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In keeping with another common IDR paradigm, GCNA proteins across species, including mouse and human, share short, linear protein-protein interaction motifs embedded within a larger disordered context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>GCNA orthologs are present in every eukaryotic superkingdom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Simpson and Roger, 2004</xref>).

With certain exceptions including plants and protostomes such as drosophilids, each species contains one <italic>Gcna</italic> gene. Our analyses of these orthologs allowed us to deduce that a typical GCNA protein has four components: a large IDR, a zinc metalloprotease domain, a C2C2 zinc finger, and a non-canonical two-helix HMG box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Protein disorder is ubiquitously present in eukaryotic proteomes; greater than 30% of proteins have disordered segments of 30 or more consecutive residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunker et al., 2000</xref>). IDRs, rather than having a single, well-defined fold, dynamically interconvert between an ensemble of conformations separated by low energy barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chebaro et al., 2015</xref>). IDRs therefore challenge the expectations set forth in the structure-function paradigm, which posits that the function of a protein is dependent upon its three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wright and Dyson, 1999</xref>). IDRs have critical biological functions across a wide variety of cellular processes including transcription, regulatory, and signaling pathways, and it has been proposed that IDRs support the processes that underlie the development of multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xie et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tantos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dunker et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Male sterility caused by mutation of the entirely disordered mouse GCNA indicates that the function of GCNA proteins lies at least in part in the disordered region. While the molecular functions of GCNA IDRs remain to be elucidated, prior studies of other IDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van der Lee et al., 2014</xref>) and specifically the known roles of the IDRs in the homologous proteins Wss1 and Spartan inform our thinking about GCNA IDR functions. Homology with Wss1 and Spartan proteins suggests that GCNA IDRs function in molecular recognition mediated by SUMO interacting motifs, thereby recruiting or scaffolding larger protein complexes. GCNA IDRs may also contribute to nucleic acid binding, either alone or in combination with the zinc finger and HMG box.</p><p>GCNA may be among the first of many disordered protein families to be implicated in reproduction, as sex chromosomes, which have been shown to be enriched for genes encoding germ cell genes, are also enriched for disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hegyi and Tompa, 2012</xref>).

Wss1 and Spartan protease domains and SUMO interacting motifs are essential for response to DNA damage caused by ionizing radiation, UV light, and chemical crosslinkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Centore et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stingele et al., 2014</xref>). GCNA shares these common elements. By extrapolation, we propose that the GCNA protein family identified here may also function in maintenance of genome integrity, and has become specialized for cells whose genomes will be passed to the next generation. As such, GCNA may help cells cope with the additional DNA damage burden that accompanies meiosis, a process that involves extensive, programmed DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Keeney, 2008</xref>).</p><p>While at first glance the phenotypes of mouse and <italic>C. elegans Gcna</italic> mutants seem disparate, they are consistent with defects in DNA damage repair in both organisms.

The proteins were heirarchically clustered by average linkage on the basis of this dissimilarity matrix using the 'linkage' and 'dendrogram' functions from the Python package SciPy (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://scipy.org">http://scipy.org</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008058">SCR_008058</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>SUMO interacting motif discovery</title><p>SUMO interacting motif discovery was carried out using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003085">SCR_003085</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dinkel et al., 2016</xref>) where a SUMO interacting motif is defined as [DEST]{0,5}.[VILPTM][VIL][DESTVILMA][VIL].{0,1}[DEST]{1,10}, representing a hydrophobic core surrounded by acidic or phosphorylatable residues, with the C terminal residues having a longer acidic stretch.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank H Christensen, D deRooij, J Hughes, M Kojima, M Mikedis, P Nicholls, and K Romer for advice and comments on the manuscript; E Spooner at the Whitehead Proteomics Facility for mass spectrometry; the Koch Institute ES Cell and Transgenics Facility for assistance with C57BL/6N ES cell targeting; the WM Keck Biological Imaging Facility at the Whitehead Institute for use of the confocal microscope; G Welstead and M Goodheart for blastocyst injections; T DeCesare and T Endo for illustrations; A Godfrey for assistance with graphical representation using SciPy; P Tomancak, E Lecuyer, and H Krause for permission to reproduce fly embryo data; M Colaiacovo for generous instruction on <italic>C. elegans</italic> handling and immunohistochemistry; and M Martinez for technical assistance with targeting vector construction.

They show that GCNA in mouse is a highly disordered protein consisting solely of intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) thus precluding sequence/structure based homolog identification. They cleverly use synteny mapping to identify vertebrate orthologes of GCNA, which contain structured domains (protease, zinc finger and HMG box) in addition to the IDRs. They then utilize the structured domains in vertebrate GCNAs in order to identify GCNA orthologes in a sequence-dependent manner. The authors identify GCNA orthologes in all the major eukaryotic kingdoms and show that GCNA gene expression is specifically enriched in reproductive cells in a wide variety of eukaryotes. All of the above data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) appears to be well supported and is clearly laid out within the manuscript.</p><p>Given the expression in reproductive cells across a wide swathe of eukaryotes, the authors next examine effects of GCNA mutation in mice and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), eukaryotes that diverged ~600 mya. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, they generate two distinct GCNA mutants and show that these mutants exhibit a ~10-20% drop in brood size and a ~3-6 fold increase in X chromosome non-disjunction suggesting a defect in meiosis. In mice, the authors generate a GCNA mutant by removing GCNA exon 4 and show a striking loss of male fertility while female fertility is unaffected. These data are vital as they suggest an important role for GCNA in eukaryotic reproductive function. However, the discrepancy between a relatively small fertility defect in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> GCNA mutants in comparison to the almost complete sterility of male GCNA mutant mice is puzzling but not addressed. It is therefore unclear if GCNA is performing a similar role in both species and whether its function is conserved. To address this, a more comprehensive examination of mouse GCNA mutant phenotypes would be required: but such thorough characterizations are beyond the scope of this study, thus the text should be edited to convey this point (germ line function seems to be conserved, but the detail of their function in each species remains unclear).</p><p>Finally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, the authors suggest that GCNA is homologous to the DNA repair proteins, Wss1 and Spartan based on structural modeling, domain composition and the presence of SIM motifs in the unstructured domain. Based on predicted homology, the authors speculate in the Discussion that GCNA may bind sumoylated proteins and play a role in resolving meiotic double strand breaks. However, these speculations are not supported by experimental data and seem to add little to the manuscript. The manuscript does not even have data to show germ cells from GCNA mutants show phenotypes consistent with their idea, such as accumulation of DNA damages. Additionally, no evidence is provided to show that GCNA interacts with SUMOylated proteins. In the absence of such data, speculations on GCNA function seem to be without a solid foundation. Again, such in-depth characterizations of GCNA protein function are clearly beyond the scope of present study: thus again it is recommended that they edit the text (possibly removing figures) so as not to mislead the readers with the speculations that lack evidence.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting paper describing the identification, functional analyses and evolutionary history of a protein family that is implicated in the earliest steps of meiosis and germ line specification in diverse eukaryotes. Interestingly, the proteins that they analyze were already well-known and longstanding antigenic markers for the germline, whose genes had not previously been revealed. The fact these genes are also widely distributed in diverse eukaryotes is the extra piece that makes this paper particularly compelling.</p><p>The data presented are solid and the overall conclusions are valid. I will not comment in detail on the experimental portions of the analyses except to say that I see no problems. However, I do find the bioinformatics to be mostly appropriate and their resulting inferences are overall supported. The paper will be of broad general interest to a diverse community including cell, molecular and evolutionary biologists--anyone interested in meiosis and the germ line. As such, the paper should be published in <italic>eLife</italic> pending some relatively minor revisions. Most of the comments below reflect suggestions to modify the precision of language, primarily as it reflects the evolutionary analyses and their inferences.</p><p>In general, I find some of the evolutionary language to be a bit loose for a scientific report. For example, in the abstract the authors cite &quot;at least 600 million years&quot;, when nowhere in the paper do they cite a source for this number. Although this might be roughly correct, stating it in this way lends an unwarranted air of accuracy to their statements. Why not just say that it traces to the common ancestor of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammals? This issue is particularly problematic with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in which the source(s) of information on divergence times are not specified and even if they were, should be not assumed to be very precise.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>In the fifth paragraph of the subsection “GCNA orthologs containing an IDR and a unique combination of conserved structured domains are present in every eukaryotic suprakingdom”, first sentence. I think that the authors mean &quot;Superkingdom&quot;. They should also cite one of many possible papers on the definition of eukaryotic superkingdoms.</p><p>In the second paragraph of the subsection “GCNA is homologous to two protein families involved in replication-associated DNA repair”. Referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> as a phylogenetic tree is a bit misleading, as the method used doesn't really have the ability to recover the actual evolutionary relationships among these four protein families. I had to look in the Methods (subsection “Dendrogram of metalloprotease families') to reveal that the tree presented was prepared using a hierarchical clustering method. Yes, it's a dendrogram, but it has limited value in determining the evolutionary relationships. For example, there is little confidence in the relationships between the three eukaryotic protein groups and the prokaryotic one (e.g., what is the earliest branch and what are each others' closest relatives) making statements like &quot;GCNA is in fact closer to Spartan&quot; and &quot;an exclusive cluster that diverged from each other in bacteria&quot; lacking support. The dendrogram shown is a loose estimate at best, but since it’s not based on formal phylogenetic criteria should be discussed with caution.</p><p>Discussion, last paragraph. &quot;GCNA is more ancient than all but <italic>Piwi</italic>, and predates the origin of a dedicated metazoan germline by a billion years.&quot; Again, this statement is overly strong and lacking in clear evidentiary support.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.
