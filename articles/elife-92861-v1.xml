Their brains perceive the external world via their sensory systems, compute information together with that of internal states and autonomous activity, and generate appropriate behavioral outputs. However, how do these processes evolve across evolution? Here, focusing on the sense of olfaction, we have studied the evolution in olfactory sensitivity, preferences, and behavioral responses to six different food-related amino acid odors in the two eco-morphs of the fish <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>. To this end, we have developed a high-throughput behavioral setup and pipeline of quantitative and qualitative behavior analysis, and we have tested 489 six-week-old <italic>Astyanax</italic> larvae. The blind, dark-adapted morphs of the species showed markedly distinct basal swimming patterns and behavioral responses to odors, higher olfactory sensitivity, and a strong preference for alanine, as compared to their river-dwelling eyed conspecifics. In addition, we discovered that fish have an individual ‘swimming personality’, and that this personality influences their capability to respond efficiently to odors and find the source. Importantly, the personality traits that favored significant responses to odors were different in surface fish and cavefish. Moreover, the responses displayed by second-generation cave × surface F2 hybrids suggested that olfactory-driven behavior and olfactory sensitivity is a quantitative genetic trait. Our findings show that olfactory processing has rapidly evolved in cavefish at several levels: detection threshold, odor preference, and foraging behavior strategy. Cavefish is therefore an outstanding model to understand the genetic, molecular, and neurophysiological basis of sensory specialization in response to environmental change.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic></kwd><kwd>teleost</kwd><kwd>fish</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EQU202003010144</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rétaux</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual olfactory-driven behaviors, odor preferences, and olfactory sensitivity have rapidly evolved in blind Mexican cavefish, as a quantitative genetic trait.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>With more than 26,000 species representing half of vertebrates, bony fishes are extremely diverse and have colonized all possible ecological niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helfman et al., 2009</xref>), making them outstanding models to study the neurophysiological, genetic, and evolutionary underpinnings of adaptive behaviors. To colonize, survive, and thrive in various environments, sensory systems are particularly crucial as they serve as windows to the external world, and they display an exceptional diversity in fishes. From the visual system of deep-sea fish shaped to catch the rare photons or the point-like bioluminescent signals to the mobile barbels covered with taste buds to probe the sea bottom and detect buried prey of bottom feeders, examples abound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Busserolles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiyohara et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The anatomical sensory specializations, i.e., the relative importance taken by specific sensory organs or brain sensory areas, arise during embryonic development through regulatory processes that control the patterning of the neuroepithelium and that define boundaries between presumptive neural regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krubitzer et al., 2011</xref>). The relative investment in different sensory modules governs anatomical and behavioral specializations. Among fish, sand-dwelling cichlids that rely almost exclusively on vision to execute behaviors develop a large optic tectum, whereas rock-dwelling cichlids, which inhabit complex environments, have small optic tecta but an enlarged telencephalon, and these variations arise early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sylvester et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, in the embryos of dark-adapted blind Mexican cavefish, the presumptive eyefield territory is reduced but the presumptive olfactory epithelium is increased in size, presumably as a compensation for the loss of visual modality in the dark environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnès et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinaux et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pottin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Torres-Paz et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>While the comparative anatomy of fish brains is reasonably well documented, behavioral studies have mainly focused on a few model species, primarily zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalueff et al., 2013</xref>). The behavioral correlates of sensory systems diversity and evolution in fishes are poorly described and understood, which hampers the interpretation of cross-species comparisons. For example, the size and complexity of fish olfactory organs is highly variable and correlates with the richness of odorant receptors repertoire, defining a morpho-genomic space in which olfactory specialists and non-specialists species distribute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burguera et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Policarpo et al., 2022</xref>). On the lower end, sunfish or pipefish have a small and flat olfactory epithelium and possess ~30 odorant receptor genes. On the higher end, polypteriforms have large and complex olfactory rosettes with up to 300 lamellae and possess ~1300 odorant receptor genes. Yet, the differences in olfactory behaviors, sensitivity, and preferences between these species are completely unknown.</p><p>To start addressing the question of the evolution of olfactory sensory-driven behaviors in an amenable laboratory fish model, we used the blind cave and the river-dwelling morphs of the Mexican tetra, the characiform <italic>Astyanax mexicanus</italic>. The species has become an established model for evolutionary biology at large, including evolution of behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duboué and Keene, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hinaux et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kowalko, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshizawa, 2016</xref>). Cavefish embryos and larvae have larger olfactory pits than surface fish and their neuronal composition is changed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinaux et al., 2016a</xref>), while adults of the two forms have a similar olfactory rosette with 20–25 lamellae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schemmel, 1967</xref>). The recent divergence between the two forms probably did not allow for a substantial evolution of their olfactory receptor gene repertoire, which is almost identical in the two eco-morphotypes (245 genes in cavefish, 233 genes in surface fish, from recent genome assemblies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Policarpo et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, cavefish larvae tested in groups display outstanding olfactory detection capacities, as they are attracted to extremely low concentration of the amino acid alanine (10<sup>–10</sup> M) while surface fish larvae have a more ‘classical’ threshold (10<sup>–5</sup> M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinaux et al., 2016a</xref>) which approximates levels of free amino acids found in natural waters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hara, 1994</xref>). In wild natural caves too, groups of cavefish adults respond to low concentrations of odorants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blin et al., 2020</xref>). We hypothesized that the evolution of olfactory system development and olfactory skills in blind cavefish is an adaptive trait that, together with other constructive sensory changes in mechano-sensory and gustatory systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Varatharasan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yamamoto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoshizawa and Jeffery, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshizawa et al., 2014</xref>), may have contributed to their adaptation and survival in the extreme environment of their subterranean habitat. Focusing on olfaction, here we developed a sensitive, high-throughput behavioral assay and a pipeline for analysis to compare the types of behavioral responses elicited by food-related, amino acid odors in cavefish and surface fish, at population and individual levels. We determined their olfactory preferences and sensitivity thresholds for six amino acids, and we analyzed their behavioral responses in detail. We also described olfactory-driven behaviors in second-generation (F2) hybrids resulting from crosses between surface and cave morphs, as an attempt to understand the genetic component of the ‘olfaction trait’ in <italic>Astyanax</italic> morphs. We discovered that the behaviors triggered by odorant stimulation has markedly evolved in cavefish.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A high-throughput, sensitive behavioral assay to compare individual’s behaviors in <italic>Astyanax</italic> morphotypes</title><p>Our goal was to compare (1) olfactory discrimination capacities, (2) odor preferences, and (3) behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli in Pachón cavefish (CF), surface fish (SF), and F2 hybrids (F2) individuals. As the three types of fish are markedly different in terms of basal swimming activity and patterns, we first sought to characterize the diversity of these behaviors in order to be able to interpret accurately fish responses to odors.</p><p>Six-week-old fish were habituated either 1 hr or 24 hr in their individual test box and they were first recorded for 30 min in the dark, without any stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; see Methods). We observed and categorized several typical and distinctive ‘baseline’ swimming behaviors for individual fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>): random/haphazard swim (R), wall following (WF; defined as the fish continuously following the four sides of the box and turning around it, in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion), large or small circles (C), thigmotactism (T, along the X- or the Y-axis of the box; defined as the fish swimming back and forth along one of the four sides of the box), or combinations thereof. The distribution of these different types of swimming patterns was significantly different in Pachón CF, SF, and F2 types of fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; Fisher’s exact test; see also Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for another representation using correspondence analysis [CA] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for a full color code representation of swimming patterns combinations). A majority of SF swam in a random pattern (blue shades), while a majority of CF performed wall following (red/brown shades) and F2 fish showed more diversified swimming patterns. Importantly, the distribution of these baseline-swimming patterns was affected as a function of the habituation time, in all three types of fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; p=0.044 for SF, p=0.0005 for CF, and p=0.0005 for F2, Fisher’s exact tests). Moreover, thigmotactism behavior, which we have previously shown to represent stress behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pierre et al., 2020</xref>), was frequent in SF after 1 hr habituation (70% of individuals) but reduced after 24 hr acclimation (37%). In the same line, the swimming speed was different for all fish types when computed after 1 hr or after 24 hr of habituation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This suggested that natural, unperturbed behavior is better observed after long, 24 hr habituation, which we applied thereafter.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental setup for testing behavioral responses to olfactory stimulation in individual, 6-week-old, <italic>A. mexicanus</italic> larvae.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each fish is placed individually in 150 ml water in a rectangular test box placed on an infrared light emitting table.

These results suggest that fish display individual swimming behaviors that are stable through time and may be considered as individual swimming personality or temperament.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92861-fig2-figsupp3-v1.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>As described above at population level, CF, SF, and F2 displayed overall markedly different basal swimming patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; see also Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for another representation using CA). Yet, at individual level, there was a substantial degree of variability across individuals within a morphotype. That is, even though most SF tended to swim randomly (75% after 24 hr habituation; blue shades on graphs) and most CF performed wall following (50%; red/brown shades), these behaviors were not exclusive as some SF individuals displayed thigmotactism behavior or some CF individuals swam in circles. Moreover and importantly, the type of swim pattern of each individual fish was remarkably stable and reproducible along several days of recordings, and swimming kinetics (position in the box, swimming speed, number of round trips in X and Y) showed no or very little variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together, these observations strengthened the importance of (1) using long habituation times and (2) studying individual behaviors. They further highlighted an overlooked aspect of fish behavioral analyses: fish may have a ‘personality’ that we sought to take into account when comparing behavioral responses to odors below.</p><p>Finally, Pachón CF, SF, and F2 possess markedly different sensory apparatuses and capacities, not only for chemo- but also for mechano-sensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lunsford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshizawa et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, to test behavioral responses specific to olfactory stimuli, we wanted to find a way to deliver odors that would be vibration-less. We choose to inject odorant solutions inside tubes attached at the two extremities of the test box, designed to stop the wave and flow that would otherwise arise at the surface of the water upon injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The efficacy of the device was demonstrated by the lack of perturbation in swimming behavior, neither qualitative (i.e. behavioral response and swimming pattern; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AB</xref>) nor quantitative (i.e. swimming kinetics; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) for the three types of fish when water/control injections were performed on one side of the test box (or two sides; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). This suggested that our way to deliver odorant solutions did not generate vibratory perturbations.

Cavefish have no eyes, but they possess enhanced mechanosensory lateral line and chemosensory gustatory and olfactory organs. To decipher behavioral responses driven by a single of these senses, one needs to control carefully the potential influence of the other sensory modalities. Here, we have recorded unimodal behavioral responses driven exclusively by olfaction by performing experiments in the dark to abrogate vision in sighted fish, and by designing a setup where the delivery of the olfactory stimulus is vibration-free. Moreover, we know from previous studies that gustatory taste buds do not participate in responses to amino acids at the concentrations used because the lesion of the olfactory epithelium abolishes the attraction to high concentrations of alanine, in both SF and CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinaux et al., 2016a</xref>).</p><p>Due to a mutation in their monoamine oxidase enzyme that interferes with the metabolism of brain monoamines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elipot et al., 2014</xref>), Pachón cavefish have lower basal cortisol levels, hence lower basal anxiety than surface fish, when they are long habituated in their home tank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pierre et al., 2020</xref>). However, the mutation confers cavefish with a much higher stressability after environmental change, such as the transfer in a novel tank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pierre et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, in order to record relevant behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli in unstressed fish, we used long acclimation times (72 hr) and we tested long habituation times, either 1 hr or 24 hr – as compared to 10 min as usually done in most fish studies including zebrafish or <italic>Astyanax</italic>. We concluded that 1 hr is too short for proper habituation, as the swimming speed and patterns were affected for both SF, CF, and F2 as compared to 24 hr. Importantly, such long, 24 hr habituation periods are susceptible to reveal unperturbed and even novel behaviors: recently applied in a study of social behaviors in cavefish, 3 days of habituation allowed the analysis of behaviors in a familiar environment and could unmask social interactions in the so-called ‘asocial’ cavefish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iwashita and Yoshizawa, 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Neurophysiological and molecular considerations</title><p>In all vertebrates including fish, odorant molecules are recognized by olfactory receptors expressed at the surface of olfactory sensory neurons, which project onto the olfactory glomeruli in the olfactory bulb with the one receptor: one glomerulus rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Axel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braubach et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kermen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koide et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoshihara, 2008</xref>). Moreover, parallel neural pathways in the olfactory circuitry process different types of odorants. In zebrafish, the perception of amino acids is mediated via OlfC/V2R receptors on microvillous sensory neurons that innervate lateral and ventro-medial glomeruli in the bulb. From the periphery to the brain, <italic>Astyanax</italic> surface and cave morphs display some variations in this amino acid signal processing circuitry. SF have 43 and CF have 41 V2R/OlfC receptor genes in their genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Policarpo et al., 2022</xref>), a minor difference that is unlikely to underlie their differences in olfactory capacities and preferences. CF larvae have higher proportions of microvillous neurons than SF, which together with the larger size of their olfactory epithelium and olfactory bulbs may influence their olfactory sensibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blin et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>Astyanax</italic> glomerular organization is unknown.</p><p>Interestingly, here we have found that CF are strongly attracted and respond to alanine and histidine, two amino acids which, albeit probably not recognized by the same receptor(s), are processed in the same or very close glomeruli in zebrafish larval olfactory bulbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2005</xref>). SF on the other hand seem to show a preference for cysteine (sulfur), the amino acid that is the most potent to evoke electrical responses in the olfactory bulbs of sea breams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubbard et al., 2011</xref>) or hammerhead sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tricas et al., 2009</xref>), and that elicits a strong aversive behavioral response in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vitebsky et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, odor preferences have evolved between cavefish and surface fish, as well as between zebrafish and <italic>Astyanax</italic>. In the same line, previously we had reported that chondroitin is a strong attractant for <italic>Astyanax</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blin et al., 2020</xref>), whereas it induces freezing and fear behavior in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mathuru et al., 2012</xref>). Such significant variations in odor preferences or value may be adaptive and relate to the differences in the environmental and ecological conditions in which these different animals live. Of note, we have not found an odor that would be repulsive for <italic>Astyanax</italic> so far, and this may relate to their opportunist, omnivorous, and detritivore regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Espinasa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marandel et al., 2020</xref>). However, the reason why Pachón cavefish have become ‘alanine specialists’ remains a mystery and prompts analysis of the chemical ecology of their natural habitat. Alternatively, specialization for alanine may not need to be specific for an olfactory cue present only, or frequently, or in high amounts in caves. Bat guano for example, which is probably the main source of food in the Pachón cave, must contain and release many amino acids. Enhanced recognition of only one of them – in the present case alanine but evolution may have randomly acted for enhanced recognition of another amino acid – should suffice to confer cavefish with augmented sensitivity to their main source of nutriment.</p><p>Cavefish have also evolved regarding olfactory sensitivity. They are able to detect very low concentrations of alanine (aliphatic), hence they have a lower detection threshold than SF. Injection of low concentration alanine 10<sup>–4</sup> M/10<sup>–5</sup> M (thus 10<sup>–6</sup> M/10<sup>–7</sup> M in the odorant third of the arena) elicits strong behavioral responses in CF, whereas even higher concentrations of 10<sup>–3</sup> M and 10<sup>–2</sup> M evoke modest responses in SF (zero response at population level, 19% responders at individual level with alanine 10<sup>–3</sup> M). We have performed dose-response experiments for three out of the six amino acids tested and for both morphs. With these, CF also appear capable of detecting low concentrations of cysteine (sulfur). Moreover, they seem to detect better histidine 10<sup>–2</sup> M (polar) as well (69.2% of CF responders, versus 42.1% of SF), and CF but not SF detected lysine (polar) at the relatively high concentration of 10<sup>–2</sup> M. From these observations, we can predict that the difference between SF and CF probably does not lie in the molecular evolution of their olfactory receptor repertoire, because it is unlikely that all the receptors recognizing diverse types of amino acids have evolved all at once. Rather, we can hypothesize that evolution occurred at the level of the general regulation of odorant receptor genes expression, or at the level of olfactory processing and computation in the bulbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedrich et al., 2009</xref>), or in higher order brain regions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A variety of behavioral responses to olfactory stimulation</title><p>Our study suggests that behavioral responses to a unimodal olfactory sensory stimulus are complex and have evolved in cavefish (summary on <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). When they detect the odor stimulus, cavefish globally decrease their scanning activity, which might help them to compute and swim up toward the higher values of concentration in the odor plume. This is associated to a change in swimming pattern whereby WF and T are eliminated at the expense of R and C, presumably to facilitate searching. This hypothesis is further supported by their systematic change of position in the box, meaning that they locate efficiently the odor source. Strikingly, surface fish display opposite behavioral responses after odor detection: they rather increase locomotor activity, which corresponds to intense foraging but does not seem optimal to find the odor source, which is confirmed by their lack of change in position of the box (i.e. they may not locate efficiently the odor source). This is also consistent with the fact that at individual level the best SF responders are slow swimmers. Such poor ability to find the odor source may result from testing in the dark. Indeed, SF behaviors are mostly visually driven (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simon et al., 2019</xref>) and they might need multimodal visual+olfactory integration to find food efficiently. These interpretations are consistent with early work showing that, when competing in the dark and with limited amounts of food, SF starve and CF thrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hüppop, 1987</xref>). In sum, CF foraging strategy has evolved in response to the serious challenge of finding food in the dark. Future experiments including functional imaging of brain activity in live animals may reveal the changes in olfactory-driven motor circuits that allowed the evolution of behavioral outputs in cavefish.</p><p>Finally, at population level, F2 fish shared some behavioral response traits with both parental morphs, and they were often closer to CF. At individual level their responses were also variable and non-stereotyped (including for alanine 10<sup>–3</sup> M and histidine 10<sup>–2</sup> M, the conditions for which CF showed highly stereotyped responses). Olfactory scores behave as a quantitative trait. The tools we have developed here will allow the future determination of the genetic underpinnings of the evolution of olfactory-driven cavefish behaviors and capabilities.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>A ‘personality’ for each fish?</title><p>Our recordings of several hundred (n=489 total) well-habituated, individual <italic>Astyanax</italic> larvae highlight an often overlooked aspect of fish behavioral analyses: fish may have a ‘personality’ or ‘temperament’, which we characterized at the level of their baseline swimming patterns. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the consistency over time, one day after the other, of the favorite swimming pattern or combination of patterns and of the swimming kinetics expressed by individuals when freely swimming without stimulus (most fish were recorded on 4 days distributed over 2 weeks). To our knowledge, this is the first time individual temperament is taken into consideration in <italic>Astyanax</italic> behavioral studies.</p><p>In the context of ecology and evolution, the personality in non-human animals was proposed to be organized along five primary axes: sociability, boldness, aggressiveness, exploration, and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Réale et al., 2007</xref>). In fish, studies applying an animal personality approach have focused to resolve variations in physiological and molecular parameters, suggesting a link between phenotype and genotype, or between behavior and transcriptome regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rey et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we propose that the different temperaments expressed by individual larvae/juveniles could correspond to the genetic diversity present in the natural populations of <italic>Astyanax</italic>, a diversity that we have maintained intentionally along generations in captivity in our fish facility.</p><p>Further, we have assessed whether swimming temperaments could influence the way and the extent to which fish respond to an olfactory sensory stimulus. Strikingly, we discovered that baseline swimming patterns and swimming speed do influence fish olfactory responses. In addition, important personality traits that confer positive behavioral responses are not the same in SF and CF. For cavefish, WF and round trips in X (but not speed) are the key parameters. Wall following behavior has been reported in <italic>Astyanax</italic> and other blind cavefish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Patton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharma et al., 2009</xref>) and was hypothesized to confer foraging advantages, although this had never been directly tested. Here, it seems to be the case for 6-week-old juveniles in a rectangular box – but the link may be more elusive when considering a fish swimming in a natural, complex environment. We propose that WF and round trips in X are together the expression of an intense exploratory behavior, which allows CF to better cover their swimming space and thus have a higher probability to detect odorant cues – even at very low concentrations because their detection capacities for some amino acids are excellent. By contrast, a slow swimming speed (but not swimming pattern) is the most critical personality parameter for SF. As SF olfactory concentration detection thresholds are higher than CF, one could imagine that they need more integration time inside the odorant plume to trigger a neuronal and a behavioral response. In any case and importantly, personality parameters that matter in CF and SF to confer good olfactory response scores are distinct. This suggests that the modulation of neuronal circuits underlying both the control of baseline behaviors and olfactory processing has evolved in cavefish.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Previous studies had shown that, when tested in groups, cavefish larvae as well as adults smell better than their surface fish conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinaux et al., 2016a</xref>).

In addition, a net (6.5×6.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) was attached around each tube and reached the bottom of the box, to prevent fish from passing under the tube during the experiment, thus escaping from the subsequent tracking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavior tests</title><p>Larvae were placed individually in a box containing 150 ml of water (clean rearing water), fed with micro-worms (three drops of concentrated <italic>Panagrellus redivivus</italic> solution placed in the center of the box) and subjected to a 12 hr:12 hr day:night cycle for 72 hr acclimation. Then, the water in each box was changed, the boxes were placed on IR tables for 24 hr, and the larvae were fasted (=habituation). The day of testing, for reasons of reproducibility, all experiments started at 11 a.m. The light was switched off, the cameras were switched on, and the experimenter left the room for a 30 min baseline behavior recording period. At t=30 min, the experimenter entered the room and switched on the inactinic red lamps. Solutions were manually injected bilaterally (500 µl of odor/500 µl of water) into the injection guides of each box. The total time needed to perform injections of 32 boxes was 5 min. Then, the experimenter switched off the inactinic lamps and left the room for a 30 min response behavior recording period. At the end of recording, the water was changed and each box was placed back exactly at the same location on IR table for 24 hr and not moved again until the following day of testing (the larvae were not fed). For the series of experiments with a habituation period of 1 hr, the water in the boxes was changed every morning, 1 hr before the start of the test. The typical timeline was as follows: [72 hr acclimation and feeding], week 1 [habituation 24 hr, test day 1, habituation, test day 2, rest and feeding for 3 days], week 2 [habituation, test day 3, habituation, test day 4]. As the larvae were tested on several consecutive days, to ensure that the fish were not learning/associating one side with a scent cue, the odor injection side was reversed each day. The control experiments (unilateral or bilateral injection of 500 µl rearing water or no injection) were always carried out on the day 1 when the larvae were naive. For the ‘light vs dark’ control experiment, SF were filmed 30 min in normal light and 30 min in the dark.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Odorant solutions</title><p>The odorant solutions were prepared by dilution of amino acids in clean rearing water (L-Alanine #A7627; L-Serine #S4500; L-Lysine #L5501; L-Histidine #H8000; L-Leucine #L8000; and L-Cysteine #168149; all from Sigma-Aldrich). A volume of 500 µl (either water or odor) was injected with a 1 ml syringe (Sigma-Aldrich #Z683531) fitted with a needle (0.8×50 mm<sup>2</sup>, 21 G; B Braun #4665503). Depending on the test, concentration of solutions injected were 10<sup>–2</sup> M or 10<sup>–3</sup> M or 10<sup>–4</sup> M. In a total water volume of 150 ml, with a box virtually separated into three, the volume of water in the odor injection zone is 50 ml. By injecting 500 µl of solution into this zone, we expected to obtain a dilution factor of 100. For example, for a concentration of [10<sup>–3</sup> M] in the syringe, the concentration in the odor injection zone will therefore be ~[10<sup>–5</sup> M]. All concentrations given in the article indicate the concentration inside the syringe.</p><p>When consecutive injections of an odor or different odors at different concentrations were tested on the same fish, they were performed from the least concentrated to the most concentrated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Video editing and tracking</title><p>Videos were saved on SD card in AVI format (1208×720 px, 30 fps), then edited using Adobe Premiere Pro V14.0 to be calibrated at 1 hr long without the 5 min injection time. They were then exported into MPG2 format. The tracking software used was TheRealFishTracker V.0.4.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/FishTracker/">https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~mccrae/projects/FishTracker/</ext-link>), developed and freely available from the University of Toronto. In our hands, it was the only software able to detect properly transparent CF larvae. The parameters used were Confidence Threshold = 10; Mean Filter Size = 1; signed Image = <italic>dark object</italic> and all other parameters were the default ones. The x/y-scales were drawn and given in cm. The output data file provided 30 X/Y coordinates (in pixels and in cm) per seconds for a 1 hr movie.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Graphical representations, quantifications, and statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were carried out with R-3.4.2 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">R Development Core Team, 2016</xref>) using the stats and rstatix libraries, and all graphical representations were designed using the ggplot2, ggrepel, gghighlight, and RGraphics libraries.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantitative parameters</title><p>From the output data set, pixel coordinates Xpi and Ypi were first recoded using the box center as 0, Xcmax = 1 on the odor side and Xcmin = –1 on the water side. The same was applied to the Y coordinate with Ycmax = 0.74 and Ycmin = –0.74. Fish position in the box along the X-axis during test was calculated using Xc and Yc at each time point (30/s). Speed between two time points (5 s time step) was calculated, thanks to Pythagoras’s theorem using X/Y in cm. Round trip number is the total number of time the fish crosses the 0.5 and –0.5 position (along X-axis) divided by two. Idem for round trips in Y-axis. Quantitative parameter means were all calculated over a 15 min period, from minute 10 to minute 25 for the ‘before’ period, and from minute 37 to minute 52 for the ‘after’ period. Means are represented by box plots showing the distribution of individual values of each fish (black dots), the median, the 25th- 75th percentile, and outliers indicated by fish ID number. Paired Mann-Whitney two-tailed tests were performed to compare means of position, speed, or round trips before and after odor injection.</p><p>Non-paired Mann-Whitney two-tailed tests were performed to compare means of speed between 1 hr and 24 hr habituation periods represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> by box plots.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Swimming patterns</title><p>The swimming activity of the fish in the test box was systematically represented under three different forms, which allow grasping the details and different aspects of the behaviors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Xc/t coordinates were used with the geom_line() function for the ‘Position (X-axis)’ graph, (Xc,Yc)/t coordinates were used with the geom_path() function for ‘2D’ top view, and the gg3D package for ‘2D+time’ view.</p><p>The determination of baseline swimming patterns and swimming patterns after odor injection was performed manually based on graphical representations such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Four distinctive baseline behaviors clearly emerged. (1) Random swim (R; defined as haphazard swimming with no clear pattern, covering entirely or partly the surface of the arena). (2) Wall following (WF; defined as the fish continuously following along the four sides of the box and turning around it, in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion). (3) Large or small circles (C; self-explanatory). (4) Thigmotactism (T, along the X- or the Y-axis of the box; defined as the fish swimming back and forth along one of the four sides of the box). On graphical representations of swimming pattern distributions, we used the following color code: R in blue, WF in red, C in green, T in yellow. Of note, many fish swam according to combination(s) of these four elementary swimming patterns (see descriptions in the legends of the figure supplements showing many examples). To fully represent the diversity and the combinations of swimming patterns used by individual fish, we used an additional color code derived from the ‘basic’ color code described above and where, e.g., R+WF is purple. The complete combinatorial color code is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. Of note, in all figures, the swimming pattern color code does not relate whatsoever with the time color code used in the 2D plus time representation of swimming tracks such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Swimming patterns (i.e. qualitative variables; compositional dataset) in different conditions were analyzed using Fisher’s exact test comparing the quantity and distribution of different swimming patterns between SF/CF/F2 at day 1, or over day 1 to day 4, or between 1 h vs 24 hr habituation period, or before vs after odor injection for each morphotype.</p><p>To reinforce our conclusions, swimming patterns in different conditions were also compared using CA, an appropriate method to analyze compositional data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greenacre, 2021</xref>). The results are plotted in Figure supplements. The distribution of swimming patterns in SF/CF/F2 in control experiments, or before vs after odor injection for each morphotype confirm the changes (or absence of changes) in behavioral patterns suggested by the colored bar plots in main Figures, with confidence ellipses overlapping or not overlapping, depending on cases. Of note, CA cannot provide statistical support through calculation of p-values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Index and score</title><p>For quantitative swimming parameters: indexes of position, speed, and number of round trips changes were calculated using the equation (mean <italic>after</italic> – mean <italic>before</italic>)/(mean <italic>after</italic> + mean <italic>before</italic>) commonly used in olfactory tests in fish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koide et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wakisaka et al., 2017</xref>). The index can vary from 0 to 1. An index close to 0 indicates that the values of the considered parameter before or after odor injection are close. The higher the absolute value of the index, the greater the difference. When the parameter increases after injection, the index is positive; when the parameter decreases after injection, the index is negative. The <italic>absolute</italic> value of each index will be used for score calculation below.</p><p>For qualitative swimming parameter: the index of pattern change was calculated as the number of new patterns observed after stimulation, divided by the total number of patterns observed after odor injection. An index equal to 0 indicates no pattern change after stimulation. The higher the index is, the greater the difference of pattern is.</p><p>For each fish, the individual olfactory score for a given odor and concentration was the sum of the <italic>absolute</italic> values of the four indexes: individual score = |position index| + |speed index| + |round trips in X+Y index| + |pattern index|. On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, the four parameter’s indexes and the total individual fish olfactory scores are represented by dots connected by a colored line for each individual. Those with a score &gt;1.5 are highlighted and considered to display a significant behavioral response to the stimulus. The 1.5 threshold value was arbitrarily determined after the examination of individual olfactory scores in control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and the observation that the vast majority of fish have individual scores below this value in the absence of specific olfactory stimulus.</p><p>On <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and C</xref>, to assess the relationship between individual olfactory score and baseline swimming pattern, we pooled results of odors for which more than 40% of individuals have an olfactory score &gt;1.5. So for SF, alanine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/cysteine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/histidine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/serine [10<sup>–2</sup> M] have been used; for CF, alanine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/alanine [10<sup>–3</sup> M]/alanine [10<sup>–4</sup> M]/cysteine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/cysteine [10<sup>–3</sup> M]/histidine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/lysine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]; and for F2, alanine [10<sup>–3</sup> M]/cysteine [10<sup>–2</sup> M]/histidine [10<sup>–2</sup> M] (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Mann-Whitney two-tailed with Bonferroni post hoc tests were performed on each morphotype.</p><p>Slopes in linear regressions show relationships between mean speed or number of round trips before injection and olfactory score.

The authors develop a new behavioural assay for the long-term imaging of individual fish in a parallel high-throughput setup. The authors first demonstrate that the different morphs show different basal exploratory swimming patterns and that these patterns are stable for individual fish. Next, the authors test the attraction of fish to various concentrations of alanine and other amino acids. They find that the cave morph is a lot more sensitive to chemicals and shows directional chemotaxis along a diffusion gradient of amino acids. Surface fish, although can detect the chemicals, do not show marked chemotaxis behaviour and have an overall lower sensitivity. These differences have been reported previously but the authors report longer-term observations on many individual fish of both morphs and their F2 hybrids. The data also indicate that the observed behaviour is a quantitative genetic trait. The approach presented will allow the mapping of genes contribution to these traits. The work will be of general interest to behavioural neuroscientists and those interested in olfactory behaviours and the individual variability in behavioural patterns.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provide a large dataset of swimming behaviour for surface fish and cave fish and also their F2 hybrids, demonstrating large differences in chemosensory behaviour and indicating that this is a quantitative genetic trait.</p><p>One strength of the paper is the development of a new and improved setup for the behavioural imaging of individual fish for extended periods and under chemosensory stimulation. The authors show that cave fish need up to 24 h of habituation to display a behavioural pattern that is consistent and unlikely to be due to the stressed state of the animals. The setup also uses relatively large tanks that allows the build-up of chemical gradients.</p><p>With their new system, the authors could generate cleaner results without mechanical disturbances. The authors characterize multiple measurements to score the odour response behaviours and also developed a new personality analysis. Their conclusion that cave fish evolved as a specialist to sense alanine and histidine among 6 tested amino acids was well supported by their data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Further work will be needed to pinpoint the nature of the genetic changes and neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the differences between the two forms and the large individual variation of behaviours.</p><p>The authors did not measure the concentrations of alanine and other amino acids in the local cave water and surface water.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92861.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Blin</surname><given-names>Maryline</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Valay</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kuratko</surname><given-names>Manon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Pavie</surname><given-names>Marie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rétaux</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Saclay</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>In this important paper, Blin and colleagues develop a high-throughput behavioral assay to test spontaneous swimming and olfactory preference in individual Mexican cavefish larvae. The authors present compelling evidence that the surface and cave morphs of the fish show different olfactory preferences and odor sensitivities and that individual fish show substantial variability in their spontaneous activity that is relevant for olfactory behaviour. The paper will be of interest to neurobiologists working on the evolution of behaviour, olfaction, and the individuality of behaviour.</p><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors posed a research question about how an animal integrates sensory information to optimize its behavioral outputs and how this process evolved. Their data (behavioral output analysis with detailed categories in response to the different odors in different concentrations by comparing surface and cave populations and their hybrid) partially answer this tough question. They built a new low-disturbance system to answer the question. They also found that the personality of individual fish is a good predictor of behavioral outputs against odor response. They concluded that cavefish evolved to specialize their response to alanine and histidine while surface fish are more general responders, which was supported by their data.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>With their new system, the authors could generate clearer results without mechanical disturbances. The authors characterize multiple measurements to score the odor response behaviors, and also brought a new personality analysis. Their conclusion that cavefish evolved as a specialist to sense alanine and histidine among 6 tested amino acids was well supported by their data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors posed a big research question: How do animals evolve the processes of sensory integration to optimize their behavioral outputs? I personally feel that, to answer the questions about how sensory integration generates proper (evolved) behavior, the authors at least need to show the ecological relevance of their response. For the alanine/histidine preference in cavefish, they need data for the alanine and other amino acid concentrations in the local cave water and compare them with those of surface water.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. This is why, in the Discussion section, we had written: “…Such significant variations in odor preferences or value may be adaptive and relate to the differences in the environmental and ecological conditions in which these different animals live. However, the reason why Pachón cavefish have become “alanine specialists” remains a mystery and prompts analysis of the chemical ecology of their natural habitat. Of note, we have not found an odor that would be repulsive for Astyanax so far, and this may relate to their opportunist, omnivorous and detritivore regime (Espinasa et al., 2017; Marandel et al., 2020).” This is also why we currently develop field work projects aimed at clarifying this question. However, such experiments and analyses are challenging, practically and technically. We hope we can reach some conclusions in the future.</p><p>To complete the discussion we have also added an important hypothesis: “Alternatively, specialization for alanine may not need to be specific for an olfactory cue present only, or frequently, or in high amounts in caves. Bat guano for example, which is probably the main source of food in the Pachón cave, must contain many amino acids. Enhanced recognition of one of them - in the present case alanine but evolution may have randomly acted for enhanced recognition of another amino acid – should suffice to confer cavefish with augmented sensitivity to their main source of nutriment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as for &quot;personality matters&quot;, I read that personality explains a large variation in surface fish. Also, thigmotaxis or wall-following cavefish individuals are exceeded to respond well to odorants compared with circling and random swimming cavefish individuals. However, I failed to understand the authors' point about how much percentages of the odorant-response variations are explained (PVE) by personality. Association ( = correlation) was good to show as the authors presented, but showing proper PVE or the effect size of personality to predict the behavioral outputs is important to conclude &quot;personality is matter&quot;; otherwise, the conclusion is not so supported.</p><p>From the above, I recommend the authors reconsider the title also their research questions well. At this moment, I feel that the authors' conclusions and their research questions are a little too exaggerated, with less supportive evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this interesting suggestion, which we have fully taken into consideration. We have therefore now calculated and plotted PVE (the percentage of variation explained on the olfactory score) as a function of swimming speed or as a function of swimming pattern. The results are shown in modified Figure 8 of our revised ms and they suggest that the personality (here, swimming patterns or swimming speed) indeed predicts the olfactory response skills. Therefore, we would like to keep our title as we provide support for the fact that “personality matters”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, for the statistical method, Fisher's exact test is not appropriate for the compositional data (such as Figure 2B). The authors may quickly check it at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositional_data</ext-link> or <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436">https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436</ext-link>.</p><p>The authors may want to use centered log transformation or other appropriate transformations (Rpackage could be: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2006.11.017">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2006.11.017</ext-link>). According to changing the statistical tests, the authors' conclusion may not be supported.</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, in most cases, the distributions are so different (as seen by the completely different colors in the distribution graphs) that there is little doubt that swimming behaviors are indeed different between surface and cavefish, or between ‘before’ and ‘after’ odor stimulation. However, it is true that Fisher’s exact test is not fully appropriate because data can be considered as compositional type. For this kind of data, centered log transformation have been suggested. However, our dataset contains many zeros, and this is a case where log transformations have difficulty handling.</p><p>To help us dealing with our data, the reviewer proposed to consider the paper by Greenacre (2021)(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436">https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-statistics-042720-124436</ext-link>). In his paper,Greenacre clearly wrote: &quot;Zeros in compositional data are the Achilles heel of the logratio approach (LRA).&quot;</p><p>Therefore, we have now tested our data using CA (Correspondence Analysis), that can deal with table containing many zeros and is a trustable alternative to LRA (Cook-Thibeau, 2021; Greenacre, 2011).</p><p>The results of CA analysis are shown in Supplemental figure 8 and they fully confirm the difference in baseline swimming patterns between morphs as well as changes (or absence of changes) in behavioral patterns after odor stimulation suggested by the colored bar plots in main figures, with confidence ellipses overlapping or not overlapping, depending on cases.

They provide a dataset of unprecedented detail, that compares not only the behaviors of the two morphs but also that of a significant number of F2 hybrids, therefore also demonstrating that many of the differences observed between the two populations have a clear (and probably relatively simple) genetic underpinning.</p><p>To complete the monumental task of behaviorally testing 425 six-week-old Astyanax larvae, the authors created a setup that allows for the simultaneous behavioral monitoring of multiple larvae and the infusion of different odorants without introducing physical perturbations into the system, thus biasing the responses of cavefish that are particularly fine-tuned for this sensory modality. During the optimization of their protocol, the authors also found that for cave-dwelling forms one hour of habituation was insufficient and a full 24 hours were necessary to allow them to revert to their natural behavior. It is also noteworthy that this extremely large dataset can help us see that population averages of different morphs can mask quite significant variations in individual behaviors.</p><p>Testing with different amino-acids (applied as relevant food-related odorant cues) shows that cavefish are alanine- and histidine-specialists, while surface fish elicit the strongest behavioral responses to cysteine. It is interesting that the two forms also react differently after odor detection: while cave-dwelling fish decrease their locomotory activity, surface fish increase it. These differences are probably related to different foraging strategies used by the two populations, although, as the observations were made in the dark, it would be also interesting to see if surface fish elicit the same changes in light as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these nice comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Further work will be needed to pinpoint the exact nature of the genetic changes that underlie the differences between the two forms. Such experimental work will also reveal how natural selection acted on existing behavioral variations already present in the SF population.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. Searching for genetic underpinnings of the sensory-driven behavioral differences is our current endeavor through a QTL study and we should be able to report it in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It will be equally interesting, however, to understand what lies behind the large individual variation of behaviors observed both in the case surface and cave populations. Are these differences purely genetic, or perhaps environmental cues also contribute to their development? Does stochasticity provided by the developmental process has also a role in this? Answering these questions will reveal if the evolvability of Astyanax behavior was an important factor in the repeated successful colonization of underground caves.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes. We will also access (at least partially) responses to most of these questions in our current QTL study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper explores chemosensory behaviour in surface and cave morphs and F2 hybrids in the Mexican cavefish Astyanax mexicanus. The authors develop a new behavioural assay for the longterm imaging of individual fish in a parallel high-throughput setup. The authors first demonstrate that the different morphs show different basal exploratory swimming patterns and that these patterns are stable for individual fish. Next, the authors test the attraction of fish to various concentrations of alanine and other amino acids. They find that the cave morph is a lot more sensitive to chemicals and shows directional chemotaxis along a diffusion gradient of amino acids. For surface fish, although they can detect the chemicals, they do not show marked chemotaxis behaviour and have an overall lower sensitivity. These differences have been reported previously but the authors report longer-term observations on many individual fish of both morphs and their F2 hybrids. The data also indicate that the observed behavior is a quantitative genetic trait. The approach presented will allow the mapping of genes' contribution to these traits. The work will be of general interest to behavioural neuroscientists and those interested in olfactory behaviours and the individual variability in behavioural patterns.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>A particular strength of this paper is the development of a new and improved setup for the behavioural imaging of individual fish for extended periods and under chemosensory stimulation. The authors show that cavefish need up to 24 h of habituation to display a behavioural pattern that is consistent and unlikely to be due to the stressed state of the animals. The setup also uses relatively large tanks that allow the build-up of chemical gradients that are apparently present for at least 30 min.</p><p>The paper is well written, and the presentation of the data and the analyses are clear and to a high standard.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these nice comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One point that would benefit from some clarification or additional experiments is the diffusion of chemicals within the behavioural chamber. The behavioural data suggest that the chemical gradient is stable for up to 30 min, which is quite surprising. It would be great if the authors could quantify e.g. by the use of a dye the diffusion and stability of chemical gradients.</p></disp-quote><p>OK. We had tested the diffusion of dyes in our previous setup and we also did in the present one (not shown). We think that, due to differences of molecular weight and hydrophobicity between the tested dyes and the amino acid molecules we are using, their diffusion does not constitute a proper read-out of actual amino acid diffusion. We anticipate that amino acid diffusion is extremely complex in the test box, possibly with odor plumes diffusing and evolving in non-gradient patterns, in the 3 dimensions of the box, and potentially further modified by the fish swimming through it, the flow coming from the opposite water injection side and the borders of the box. This is the reason why we have designed the assay with contrasting “odor side” and “water control side”. Moreover, our question here is not to determine the exact concentration of amino acid to which the fish respond, but to compare the responses in cavefish, surface fish and F2 hybrids. Finally and importantly, we have performed dose/response experiments whereby varying concentrations have been presented for 3 of the 6 amino acids tested, and these experiments clearly show a difference in the threshold of response of the different morphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper starts with a statement that reflects a simplified input-output (sensory-motor) view of the organisation of nervous systems. &quot;Their brains perceive the external world via their sensory systems, compute information and generate appropriate behavioral outputs.&quot; The authors' data also clearly show that this is a biased perspective. There is a lot of spontaneous organised activity even in fish that are not exposed to sensory stimulation. This sentence should be reworded, e.g. &quot;The nervous system generates autonomous activity that is modified by sensory systems to adapt the behavioural pattern to the external world.&quot; or something along these lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In addition to my comments in the &quot;weakness&quot; section above, here are my other comments.</p><p>How many times fish were repeatedly assayed and what the order (alanine followed by cysteine, etc) was, is not clear (Pg 24, Materials and Methods).

Most often, control experiments (eg, water/nothing; water/water; nothing/nothing) were followed by odor testing. In such cases, there is no risk that fish memorize prior experience and that such previous experience interferes with response to odor. In other instances, fish were tested with a low concentration of one amino acid, followed by a high concentration of another amino acid, which is also on the safe side. Of note, on consecutive days, the odors were always perfused on alternate sides of the test box, to avoid possibility of spatial memory. Finally, in the few cases where increasing concentrations of the same amino acids were perfused consecutively, (1) they were perfused on alternate sides, (2) if the fish does not detect a low concentration below threshold / does not respond, then prior experience should not interfere for responding to higher concentrations, and (3) we have evidence (unpublished, current studies) that when a fish is given increasing concentrations of the same amino acid above detection threshold, then the behavioral response is stable and reproducible (eg does not decrease or increase).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>Thygmotaxis and wall following.</p><p>Classically, thigmotaxis and wall following are treated as the same (sharma et al., 2009; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19093125/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19093125/</ext-link>) but the authors discriminate it in thigmotaxis at X-axis and Y-axis because fish repeatedly swam back and forth on x-axis wall or y-axis wall.

Contrarily to cavefish, all other parameters were unchanged in surface fish for this concentration. Moreover, at individual level, only 3.2% of surface fish had significant olfactory scores (to be compared to 81.3% for cavefish).

Alanine 10-5M has significant effects (now shown in Suppl Fig2 and indicated in text; a column has been added for 10-5M in Summary Table 1).

Also, no need to show fish ID in Fig 2C in the current way, but identify the fish data points of the fish in Fig 2D (SF#40, CF#65, and F2#26) in Fig 2C if the authors want to show fish ID numbers in the boxplots.

The difficulty is due to the existence of many combinations (33 possibilities in total, see new Suppl Fig7), which are never the same in different plots/conditions because individual tested fish are different. We decided that that the best way was to represent, from bottom to top, the most used to the less used swimming patterns, and to use a color code that matches at best the different combinations. It was impossible to give the full color code on each figure, therefore it was simplified, and we believe that the results are well conveyed on the graphs. We would like to keep it as it is.

I think the authors have done a great job in presenting this complex dataset, but there are still some smaller tweaks that could be used to increase the legibility of the presented data.</p><p>First and perhaps foremost, a better definition of the swimming pattern subsets is needed. I have no problem understanding the main behavioral types, but whereas the color codes for these suggest that there is continuous variance within each pattern, it is not clear (at least to me), what particular aspect(s) of the behaviors vary. Also, whereas the sidebars/legends suggest a continuum within these behaviors, the bar charts themselves clearly present binned data. I did not find a detailed description of how the binning was done. As this has been - according the Methods section - a manual process, more clarity about the details of the binning would be welcome. I would also suggest using binned color codes for the legends as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, in Results and Methods. We hope it is now clear that there is no “continuum”, rather multiple combinations of discrete swimming patterns. The gradient aspect in color code in figures has been removed to avoid the idea of continuum. According to the chosen color code, WF is in red, R in blue, T in yellow and C in green. Then, combination are represented by colors in between, for example, R+WF is purple. We have now added a full color code description for the swimming patterns and their combinations in a new Supplemental Figure 7 (associated to Methods).</p><p>Also, to better explain the definition of the swimming patterns and the graphical representation, it now reads (in Methods):</p><p>“The determination of baseline swimming patterns and swimming patterns after odor injection was performed manually based on graphical representations such as in Figure 2A or Figure 3A. Four distinctive baseline behaviors clearly emerged: random swim (R; defined as haphazard swimming with no clear pattern, covering entirely or partly the surface of the arena), wall following (WF; defined as the fish continuously following along the 4 sides of the box and turning around it, in a clockwise or counterclockwise fashion), large or small circles (C; self explanatory), and thigmotactism (T, along the X- or the Y-axis of the box; defined as the fish swimming back and forth along one of the 4 sides of the box). On graphical representations of swimming pattern distributions, we used the following color code: R in blue, WF in red, C in green, T in yellow. Of note, many fish swam according to combination(s) of these four elementary swimming patterns (see descriptions in the legends of Supplemental figures, showing many examples). To fully represent the diversity and the combinations of swimming patterns used by individual fish, we used an additional color code derived from the “basic” color code described above and where, for example R+WF is purple. The complete combinatorial color code is shown in Suppl. Fig7.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be also easier to comprehend the stacked bar charts, presenting the particular swimming patterns in each population, if the order of different swimming patterns was the same for all the plots (e.g. the frequency of WF always presented at the bottom, R on the top, and C and T in the middle). This would bring consistency and would highlight existing differences between SF, CF, and F2s. Furthermore, such a change would also make it much easier to see (and compare) shifts in behaviors.</p></disp-quote><p>We have thought a lot on how to best represent the distributions of swimming patterns in graphs such as Fig 2B and others. The difficulty is due to the existence of many combinations, which are never the same in different plots/conditions because the individual fish tested are different. We decided to keep it as it currently stands, because we think re-doing all the graphs and figures would not significantly improve the representation. In fact, we think that the differences between morphs (dominant blue in SF, dominant red in CF) and between conditions (bar charts next to each other) are easy to interpret at first glance in the vast majority of cases. Moreover, they are now completed by CA analyses (Suppl Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While the color coding of the timeline in the &quot;3D&quot; plots presented for individual animals is a nice feature, at the moment it is slightly confusing, as the authors use the same color palette as for the stacked bar charts, representing the proportionality of the particular swimming patterns. As the y-axis is already representing &quot;time&quot; here, the color coding is not even really necessary. If the authors would like to use a color scheme for aesthetic reasons, I would suggest using another palette, such as &quot;grey&quot; or &quot;viridis&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to keep the graphical aspect of our figures as they are, for aesthetic reasons. To avoid confusion with stacked bar chart color code, we have added a sentence in Methods and in the legend of Figure 2, where the colors first appear:</p><p>“The complete combinatorial color code is shown in Suppl. Figure 7. Of note, in all figures, the swimming pattern color code does not relate whatsoever with the time color code used in the 2D plus time representation of swimming tracks such as in Figure 2A”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also suggest changing the boxplots to violin-plots. Figure 7 clearly shows bimodality for F2 scores (something, as the authors themselves note, not entirely surprising given the probably poligenic nature of the trait), but looking at SF and CF scores I think there are also clear hints for non-normal distributions. If non-normal distribution of traits is the norm, violin-plots would capture the variance in the data in a more digestible way. (The existence of differently behaving cohorts within the population of both SF and CF forms would also help to highlight the large pre-existing variance, something that was probably exploited by natural selection as well, as mentioned briefly in the Discussion by the authors, too.)</p></disp-quote><p>The bimodal distribution of scores shown by F2s in Figure 7B is indeed probably due to the polygenic nature of the trait. However, such distribution is rather the exception than the norm. Moreover, the boxplot representations we have used throughout figures include all the individual points, and outliers can be identified as they have the fish ID number next to them. This allows the reader to grasp the variance of the data. Again, redoing all graphs and figures would constitute a lot of work, for little gain in term of conveying the results. Therefore, we choose not to change the boxplot for violin plots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The summary data of individual scores in Table 1B shows some intriguing patterns, that warrant a bit further discussion, in my opinion. For example, we can see opposite trends in scores of SF and CF forms with increasing alanine concentration. Is there an easy explanation for this? Also, in the case of serine, the CF scores do not seem to respond in a dose-dependent manner and puzzlingly at 10^(-3)M serine concentration F2 scores are above those of both grandparental populations.</p></disp-quote><p>That is true. However, we have no simple explanation for this. To begin responding to this question, we have now performed full dose/responses expts for alanine (concentrations tested from 10-2M to 10-10M on cavefish; confirm that CF are bona fide “alanine specialists”) and for serine (10-2M to 104M tested on both morphs; confirm that both morphs respond well to this amino acid). These complementary results are now included in text and figures (partially) and in the summary table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If anything is known about this, I would also welcome some discussion on how thigmotactic behavior, a marker of stress in SF, could have evolved to become the normal behavior of CF forms, with lower cortisol levels and, therefore lower anxiety.</p></disp-quote><p>We actually think thigmotactism is a marker of stress in both morphs. See Pierre et al, JEB 2020, Figure S3A: in both SF and CF thigmotaxis behavior decreases after long habituation times. In our hands, the only difference between the two morphs is that surface fish (at 5 month of age) express stress by thigmotactism but also freezing and rapid erratic movements, while cavefish have a more restricted stress repertoire.</p><p>This is why in the present paper we have carefully made the distinction between thigmotactism ( = possible stress readout) and wall following ( = exploratory behavior). Our finding that WF and large circles confers better olfactory response scores to cavefish is in strong support of the different nature of these two swimming patterns. Then, why is swimming along the 4 walls of a tank fundamentally different from swimming along one wall? The question is open, although the number of changes of direction is probably an important parameter: in WF the fish always swims forward in the same direction, while in T the fish constantly changes direction when reaching the corner of the tank – which is similar to erratic swim in stressed surface fish.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally two smaller suggestions:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>When referring to multiple panels on the same figure it would be better to format the reference as &quot;Figure 4D-G&quot; instead of &quot;Figure 4DEFG&quot;;</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>On page 4, where the introduction reads as &quot;although adults have a similar olfactory rosette with 2025 lamellae&quot;, in my opinion, it would be better to state that &quot;while adults of the two forms have a similar olfactory rosette with 20-25 lamellae&quot;.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Done</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Consider moving Figure 3 to be a supplement of Figure 4.
