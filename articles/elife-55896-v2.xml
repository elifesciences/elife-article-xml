a hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)-decomposing enzyme, catalase, are imported in a peroxisome-targeting signal type-1 (PTS1)-dependent manner. However, little is known about regulation of the membrane-bound protein import machinery. Here, we report that Pex14, a central component of the protein translocation complex in peroxisomal membrane, is phosphorylated in response to oxidative stresses such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in mammalian cells. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase in vivo and selectively impairs in vitro the interaction of catalase with the Pex14-Pex5 complex. A phosphomimetic mutant Pex14-S232D elevates the level of cytosolic catalase, but not canonical PTS1-proteins, conferring higher cell resistance to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We thus suggest that the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 spatiotemporally regulates peroxisomal import of catalase, functioning in counteracting action against oxidative stress by the increase of cytosolic catalase.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>catalase</kwd><kwd>Pex14</kwd><kwd>peroxisomal protein

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peroxisome, an essential intracellular organelle, functions in various essential metabolism including β-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and the synthesis of ether phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Waterham et al., 2016</xref>). Peroxisome contains a number of oxidases that generate hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and catalase that decomposes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and potentially regulates reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schrader and Fahimi, 2006</xref>). Peroxisomal functions rely on the tightly and spatiotemporally regulated import of the enzyme proteins responsible for respective reactions. Two topogenic signals are identified in the majority of peroxisomal matrix proteins: peroxisome targeting signal type-1 (PTS1) is a C-terminal tripeptide sequence SKL and its derivatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gould et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miura et al., 1992</xref>) and PTS2 is an N-terminal cleavable nonapeptide presequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osumi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swinkels et al., 1991</xref>). Of 14 peroxisome assembly factors called peroxins in mammals, Pex14 is a peroxisomal membrane peroxin playing a central role in the import of both PTS1- and PTS2-proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Platta et al., 2016</xref>). PTS1 receptor Pex5 recognizes newly synthesized PTS1-proteins in the cytosol. Pex14 acts as an initial target of the Pex5-PTS1-protein complex on peroxisomal membrane. By associating of Pex5 with the import machinery complexes in peroxisome membrane comprising Pex14, Pex13, and RING peroxins Pex2, Pex10 and Pex12, Pex5 transports its cargo proteins into the matrix, and then shuttles back to the cytosol (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fujiki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Platta et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, catalase encoded by a single gene is a tetrameric heme-containing enzyme harboring an atypical PTS1, KANL, at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Purdue and Lazarow, 1996</xref>). Similar to typical PTS1 proteins, catalase is mainly localized to peroxisomes by the Pex5-mediated import pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera and Fujiki, 2012</xref>). Catalase forms fully active tetrameric conformation in the cytosol as noted in peroxisome-deficient fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Middelkoop et al., 1993</xref>). Increased level of catalase is observed in the cytosol in aged human skin fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Legakis et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, we recently reported that a proapoptotic protein BAK partially localizes to peroxisomes in mammalian cells and is involved in the release of catalase from peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fujiki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosoi et al., 2017</xref>). Although these findings suggest physiological importance of cytosolic catalase, molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation in translocation of peroxisomal matrix proteins remain largely unknown.</p><p>Posttranslational modification of protein regulates various functions of the cell in a fast, dynamic, and reversible fashion upon response to the changes in cellular demands and environmental conditions. Indeed, ubiquitination of Pex5 at a conserved cysteine residue is essential for its export from peroxisomes to the cytosol and peroxisomal matrix protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carvalho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Okumoto et al., 2011</xref>). The cysteine residue at the position 11 of Pex5 is shown to be redox-sensitive, thereby Pex5-mediated PTS1 protein import can be regulated in the response to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apanasets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walton et al., 2017</xref>). As for another major posttranslational modification, that is phosphorylation, a large number of phosphorylation sites have been identified in various peroxisomal proteins by phosphoproteomic analysis in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, mouse, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oeljeklaus et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, phosphorylation of Pex14 is reported in the yeast <italic>Hansenula polymorpha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>) and <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farré et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>), but the biological importance and function remain unclear. In mammalian cells, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways are shown to be activated in response to various oxidative stresses including ROS in the regulation of diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ray et al., 2012</xref>). Peroxisome is a H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-generating and -consuming organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fransen et al., 2012</xref>), thus these findings suggest potential roles of ROS-dependent protein phosphorylation in regulating peroxisomal functions. It was reported that ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase activated by ROS phosphorylates and subsequently ubiquitinates Pex5, thereby giving rise to degradation of peroxisomes, termed pexophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, how ROS plays a role in peroxisomal protein import remains undefined in any species.</p><p>Here, we address H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent phosphorylation of mammalian Pex14. Phosphorylated Pex14 suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase, thereby functioning as an anti-oxidative stress response by elevating the level of catalase in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of Pex14 in mammalian cells</title><p>To investigate whether Pex14 is phosphorylated in mammalian cells, lysates of various mouse tissues were analyzed by electrophoresis using a conventional polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) and the one containing Phos-tag (hereafter described as Phos-tag PAGE). In Phos-tag PAGE, phosphorylated proteins can be distinguished as slower-migrating bands from the corresponding non-phosphorylated form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kinoshita et al., 2006</xref>). We found that in Phos-tag PAGE, a Pex14 band with slower migration was readily discernible by immunoblotting in the lysates of mouse testis and liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1 and 3, solid arrowhead) in addition to a similar level of unmodified Pex14 in both organs (open arrowhead). Pex14 was detected as a single band in conventional SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel). The retarded-mobility form of Pex14 completely disappeared upon treatment with <bold>λ</bold>-protein phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 2 and 4), suggesting that Pex14 was partially phosphorylated in mammalian tissues, as observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komori et al., 1999</xref>). Further, Phos-tag PAGE analysis showed that Pex14 in mouse tissues examined was phosphorylated at varying levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), where the relatively higher phosphorylation was detected in liver and heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). Similar phosphorylation profile of Pex14 was observed in rat hepatoma Fao cells under normal culture condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). Notably, we found that treatment with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) increased the slower-migrating band of Pex14 with an additional lower mobility band in Phos-tag PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). Treatment of Fao and CHO-K1 cells with another oxidative agent, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), induced a nearly complete shift of Pex14 from the unmodified form to two slower-migrating bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>- and DDC-dependent mobility shift of Pex14 in Phos-tag PAGE was likewise observed in CHO-K1 cells, to a similar extent between two oxidative agents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). In contrast, as a negative control, neither slower-migrating bands nor unmodified Pex14 were discernible in a <italic>PEX14</italic>-deficient (<italic>pex14</italic>) CHO mutant, ZP161 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). ZP161 cells possess two types of deletions in the genome; a 133-base pair deletion in one allele created a termination codon at amino-acid residues 40–42 of Pex14, and an additional 103-base pair deletion in combination with the 133-base pair deletion in the other allele. Neither of two mutant forms of Pex14 is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimizu et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pex14 is phosphorylated in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lysates of testis and liver (20 µg each) from an 8-week-old male mouse were incubated with vehicle (-, lanes 1 and 3) and 400 unit λ-protein phosphatase (+, lanes 2 and 4).

A higher level of catalase was detected in the cytosolic fraction (S) as compared to that in the organelle fraction (P) from the SD-30 cells expressing Pex14-S232D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lanes 9 and 10, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Consistent with our earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosoi et al., 2017</xref>), a part of catalase was present in the cytosol fraction in CHO-K1 and in WT-6 cells expressing wild-type Pex14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lanes 1 and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Catalase was barely detectable in the cytosolic fraction from SA-13 cells expressing Pex14-S232A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 7). The ratio of cytosolic (S) to total (S + P) catalase of SA-13 cells indicated a significant decrease as compared to that of WT-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), suggesting that Pex14-S232A more efficiently imported catalase into peroxisomes than wild-type Pex14 that was partially phosphorylated in WT-6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Precursors of PTS2 proteins, peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA thiolase and alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (ADAPS), are converted to their respective mature forms in peroxisomes by cleavage of the amino-terminal PTS2 presequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">de Vet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Honsho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osumi et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Swinkels et al., 1991</xref>).

To further assess the effect of Pex14 phosphorylation in the interaction with known Pex14-binding partners, glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed using recombinant proteins including Pex5 and the cargoes. In regard to Pex14-Pex5 interaction, Pex5L was equally detected in the fractions bound to GST-fused wild-type Pex14 (GST-Pex14-WT), GST-Pex14-S232A, and GST-Pex14-S232D, but not GST alone, suggesting that both S232A and S232D mutations have no apparent effect on the direct binding of Pex14 to Pex5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 1, 8–10, 17). As shown in the earlier report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera and Fujiki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otera et al., 2002</xref>), PTS1 cargoes, both EGFP-PTS1 and HA-catalase, respectively formed a ternary complex with GST-Pex14-WT via Pex5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 2, 5, 11, 14). However, GST-Pex14-S232D, not GST-Pex14-S232A, yielded an almost undetectable amount of HA-catalase in the bound fraction, despite the same-level recovery of Pex5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 12 and 13). By contrast, in the presence of Pex5L, EGFP-PTS1 was detected in the fractions bound to GST-Pex14-S232D at a slightly lower level, as compared to that with GST-Pex14-WT and GST-Pex14-S232A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 5–7). In the absence of Pex5L, EGFP-PTS1 and HA-catalase were not detectable in the bound fractions of GST-Pex14 variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, lanes 2–4, 14–16). Essentially the same results were obtained with a shorter isoform of Pex5, Pex5S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Together, Pex14-S232D most likely interacts with Pex5 as wild-type Pex14 but it much less efficiently forms a Pex5-mediated ternary complex with catalase. We further investigated the effect of Pex14 phosphorylation at Ser247 and Ser252 on the ternary complex formation. None of the mutations S232A and S232D, double mutations S247A/S252A and S247D/S252D, and triple mutations S232A/S247A/S252A and S232D/S247D/S252D in Pex14 altered the binding efficiency to Pex5L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). HA-catalase was similarly pulled down with GST-Pex14 harboring respective mutations S247A/S252A and S232A/S247A/S252A in the presence of Pex5L, as seen with GST-Pex14-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 10, 13–15). On the other hands, HA-catalase bound to the Pex14-Pex5L complex was reduced to ~40% of wild-type Pex14 by S232D mutation alone and ~70% by S247/252D mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 10, 12, and 14). The triple mutant GST-Pex14-S232D/S247D/S252D showed further decrease of HA-catalase, to ~20% of wild-type Pex14, in the Pex5-dependent recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 16). In forming the Pex5-mediated ternary complex with EGFP-PTS1, significant decrease was observed only with the GST-Pex14-S232D/S247D/S252D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lanes 2–8). Nearly the same results were observed in the case with Pex5S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggested that phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 mainly suppresses the Pex5-mediated complex formation with catalase, where the phosphorylation at Ser247 and Ser252 likely provides additive effect. Moreover, the apparently simultaneous phosphorylation at the three sites also affect the complex formation with PTS1 proteins. Such distinct effects of Pex14 mutants on the ternary complex formation with catalase and typical PTS1 protein are in good agreement with the phenotypes of those observed in vivo, in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Phosphorylation at Ser232 of Pex14 shows higher cell resistance to hydrogen peroxide</title><p>A part of catalase is localized in the cytosol even in the wild-type CHO-K1 cells, while catalase is fully diffused to the cytosol in peroxisome-defective mutants such as <italic>pex14</italic> ZP161 cells.

Moreover, these differential sensitivities to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> between ZP161-stable cell lines were completely abrogated by the addition of 3-aminotriazole, a catalase inhibitor, indicative of catalase-dependent cell viability.

We identified H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced three phosphorylation sites of Pex14, Ser232, Ser247, and Ser252 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>), all of which locate in the cytosolically faced, C-terminal region of Pex14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper diagram). Our earlier domain mapping study suggested that the C-terminal region following the coiled-coil domain of Pex14 plays a role in peroxisomal protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh and Fujiki, 2006</xref>). Notably, deletion of the residues at 201–367 including Ser232, not that at 261–367, abolished peroxisomal import of catalase but retained minimum import of PTS1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh and Fujiki, 2006</xref>). These results support our view that C-terminal region of Pex14 has a regulatory role in peroxisomal protein import, which is modulated by the phophorylation of Ser232. Indeed, phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser232 selectively lowers the Pex5-mediated complex formation with catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, B and C). Pex14 forms a highly ordered homo-oligomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Itoh and Fujiki, 2006</xref>) as well as large protein complexes of protein translocation machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meinecke et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, phosphorylation at Ser232 might induce the conformational change of Pex14-containing protein complexes, thereby leading to the predominant suppression of catalase import into peroxisomes. Phosphorylation at Ser247 and Ser252 potentially provides additive effect on the conformation of Pex14 complex, resulting in further inhibition in the peroxisomal import of catalase as well as partial retardation in that of PTS1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, B and C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, the level of Pex13 is increased in the immunoprecipitated Pex14 complexes containing highly phosphorylated Pex14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In mammals, Pex13 has been shown to play a pivotal role in peroxisomal import of catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Otera et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meinecke et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera and Fujiki, 2012</xref>). A study using the Pex5 mutant defective only in the binding to Pex13 reported that Pex13-Pex5 interaction is specifically required for peroxisomal import of the folded and oligomeric proteins including catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera and Fujiki, 2012</xref>). A large complex comprising Pex5, Pex14, and Pex13 is suggested to form the pore-like structures in peroxisomal membrane to translocate a variety of peroxisomal matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meinecke et al., 2010</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that Pex13-Pex5 interaction is required for modulating the pore size to import the tetrameric catalase. In the present study, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 is shown to incorporate a more amount of Pex13 into the Pex14-conatining complexes as compared to those in normal condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Therefore, the phosphorylation of Pex14 might directly or indirectly modulates the Pex13-Pex5 interaction, suppressing the peroxisomal import of catalase. Although phosphorylation of Pex14 at its C-terminal part is identified in several yeast species, including Thr248 and Ser258 in <italic>H. polymorpha</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komori et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanaka et al., 2013</xref>) and Ser266 and Ser313 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albuquerque et al., 2008</xref>), their functional roles remain to be defined. The Ser232 of Pex14 is conserved only in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and the amino-acid sequences of the C-terminal region of Pex14 share lower similarity between vertebrates and yeasts, hence suggesting that functional significance of the phosphorylation of Pex14 at C-terminal region is distinct between species. Yeast and worms have a cytosolic catalase in addition to a peroxisomal catalase harboring PTS1-like sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartman et al., 2003</xref>), implying that the modulated intracellular distribution of catalase is beneficial to the survival of organisms during the evolution.</p><p>ROS activates various cellular signaling pathways. ATM is reported as a peroxisome-localized kinase activated by ROS, mediating Pex5 phosphorylation and induction of pexophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). An ATM inhibitor KU55933 that abrogates H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-indeced phosphorylation of Pex5 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) showed no effect on phopsphorylation of Pex14 upon the treatment with either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in Fao cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> most likely induces posttranslational modifications of Pex5 and Pex14 in a manner independent from ATM; the ATM-dependent phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitination of Pex5 are distinct from the phosphorylation of Pex14 by the undefined kinase(s) reported here. Although the study with kinase inhibitors suggests the ERK-mediated phosphorylation of Pex14 at Ser247 and Ser252 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), further studies may be required to identify the kinase(s) that directly phosphorylates Pex14 in an H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner and its upstream signaling pathway. Moreover, Pex14 phosphorylation upon cell treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is transiently induced but is gradually reverted to the unmodified form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), where the turnover of Pex14 is not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This is further supported by the findings that phosphorylation-defective or phosphomimetic mutants of Pex14 were expressed at a similar level as the wild-type Pex14 even in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated <italic>pex14</italic> ZP161 cells for 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, lanes 9–16). Collectively, phosphorylated Pex14 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment is most likely de-phosphorylated by yet identified phosphatase(s).</p><p>We show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 predominately suppresses peroxisomal import of catalase more efficiently than typical PTS1 proteins. Together with the findings that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment transiently induces Pex14 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and that cell toxicity of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is more efficiently detoxified by cytosolic catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosoi et al., 2017</xref>), we propose a working model that Pex14 phosphorylation plays an essential role in the acute cell response against H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is possibly a regulatory system by taking advantage of the specific suppression of peroxisomal import of catalase, not that of PTS1 proteins, and the temporal increase of catalase in the cytosol by phosphorylation of Pex14. However, catalase chronically residing in the cytosol compromises the redox homeostasis in peroxisomes, thereby resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction or cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivashchenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koepke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walton et al., 2017</xref>). Given the finding that catalase catabolizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at the highest rate without effecting on the reducing equivalent such as glutathione (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sies et al., 2017</xref>), it is reasonable to have catalase function as the first defender in acute phase upon excess H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> insult. Oxidative stress such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> has been suggested to affect PTS1 protein import via Pex5 modification, depending on the redox state of the conserved Cys11 residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Apanasets et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walton et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, oxidative stress intrinsically lowers the import of PTS1 proteins and catalase under the imbalance of cellular redox. Collectively, the compromised import of catalase under the oxidative condition is most likely reflecting the severely impaired formation of ternary complex of Pex14, Pex5, and catalase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, B and C) and a weaker affinity of Pex5 to catalase as compared to canonical PTS1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koepke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Otera and Fujiki, 2012</xref>). In in vivo situation, both mechanisms might simultaneously take place for the cell survival, where suppression of peroxisomal catalase import and BAK-mediated release of catalase from the peroxisomal matrix are involved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hosoi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>This report demonstrates that the protein import machinery of peroxisomes plays a crucial role in the regulatory network that counteracts the exogenous oxidative stresses. There are other intracellular sources of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> involving mitochondria, NADPH oxidases, and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sies et al., 2017</xref>). We observed that Pex14 phosphorylation at Ser232 was induced in Fao cells upon either treatments with rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, or peroxisome proliferators including clofibrate and bezafibrate that are known to elevate intracellular level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tada-Oikawa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>) (data not shown). Thus, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated by various stimuli in response to the change of intracellular or extracellular environments could modulate and fine-tune the intracellular localization of catalase via Pex14 phosphorylation. In mitochondrial biogenesis, phosphorylation of yeast mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, indeed regulates the import of mitochondrial proteins in a nutrient condition-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gerbeth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>). Mice genetically overexpressing or deleting catalase reveal that catalase is also involved in various physiological and pathological processes such as renal injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hwang et al., 2012</xref>) and cardiomyocyte dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ye et al., 2004</xref>) in diabetes. Together with the biological relevance of cytosolic catalase to mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ivashchenko et al., 2011</xref>) and cell senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koepke et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Walton et al., 2017</xref>), a tackling issue needs to be addressed in regards to mechanisms underlying how Pex14 phosphorylation-dependent, spatiotemporal regulation and dysregulation of catalase are linked to the oxidative-stress state or age-related disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The authors identify peroxide-triggered phosphorylation sites on Pex14 and show that phosphorylation at one such site impairs catalase import. A series of in vitro experiments suggests that phosphorylation impacts the formation of a stable complex between the substrate and import machinery, although the molecular details remain to be elucidated in future work. The reduced import of catalase during peroxide treatment is important for maintaining viability during this type of stress.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is 'in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>'. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates whether peroxisomal import is regulated by phosphorylation. The authors initially identify peroxide-triggered phosphorylation on Pex14 using Phos-tag gels, then identify the sites, and use mutations to probe their importance. The key discovery is that S232 on Pex14 is phosphorylated (among other sites) in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, that a phosphomimetic mutation of this site impairs catalase import, and that the reduced import of catalase during H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment is important to maintaining viability during the stress. in vitro interaction studies suggest that the phosphomimetic Pex14 mutant can bind Pex5L but does not form a stable ternary complex with Pex5L and catalase. The other phosphorylation sites seem to have less of an effect but may affect other PTS1 import substrates. The primary conceptual advance here is that peroxisome import machinery can be regulated by phosphorylation to affect import of some, but not other substrates. The referees agreed that the conceptual advance of identifying a new regulatory aspect of peroxisomal import is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but that the data are currently insufficiently complete to fully support the manuscript's claims.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanism proposed by the authors for regulation of catalase import involves Pex14 phosphorylation. Yet it is Pex5 that recognizes catalase in the cytosol and is required for chaperoning catalase across the peroxisome membrane. Thus, to understand the mechanism of regulation, their crucial in vitro experiments examining substrate-Pex5-Pex14 interactions need to use the appropriate substrate-Pex5 complexes. Mammals have two Pex5's, a short Pex5 responsible for PTS1 import, and Pex5L, which binds to Pex7 and helps guide PTS2-containing proteins into the peroxisome. The authors do not provide any justification in the manuscript for why Pex5L was used in the in vitro binding experiments, and they do not provide any comparative experiments using the short Pex5. The authors must address this concern in order to justify the extrapolation of the in vitro experiments to the situation in cells.</p><p>2) The phospho-serine rich site identified by the authors is predicted to be a PEST sequence by bioinformatic searches using the sequence for rat Pex14. PEST sequences are typically found on short-lived proteins and act as a signal for turnover by the proteasome or calcium-dependent calpain proteases. In several instances, Figure 1B, Figure 2A, Figure 2D, etc. it appears that oxidative stress results in a reduction of Pex14, consistent with a hypothesis that this proline and serine rich site is functioning like a PEST sequence. In Figure 4F, phosphorylated Pex14 is detected in the cytosolic fraction, which the authors claim is non-specific. An alternative explanation is that Pex14 is being extracted from the peroxisome and turned over upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. The dynamics of Pex14 turnover and its contribution to peroxisome import dynamics is not explored by the authors but has important implications for their hypothesis. The authors should carefully consider the possibility that phosphorylation regulates Pex14 turnover, which impacts import dynamics. If the authors have data on the turnover of Pex14 and its mutants under different conditions, this would be important to include. At the very least, this alternative explanation for regulation should be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>3) The microscopy experiments present in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are not very convincing and are incomplete. It is difficult to see catalase in the cytosol in the S-to-D mutants. The control images stained for SKL are not shown, confounding the analysis. Further, the localization of the Pex14 mutants, while appearing punctate in the images, was not confirmed by colocalization with another PMP. Finally, equal expression of the different mutants relative to wild type was not verified (e.g., by SDS-PAGE analysis of parallel transfections). To make the experiment more complete, control SKL images need to be presented, the subcellular localization of the Pex14 mutants verified by colocalization with another PMP, and equal expression of the mutants verified by either quantification of the microscopy or SDS-PAGE.</p><p>4) Loading controls for the experiment in Figure 4D are needed to make this fully interpretable. Quantification of EGFP-PTS1 and HA-catalase in Figure 5C would be helpful to a reader.</p><p>5) Figure 4F is not convincing because the differences claimed are not very easy to appreciate and the degree of reproducibility of the small effects is not clear. To be convincing, this experiment needs to be quantified from multiple replicates and should be accompanied by total samples to show the levels of the proteins in each sample before fractionation.</p><p>6) The anti-His blot in Figure 2D is of poor quality and cannot be interpreted with confidence. The Pex14 blot is clear but is complicated by co-expression and partial co-migration of endogenous and exogenous Pex14 species. This experiment would be improved by either improving the quality of the anti-His blot, or perhaps if the authors preformed a His-pulldown followed by blotting to selectively visualize the exogenous proteins. The other option is to perform the experiment in cells lacking endogenous Pex14. Regardless of the approach taken, the authors should improve the quality of this important figure.</p><p>7) The claimed role of Pex13 is not clear from the results in Figure 5A. This experiment can be improved if the authors perform IP with phospho-specific antibody to substantiate the claim that phosphorylation of Pex14 alters it complex formation with Pex13. Alternatively, an IP via Pex13 could also be performed and show that the pS232 is coming down with Pex13.</p><p>8) The conclusion that phosphorylation is ERK mediated has been shown with a single inhibitor and should be extended to show this more directly by checking Pex14 in ERK knockout or siRNA cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55896.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This study investigates whether peroxisomal import is regulated by phosphorylation.

In the original manuscript, we mainly used Pex5L as a PTS1 receptor in in vitro binding assays (Figure 5, B and C) and also showed that Pex5S less efficiently forms a ternary complex with Pex14-S232D and catalase (Figure 5—figure supplement 1A) as in the case of Pex5L (Figure 5B). To further address this issue, we performed in vitro binding assays for interactions between a full series of Pex14 variants, Pex5S, and PTS1-proteins (newly added Figure 5—figure supplement 1B). Pex5S represented an interaction profile similar to Pex5L, demonstrating that Pex5S and Pex5L similarly mediate the complex formation of Pex14 with catalase and PTS1 protein accompanied by the phosphorylation-dependent regulation. These results further supported the situation in cells upon an oxidative stress.</p><p>We added Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and revised the text involving this issue with additional introduction of two isoforms of Pex5 in the Results section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phospho-serine rich site identified by the authors is predicted to be a PEST sequence by bioinformatic searches using the sequence for rat Pex14. PEST sequences are typically found on short-lived proteins and act as a signal for turnover by the proteasome or calcium-dependent calpain proteases. In several instances, Figure 1B, Figure 2A, Figure 2D, etc. it appears that oxidative stress results in a reduction of Pex14, consistent with a hypothesis that this proline and serine rich site is functioning like a PEST sequence. In Figure 4F, phosphorylated Pex14 is detected in the cytosolic fraction, which the authors claim is non-specific. An alternative explanation is that Pex14 is being extracted from the peroxisome and turned over upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. The dynamics of Pex14 turnover and its contribution to peroxisome import dynamics is not explored by the authors but has important implications for their hypothesis. The authors should carefully consider the possibility that phosphorylation regulates Pex14 turnover, which impacts import dynamics. If the authors have data on the turnover of Pex14 and its mutants under different conditions, this would be important to include. At the very least, this alternative explanation for regulation should be discussed in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers pointed out, a putative PEST sequence was identified in the C-terminal region of rat Pex14 (amino-acid residues at 259-278) by an algorithm, PESTfind. We addressed the protein level of Pex14 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment by re-analysis of the original Figure 1C using exactly the same samples as those used in the original figure. In contrast to ~70% of total Pex14 was phosphorylated with a peak at 1 hour post-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> challenge, total Pex14 level remained nearly constant in SDS-PAGE for 2 hours and reduced by approximately 30% at 5 hours after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, where a cytosolic protein LDH indicated a similar pattern (revised Figure 1D, corresponding to the original Figure 1C). We further verified any effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment on Pex14 stability and found that the exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 5 hours significantly lowered the protein level of Pex14 and concomitantly decreased LDH to a similar extent, thereby showing the relatively unaltered protein level of Pex14 (newly added Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). As the cells in these experiments were lysed in a constant volume of the buffer, we interpreted these results to mean that significant decrease of Pex14 observed at 5 hours after the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment is most likely due to less number of the cells by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> toxicity, not by a preferential degradation of phosphorylated Pex14. This is further supported by the findings that both phosphorylation-deficient and phosphomimetic mutants of Pex14 were similarly expressed as wild-type Pex14 even in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated ZP161 cells for 2 hours (newly added Figure 3A, lanes 9-16). Taken together, we think that phosphorylation-dependent regulation of Pex14 turnover has little effect on peroxisomal protein import and that phosphorylated Pex14 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment is most likely de-phosphorylated by currently yet identified phosphatase(s). Thus, the putative PEST sequence does not appear to function in the Pex14 degradation.</p><p>Regarding the band detected in the cytosolic fraction in anti-phospho-Pex14 blot (Figure 4F), it is most likely a non-specific band; 1) no cytosolic band was discernible with anti-Pex14 antibody at the position corresponding to that observed in anti-phospho-Pex14 blot and 2) the anti-phospho-Pex14-positive band in the cytosolic fraction seemed to migrate with slightly lower mobility than those in the organelle fractions in the respective conditions. We do not exclude the possibility that phosphorylation is involved in Pex14 turnover and a part of the phosphorylated Pex14 becomes extractable from the organelle membrane upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. These issues would be clarified in the future.</p><p>We added Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and revised Figure 1D (corresponding to the original Figure 1C) and the text addressing this issue in the Results section, Discussion section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The microscopy experiments present in Figure 3 and Figure 4 are not very convincing and are incomplete.

To make the experiment more complete, control SKL images need to be presented, the subcellular localization of the Pex14 mutants verified by colocalization with another PMP, and equal expression of the mutants verified by either quantification of the microscopy or SDS-PAGE.</p></disp-quote><p>We revised immunostaining images of catalase in ZP161 cells transiently or stably expressing Pex14 variants (Figure 3B, corresponding to Figure 3A in the original manuscript and Figure 4B, respectively). These improved the images clearly showing cytosolic catalase in ZP161 cells expressing phosphomimetic S-to-D mutants of Pex14, in which Pex14 variants were equally expressed as assessed by immunoblot analysis (transient expression in newly added Figure 3A and stable expression in Figure 4A). We provided representative images of PTS1 proteins (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B) used for quantifying the activity of PTS1 import in Pex14 variants (Figure 3C). Furthermore, we performed co-immunostaining of Pex14 variants with a peroxisomal membrane protein PMP70 in ZP161 cells and found that all Pex14 variants tested were co-localized with PMP70 in punctate structures, peroxisomes, as the wild-type Pex14 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). In ZP161-stable cell lines, WT-6, SA-13, and SD-30, exclusive peroxisomal localization of PTS1 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A) and co-localization of Pex14 variants with PMP70 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B) were likewise observed as in CHO-K1 cells. Collectively, these results showed that both S-to-A and S-to-D mutations did not affect peroxisomal localization and a protein level of Pex14 variants, confirming the specific suppression of catalase import by the phosphomimetic Pex14 variant with S232D.</p><p>We revised the text regarding New Figure 3A, New Figure 3—figure supplement 1BC, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1AB in the Results section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Loading controls for the experiment in Figure 4D are needed to make this fully interpretable. Quantification of EGFP-PTS1 and HA-catalase in Figure 5C would be helpful to a reader.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4D, LDH was used as a loading control as well as a cytosolic protein for adequate subcellular fractionation. As the reviewers suggested, the recoveries of EGFP-PTS1 and HA-catalase in Figure 5C were quantified and represented at the bottom of these blots. We revised the text in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 4F is not convincing because the differences claimed are not very easy to appreciate and the degree of reproducibility of the small effects is not clear. To be convincing, this experiment needs to be quantified from multiple replicates and should be accompanied by total samples to show the levels of the proteins in each sample before fractionation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ concern in regard to an apparently low effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in catalase import. We think several reasons for this situation.</p><p>1) Catalase was imported into peroxisomes with substantially less efficiency than typical PTS1 proteins in in vitro import system (Fujiki and Lazarow, 1985, Miura et al., 1992) and in cells (Koepke et al., 2007), which is owing to the atypical PTS1 (KANL) of catalase. Therefore, the increase of catalase in organelle fraction was lower during 1 hour-chase even in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>2) We found in other experiments that medium changes with methionine- and cysteine-free medium and following washing steps attenuated the phosphorylation level of Pex14 upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. This would lead to a lower suppression effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on catalase import in pulse-chase experiment, where the experimental condition was best optimized including the essential processes for pulse-labeling. In the revised manuscript, we quantified <sup>35</sup>S-catalase and <sup>35</sup>S-DHAPAT and showed that the increase of peroxisomal import of catalase in normal condition was repressed by the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treatment (newly added Figure 4G). Unfortunately, we have been unable to perform further experiments by the restriction of our radioisotope-research facility under the epidemic of COVID-19. We hope that you would understand our situation. We think that in addition to the pulse-chase experiments, other several results including the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of endogenous Pex14 and suppressive phenotypes of phosphomimetic Pex14 variants in catalase import convincingly support the regulated import of catalase in cells in a Pex14 phosphorylation-dependent manner.</p><p>We added Figure 4G and revised the text regarding this issue in the Results section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The anti-His blot in Figure 2D is of poor quality and cannot be interpreted with confidence. The Pex14 blot is clear but is complicated by co-expression and partial co-migration of endogenous and exogenous Pex14 species. This experiment would be improved by either improving the quality of the anti-His blot, or perhaps if the authors preformed a His-pulldown followed by blotting to selectively visualize the exogenous proteins. The other option is to perform the experiment in cells lacking endogenous Pex14. Regardless of the approach taken, the authors should improve the quality of this important figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We had a clear immunoblot image with anti-His antibody by re-analysis of exactly the same samples as those used in original manuscript. We revised the Figure 2D (re-numbered as Figure 2E in the revised manuscript) by replacing the older anti-His blot with new, clear one that shows site-specific phosphorylation of Pex14.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The claimed role of Pex13 is not clear from the results in Figure 5A. This experiment can be improved if the authors perform IP with phospho-specific antibody to substantiate the claim that phosphorylation of Pex14 alters it complex formation with Pex13. Alternatively, an IP via Pex13 could also be performed and show that the pS232 is coming down with Pex13.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we performed immunoprecipitation analyses with antibodies to Pex13 and Pex14-p232 (Figure 5A, lanes 5-12). In immunoprecipitation of Pex13, phosphorylated Pex14 was more efficiently recovered from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated cells, while unmodified Pex14 was discernible at a similar level regardless of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (Figure 5A, lanes 5-8; compare the recovery of phosphorylated (solid arrowhead) to the unmodified Pex14 (open arrowhead) in Phos-tag PAGE (top panel). In immunoprecipitation with anti-Pex14-pS232 antibody, Pex13 was co-immunoprecipitated with phosphorylated Pex14, where a substantial amount of unmodified Pex14 was also associated with phosphorylated Pex14 (Figure 5A, lanes 9-12). Together with the data of immunoprecipitation with anti-Pex13 antibody in the original manuscript (Figure 5A, lanes 1-4), we concluded that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent phosphorylation of Pex14 increases its complex formation with Pex13 in peroxisomal membrane.</p><p>We revised Figure 5A by adding the immunoprecipitation data with antibodies to Pex13 and Pex14-p232 and the text regarding this issue in the Results section, Discussion section, Materials and methods section and figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The conclusion that phosphorylation is ERK mediated has been shown with a single inhibitor and should be extended to show this more directly by checking Pex14 in ERK knockout or siRNA cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers suggested, we carried out knockdown of ERK by siRNA transfection. As simultaneous knockdown of ERK1 and ERK2 severely affected cell growth, ERK2, a mainly expressed ERK in Fao cells (Figure 2F in the revised manuscript) was selected as a target. Transfection of <italic>ERK2</italic> siRNA reduced the protein level of ERK2 by ~80%, but showed no apparent effect on phosphorylation level of Pex14 induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (newly added Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, phosphorylation of ERK1 was instead induced in ERK2-depleted cells at the comparable level to those of ERK2 in control siRNA-transfected cells, suggesting the complementation of ERK2 depletion by ERK1. Collectively, ERK2-knockdown by siRNA transfection did not further support the possible role of ERK in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced phosphorylation of Pex14 observed in the experiment using kinase inhibitors (Figure 2F).</p><p>We added the data of ERK2-knockdown experiment as Figure 2—figure supplement 2. As described in the Discussion section in the initially submitted manuscript, addressing the kinase that directly phosphorylates Pex14 and the upstream kinase cascade is the most important task in the future works. At present, we think that more studies are required to show the involvement of ERK kinases in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced Pex14 phosphorylation. We revised the text regarding this issue in the Results section, Materials and methods section and figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
