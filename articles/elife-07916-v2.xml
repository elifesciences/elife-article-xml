While prior studies have reported dysregulation of effector and memory cells, little is known about the effects on naïve T cell populations. We performed a cross-sectional study of chronic hepatitis C (cHCV) patients using tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment to study antigen-specific inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (i.e., tumor or unrelated virus-specific populations in tumor-free and sero-negative individuals). cHCV showed normal precursor frequencies, but increased proportions of memory-phenotype inexperienced cells, as compared to healthy donors or cured HCV patients. These observations could be explained by low surface expression of CD5, a negative regulator of TCR signaling. Accordingly, we demonstrated TCR hyperactivation and generation of potent CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses from the altered T cell repertoire of cHCV patients. In sum, we provide the first evidence that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during cHCV infection, and establish a new mechanism of immune perturbation secondary to chronic infection.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07916.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07916.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Long-lasting or “chronic” infections massively perturb the immune system as a way to favor their own growth. In particular, they can stop T cells – a subtype of immune cells that help to destroy viruses – from working well. For example, HIV and hepatitis C viruses can overwork T cells and cause them to die. This can make individuals vulnerable to other infections.</p><p>In healthy people, T cells that have participated in the fight against particular infections continue to live to provide a memory of those past infections. Groups of “naïve” T cells that have not yet encountered an infected cell also patrol the body, ready to respond to infections by a new virus. There are relatively few virus-specific naïve T cells in the body, so until recently it has been hard to study them. As a result, researchers know little about how these cells are affected by long-lasting infections, and whether chronic infection affects our capacity to fight unrelated infections.</p><p>Alanio et al. have now used a highly sensitive technique to compare naïve T cells found in the blood of three groups of people: those with chronic hepatitis C infections, those who have been cured of a chronic hepatitis C infection, and healthy people. This revealed that the naïve T cells are negatively affected by chronic hepatitis C infections, and become hypersensitive: they get easily overexcited, which can lead to their death. This compromises the immune defenses at the moment they are most needed.</p><p>Closer inspection showed that the naïve T cells of patients with hepatitis C are hypersensitive because they have less of a protein called CD5 on their surface. This protein acts as a natural brake for the T cells, and thus having less results in the T cells mounting stronger immune responses. Although this might be beneficial when fighting certain infections, this may also account for conditions where T cells attack healthy tissues.</p><p>Finally, Alanio et al. found evidence that people who have been cured of a chronic hepatitis C infection recover a healthy set of naïve T cells within two years. Treating patients as soon as an infection is diagnosed therefore has several benefits: as well as clearing the virus, this will reset the immune system balance and reduce the damage that hyperactive immune cells cause to the body.</p><p>The results also have implications for vaccinations, which work by pushing naïve T cells to arm themselves against a particular virus. The discovery that naïve T cells are hypersensitive in patients with hepatitis C suggests that we may need a distinct strategy for efficiently vaccinating these patients. It is indeed possible that standard vaccines – tested in groups of healthy people – may result in unexpected and unwanted immune responses in individuals with hepatitis C.</p><p>These open questions will be addressed in further studies. It will also be of interest to know if other chronic viruses have the same ability to alter the activity of naïve T cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07916.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07916.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Pre-immune repertoire</kwd><kwd>CD8 T cell dysfunction</kwd><kwd>TCR signaling</kwd><kwd>viral immunology</kwd><kwd>chronic inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006364</institution-id><institution>Institut National Du Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alanio</surname><given-names>Cécile</given-names></name><name><surname>Sultanik</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name><name><surname>Perot</surname><given-names>Brieuc</given-names></name><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Darragh</given-names></name><name><surname>Pol</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallet</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SPHINX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alanio</surname><given-names>Cécile</given-names></name><name><surname>van Buuren</surname><given-names>Marit M</given-names></name><name><surname>Mottez</surname><given-names>Estelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Toubert</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><name><surname>Appay</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name><name><surname>Pol</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallet</surname><given-names>Vincent</given-names></name><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003762</institution-id><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duffy</surname><given-names>Darragh</given-names></name><name><surname>Bianchi</surname><given-names>Elisabetta</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>Annick</given-names></name><name><surname>Clave</surname><given-names>Emmanuel</given-names></name><name><surname>Schnuriger</surname><given-names>Aurélie</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnsson</surname><given-names>Kerstin</given-names></name><name><surname>Garbarg-Chenon</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name><name><surname>Bousquet</surname><given-names>Laurence</given-names></name><name><surname>Pol</surname><given-names>Stanislas</given-names></name><name><surname>Albert</surname><given-names>Matthew L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection, and this is reversible after viral clearance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Functional impairments of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have been characterized in several persistent viral infections, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in humans, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in macaques, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed and Rouse, 2006</xref>). In particular, it has been shown that chronic infection skews memory/effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stelekati and Wherry, 2012</xref>), and drives virus-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells towards an « exhausted » phenotypic state, as marked by high expression of the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim and Ahmed, 2010</xref>). Chronic infections have also been reported to impair immune responses to unrelated infectious microbes in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stelekati and Wherry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richer et al., 2013</xref>), as well as in humans infected with HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Rehermann, 2014</xref>). This phenomenon correlates with a interferon (IFN) stimulated gene (ISG) transcriptional signature, suggesting an indirect effect of systemic type I IFN secondary to innate immune activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stelekati et al., 2014</xref>). Following from these observations, we hypothesized that chronic infection may alter the T cell preimmune repertoire, which plays an important role in shaping the adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jenkins and Moon, 2012</xref>). Employing a newly validated approach for the study of low-frequency (&lt; 10<sup>–5</sup>) antigen-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanio et al., 2010</xref>), we evaluated this prediction in patients with chronic viral infection of the liver.</p><p>The α/β T cell preimmune repertoire is defined as the set of mature but antigen inexperienced lymphocytes that circulate in blood and secondary lymphoid organs, ready to be activated by cognate high-affinity peptide-class I MHC (pMHC) complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). They are maintained in the periphery by survival factors such as IL-7, as well as transient contacts with low affinity non-cognate pMHC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). Over the last decade, studies using newly-developed tetramer-enrichment assays - sensitive enough to detect and track antigen-specific populations prior to immunization - have provided new insights into the impact of preimmune repertoire heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>). First, the number of antigen-specific T cells (i.e. precursor frequency) is not equivalent across inexperienced populations, with the absolute number positively correlating with the magnitude of responses that are induced upon priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Obar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Moon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kwok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kotturi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tan et al., 2011</xref>). Second, antigen-inexperienced CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations contain variable proportions of memory-phenotype (MP) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Legoux et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2013</xref>). These cells have been explained in the literature as a result of cross-reactivity or homeostatic proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). Cross-reactivity is now recognized as an essential feature of the T-cell receptor (TCR) / MHC interaction (Mason et al., 1998), and a major determinant of virus-specific MP cells in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire of unexposed healthy donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, homeostatic proliferation may occur in settings of lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, differential CD5 expression by antigen-specific T cell populations has been shown to dictate clonal recruitment and expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fulton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tabbekh et al., 2013</xref>). To date, the impact of non-heritable influences such as human chronic viral infection on the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the preimmune repertoire remains unknown.</p><p>In our study, we focused on patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection (cHCV), which show CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Rehermann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005</xref>). In particular, HCV-specific responses are typically (i) weak – both in term of numbers and function, (ii) of low avidity, and (iii) blocked in their differentiation into central memory cells, despite the availability of cognate pMHC complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Rehermann, 2014</xref>). cHCV is to date the only chronic viral infection that can be cured, offering the unique possibility to interrogate the reversibility of immune perturbations post-viral clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pol et al., 2013</xref>). Herein, we applied the highly sensitive tetramer-associated magnetic enrichment (TAME) technique for investigating at the antigen-specific level the impact of chronic viral hepatitis infection on the CD8 T cell preimmune repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanio et al., 2010</xref>). Although precursor frequencies were similar to healthy controls, we observed significant impairments of the preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients. Inexperienced T cell populations contained increased proportions of MP cells. This correlated with naïve-phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells having lower surface expression of CD5, which accounted for a lower threshold for TCR signaling and the generation of potent immune responses from cHCV patients. Importantly, the positive effect of chronic infection on naïve T cell recruitment into immune responses is transient, as cHCV patients who clear their virus following successful therapy (referred to as Sustained Virologic Responders or SVR) can experience a reversion towards a healthy naïve T cell repertoire within 2 years. These data provide the first evidence for chronic infection resulting in the bystander dysregulation of the antigen-specific preimmune repertoire in humans, and highlight the added benefit of early viral clearance in patients with chronic HCV infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Perturbed naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire during chronic infection</title><p>To test the hypothesis that chronic viral infection perturbs preimmune repertoire homeostasis, we evaluated the influence of cHCV infection on the phenotype of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. 29 cHCV and 37 Sustained Virologic Responders (SVR, <italic>i.e.</italic> patients achieving clearance of the virus after therapy) patients were included in the study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). 62% of the chronic and 100% of the SVR patients received at least one anti-HCV treatment (of those treated, 69% received conventional IFN-ribavirin bitherapy, 31% IFN + direct antiviral agent (DAA), and IFN-free DAA combination therapy alone in the case of a single SVR patient). Healthy donors from the blood bank were included as controls. Total lymphocyte numbers were within the normal range for all tested patients (median 2.2 +/- 0.6 G/l). Within the CD3<sup>+</sup> lymphocyte population, we observed similar percentages of circulating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, absolute numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> were significantly increased in our cohort of cHCV (KW p&lt;0.0001), translating into increased absolute numbers of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in cHCV patients (KW p=0.0002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We further subsetted the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells according to their surface expression of CD45RA and CD27. Based on prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alanio et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rosa et al., 2001</xref>) and our confirmatory experiments using 5 phenotypic markers for naïve or memory T cells, we determined that co-expression of high levels of CD45RA and CD27 were sufficient to classify naïve T cells in both HD and cHCV patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Decreased percentages of naïve CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells have previously been reported in cHCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shen et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we confirmed these findings in age- and CMV- matched chronically infected patients (KW p=0.0007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

We therefore interpreted the lower proportion of naïve T cells to simply be a result of an expansion of the memory cell compartment.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Perturbed naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire during chronic HCV infection.</title><p>Percentages and absolute numbers of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD3<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in Healthy Donors (HD), Sustained Virologic Responder (SVR), and chronic HCV (cHCV) patients are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>.

Confirming previous studies, we found a significant decrease in sjTREC content of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (MW p=0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). To address the bias due to differential naïve T cell number, we isolated CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and assessed sjTREC frequencies. Surprisingly, we also observed within the naïve compartment a significantly lower sjTREC content in cHCV patients as compared to HD (MW p=0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To further characterize this phenotype, we assessed the Vβ distribution within the naïve repertoire of cHCV patients. cHCV patients showed a biased repertoire with increased representation of selected Vβ families. A representative example of Vβ usage plotted as percentage accross the 24 tested families, and ordered by increasing size from one cHCV patient and one HD is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To compare distributions, Lorenz curves were constructed as a graphical representation of the diversity of the repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Inequality measurements in the Vβ distribution, comparing cHCV patients to HD, indicated proportions of naïve T cells being altered in their Vβ usage. In brief, for a given percentage (x) of the 24 Vβ chains, Lorenz curves indicate the proportion of the T cell population that have Vβ chains among the 24 * x% least abundant ones. An equal distribution is represented as the dotted line. By contrast, an extreme, unequal distribution is shown in red, as in the case of a T-cell lymphoma where &gt;90% of the TCR repertoire is explained by one particular Vβ chain (red line). We included Gini coefficient as a numeric measure of Lorenz curve’s based observations. It corresponds to the ratio of the area between the line representing equal use of all Vβ chains (dotted line) and the observed Lorenz curve to the total area below the line representing equal use. The higher the coefficient, the more unequal is the distribution. In line with our observation, we found Gini coefficients increased in cHCV patients (M-W p=0.03, see Material and Methods for details of calculation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data support an overall perturbed naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire in cHCV patients, with increased peripheral expansion of selected populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MP Mart1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during chronic infection may be reversed by viral clearance</title><p>To evaluate more precisely the impact of these perturbations on antigen-specific populations, we applied recently developed strategies to detect, quantify and phenotype rare inexperienced antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klenerman and Thimme, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alanio et al., 2013</xref>). Specifically, we utilized TAME to enumerate and subdivide Mart1-specific T cell populations. While similar absolute numbers of Mart1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were observed in our respective study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), SVR and cHCV patients showed a more differentiated phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), defined by fewer CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> and increased proportions of memory-phenotype (MP) cells (KW <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Of note, these MP cells were mostly of central-memory (CD45RA-CD27+) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, when considering only naïve-phenotype Mart1-specific cells, precursor frequencies were still comparable across the different study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We were able to purify sufficient numbers of Mart1-specific naïve- and memory- phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from one HCV patient to perform an immunoscope analysis on the Vβ chain usage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In line with our data in bulk T cells populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we observed a restricted repertoire of Mart1-specific naïve T cells, with evidence of an expanded Vβ clonotype in memory cells. These data argue in favor of MP cells being the progeny of a perturbed naïve T cell repertoire.

We hypothesized that an altered threshold for TCR activation could explain the differentiation phenotype of inexperienced T cells. CD5 expression has been shown to correlate with the threshold of activation in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grossman and Paul, 2015</xref>). It is typically high on naïve T cells, showing diminished levels as a function of T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). We observed phenotypic changes (i.e. low CD5 expression) that were significant for the comparison between CD45RA<sup>+</sup>/CD27<sup>+</sup> naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in cHCV vs HD (KW p=0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Based on its role in regulating TCR signaling, we predicted that lower CD5 expression on naïve T cells would result in their hyperactivation upon stimulation. This was tested functionally by evaluating TCR signaling in naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, stimulating cells with low doses of plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 Abs. While only weak induction of phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK) could be observed in HD during the first hour of stimulation, TCR stimulation induced a strong p-ERK signal in naïve cells from seven of sixteen cHCV patients tested (histograms from one responding cHCV and one HD are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; MW p=0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Using the same stimulation protocol, we investigated expression of activation markers (<italic>i.e.,</italic> CD25, CD69) measured after 24 hr stimulation. Consistent with p-ERK data, we observed higher percentages of cells expressing CD25 on naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from cHCV as compared to HD (representative example from one cHCV and one HD are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; MW p=0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Similar results were obtained for CD69 analysis (data not shown). We also observed increased percentages of naïve CD8 T cells undergoing activation-induced cell death – as assessed by active caspase 3 staining after 24 hr - in cHCV patients as compared to HD (MW p=0.002; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Specifically, we demonstrated that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated in the context of cHCV, marked by (i) decreased sjTRECs levels, (ii) a restricted Vβ repertoire, and (iii) a lower threshold for TCR engagement.</p><p>Prior examples suggestive of preimmune repertoire perturbations have been documented in humans. An increased threshold for TCR activation in naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in elderly persons has been proposed as participating in the diminished response to vaccination that occurs with increasing age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Conversely, a decreased threshold for TCR activation, secondary to sustained cytokine production, leads to diverse autoimmune manifestations in rheumatoid arthritis patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Singh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshpande et al., 2013</xref>). With respect to chronic infection, functional defects in the naïve T cell compartment have also been documented in HIV-infected individuals, with non-cognate activation of T cells correlating with disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Favre et al., 2011</xref>). One major caveat for these studies is that their analysis was limited to global dysregulation of the bulk naïve T cell repertoire.</p><p>The challenge of studying perturbations of antigen-specific populations is their low precursor frequency. Taking advantage of the possibility to study viremic <italic>vs.</italic> cured patients, we chose to investigate this question in cHCV patients. Analyzing rare (<italic>i.e.,</italic> frequency = 10<sup>–7</sup> - 10<sup>–5</sup>) antigen-specific inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells populations, we show increased proportions of memory-phenotype cells in cHCV patients, and demonstrate that this correlates with naïve T cells being hyperreactive to TCR signaling in the context of the chronic infection. Despite these altered phenotypes, the absolute number of antigen-specific cells was comparable to healthy donors. Of note, cHCV patients are not thought to experience altered thymic output. As such, our findings provide direct evidence that MP antigen-specific T cells can arise in non-lymphopenic humans.</p><p>It has been suggested that a high degree of cross-reactivity with environmental antigens is the trigger for differentiation and MP conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sprent and Surh, 2011</xref>). This finding has been reported for human viral peptide / MHC restricted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in unexposed donors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Su et al., 2013</xref>). While cross-reactivity is a possible explanation for our findings, we demonstrate in cured patients that the antigen-specific inexperienced T cell populations are restored to a naïve phenotype. This result will need to be confirmed in a larger longitudinal cohort study. It favors an alternative model, where homeostatic proliferation accounts for the perturbed naïve T cell repertoire in cHCV patients. Supporting this conclusion, we note the evidence for rapid reversibility to a healthy preimmune repertoire after transient lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with our findings, Jones et al. studied multiple sclerosis patients and showed an anti-CD52 (also known by alemtuzumab) treatment-induced narrowing of the Vβ repertoire and the dilution of sjTREC after treatment, with a complete restoration of normal levels two years post-therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jones et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Infection and inflammation is known to lower the threshold of TCR signaling in memory T cells, making them more sensitive to activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Richer et al., 2013</xref>). This effect is mediated by inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Raué et al., 2013</xref>). Our results extend this concept to naïve T cells and introduce CD5 downregulation as a mechanism for hyperreactivity. CD5 tunes the TCR signaling threshold in peripheral T cells, with naïve cells expressing higher levels than central memory or effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tabbekh et al., 2013</xref>). In mice, Hawiger <italic>et al</italic> demonstrated that anti-CD5 blocking antibodies, or the use of CD5<sup>-/-</sup> transgenic MOG-specific T cells, resulted in higher sensitivity to experimental autoimmune encephalitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hawiger et al., 2004</xref>). In B cells, CD5 has also been shown to regulate activation and low CD5 expression correlates with high sensitivity to activation induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tabbekh et al., 2013</xref>). In line with these findings, we demonstrate an increased sensitivity of CD5<sup>lo</sup> naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to TCR ligation in cHCV patients. We further provide direct evidence that this hypersensitivity phenotype can be partially reproduced in HD by blocking CD5. While not evaluated in our patient cohort, we propose that elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines may be responsible for the altered CD5 expression on naïve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park and Rehermann, 2014</xref>). Finally, we applied our strategy for evaluating preimmune repertoire perturbations to other clinical conditions, and demonstrate in cHBV patients that a distinct persistent infection of the liver triggers a different preimmune signature. This observation may be related to the differing innate inflammation induced as a result of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duffy et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The combination of low levels of CD5 and increased proportions of MP in inexperienced antigen-specific populations may provide a compounded effect, resulting in a highly reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment. We provide evidence here that chronic HCV infection facilitates the generation of robust self-specific responses from the pool of preimmune cells. Given the important role for cellular immunity in the pathogenesis of autoimmune manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palermo et al., 2001</xref>), we speculate that circulating self-reactive effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells may contribute to the systemic immune activation observed during chronic HCV infection, and account for some of the extra-hepatic autoimmune-like manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). If our prediction is correct, the ability to restore a physiologically normal preimmune repertoire in cured patients may thus justify early treatment as a means to limit immune-mediated manifestations of the disease. Further investigation in longitudinal cohorts is warrented to confirm these hypotheses, as well as assess the impact on the generation of non-self-specific responses (e.g., in the context of vaccination).</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are dysregulated during cHCV, with marked perturbations of the preimmune repertoire. Specifically, low levels of CD5 at the surface of naïve T cells, and high proportions of memory-phenotype cells represent two mechanisms by which antigen-inexperienced CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are susceptible to stimulation and antigen-induced expansion. These findings should be considered when designing future immunotherapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human subjects, blood samples processing and HLA typing</title><p>29 cHCV, 37 SVR, and 18 cHBV patients were included (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). All subjects were followed in the Liver Unit of Hôpital Cochin (Paris, France) or the Department of Internal Medicine II (Freiburg, Germany). French samples were obtained as part of study protocol C11-33 approved by the INSERM clinical investigation department with ethical approval from the CPP Ile-de-France II, Paris (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: n° NCT01534728). German samples were obtained in the University Hospital Freiburg according to regulations of local ethic committee. Both study protocols conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and patients provided informed consent. Patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from leukapheresis, or whole blood collections. Healthy donor PBMCs were obtained from buffy coat preparations or whole blood collections (Etablissement Français du Sang, France). PBMCs were processed within 5 hr of their collection. They were used either fresh, or frozen and thawed when needed – and in both cases, cells were rested overnight in serum-free RPMI at 37° before performing functional studies. Absolute lymphocyte counts were determined on the day of collection at the hospital laboratories for HCV and SVR patients, and on fresh samples using AccuCheck Counting Beads (Life Technologies, France) for healthy donors. For all samples, PBMCs were isolated by Ficoll-Paque gradient separation (GE Healthcare, France) after 1:4 dilution in RPMI1640 (Gibco, Life Technologies, France) and controlled for viability (&gt;90%). Molecular HLA-A and –B loci typing were determined using extracted genomic DNA according to standard clinical laboratory procedures (Hôpital St Louis, Paris, France).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>MHC class I multimers</title><p>Photocleavable-HLA-A*02:01 multimers were constructed using peptide exchange technology as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jenkins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Toebes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Altman and Davis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hadrup et al., 2009</xref>).

Given the varied major concerns listed by the reviewers, this report would need to be radically improved in order for the authors to make definitive conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Alanio et al. have analyzed tumor – and virus-specific cells in tumor – and virus negative subjects and found differences for these populations between healthy subjects, people with chronic and treated HCV infection and those with chronic HBV infection. They found specific T cells with different phenotypes in these populations, notably significant numbers of memory T cells in addition to naïve cells in chronic HCV. They suggest this is due to lower CD5 expression and thus more cell death in naïve cells in chronic HCV.</p><p>Overall I think there are quite a few intriguing observations in this study, but at the same time I do have a few questions for the authors and also a few concerns about some of the data. Currently it is not easy to follow the interpretations of the study and to see the importance of the observations. Specifically:</p><p>1) It is not fully clear to me that the authors have a strong case that the distinct phenotype they observe has also actual clinical consequences. They discuss autoimmunity and also that antigen-experienced cells in HCV infection might be more prone to stimulation and cell death. But this is all rather vague and speculative. One could equally argue that the number of truly naïve cells remained actually stable and that just some additional memory-like cells were observed, with unknown consequences.</p><p>2) The paper does not detail what kind of therapy the patients were receiving (and almost all of them were already treatment experienced in both the chronic and the SVR group). Assuming they had received IFN before, could that not have had significant impact on the phenotype of the T cells? And what was the latest therapy in the SVR group? IFN versus DAA would make an important difference. Also, cells from the healthy subjects were at least partially obtained from buffy coats. Depending on how those are obtained (leftovers from the blood bank?) this could also influence both cell numbers and phenotype. Furthermore, nothing is known about age and other clinical parameters for HD, yet those could have significant impact on results (often HD tend to be younger).</p><p>3) The authors also observed decreased number of naïve cells in the case of HBV infection, but none of the other findings extended to this patient group. This is curious and warrants at least some discussion.</p><p>4) I am somewhat concerned about the approach to define naïve cells by CD45RA and CD27 alone, based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. I would argue that this figure shows a significant proportion of this population to be CD127 negative, CD45RO positive and CCR7 negative. The latter two markers are also surprisingly hard to evaluate, since the staining of the total CD8 population indicates inadequate separation between positive and negative cells.</p><p>5) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3E and F</xref> needs more detail. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, was the treatment IFN? And on how many specific cells are these plots based? They look not like the best flow data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, which patients were studied at which time-point? The range for naïve cells in chronic HCV ranges from 25% to 90%, so the selection of patients in the different post treatment timeframes could greatly alter the results, given the small numbers of data points. Did all subjects show an increase in naïve cells from chronic to post treatment?</p><p>6) For some of the analyses it would be important to know how many specific cells were actually included. For example the ICS data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and the immunoscope study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) could be greatly influenced/skewed by low cell numbers in the analysis. For the ICS experiment, flow plots should be provided as well, and the results not be reported as a multiple of unstimulated versus unstimulated cells as this not allowing a meaningful interpretation of the data.</p><p>7) I think the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> needs to be analyzed differently. The focus on fold change is too dependent on the unstimulated background, which seems higher for the HD sample. The different timpanist also seems to be quite heterogeneous, yet only one time-point is used. I find these data not fully convincing. Were buffy coat cells used for HD? And if so, how long after blood draw were the cells collected?</p><p>8) Can the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> really be interpreted? The variation in that assay seems to be extremely high. At least it would be good to show the results as individual data points instead of bar graphs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Alanio et al. examines memory phenotype CD8 T cells in the preimmune repertoire from chronically infected HCV patients compared to HCV-cured patients and healthy donors. The authors found an increased proportion of pre-immune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells exhibited a memory phenotype (rather than the expected naïve phenotype) in chronically infected HCV patients. This correlated with decreased CD5 expression, increased stimulation following TCR stimulation and increased caspase 3 cleavage following activation, suggesting increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation and activation-induced cell death. In vitro mechanistic studies showed that blocking CD5 on CD8 T cells from healthy donors recapitulated aspects of the increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation phenotype seen for CD8 T cells from chronic HCV patients. Furthermore, the authors showed that naïve CD8 T cells from chronic HCV patients had decreased TREC levels and a more restricted Vβ repertoire, indicative of a perturbed naïve CD8 T cell repertoire in chronic HCV patients. Overall, the study has been well designed and the findings add important information to our knowledge of memory phenotype CD8 T cells in humans in the context of chronic viral infection. However, there are some issues with the manuscript that are detailed below.</p><p>1) Of the three antigen-specific populations studied, two were specific for self antigens – MART1 and hTERT. Thus, although the authors state that these T cells are antigen &quot;inexperienced&quot;, the antigen is present in normal tissues and it seems feasible that chronic HCV infection leads to enhanced presentation of peptides from these self antigens, and subsequent antigen-specific T cell stimulation. In which case the acquisition of non-naïve phenotype is not a surprise. These concerns are partly offset by additional analysis of hCMV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), since the frequency of this population is the lowest of all the specificities studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), making it more difficult to be confident about apparent phenotypic differences. It would be useful if the authors could extend their observations to another non-self antigen (ideally, one with a higher precursor frequency), but at the very least the fact that most of the study is focused on self-specific T cells should be discussed in more depth.</p><p>2) The data on TCR sensitivity and CD5 expression is interesting, and would be in line with the authors' suggestion that proliferation of naïve phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (as evidenced by loss of TREC – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) might lead to decreased CD5 expression levels. However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> do not make a strong case that CD5 expression levels are the root cause of the increased TCR sensitivity of the naïve cells from cHCV patients. The experiments presented show that blockade of CD5 leads to an enhanced response by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells – in line with many previous studies. What is needed is to test whether this blockade would normalize the differences in sensitivity between T cells from HD and cHCV donors. To be specific, the authors need to apply anti-CD5 blockade to <italic>both</italic> HD and cHCV T cells and determine whether TCR hypersensitivity is now equivalent between the groups (supporting the authors' idea that CD5 expression levels are the key determinant). Alternatively, they may find that T cells from cHCV patients still show the same degree of enhanced reactivity following TCR engagement – a result that would imply that CD5 blockade increases sensitivity by both populations to the same extent, and that other features of the cells from cHCV patients are responsible for their enhanced sensitivity.</p><p>3) The authors show that the proportion of antigen-specific CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> naïve CD8 T cells is reduced in chronic HCV patients compared to healthy donors and HCV-cured patients. The stated conclusion is that chronic HCV infection results in increased memory phenotype CD8 T cells; however, it would be useful for the authors to define the phenotypic traits of the non-naïve populations and show whether there is a consistent increase in either CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> or CD45RA<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>-</sup> antigen specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in chronic HCV patients compared to healthy donors and HCV-cured patients. There appears to be substantial differences between groups or experiments in the flow cytometry plots – e.g. comparing the CD27 expression by non-naïve MART-specific cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> – and it would be good to know whether this averages out with compiling samples from multiple individuals.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Bystander hyperactivation of preimmune CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in chronic HCV patients&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a guest Reviewing editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In general, both reviewers are satisfied with the revised version. Reviewer #1 has raised some issues that still need to be addressed before your manuscript can be accepted. However, no additional experiments are required. You just need to address these concerns by making changes in the text. Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 5</xref>, please include these data in the manuscript as a supplemental figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Alanio et al. have significantly revised their manuscript on bystander activation of unprimed CD8 T cells in chronic HCV infection. I appreciate the amount of work, especially given the challenges and limitations when working on human samples. This has definitely improved the manuscript, but, at the same time, I still have a few questions for the authors:</p><p>1) The observation that there are changes in the composition of the CD8 T cell pool based on memory markers remains intriguing. I am still not sure, however, whether this is a relative or an absolute change. The reasons are that the gates on the naïve populations are different for each subject (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), making the quantification of the relative number of naïve T cells seem a little random. At the same time (if I understood the new information about absolute T cell counts correctly), absolute T cell counts were performed using different methods in HD vs SVR and cHCV patients, raising the possibility that the differences in absolute CD3 numbers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> could be a result of different methodology. These issues should be reconciled.</p><p>2) I find it very difficult to interpret the TCR data. The cross sectional results on bulk naïve cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show somewhat subtle differences that could be caused by a multitude of factors. Data on specific cells like from the one subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> should be more revealing. In this case, it seems clear that just one clonotype (already dominant in the naïve cells) is responsible for all memory cells. Would that not imply that one clonotype might have some cross-reactivity and thus have expanded?</p><p>3) The analysis of specific cells for naïve versus memory population has been significantly strengthened by the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, justifying the overall conclusion that more T cells display a memory phenotype. I have still some concerns, especially regarding the longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of MART responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), given that the gates on naïve cells seem to be different in every plot. How was the &quot;right&quot; gate determined in each case? Where the different time-points for a patient not stained in a single experiment or why do the staining patterns/signal strength look so different? Regarding the cross sectional analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, my concern remains that the differences seen in the few patients more than 2 years after treatment (already barely significant) might be driven by patient selection (exemplified by patients S11 and S12 with low memory percentages already pre and post treatment, potentially skewing the results for the 6 subjects included at more than 2 years post treatment). The case that treatment normalizes the phenotype remains not very strong in my opinion (did the bulk CD8 T cells show changes? more data points might be available).</p><p>4) The functional experiments using CD5 blockade remain inconclusive, given that an effect is only seen in HD. As this effect is modest and does not lead to the same level of reactivity as seen in the cHCV patients (R6) it seems unclear whether CD5 is the main mechanism here.</p><p>5) The in vitro expansion and ICS experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are a bit problematic. First, for each of the subjects the naïve MART precursor frequency should be given, since some of the cHCV subjects had relatively high frequencies as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>. In any case, assuming specific cells in cHCV expand better, could this not be explained by them being memory and not naïve cells? For the functional data, the difference in granzyme B is modest and no difference is observed directly ex-vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>). As for the IFN assay, are the authors really suggesting that populations requiring TAME for visualization can be detected via ICS directly ex-vivo? Detecting such small populations via ex-vivo ICS from 5 million PBMC seems unlikely.</p><p>In summary, to me this revision has significantly strengthened the basic observations supporting the notion that HCV infection indeed impacts other unrelated T cell populations. I remain less convinced about the suggested mechanisms behind these findings and also whether HCV treatment really restores the T cell compartment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors have made numerous revisions to the manuscript, which address the major concerns I raised. The only request would be to include the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 5</xref> in the manuscript.

It is also much appreciated that the editor and referees acknowledge the inherent limitations for human investigations; accordingly, we have modified the Discussion so that it is more clear what aspects of our predictions are speculative in nature. In light of our new results and the reorganization of the report, we believe that the revised manuscript is considerably improved.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) It is not fully clear to me that the authors have a strong case that the distinct phenotype they observe has also actual clinical consequences. They discuss autoimmunity and also that antigen-experienced cells in HCV infection might be more prone to stimulation and cell death. But this is all rather vague and speculative. One could equally argue that the number of truly naïve cells remained actually stable and that just some additional memory-like cells were observed, with unknown consequences.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pushing us to clarify our message. We have modified the Discussion in order to make the point that the proposed link to the extra-hepatic manifestations observed in cHCV patients is speculative and will need to be evaluated in longitudinal cohort studies. If our prediction is correct, the ability to restore a physiologically normal preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients may justify early treatment as a means to limit immune-mediated manifestations of the disease. We have also performed new experiments that reinforce our prior observations. With respect to antigen-specific inexperienced T cells being more prone to activation, this has been directly tested using ex vivo expansion as readout. We found MART-1 specific T cells from cHCV patients more abundant and possessing greater effector function (i.e., Granzyme B expression) after cognate peptide stimulation, comparing with healthy controls (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 A-D</xref>). These findings indicate that qualitative alterations of the CD8 T cell preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients do indeed impact critical aspects of induced immune responses. It also reinforces our conclusion that lower threshold for TCR activation on naïve T cells might trigger antigen-independent T cell differentiation in cHCV patients. As discussed below, our initial results were confirmed when testing virus-specific T cells, reactive to viral antigens for which the donors had not been exposed (e.g., HIV, Ebola).</p><p>Regarding the query about absolute cell numbers, the reviewer is correct in their interpretation, and we now have clarified this point in the revised manuscript – the precursor frequency of naïve-phenotype Mart1-specific T cells is unaffected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>). This result, however, does not alter our conclusions regarding memory-phenotype cells.</p><p><italic>2) The paper does not detail what kind of therapy the patients were receiving (and almost all of them were already treatment experienced in both the chronic and the SVR group). Assuming they had received IFN before, could that not have had significant impact on the phenotype of the T cells? And what was the latest therapy in the SVR group? IFN versus DAA would make an important difference.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. 62% of our chronic HCV patients were treatment-experienced, of which 2/3 received bitherapy with pegylated interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), and 1/3 were treated with a combination of a direct antiviral agent (DAA) and interferon. To assess the potential interference, we stratified our patient groups, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>, the observed effect of higher percentages of memory-phenotype Mart1-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be seen in both non-treated and previously treated cHCV patients. We have also provided an update to <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, indicating that the median delay post-treatment of included cHCV patients was 3.8 years (IQR1-3 3.4-4.2). Given the timing of our collections, we do not believe there to be a risk of prior therapy confounding our results.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.028</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>In both cHCV (left) and SVR (right), proportions of memory-phenotype (MP) cells within Mart1-specific populations are not a function of previous drug regimen.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07916.028">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07916.028</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07916-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>With respect to SVR patients, all patients received prior treatment (by definition): 70% received an IFN/RBV therapy, and 30% were treated with a DAA-based therapy.

We have amended the manuscript, including details about prior treatment regimens.</p><p>With the aim of increasing clarity of our manuscript, we also provide a new table (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) that is stratified for HLA-A<sub>0201</sub> positive donors, the subset of patients used for studying antigenspecific T cell phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Also, cells from the healthy subjects were at least partially obtained from buffy coats. Depending on how those are obtained (leftovers from the blood bank?) this could also influence both cell numbers and phenotype. Furthermore, nothing is known about age and other clinical parameters for HD, yet those could have significant impact on results (often HD tend to be younger).</italic> </p><p>In our study, buffy coats from HD were collected by the French blood bank, according to blood transfusion procedures. PBMCs were processed within 5 hours of their collection. They were used fresh, frozen and thawed when needed. In both cases, cells were rested overnight in serum-free RPMI at 37° before performing functional studies. We systematically controlled sample quality and excluded any samples containing &gt;10% of dying cells. For cytometric studies, we further gated residual dead cell using live/dead probes. Importantly, allowing appropriate comparison, leukapheresis collection from cHCV and SVR patients followed the exact same procedure (e.g., location, transport time, quality control). Additional information is now added to the revised Methods section. Finally, the age of HD is now indicated. Of note, age-matched controls were selected for our study (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors also observed decreased number of naïve cells in the case of HBV infection, but none of the other findings extended to this patient group. This is curious and warrants at least some discussion.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. To address the question of the pre-immune repertoire in HCV patients, we designed a specific protocol for leukapheresis collection, permitting recovery of up to 1010 PBMCs from each donor. This allowed assay development and optimization, and multiple assays to be performed on same donors. Following our initial discoveries in cHCV patients, we were prompted to evaluate our findings in an alternative viral hepatitis disease state. We were fortunate to have access to a bio-repository of HBV samples that permitted rapid testing, however samples were indeed limited, with ~5x107 PBMCs being available per patient. We therefore restricted our analysis to: (i) Mart1-specific T cell phenotype and numbers, (ii) CD5 levels on bulk naïve T cells, and (iii) CD25 and active caspase 3 percentages after 24 hours of activation with CD3/CD28 antibodies, parameters that we identified in the cHCV cohort as the best biomarkers of a perturbed T cell repertoire. As discussed, we demonstrated lower absolute numbers and intermediate proportions of memoryphenotype Mart1-specific cells in cHBV patients, and a similar CD5 expression and T cell activation as compared to HDs. Based on these findings, we believe that different persistent viral infections can trigger distinct T cell repertoire perturbations. We have taken the advice of the reviewer to include all data from cHBV patients in a separate supplementary figure. These results will be followed up in future studies.</p><p><italic>4) I am somewhat concerned about the approach to define naïve cells by CD45RA and CD27 alone, based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. I would argue that this figure shows a significant proportion of this population to be CD127 negative, CD45RO positive and CCR7 negative. The latter two markers are also surprisingly hard to evaluate, since the staining of the total CD8 population indicates inadequate separation between positive and negative cells.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful analysis of our data, and acknowledge that the gating strategy is crucial. Regarding the gating on naïve T cells based on high levels of CD45RA and CD27, we validated our strategy using additional healthy donors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> gated naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express the highest levels of CCR7 and lowest level of HLA-DR markers. We also demonstrate a high degree of correlation between percentages of CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> and CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CCR7<sup>+</sup> naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These data were confirmed in cHCV patients, with &gt;95% bulk and Mart1- specific CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells also expressing CCR7. We now provide these data in the manuscript as a supplementary figure (Figure S1B). Regarding the concern related to Figure S1, we confirm that there is a minor population (9%) of CD127 negative cells in the displayed CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> gate. These cells are &gt;99% CD45RO negative and CCR7 positive, which we believe allows us to be confident that they are indeed naïve T cells. Interestingly, they express lower levels of CD27 as compared to other naïve cells. Our interpretation is that this subpopulation corresponds to activated naïve T cells that have shed surface CD27, as previously described in the context of graft-versus-host disease (Poulin, 2003).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.029</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Evaluation of CD45RA/CD27 gating strategy.</title><p>CD45RA<sup>+</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup> naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express the highest levels of CCR7 and lowest level of HLA-DR markers (<bold>A</bold>).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, was the treatment IFN? And on how many specific cells are these plots based? They look not like the best flow data.</italic> </p><p>We have revised the indicated figure, now revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Specifically, we (i) provide new FACS plots showing the evolution of Mart1 phenotype in one SVR patient collected during chronic phase, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after successful IFNRBV therapy; (ii) included 4 new HLA-A0201 SVR patients that were sampled at different time points after viral clearance; and (iii) employed statistical methods to analyze longitudinal datasets (p-value represents the significance of the fixed effect of time after linearisation of the data followed by fitting of a mixed model (see Materials and methods for details). Our data confirm on a per patient basis that viral clearance results in the restoration of an expected naïve phenotype for Mart1-specific T cells. Concerning the number of cells, we agree with the reviewer that low number of Ag-specific inexperienced T cells is a challenge. As an example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we gated a mean of 97 Mart1- specific T cells (range 48-126). As a general strategy, in line with recognized groups in the field (Yu et al., 2015), we interpret a tetramer-gated population as real if containing more than 20 antigen-specific enriched cells. We chose this number based on our initial evaluation of the limit of detection of our assay (please refer to Alanio et al., 2010), established using spiked numbers of CTL clones.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, which patients were studied at which time-point?</italic> </p><p>The manuscript has been modified accordingly, tagging corresponding data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B and C</xref> with patient ID.

Thus, although the authors state that these T cells are antigen &quot;inexperienced&quot;, the antigen is present in normal tissues and it seems feasible that chronic HCV infection leads to enhanced presentation of peptides from these self antigens, and subsequent antigen-specific T cell stimulation. In which case the acquisition of non-naïve phenotype is not a surprise. These concerns are partly offset by additional analysis of hCMV specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), since the frequency of this population is the lowest of all the specificities studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), making it more difficult to be confident about apparent phenotypic differences. It would be useful if the authors could extend their observations to another non-self antigen (ideally, one with a higher precursor frequency), but at the very least the fact that most of the study is focused on self-specific T cells should be discussed in more depth.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her interest in our study and for the careful analysis of the manuscript. Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that cells-specific for self-peptides were activated by their cognate antigen, we believe the extension of our observations to T cells specific for non-self (foreign) antigens supports our conclusion of antigen-independent differentiation of preimmune repertoire in cHCV patients. Indeed, our new experiments measuring HIV and Ebola virus epitopes in cHCV patients – all HIV and presumably Ebola seronegative – considerably strengthens our argument (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We have also included new functional data to assess the impact of preimmune alterations. Notably, Mart1 peptide based expansion was higher in cHCV than normal donors, and the responding T cells showed higher levels of effector molecules (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> in revised manuscript). Future studies will address how these findings impact the in vivo capacity of cHCV patients to mount adequate CD8 T cell responses – providing direct relevance for optimization of therapeutic vaccination in this patient population. Notably, these data may be relevant in other chronic disease areas.</p><p><italic>2) The data on TCR sensitivity and CD5 expression is interesting, and would be in line with the authors' suggestion that proliferation of naïve phenotype CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (as evidenced by loss of TREC – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) might lead to decreased CD5 expression levels. However, the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> do not make a strong case that CD5 expression levels are the root cause of the increased TCR sensitivity of the naïve cells from cHCV patients. The experiments presented show that blockade of CD5 leads to an enhanced response by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells – in line with many previous studies. What is needed is to test whether this blockade would normalize the differences in sensitivity between T cells from HD and cHCV donors. To be specific, the authors need to apply anti-CD5 blockade to</italic> both <italic>HD and cHCV T cells and determine whether TCR hypersensitivity is now equivalent between the groups (supporting the authors' idea that CD5 expression levels are the key determinant). Alternatively, they may find that T cells from cHCV patients still show the same degree of enhanced reactivity following TCR engagement – a result that would imply that CD5 blockade increases sensitivity by both populations to the same extent, and that other features of the cells from cHCV patients are responsible for their enhanced sensitivity.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments and suggestions. To address the inter-individual variation, we have increased the number of donor tested in TCR activation experiments (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As recommended, we also tested the impact of pre-incubation with blocking CD5 antibody on both HD and cHCV groups. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 5</xref>, we demonstrate a consistent positive impact of αCD5 on TCRinduced activation, with a corresponding increase in activation-induced cell death. By contrast, cHCV patients do not show evidence of enhanced T cell activation following CD5 blockade. These data support our interpretation that T cells from cHCV patients are functionally perturbed due to their lower expression of CD5, and that further inhibition does not provide additional hyper-activation.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.032</object-id><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Impact of CD5 blockade on TCR activation profile in cHCV patients.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Impact of preincubation with anti-CD5 antibodies on% CD25 and% active-caspase 3 after CD3/28 stimulation in cHCV patients.

I am still not sure, however, whether this is a relative or an absolute change. The reasons are that the gates on the naïve populations are different for each subject (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), making the quantification of the relative number of naïve T cells seem a little random.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive assessment of our study. The gates were not perfectly identical in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> because the samples were acquired in different experiments. However, fluorescence measurements were consistent over time, standardized using CST <italic>Check Performance</italic>. Following the reviewer’s note, we reanalysed the same files in one single FlowJo workspace. We are now providing a sample of the resulting plots in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, as well as new percentages (47 in HD, 35 in SVR, and 24 in cHCV instead of 43, 33 and 22 respectively). Although we recognize that acquiring all samples in a unique experiment, and applying strict gating to all samples would have been ideal, this was not possible in our prospective study. We hope the reviewer will acknowledge the minor impact of this technical limitation on the relevance of our observations.</p><p> <italic>At the same time (if I understood the new information about absolute T cell counts correctly), absolute T cell counts were performed using different methods in HD vs SVR and cHCV patients, raising the possibility that the differences in absolute CD3 numbers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref> could be a result of different methodology. These issues should be reconciled.</italic> </p><p>Regarding the differences in absolute numbers of CD3, the reviewer is right that the methodologies used are slightly different, i.e. automatic counts on whole blood in hospital laboratory for HCV and SVR patients vs. beads-based counts on whole blood for healthy donors. However, as HCV and SVR patients were collected by leukapheresis, we did not have a way to standardize the methods. Both being well calibrated, we don’t see any reason for significant discrepancies. We have now clarified this in the manuscript. We remain confident in our conclusion of lower percentages and normal absolute counts of naïve CD8 T cells in cHCV patients, especially that the first observation is in accordance with previously published studies (Shen et al., 2010).</p><p> <italic>2) I find it very difficult to interpret the TCR data. The cross sectional results on bulk naïve cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> show somewhat subtle differences that could be caused by a multitude of factors. Data on specific cells like from the one subject in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> should be more revealing. In this case, it seems clear that just one clonotype (already dominant in the naïve cells) is responsible for all memory cells. Would that not imply that one clonotype might have some cross-reactivity and thus have expanded?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for these comments. We acknowledge that our data on bulk naïve cells are reinforced by repertoire analysis on sorted Mart1-specific naïve and memory inexperienced T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We agree with the reviewer that our observation of predominant Vβ18 clone within Mart1-specific memory-phenotype cells argues for it being the progeny of the dominant Vβ18 clone within Mart1-specific naïve-phenotype cells. Our interpretation is that the shift in the CD45RA/CD27 phenotype of inexperienced T cells is accompanied by clonal selection – and thus not a reflection of abnormal surface expression. However, we believe this does not inform us on the mechanism of expansion, i.e. specific vs. aspecific (homeostatic) differentiation, both being described as triggering clonal selection (Mikszta et al., 1999; Qi et al., 2014). We have now clarified this point in our manuscript.</p><p> <italic>3) The analysis of specific cells for naïve versus memory population has been significantly strengthened by the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, justifying the overall conclusion that more T cells display a memory phenotype. I have still some concerns, especially regarding the longitudinal and cross-sectional analysis of MART responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), given that the gates on naïve cells seem to be different in every plot. How was the &quot;right&quot; gate determined in each case? Where the different time-points for a patient not stained in a single experiment or why do the staining patterns/signal strength look so different?</italic></p><p>As in point 1, the reviewer is correct that there are minor changes in naïve/memory gates (please see above for justification). With respect to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, the &quot;right&quot; gate for tetramer-specific populations was set using naïve/memory markers on bulk CD8 T cells, acquired on the same day as given patients were analyzed.</p><p><italic>Regarding the cross sectional analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, my concern remains that the differences seen in the few patients more than 2 years after treatment (already barely significant) might be driven by patient selection (exemplified by patients S11 and S12 with low memory percentages already pre and post treatment, potentially skewing the results for the 6 subjects included at more than 2 years post treatment). The case that treatment normalizes the phenotype remains not very strong in my opinion (did the bulk CD8 T cells show changes? more data points might be available).</italic> </p><p>Concerning recovery after SVR, we studied all frozen material available from the five longitudinally-sampled HLA A<sub>0201</sub>-positive donors. Analysis on bulk CD8 T cells, as suggested by the reviewer, was conducted and is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 7</xref>. Although it shows an interesting pattern, we share with the reviewer the conviction that these findings will need to be confirmed in large longitudinal cohort studies. We have now added one sentence to the manuscript to indicate the need for replication.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07916.034</object-id><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Percentages of memoryphenotype cells within bulk CD8+ T cells over time in SVR patients tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07916.034">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07916.034</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07916-resp-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p> <italic>4) The functional experiments using CD5 blockade remain inconclusive, given that an effect is only seen in HD. As this effect is modest and does not lead to the same level of reactivity as seen in the cHCV patients (R6) it seems unclear whether CD5 is the main mechanism here.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effect of blocking CD5 is modest and does not lead to the same level of reactivity than in cHCV patients. However, and this is consistent with reviewer 2’s interpretation, we believe the selective effect on HD is an argument for CD5 being involved in the pathogenesis underlying the hyperactivation phenotype.</p><p> <italic>5) The in vitro expansion and ICS experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are a bit problematic. First, for each of the subjects the naïve MART precursor frequency should be given, since some of the cHCV subjects had relatively high frequencies as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for careful analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.

For the functional data, the difference in granzyme B is modest and no difference is observed directly ex-vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6–figure supplement 3</xref>).</italic> </p><p>The difference in granzyme B is modest but statistically significant. We have clarified this in the text.</p><p><italic>As for the IFN assay, are the authors really suggesting that populations requiring TAME for visualization can be detected via ICS directly ex-vivo? Detecting such small populations via ex-vivo ICS from 5 million PBMC seems unlikely.</italic> </p><p>For ICS experiments, we stimulated 10<sup>7</sup> PBMCs cells in 24-well format plates. Based on precursor frequencies (10<sup>-5</sup> – 10<sup>-6</sup> / CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells), we expect between 2 and 20 inexperienced antigen-specific cells to be available in a given well for peptide restimulation. Given the absence of detectable IFNγ in unstimulated conditions, we believe cytokine secretion reflects a state of hyperactivation towards antigens. We therefore concluded that presumably inexperienced T cells are indeed hyperactive.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>The authors have made numerous revisions to the manuscript, which address the major concerns I raised. The only request would be to include the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 5</xref> in the manuscript.
