distribution of enzymes. Serine hydrolases are a diverse enzyme class that plays fundamental roles in CNS metabolism and signaling. Here, we perform an activity-based proteomic analysis of primary mouse neurons, astrocytes, and microglia to furnish a global portrait of the cellular anatomy of serine hydrolases in the brain. We uncover compelling evidence for the cellular compartmentalization of key chemical transmission pathways, including the functional segregation of endocannabinoid (eCB) biosynthetic enzymes diacylglycerol lipase-alpha (DAGLα) and –beta (DAGLβ) to neurons and microglia, respectively. Disruption of DAGLβ perturbed eCB-eicosanoid crosstalk specifically in microglia and suppressed neuroinflammatory events in vivo independently of broader effects on eCB content. Mapping the cellular distribution of metabolic enzymes thus identifies pathways for regulating specialized inflammatory responses in the brain while avoiding global alterations in CNS function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12345.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12345.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12345.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The brain is made up of many types of cells. These include the neurons that transmit messages throughout the nervous system, and microglia, which act as the first line of the brain’s immune defense. The activity of both neurons and microglia can be influenced by molecules called endocannabinoids that bind to proteins on the cells’ surface. For example, endocannabinoids affect how a neuron responds to messages sent to it from a neighbouring neuron, and help microglia to regulate the inflammation of brain tissue.</p> <p>Enzymes called serine hydrolases play important roles in several different signaling processes in the brain, including those involving endocannabinoids. Viader et al. have now studied the activities of these enzymes – including two called DAGLα and DAGLβ – in the mouse brain using a technique called activity-based protein profiling. This revealed that DAGLα plays an important role in controlling how neurons respond to endocannabinoids, while DAGLβ performs the equivalent role in microglia.</p> <p>When Viader et al. shut down DAGLβ activity, this only affected endocannabinoid signaling in microglia. This also had the effect of reducing inflammation in the brain, without affecting how endocannabinoids signal in neurons. These results suggest that inhibitors of DAGLβ could offer a way to suppress inflammation in the brain, which may contribute to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases, while preserving the normal pathways that neurons use to communicate with one another.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12345.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12345.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chemical proteomic</kwd><kwd>endocannabinoids</kwd><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>neuroinflammation</kwd><kwd>2-arachidonoylglycerol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA033760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cravatt</surname><given-names>Benjamin F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109315</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viader</surname><given-names>Andreu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-specific pathways regulate lipid transmitters and neuroinflammation in the brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain is a highly heterogeneous organ composed of diverse cell types with distinct structures, molecular compositions, and complementary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Major brain cell classes include neurons, which are the principal cells responsible for directing and transmitting information in the nervous system in the form of chemical and electrical signals, and glia, which are often referred to as support cells, but are now recognized to play critical roles in regulating neurotransmission, synaptic activity, and higher-order neurophysiological, behavioral, and disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barres, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gundersen et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the biochemical pathways that furnish neurons and glia with different properties and functions requires knowledge of the content, activity, and regulation of proteins within these cells.</p><p>Global gene expression studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular composition of different brain cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cahoy et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beutner et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, a recent study using deep RNA sequencing generated a quantitative, high-resolution map of transcript abundances for major mouse brain cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Thousands of cell type-enriched transcripts and splicing isoforms were identified, underscoring the unique molecular composition of different brain cell classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). How these transcriptional signatures relate to the protein content of brain cell types, however, remains mostly unknown.</p><p>Several proteomic studies have been performed on isolated brain cells, in particular, neurons and astrocytes, using approaches that include two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and shotgun liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glanzer et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell-Temin et al., 2012</xref>). Many proteins, however, are regulated in their function by post-translational mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kobe and Kemp, 1999</xref>) that are difficult to discern with conventional expression-based proteomic methods. Activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) is a chemical proteomic method that uses active site-directed chemical probes to selectively target subsets of proteins in the proteome based on shared mechanistic and/or structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cravatt et al., 2008</xref>). Because ABPP probes modify protein targets based on conserved functional features, these reagents can detect, enrich, and identify many members of a class of proteins and illuminate changes in protein activity that are not reflected in transcript or protein abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jessani et al., 2004</xref>). ABPP has been used to map deregulated enzyme activities in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jessani et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nomura et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kohnz et al., 2015</xref>), metabolic disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez et al., 2014</xref>), and infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Greenbaum et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bottcher and Sieber, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heal and Tate, 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nasheri et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Among the classes of proteins that have been addressed by ABPP, the serine hydrolases are a particularly large and diverse enzyme family that plays many key roles in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon and Cravatt, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long and Cravatt, 2011</xref>). Serine hydrolases regulate proteolysis at the synapse to modulate neuronal plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Melchor and Strickland, 2005</xref>), the post-translational modification state of key brain signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sontag et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>), and, perhaps most notably, the metabolism of a wide range of chemical messengers, including neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Phillis, 2005</xref>], neuropeptides (e.g., α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wallingford et al., 2009</xref>]), and lipid messengers (e.g., endocannabinoids; eCBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankman and Cravatt, 2013</xref>]).</p><p>Here we use ABPP combined with shotgun LC-MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Washburn et al., 2001</xref>) to generate an in-depth portrait of serine hydrolase activities across three major mouse brain cell types—neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. We show that the output of this functional proteomic analysis correlates well with published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), although there are clear exceptions of enzymes where transcript and activity are un- and even anti-correlated. We also uncover strong evidence for the compartmentalization of functionally related serine hydrolases into distinct cell types, suggesting that their respective activities are anatomically segregated in the brain. A principal example was the selective enrichment of different sets of eCB biosynthetic and degradative enzymes in neurons versus microglia. We show that these activity patterns have functional relevance and mark pathways that regulate immunomodulatory eCB/eicosanoid signals without globally perturbing brain eCB content.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Serine hydrolase activity profiles of mouse brain cell types</title><p>We globally assessed serine hydrolase activities in cultured mouse neurons, astrocytes, and microglia by treating proteomes from these cells with serine hydrolase-directed fluorophosphonate (FP) probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon and Cravatt, 2010</xref>).

We have herein used ABPP to provide a global portrait of serine hydrolase activities in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, and, through doing so, identified cell type-specific regulation of key chemical transmission pathways, in particular eCBs and eicosanoids, that exert differential impact on global versus inflammation-induced processes in the mouse brain.</p><p>Previous studies have found that a substantial portion (~40%) of the variance in protein content can be explained by differences in mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schwanhausser et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this conclusion, we found that our activity-based proteomic data displayed good overall correlation with previously reported mRNA expression data obtained by deep RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). A few notable exceptions of enzymes where transcript and activity were un- or even anti-correlated were, however, identified, and it would be interesting, in future studies, to understand the basis for these differences. One anti-correlated protein – HTRA1 – for instance, is known to be regulated at the level of secretion from cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Skorko-Glonek et al., 2013</xref>), and it is possible that individual brain cell types differentially export this enzyme to create discordant measures of mRNA and cellular protein content. Other posttranslational events, such as phosphorylation, could regulate serine hydrolase activity and/or stability. Some of the discrepancies between our chemical proteomic results and previously reported mRNA expression datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) may also arise from differences in methodology, given that our studies used primary brain cell cultures instead of acutely isolated neurons and glia. Cells in culture are known to only partially model cells from an in vivo environment, and future ABPP studies using freshly isolated neurons and glia should help to further enrich our understanding of serine hydrolase activities in specific brain cell types.</p><p>We were struck by the remarkable number of serine hydrolases that showed differential activity across neurons, astrocytes, and microglia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This observation supports the emerging recognition that neurons and glia are endowed with complementary enzymatic pathways to meet the overall metabolic needs of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belanger et al., 2011</xref>). Among the most prominently compartmentalized serine hydrolases were those that regulate the eCB 2-AG. This lipid messenger, known to be biosynthesized by two different enzymes—DAGLα and DAGLβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bisogno et al., 2003</xref>)—and with the potential to be degraded by several enzymes—MGLL, ABHD6, ABHD12, and FAAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blankman et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marrs et al., 2011</xref>)— is an important regulator of inter-neuronal and neuron-glia interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Navarrete and Araque, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Martin et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Viader et al., 2015</xref>). 2-AG signaling also impacts diverse neurophysiological processes, including pain, mood, and neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankman and Cravatt, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murataeva et al., 2014</xref>). Considering the widespread functions of 2-AG, the identification of mechanisms that allow for the selective modulation of specific aspects of this lipid transmitter’s action in the nervous system stands as an important objective. Toward this end, our work establishes that individual cell types in the brain control 2-AG metabolism and signaling by different enzymatic pathways.</p><p>We found that microglia, in particular, are equipped with a distinct complement of 2-AG metabolic enzymes – ABHD12 and DAGLβ – the inactivation of which perturbs eCB signaling and crosstalk with eicosanoids specifically in this cell type. ABHD12 plays additional important roles in lipid metabolism in the brain, where the enzyme serves as a major lyso-PS hydrolase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blankman et al., 2013</xref>) that is part of an immunomodulatory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kamat et al., 2015</xref>) linked to the human neurological disease PHARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiskerstrand et al., 2010</xref>). It will thus be important, in the future, to dissect in what physiological and disease contexts ABHD12 acts as a 2-AG versus lyso-PS hydrolase. Note also that, while our results indicate a role for ABHD12 in the modulation of microglia endocannabinoid signaling, our experiments do not discriminate the precise identity of the receptors involved. Whether CB<sub>1</sub>R, CB<sub>2</sub>R, or even other closely related receptors, mediate the observed ABHD12-regulated 2-AG effect on microglial ERK phosphorylation can be addressed in future studies using lower concentrations of selective CB<sub>1</sub>R and CB<sub>2</sub>R antagonists or microglia derived from knockout mice lacking these receptors.</p><p>DAGLα has been shown to be the principal source for 2-AG production in the nervous system, and disruption of this enzyme impairs many forms of CB<sub>1</sub>R-dependent synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tanimura et al., 2010</xref>). Our results extend these findings in an important way by demonstrating that DAGLα also regulates neuroinflammatory responses in the brain, in particular, LPS-induced microglial activation. The reductions in LPS-stimulated neuroinflammation observed in <italic>Dagla</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice may reflect, at least in part, crosstalk between eCB and eicosanoid pathways, since basal and LPS-induced prostaglandin synthesis were decreased in these animals. By also identifying DAGLβ as a principal 2-AG synthase in microglia, our work establishes a previously underappreciated and specialized role for this enzyme in 2-AG biosynthesis in the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reisenberg et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murataeva et al., 2014</xref>). Our results also do not rule out the presence of DAGLβ-regulated pools of 2-AG in other brain cell types, as might be supported by the significant reductions in this eCB observed in brain tissue from <italic>Dagla</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice treated with MGLL and DAGL inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Also potentially consistent with a role for DAGLβ in regulating bulk brain 2-AG in the absence of DAGLα, we have been unable to generate viable <italic>Dagla/b</italic> double-knockout mice. Nonetheless, most of the major forms of eCB-dependent synaptic plasticity have been shown to be regulated by DAGLα rather than DAGLβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tanimura et al., 2010</xref>), underscoring the broad role that the former enzyme plays in eCB signaling throughout the nervous system.</p><p>That <italic>Daglb</italic> deletion attenuates LPS-induced microglial activation in vivo without altering bulk eCB or eicosanoid content in the brain suggests modulation of restricted pools of 2-AG can impact neuroinflammatory processes while avoiding global effects on eCB signaling. This finding adds to a growing body of work implicating glial proteins and pathways as potential targets for nervous system disease that may have fewer neuron-related adverse side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barres, 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ilieva et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Milligan and Watkins, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sheridan, 2009</xref>).

When necessary, proteomes were pre-treated with inhibitors for 1 hr at 37°C prior to addition of ABPP probes. Probe labeling was terminated by quenching with 4x SDS/PAGE loading buffer, and labeled proteome samples were separated by SDS-PAGE (10% [wt/vol] acrylamide) and visualized by in-gel fluorescence scanning using a flatbed fluorescence scanner (Hitachi FMBio IIe).

After labeling, the proteomes were precipitated using cold MeOH (2 mL), CHCl3 (0.5 mL) and PBS (1 mL). The resulting cloudy mixture was vortexed and then centrifuged (5000 × g, 15 min, 4°C). The organic and aqueous layers were aspirated leaving a protein disc which had formed between phases. The protein disc was washed with cold 1:1 MeOH:CHCl3 (3 × 1 mL) while intact and then probe sonicated in cold 4:1 MeOH:CHCl3 (2.5 mL). Insoluble proteins were pelleted via centrifugation (5000 × g, 15 min, 4°C) and the supernatant was removed. The remaining pellet was redissolved in 500 µL of 6 M urea in PBS, reduced using Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP, 10 mM) for 30 min at 37°C, and then alkylated using ​iodoacetamide (40 mM) for 30 min at 25°C in the dark.

For all samples, data were collected in data-dependent acquisition mode over a range from 400–1800 m/z. Each full scan was followed by up to 7 fragmentation events. Dynamic exclusion was enabled (repeat count of 1, exclusion duration of 20 s) for all experiments. The data were searched using the ProLuCID algorithm against a mouse reverse-concatenated, non-redundant (gene-centric) FASTA database that was assembled from the Uniprot database. ProLuCID searches allowed for variable oxidation of methionine (+15.9949 m/z), static modification of cysteine residues (+57.0215 m/z; iodoacetamide alkylation) and accepted only half- or fully-tryptic peptides. The resulting peptide spectral matches were filtered using DTASelect (version 2.0.47), and only half-tryptic or fully tryptic peptides were accepted for identification. Peptides were restricted to a specified false positive rate of &lt;1%. Only proteins detected in at least two out of four replicates for any one cell type preparation, with ≥ 5 spectral counts were used for downstream analysis.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor. One of the two reviewers, Nephi Stella, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>In this interesting study, Viader et al. assess the distribution of serine hydrolases in cultured mouse neurons, astrocytes and microglia. They use activity-based protein profiling combined with multidimensional LC-MS and find that distinct groups of serine hydrolases are enriched in specific neural cell types. Comparison of serine hydrolase expression profiles in neural cell types correlates well with the recently reported RNA-seq database from the Barres lab (Zheng et al., 2014), with some noticeable exceptions.</p> <p>Of particular interest are results showing the clear compartmentalization in the functionality of the endocannabinoid/eicosanoid signaling between neurons and microglia. Furthermore, the in vivo testing of these particular signaling pathways using selective inhibitor and knockout technology provides a convincing validation.</p> <p>However, there are a few textual changes that will need to be made before the manuscript is ready for acceptance.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>1) With regards your cell culture preparations, please provide more specifics and the actual data of their characterization. What were the readouts (specific antibodies) and the sampling approach used to determine cell numbers? What non-neuronal cells?</p> <p>2) Microglial cells were cultured in the presence GMCSF, which induces a dendritic-like phenotype in these cells. Please comment on how this influences the interpretation of these results.</p> <p>3) Add to the Discussion something on the limitation of this study. Specifically, the initial profiling was performed on cells in culture, which are known to only partially model in situ CNS cells. Several key validation steps of these results will have to be performed in future studies, including confirming key cell culture results using freshly isolated CNS cells, for example using FACS. Further studies using cell specific genetic alteration will also provide further validation of the results.</p> <p>4) Regarding IHC analysis, please provide methodological specifics: were masks generated to outline each cell or the number of positive pixels counted? How were the background signal and global adjustments set?</p> <p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, involvement of CB1 and CB2 receptors is tested with antagonists applied at 5 µM, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than their respective potency at these target (and thus too high to leverage their selectivity). Testing the response obtained with lower concentrations of these antagonists would be more convincing and informative.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12345.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p> <p><italic>1) With regards your cell culture preparations, please provide more specifics and the actual data of their characterization. What were the readouts (specific antibodies) and the sampling approach used to determine cell numbers? What non-neuronal cells?</italic></p> <p>Our glial culture preparations were characterized by immunocytochemistry and western blotting. Iba-1 and GFAP were used as markers for microglia and astrocytes, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> and noted in the Methods sections, our microglia and astrocyte cultures are routinely ~99% and ~85% pure respectively, as determined by quantifying the proportion of Iba-1 or GFAP positive cells counted in six different fields from two separate cultures (total cell number determined by DAPI nuclear staining and/or actin staining).</p> <p>Our neuron cultures are grown in the presence of anti-mitotics (5 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine) for over 2 weeks, thus also ensuring high neuronal enrichment. This was confirmed in the western blot below, which shows that cell lysates from our neuronal cultures strongly express the neuronal marker Tuj1 but lack astrocytic or microglial markers (GFAP and Iba-1). A brief description of the characterization of our cell culture preparations has now been included in the Methods section.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12345.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12345.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12345.015</ext-link></p></caption> <graphic xlink:href="elife-12345-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p> <p><italic>2) Microglial cells were cultured in the presence GMCSF, which induces a dendritic-like phenotype in these cells. Please comment on how this influences the interpretation of these results.</italic></p> <p>We recognize the reviewers’ concern regarding the potential effect of culturing microglia in the presence of GM-CSF, since this growth factor is known to induce a dendritic-like phenotype in these cells. The large number of microglia cells required for our proteomic and metabolomic studies (we often needed &gt;60 million cells), however, made the use of GM-CSF necessary to increase the microglia cell yield and accomplish our experimental goals. Given that cultured cells in general and GM-CSF-exposed microglia in particular only partially model CNS cells in vivo, the results from the present study need to be considered as a starting point to identify potentially interesting serine hydrolase activities in different brain cell types. The functional relevance of individual enzymes, however, and as we showed in this study, requires additional experimental validation. Note that some of the limitations related to using cultured microglia are now described in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript.</p> <p><italic>3) Add to the Discussion something on the limitation of this study. Specifically, the initial profiling was performed on cells in culture, which are known to only partially model in situ CNS cells. Several key validation steps of these results will have to be performed in future studies, including confirming key cell culture results using freshly isolated CNS cells, for example using FACS. Further studies using cell specific genetic alteration will also provide further validation of the results.</italic></p> <p>We agree with the reviewers that the present work could be strengthened by generating our chemoproteomic profiles using freshly isolated CNS cells. As the sensitivity of our chemoproteomic methods improves and the yields of acute brain cell type isolation increase, such studies should become technically feasible. We have now included the following sentence in the Discussion to acknowledge some of the limitations associated with the use of brain cells in culture for our proteomic profiles: “Note that some of the discrepancies between our chemical proteomic results and previously reported mRNA expression datasets (Zhang et al., 2014) may also arise from differences in methodology, given that our studies used primary brain cell cultures instead of acutely isolated neurons and glia. Cells in culture are known to only partially model cells from an in vivo environment, and future ABPP studies using freshly isolated neurons and glia should help to further enrich our understanding of serine hydrolase activities in specific brain cell types.”</p> <p><italic>4) Regarding IHC analysis, please provide methodological specifics: were masks generated to outline each cell or the number of positive pixels counted? How were the background signal and global adjustments set?</italic></p> <p>The Methods section now includes a description of the IHC analysis. Briefly, images to be counted were converted to 8 bit greyscale and global adjustments in brightness and contrast applied in the same way to the whole set of images being analyzed. The area for all cells being quantified was then highlighted using ImageJ’s Threshold macro, setting the same range of pixel intensities for the entire set of images being processed. Total microglia area in the resulting binary image was determined using ImageJ’s Particle Analyzer macro. Area for all particles larger than 10 pixels was included in the quantification.</p> <p><italic>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, involvement of CB1 and CB2 receptors is tested with antagonists applied at 5 µM, which is 2 orders of magnitude higher than their respective potency at these target (and thus too high to leverage their selectivity). Testing the response obtained with lower concentrations of these antagonists would be more convincing and informative.</italic></p> <p>The reviewers are correct to point out that at 5 μM AM630 and rimonabant may not be completely selective for CB1 and CB2 receptors. We chose a somewhat high concentration of AM630 and rimonabant for this set of experiments to ensure complete blockade of any cannabinoid receptors potentially involved in microglial 2-AG signaling. Note also that both AM630 and rimonabant are often used in the low micromolar range in the cannabinoid research literature, thus while 5 μM is a high concentration for these inhibitors, it is not an unreasonable one. The following sentence has been added to the Discussion to address the reviewers’ concern: “Note also that, while our results indicate a role for ABHD12 in the modulation of microglia endocannabinoid signaling, our experiments do not discriminate the precise identity of the receptors involved. Whether CB<sub>1</sub>R, CB<sub>2</sub>R, or even other closely related receptors, control the observed ABHD12-regulated 2-AG effect on microglial ERK phosphorylation can be addressed in future studies using lower concentrations of selective CB<sub>1</sub>R and CB<sub>2</sub>R antagonists or microglia derived from knockout mice lacking these receptors.”</p></body> </sub-article></article>
