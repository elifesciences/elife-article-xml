As the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood, our study aimed to determine whether skeletal muscle myosin and its metabolic efficiency undergo alterations during hibernation to optimize energy utilization. We isolated muscle fibers from small hibernators, <italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic> and <italic>Eliomys quercinus</italic> and larger hibernators, <italic>Ursus arctos</italic> and <italic>Ursus americanus</italic>. We then conducted loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments alongside X-ray diffraction to measure resting myosin dynamics and its ATP demand. In parallel, we performed multiple proteomics analyses. Our results showed a preservation of myosin structure in <italic>U. arctos</italic> and <italic>U. americanus</italic> during hibernation, whilst in <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> and <italic>E. quercinus</italic>, changes in myosin metabolic states during torpor unexpectedly led to higher levels in energy expenditure of type II, fast-twitch muscle fibers at ambient lab temperatures (20 °C). Upon repeating loaded Mant-ATP chase experiments at 8 °C (near the body temperature of torpid animals), we found that myosin ATP consumption in type II muscle fibers was reduced by 77–107% during torpor compared to active periods. Additionally, we observed Myh2 hyper-phosphorylation during torpor in <italic>I. tridecemilineatus</italic>, which was predicted to stabilize the myosin molecule. This may act as a potential molecular mechanism mitigating myosin-associated increases in skeletal muscle energy expenditure during periods of torpor in response to cold exposure. Altogether, we demonstrate that resting myosin is altered in hibernating mammals, contributing to significant changes to the ATP consumption of skeletal muscle. Additionally, we observe that it is further altered in response to cold exposure and highlight myosin as a potentially contributor to skeletal muscle non-shivering thermogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many animals use hibernation as a tactic to survive harsh winters. During this dormant, inactive state, animals reduce or limit body processes, such as heart rate and body temperature, to minimise their energy use. To conserve energy during hibernation, animals can use different approaches. For example, garden dormice undergo periodic states of extremely low core temperatures (down to 4–8<sup>o</sup>C); whereas Eurasian brown bears see milder temperature drops (down to 23–25<sup>o</sup>C).</p><p>An important organ that changes during hibernation is skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle typically uses large amounts of energy, making up around 50% of body mass. To survive, hibernating animals must change how their skeletal muscle uses energy. Traditionally, active myosin – a protein found in muscles that helps muscles to contract – was thought to be responsible for most of the energy use by skeletal muscle. But, more recently, resting myosin has also been found to use energy when muscles are relaxed. Lewis et al. studied myosin and skeletal muscle energy use changes during hibernation and whether they could impact the metabolism of hibernating animals.</p><p>Lewis et al. assessed myosin changes in muscle samples from squirrels, dormice and bears during hibernation and during activity. Experiments showed changes in resting myosin in squirrels and dormice (whose temperature drops to 4–8<sup>o</sup>C during hibernation) but not in bears. Further analysis revealed that cooling samples from non-hibernating muscle to 4–8<sup>o</sup>C increased energy use in resting myosin, thereby generating heat. However, no increase in energy use was found after cooling hibernating muscle samples to 4–8<sup>o</sup>C. This suggest that resting myosin generates heat at cool temperatures – a mechanism that is switched off in hibernating animals to allow them to cool their body temperature.</p><p>These findings reveal key insights into how animals conserve energy during hibernation. In addition, the results show that myosin regulates energy use in skeletal muscles, which indicates myosin may be a potential drug target in metabolic diseases, such as obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ursus arctos</kwd><kwd>ursus americanus</kwd><kwd>ictidomys tridecemlineatus</kwd><kwd>eliomys quercinus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF20-0113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ochala</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF19SA0059305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ochala</surname><given-names>Julien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Norwegian Environment Agency and the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM130443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Drew</surname><given-names>Kelly</given-names></name><name><surname>Goropashnaya</surname><given-names>Anna V</given-names></name><name><surname>Fedorov</surname><given-names>Vadim B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (Canada)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Staples</surname><given-names>James F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During hibernation, animals remodel the structure of their relaxed muscle via a protein called myosin and this enables vast temperature changes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hibernation is an adaptive strategy employed by many animals aiming to decrease their metabolic rate and improve survival, particularly during harsh, winter conditions where food supply is limited, and thermogenic demands are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiser, 2013</xref>). During hibernation, mammals typically undergo a decrease in body temperature, heart, and breathing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Milsom and Jackson, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sprenger and Milsom, 2022</xref>). In so-called fat-storing hibernators, this is inherently accompanied by prolonged fasting and fatty acids become the main substrate for energy provision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Florant, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giroud et al., 2020</xref>). Besides these common features associated with overall metabolic depression, there are also significant inter-species differences in the underlying strategies. For instance, small (&lt;8 kg) fat-storing hibernating mammals such as 13-lined ground squirrels (<italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic>) or garden dormice (<italic>Eliomys quercinus</italic>) experience extended bouts of a hypo-metabolic state (torpor), punctuated by spontaneous periods of interbout euthermic arousals (IBA), during which metabolic activity transiently increases back to basal levels. During torpor, metabolic rate decreases below 5% of euthermic values and core body temperatures decrease from 35°C–38°C to 4°C–8°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sprenger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Haugg et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, either medium (10–20 kg, e.g. European badger, <italic>Meles meles</italic>) or large (&gt;20 kg, e.g. Eurasian brown bear, <italic>Ursus arctos</italic>, and American black bear, <italic>Ursus americanus</italic>) hibernating mammals exhibit a pronounced hypo-metabolic state (as low as 25% of their basal metabolic rate in the case of bears), but only experience a mild decline in body temperature (to 32–35°C depending on body size) that lasts for several winter months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geiser, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tøien et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans et al., 2023</xref>). While species-specific physiological patterns are well-documented, the molecular and cellular mechanisms operative in individual organs to achieve these remain largely undefined.</p><p>Skeletal muscle constitutes approximately 45–55% of body mass and serves as a major determinant of basal metabolic rate and heat production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zurlo et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sylow et al., 2021</xref>). Previous studies have uncovered some specific metabolic changes in skeletal muscle during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giroud et al., 2020</xref>). For example, a decrease in mitochondrial respiration, as well as a suppression of ATP production capacity, has previously been documented in skeletal muscles from <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> during torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">James et al., 2013</xref>). Previous work has demonstrated that ground squirrels require an optimal dietary ratio of monounsaturated to polyunsaturated fats, approximately 2:1, during their fat-storing period to facilitate effective hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frank and Storey, 1995</xref>). The proteome of <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> has then been shown to be enriched for fatty acid β-oxidation during periods of torpor. However, some reliance upon carbohydrate metabolism is maintained. The activity of phosphoglucomutase (PGM1) is even increased during torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hindle et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>U. arctos</italic>, skeletal muscle exhibits a transition from carbohydrate utilization to lipid metabolism, coupled with a reduction in whole-tissue ATP turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazarin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Muscle is organized into an array of fibers containing repeating sarcomeres, which are crucial for regulating not only contraction but also metabolism and thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>). Until recently, energy consumption in skeletal muscle was thought to be primarily linked to the activity of myosin during muscular contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, thermogenesis in skeletal muscle was previously attributed primarily to the electron transport system, in some cases link to uncoupling of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Periasamy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">González-Alonso et al., 2000</xref>). However, growing evidence that the sarcomeric metabolic rate and thermogenesis are also controlled by ‘relaxed’ myosin molecules is emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McNamara et al., 2015</xref>). Myosin heads in passive muscle (pCa &gt;8), can be in different resting metabolic states that maintain a basal level of ATP consumption. In the ‘disordered-relaxed’ (DRX) state, myosin heads are generally not bound to actin and structurally exist in a conformation (so-called ON state) where they primarily exist freely within the interfilamentous space in the sarcomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stewart et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grinzato et al., 2023</xref>). In the ‘super-relaxed’ (SRX) state, myosin heads adopt a structural conformation against the thick filament backbone (so-called OFF state; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hooijman et al., 2011</xref>). This conformation sterically inhibits the ATPase site on the myosin head, significantly reducing both ATP turnover in these molecules and, therefore heat production. The SRX state has an ATP turnover rate five to ten times lower than that of myosin heads in the DRX state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke, 2011</xref>). A 20% shift of myosin heads from SRX to DRX is predicted to increase whole-body energy expenditure by 16% and double skeletal muscle thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooke, 2011</xref>). What remains to be determined is whether, across mammals, increasing the proportions of myosin in the DRX or SRX states serves as a physiological molecular mechanism to fine-tune metabolic demands and thermogenesis. This includes potential contributions to whole-body metabolic depression observed during hibernation.</p><p>Hence, in the present study, we hypothesized that a remodeling of the proportions of myosin DRX and SRX conformations within skeletal muscles occurs and is a major suppressor of ATP/metabolic demand during hibernation. A recent study on <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> cardiac muscle supports this hypothesis, finding higher proportions of SRX during torpor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Toepfer et al., 2020</xref>).

We collected and analysed X-ray diffraction patterns of thin muscle strips in <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic>. The ratio of intensities between the 1,0 and 1,1 reflections (I<sub>1,1</sub> / I<sub>1,0</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) provides a quantification of myosin mass movement between thick and thin filaments. An increase in I<sub>1,1</sub> / I<sub>1,0</sub> reflects myosin head movement from thick to thin filaments, where increasing I<sub>1,1</sub> / I<sub>1,0 </sub> tracks myosin head movement from thick to thin filaments, signaling a transition from the OFF to ON state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Irving, 2022</xref>). 1,0 and 1,1 equatorial intensities were quantified and the intensity ratio (I<sub>1,1</sub> to I<sub>1,0</sub>) calculated. This intensity ratio was significantly lower in torpor compared to IBA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting more myosin heads are structurally OFF in torpor vs IBA. A reorientation of the myosin heads between OFF and ON states can also be captured by the M3 reflection along the meridional axis of diffraction patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The M3 spacing represents the average distance between myosin crowns along the thick filament. An increase in M3 spacing signifies a reorientation of myosin heads from the OFF towards the ON states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ma et al., 2018a</xref>). No differences were seen in M3 spacing or intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), indicating that the orientation of myosin crowns along the thick filament are similar across all conditions (SA, IBA and torpor).

Three specific residues had significantly greater levels of phosphorylation: threonine 1039 (Thr1039-P), serine 1240 (Ser1240-P), and serine 1300 (Ser1300-P). These PTMs lie within the coiled-coil region of the myosin filament backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>). To define whether they have functional implications during hibernation, we utilized EvoEF, an in silico programme which can characterize the effects of single amino acid residue substitutions on protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). For our analysis, we replaced the three native residues where PTMs were found by aspartic acid (Asp), which chemically resembles phosphothreonine (Thr-P) and phosphoserine (Ser-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haase et al., 2004</xref>). Thr1039Asp, Ser1240Asp, and Ser1300Asp had higher protein stabilities compared to Thr1039, Ser1240, and Ser1300, as attested by ΔΔG<sub>Stability</sub> values greater than zero (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Contrary to our hypothesis, our results indicate that during hibernation small mammals such as <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> or <italic>E. quercinus</italic> modulate their myosin metabolic states unexpectedly by increasing energy expenditure of sarcomeres at ambient temperatures. At 8 °C, muscle fibers from <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> obtained during SA and IBA phases displayed a significant rise in myosin-based ATP consumption. Conversely, fibers sampled during torpor bouts did not exhibit this cold-induced increase. These data suggest that small hibernators may stabilize myosin during torpor to prevent cold-induced increases in energy expenditure and thus increased heat production. Overall, our results also demonstrate a preferential adaptation of type II, fast-twitch, muscle fibers. Type II muscle fibers generally have more plasticity than type I, slow-twitch, fibers and have been demonstrated to undergo behavioral and fiber type transition in response to both metabolic and exercise stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qaisar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bourdeau Julien et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Plotkin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen and Aagaard, 2010</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Resting myosin conformation is unchanged during hibernation</title><p>In contrast to our study hypothesis, we demonstrated that the animals studied continue to maintain their active levels of myosin in the more metabolically active disordered-relaxed state (DRX) during periods of metabolic shutdown. This is of particular interest when compared to a previous study by Toepfer et al<italic>.,</italic> who observed that in cardiac muscle from <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> the percentage of myosin heads in the DRX conformation was lower in periods of torpor vs SA and IBA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Toepfer et al., 2020</xref>). Maintenance of the resting myosin conformation to active levels during hibernating periods may be to prevent the onset significant muscular atrophy during hibernation. Hibernating animals have evolved mechanisms that prevent skeletal muscle atrophy during the extended periods of immobilization inherent to hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hindle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyazaki et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miyazaki et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mugahid et al., 2019</xref>). Further research into changes to myosin head conformation in human atrophy and immobilization models would provide an interesting comparison to these data and potentially highlight resting myosin conformation as a novel target in the treatment of sarcopenia associated with aging and/or inactivity. It would furthermore ideally be possible to increase the biological sample size of all the species analysed in this study to further confirm the results which we report, particularly as modest differences are seen in the resting myosin conformation values of <italic>U. americanus</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Resting myosin ATP consumption is higher during hibernation in small mammals at ambient temperature</title><p>Our findings demonstrate that in small hibernators such as <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> and <italic>E. quercinus</italic>, the ATP turnover time of relaxed myosin molecules (in both DRX and SRX conformations) is faster during torpor (and IBA), especially in type II muscle fibers, leading to an unexpected overall increased ATP consumption. Accordingly, a few studies investigating human pathological conditions have reported disruptions of the myosin ATP turnover times in resting isolated skeletal myofibers, but their actual impacts have never been thoroughly investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lewis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Phung et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sonne et al., 2023</xref>). Here, originally, we estimated the consequences on the actual energy consumption of sarcomeres/muscle fibers. Our results of higher ATP consumption during torpor (and IBA) could, at first glance, be seen as counter-intuitive but is an indication of adaptation to the myosin protein during hibernating periods. It was therefore essential to investigate if these changes were also observed at a lower temperature, more relevant to the actual temperature of skeletal muscle in small hibernators during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Resting myosin ATP turnover time is protected from cold-induced change during torpor in <italic>Ictidomys Tridecemlineatus</italic></title><p>A critical difference between the large hibernators, <italic>U</italic>. arctos and <italic>U. americanus</italic>, and the small hibernators, <italic>E. quercinus</italic> and <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic>, during their hibernation periods is core body temperature. Whilst the large hibernators only undergo a modest temperature decrease during hibernation, small hibernators reduce their core body temperature drastically to between 4°C and 8°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sahdo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kisser and Goodwin, 2012</xref>). We repeated the Mant-ATP chase assays at 8 °C to mimic the environment of physiological torpor. Interestingly, lowering the temperature decreased DRX and SRX-linked ATP turnover times during active periods (in SA and IBA), especially in type II myofibers from <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic>, inducing an increase in ATP consumption. Metabolic organs such as skeletal muscle are well-known to increase core body temperature in response to significant cold exposure (i) by inducing rapid involuntary contractions known as shivering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haman and Blondin, 2017</xref>) or (ii) a process named non-shivering thermogenesis (NST). NST has traditionally been attributed to processes in brown adipose tissue, however, in recent years, skeletal muscle has also been shown to contribute to heat production via NST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Himms-Hagen, 1984</xref>). NST in skeletal muscle is stimulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-slippage by the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (SERCA) in a cascade of molecular events controlled by a protein called sarcolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Raimbault et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nowack et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bal and Periasamy, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>). Mammals have evolved a mechanism of resistance to ryanodine receptor (RyR) opening via rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup> to allow for Ca<sup>2+</sup> leak which is activated by cAMP via the β-adrenergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meizoso-Huesca et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Singh et al., 2023</xref>). This Ca<sup>2+</sup> slippage leads to the uncoupling of SERCA activity from Ca<sup>2+</sup> transport across the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Consequently, ATP hydrolysis does not fuel ion transport. Instead, the resultant ADP stimulates heat production via the mitochondrial electron transport system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maurya et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asahi et al., 2003</xref>). Here we propose that, in addition to SERCA, myosin also contributes to NST in small hibernators. Interestingly, our group has previously demonstrated that the resting myosin dynamics are altered in patients with RYR1 mutation-related myopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sonne et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Of potential further interest to the regulation of myosin would be the differential expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) during hibernation. Various HSPs have been observed to be differentially expressed during hibernation in mammals such as bears and bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thienel et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). This is of relevance to the data from our study as HSPs have been demonstrated to be able to bind sarcomeric proteins and regulate their turnover, including that of myosin itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glazier et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ojima et al., 2018</xref>). The proteins they have been shown to interact with include the cardiac isoform of myosin binding protein-C an important regulator of resting myosin conformation in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNamara et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>As the biopsies which were used in this study were all obtained from the hind leg of the animals studied, it is important to consider that the myosin dynamics may differ if these biopsies were sampled from different areas in the body. This is particularly important different areas of the body can have different core temperature and in some distal muscles, shivering does not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aydin et al., 2008</xref>). A study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aydin et al., 2008</xref>, demonstrated in mice that when a shivering muscle, soleus, was prevented from undergoing non-shivering thermogenesis via knock-out of UCP1 and were subsequently exposed to cold temperatures, the force production of these muscles was significantly reduced due to prolonged shivering. These results do suggest that even in shivering muscle, non-shivering thermogenesis plays a key role in the generation of heat for survival and for the maintenance of muscle performance. Further work examining potential differences in the resting myosin dynamics of muscles sampled from different sites of the body would be of importance to the field in the future.</p><p>Essential to our findings were the simultaneous observations that these cold induced changes in myosin ATP turnover times in each resting myosin state were not observed in <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> samples obtained during torpor. <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> and other similar small hibernators require a significant reduction in their body temperature to survive during winter periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cooper et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the inhibition of excess heat production via myosin ATP hydrolysis is likely a protective mechanism which has evolved to facilitate reductions in core body temperature and wider metabolic shutdown during torpor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Myh2 is hyper-phosphorylated during torpor increasing protein stability in <italic>Ictidomys tridecemlineatus</italic></title><p>The exact causes of all the above alterations remain unclear but may be linked to unusual PTMs directly targeting MyHCs.

This is consistent with our X-ray diffraction experiments where M6 spacing was found to be greater during torpor and is indicative of a unique structural configuration of the thick filament during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ma and Irving, 2022</xref>). Besides PTMs, another potential cause of the myosin metabolic remodeling may be changes to myofibrillar protein expression. Our global untargeted proteomics analysis reveals that <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> undergo a subtle reorganization in sarcomeric protein content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hindle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chazarin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Miyazaki et al., 2022</xref>). Our results are consistent with previous similar analysis on <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> from Hindle <italic>et. al.,</italic> who identified significant changes in carbohydrate metabolism but also changes in sarcomere and cytoskeletal organization in SA vs torpor muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hindle et al., 2011</xref>). In our analysis, we observed examples of type II muscle fiber specific proteins which were highly differentially expressed. ACTN3 (α-actinin-3), a type II fiber-specific molecule involved in linking adjacent sarcomeres, was notably downregulated during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wyckelsma et al., 2021</xref>). Its depression in mammals unexpectedly appears to confer superior cold resistance and heat generation in skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wyckelsma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pickering and Kiely, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clarkson et al., 2005</xref>). Another type II fiber-specific protein significantly downregulated in both torpor and IBA was MYBPC2 (fast skeletal myosin binding protein-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNamara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Its loss in skeletal mammals of rodents is thought to directly interfere with myosin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Song et al., 2021</xref>). Taken together, we believe that the aberrant PTMs and/or protein expression remodeling do play a role in modifying the myosin filament stability and this all may be triggered by the well-known decreased tension on sarcomeres during hibernation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Linari et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ma et al., 2018b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings suggest ATP turnover adaptations in DRX and SRX myosin states occur in small hibernators like <italic>I. tridecemlineatus</italic> during hibernation and cold exposure.

To this end, we first used ‘EvoEF <monospace>--command=RepairStructure</monospace>’ to repair clashes and torsional angles of the wild type structure. ‘EvoEF <monospace>--command=BuildMutant</monospace>’ is then used to mutate the repaired wild type structures into the mutant by changing the side chain amino acid type followed by a local side chain repacking. ‘EvoEF <monospace>--command=ComputeStability</monospace>’ is then applied to both the repair wild type and the mutant to calculate their respective stabilities (ΔGWT and ΔGmutant). The stability change upon mutation can then be derived by ΔΔG=ΔGmutant-ΔGWT. A ΔΔG below zero means that the mutation causes destabilization; otherwise, it induces stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pearce et al., 2019</xref>). The sequence of the MYH2 coiled-coil backbone was used for EvoEF stability calculations due to size limitations in the software when using the entire MYH2 protein sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as means ± standard deviations.

Multiple approaches were then used to identify the state of the contractile apparatus, and its energy expenditure under torpor or otherwise.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There was only one site of biopsy from the animals used (leg).

The study interrogates (primarily) permeabilized muscle strips or myofibrils using several state-of-the-art assays, including the mant-ATP assay to investigate ATP utilization of myosin, X-ray diffraction of muscles, proteomics studies, metabolic tests, and computational simulations. The overall data suggests that ATP utilization of myosin during hibernation is different than in active conditions.</p><p>A clear strength of this study is the use of multiple animals that utilize two different states of hibernation or torpor. Two large animal hibernators (Eurasian Brown Bear, American Black Bear) represent large animal hibernators that typically undergo a prolonged hibernation.

Here, in small mammals, the contractile apparatus of the muscle is shown to increase energy expenditure upon a drop in ambient temperature. Additionally, in the state of torpor, small hibernators did not show an increase in energy expenditure under the same challenge.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors have conducted a very well-planned study that has sampled the muscles of large and small hibernators from two continents. Multiple approaches were then used to identify the state of the contractile apparatus, and its energy expenditure under torpor or otherwise.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>There was only one site of biopsy from the animals used (leg). It would be interesting to know if non-shivering thermogenesis is something that is regionally different in the animal, given the core body and distal limbs have different temperatures.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their time and effort in reviewing our manuscript. Furthermore, we agree that it would be of interest to perform similar experiments upon different muscle sites in these animals. This is of particular interest as in some mammals, such as mice, distal limbs do not shiver and therefore non-shivering thermogenesis may play a more prominent role in heat regulation. A paper from Aydin et al., demonstrated that when shivering muscles (soleus) were prevented undergoing non-shivering thermogenesis via knock-out of UCP1 and were then exposed to cold temperatures, the force production of these muscles was significantly reduced due to prolonged shivering [1]. These results do suggest that even in shivering muscle, non-shivering thermogenesis plays a key role in the generation of heat for survival and for the maintenance of muscle performance. Furthermore, there is evidence from garden dormice that muscle temperature during torpor is slightly warmer than abdominal temperature and slighter cooler that heart temperature which is 7-8°C than abdominal suggesting the existence of non-shivering thermogenesis in skeletal and cardiac muscles (Giroud et al. in prep) [2]. We have added this information and reference into our discussion to reflect this important point (Discussion, paragraph 6, “As the biopsies which were used…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors utilized (permeabilized) fibers from muscle samples obtained from brown and black bears, squirrels, and Garden dormice, to provide interesting and valuable data regarding changes in myosin conformational states and energetics during hibernation and different types of activity in summer and winter. Assuming that myosin structure is similar between species then its role as a regulator of metabolism would be similar and not different, yet the data reveal some interesting and perplexing differences between the selected hibernating species.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The experiments on the permeabilized fibers are complementary, sophisticated, and well-performed, providing new information regarding the characteristics of skeletal muscle fibers between selected hibernating mammalian species under different conditions (summer, interarousal, and winter).</p><p>The studies involve complementary assessments of muscle fiber biochemistry, sarcomeric structure using X-ray diffraction, and proteomic analyses of posttranslational modifications.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>It would be helpful to put these findings on permeabilized fibers into context with the other anatomical/metabolic differences between the species to determine the relative contribution of myosin energetics (with these other contributors) to overall metabolism in these different species, including factors such as fat volume/distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the time and effort they have put into reviewing our paper and are grateful for the helpful suggestions which we believe, enhances our work (please see below for detailed answers to critics).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>Summary and strengths:</p><p>The manuscript, &quot;Remodelling of skeletal muscle myosin metabolic states in hibernating mammals&quot;, by Lewis et al, investigates whether myosin ATP activity may differ between states of hibernation and activity in both large and small mammals. The study interrogates (primarily) permeabilized muscle strips or myofibrils using several state-of-the-art assays, including the mant-ATP assay to investigate ATP utilization of myosin, X-ray diffraction of muscles, proteomics studies, metabolic tests, and computational simulations. The overall data suggests that ATP utilization of myosin during hibernation is different than in active conditions.</p><p>A clear strength of this study is the use of multiple animals that utilize two different states of hibernation or torpor. Two large animal hibernators (Eurasian Brown Bear, American Black Bear) represent large animal hibernators that typically undergo prolonged hibernation. Two small animal hibernators (Garden Dormouse, 13 Lined Ground Squirrel) undergo torpor with more substantial reductions in heart rate and body temperature, but whose torpor bouts are interrupted by short arousals that bring the animals back to near-summer-like metabolic conditions.</p><p>Especially interesting, the investigators analyze the impact that body temperature may have on myosin ATP utilization by performing assays at two different temperatures (8 and 20 degrees C, in 13 Lined Ground Squirrels).</p><p>The multiple assays utilized provide a more comprehensive set of methods with which to test their hypothesis that muscle myosins change their metabolic efficiency during hibernation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the effort and time they have put into carefully reviewing our manuscript and have taken on board their valuable suggestions to improve our manuscript (please see below for detailed answers to critics).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestions and potential weaknesses:</p><p>While the samples and assays provide a robust and comprehensive coverage of metabolic needs and testing, the data is less categorical. Some of these may be dependent on sample size or statistical analysis while others may be dependent on interpretation.</p><p>(1) Statistical Analysis</p><p>(1a) The results of this study often cannot be assessed properly due to a lack of clarity in the statistical tests.</p><p>For example, the results related to the large animal hibernators (Figure 1) do not describe the statistical test (in the text of the results, methods, or figure legends). (Similarly for figure 6 and Supplemental Figure 1). Further, it is not clear whether or when the analysis was performed with paired samples. As the methods described, it appears that the Eurasian Brown Bear data should be paired per animal.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these important points and have added information upon the statistical tests used where previously missing in each figure legend. Details on the statistical testing used for figure 6 are listed in the methods section, paragraph 18, “All statistical analysis of TMT derived protein expression data…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) The statistical methods state that non-parametric testing was utilized &quot;where data was unevenly distributed&quot;. Please clarify when this was used.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clariid all statistical tests used in the figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1c) While there are two different myosin isoforms, the isoform may be considered a factor. It is unclear why a one-way ANOVA is generally used for most of the mant-ATP chase data.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right, in our analysis, we haven’t considered ‘myosin isoforms’ as a factor. One of the main reasons for that is because we have decided to treat fibres expressing different myosin heavy chain isoforms as totally separated entities (not interconnected).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1d) While the technical replicates on studies such as the mant-ATP chase assay are well done, the total biological replicates are small. A consideration of the sample power should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, obtaining additional biological samples from these unique species is challenging. Hence, we have added a statement in the Discussion section. This statement focuses on the potential benefits of increasing sample size to increase statistical power Discussion, paragraph 2, “In contrast to our study hypothesis…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1e) An analysis of the biological vs statistical significance should be considered, especially for the mant-ATP chase data from the American Black Bear, where there appear to be shifts between the summer and winter data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is important to be careful when drawing conclusions from data only based on p-values. We agree that the modest differences observed in these data on American Black bear, whilst not significant, are worth noting and we have added these considerations into the manuscript (Discussion, paragraph 2, “In contrast to our study hypothesis…).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Consistency of DRX/SRX data.</p><p>(2a) The investigators performed both mant-ATP chase and x-ray diffraction studies to investigate whether myosin heads are in an &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot; state. The results of these two studies do not appear to be fully consistent with each other, which should not be a surprise. The recent work of Mohran et al (PMID 38103642) suggests that the mant-ATP-predicted SRX:DRX proportions are inconsistent with the position of the myosin heads. The discussion appears to lack a detailed assessment of this prior work and lack a substantive assessment contrasting the differing results of the two assays in the current study. i.e. why the current study's mant-ATP chase and x-ray diffraction results differ.</p></disp-quote><p>Prior works on skeletal muscle (observing discrepancies between Mant-ATP chase assay and X-ray diffraction) are rather scarce. Adding a comprehensive discussion about this may be beyond the scope of current study and would distract the reader from the main topic. For this reason, we have not added any section. Note that, we have other manuscripts in preparation that are specifically dedicated to the discrepancy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2b) The discussion of the current study's x-ray diffraction data relating to the I_1,1/I_1,0 ratio and how substantially different this is to the M6 results merits discussion. i.e. how can myosin both be more primed to contract during IBA versus torpor (according to intensity ratio), but also have less mass near the thick filament (M6).</p></disp-quote><p>The I1,1/I1,0 ratio indicates a subtle mass shift towards the myosin thick filament whilst the M6 spacing shows a more compliant thick filament. These results are not incompatible and rely on interpretation of the X-ray diffraction patterns. To avoid any confusion and avoid distracting the reader from the main topic, we have decided not to speculate there.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Possible interactions with Heat Shock Proteins</p><p>Heat Shock Proteins (HSPs), such as HSP70, have been shown to be differential during torpor vs active states. A brief search of HSP and myosin reveals HPSs related to thick filament assembly and Heat Shock Cognate 70 interacting with myosin binding protein C. Especially given the author's discussion of protein stability and the potential interaction with myosin binding protein C and the SRX state, the limitation of not assessing HSPs should be discussed. (While HSP's relation to thick filament assembly might conceivably modify the interpretation of the M3 x-ray diffraction results, this reviewer acknowledges that possibility as a leap.)</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an interesting and potentially important of the potential impact of HSP and their interaction with the thick filament during hibernation. We have added a section into the discussion of this manuscript regarding this, with particular impact upon the HSP70 acting as a chaperone for myosin binding protein, however we feel that it is important to point out that HSPs have only been shown to interact with MYBPC3, a cardiac isoform of this protein which is not present in skeletal muscle [3]. (Discussion, paragraph 5, “Of potential further interest to the regulation of myosin…”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the above substantial concerns/weaknesses, this reviewer believes that this manuscript represents a valuable data set.</p><p>Other comments related to interpretation:</p><p>(4) The authors briefly mention the study by Toepfer et al [Ref 25] and that it utilizes cardiac muscles. There would benefit from increased discussion regarding the possible differences in energetics between cardiac and skeletal muscle in these states.</p></disp-quote><p>As this manuscript focuses solely on skeletal muscle. We believe that introducing comparisons between cardiac and skeletal muscles would confuse the reader. These types of muscles have very different regulations of SRX/DRX as an example. Note that we are preparing a manuscript focusing on cardiac muscle and hibernation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The author's analysis of temperature is somewhat limited.</p><p>(5a) First, the authors use 20 degrees C (room temperature), not 37 degrees C, a more physiologic body temperature for large mammals. While it is true that limbs are likely at a lower temperature, 20 degrees C seems substantially outside of a normal range. Thus, temperature differences may have been minimized by the author's protocol.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agree that the experimental set up to perform these single fiber studies at slightly higher temperatures may have been more beneficial to replicate the physiological conditions of these hind leg muscle in the analyzed animals. However, previous work has shown that the resting myosin dynamics are in fact stable at temperatures between 20-30 degrees Celsius in type I, type II and cardiac mammalian muscle fibers [4].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5b) Second, the authors discuss the possibility of myosin contributing to non-shivering thermogenesis. The magnitude of this impact should be discussed. The suggestion of myosin ATP utilization also implies that there is some basal muscle tone (contraction), as the myosin ATPase utilizes ATP to release from actin, before binding and hydrolyzing again. Evidence of this tone should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is raising an interesting point and it would indeed be interesting to assess the magnitude of the impact and whether a basal muscle tone exists. Assessing the magnitude of the impact, is not an easy task and would require very advanced simulations which we are not experts in unfortunately. As for basal muscle tone, this is difficult to say as myosin is not actually binding to actin but hydrolyzing ATP at a faster pace during hibernation. We then think that the relation between our data and basal muscle tone is unclear. Hence, we have decided not to discuss these points in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>This is a very interesting paper. I have some minor suggestions to help improve it.</p><p>Is there any way to estimate the contribution of contractile apparatus to energy expenditure in reference to what is being generated at SERCA in the resting muscle under the various states examined?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting idea however, as far as we know, this would be challenging experimentally (in the hibernating mammals) and difficult to achieve in a reliable manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is important to emphasize that while BAT has been traditionally seen to be the site of NST, the skeletal muscle is very important, especially in large mammals, where BAT is going to be a very small % of the body and unlikely to be able to adequately provide heat. The addition of the contractile apparatus to SERCA as a heat generator at rest is very important -- also, the activation of ryanodine receptor Ca2+ to increase the local [Ca2+] at SERCA to generate heat has also recently been shown and should be mentioned (Meizoso-Huesca et al 2022, PNAS; Singh et al 2023, PNAS) alongside the work of Bal et al 2012 etc...</p></disp-quote><p>We have included these mechanisms and references into the manuscript discussion [5, 6]. Discussion, paragraph 4, “A critical difference between the large hibernators…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are you able to report the likely proportion of type II fibers in the muscles you have sampled?</p></disp-quote><p>The fiber type breakdown for all animals used in this study is reported in supplementary table 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sampling of muscle from the legs of live animals is sensible and convenient. Is it possible different muscles in the body have different levels of NST, changes in energy expenditure in torpor, and other states?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in the public review we have added to the discussion of this manuscript to reflect upon this important point of potentially different results from different muscle sites in these animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Is it likely that the proportion of fast and slow myosin-heavy chains within the selected sample of myofibers from the different mammals contributes to the overall differences in the energetics of different conformational states? In living animals, how does the relative contribution of the energetics from different muscle fiber types compare with the contribution from other organs to the overall regulation of metabolism during activities in summer, winter, or periods of intermittent arousal?</p></disp-quote><p>Fiber types in mammals can be vastly different between species as well as having a considerable amount of plasticity to change within each species upon specific stimuli. Furthermore, some mammals also have specific myosin heavy chain isoforms which have considerable expression, for example, myosin heavy chain 2B which is expressed in rodents such as mice but not larger mammals such as humans.</p><p>In the manuscript, we demonstrate that there is no significant change in the ATP usage by myosin in resting muscle in any of the species which we examined (Fig 1 F, L; Fig 2 E, J). The relatively high mitochondrial density of type I fibers when compared to type II fibers may contribute to a higher overall requirement of energy storage primarily via lipid oxidation. However, mitochondrial respiration is heavily suppressed during hibernation, so questions remain over the overall energy demand in hibernating muscle beyond myosin [7]. The fact that myosin ATP demand is relatively preserved in hibernating muscle suggests that skeletal muscle may be a relatively energy-demanding organ even during hibernation, we speculate in the manuscript this may be due to the requirement of maintaining muscular tone and function during this period of prolonged immobilization. This may be of relevance when one considers the almost complete shutdown of organs involved with food intake and breakdown such as the stomach and liver during hibernation. Furthermore, heart rate and breathing rates are vastly suppressed. Altogether, whilst is it difficult at this point to make an accurate estimate of energy demands between the different organs of hibernators, our data points to skeletal muscle to be a relatively high energy demand organ during these periods. When considering the difference between fiber type, again our data suggests that both type I and type II fibers have relatively similar energy demands during hibernation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The supplementary data are quite revealing as to how the myosin isoform composition is stable in some species but highly plastic in others in response to the same environmental/metabolic challenges. Why is the myosin heavy chain isoform (I and II) composition stable for brown bears but not for black bears between summer and winter? This is very interesting. For the Ground squirrel, there is remarkable plasticity between myosin heavy chain isoforms (I and II) between summer, interbout arousal, and torpor. Yet in the Garden Dormouse, the myosin heavy chain isoform (I and II) composition is stable between these three activity states. The inconsistencies between and within species are perplexing and worthy of closer interrogation.</p><p>The measurements and role of myosin energetics in different conformational states are interesting but need to be explained in context with other metabolic regulators for these hibernating mammals, especially because some species show remarkable plasticity whereas others show remarkable stability. For example, compare brown and black bears which show differences in the response of myosin composition the activity, interbout arousal, and torpor. Ground squirrels show remarkable plasticity in myosin isoform composition between activity states (and likely metabolic differences), but the Garden Dormouse has a remarkably stable myosin isoform composition during the three metabolic/environmental challenges. What mechanisms facilitate these modifications in some but not other mammals, even those of similar size? The differences are very interesting, worthy of follow-up, and may well contribute to further understanding the significance of the energetics of different myosin conformational states.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the changes seen between these species are very interesting and worthy of further investigation. What would be of further interest would be to look at methods which would allow for even deeper phenotyping, such as single fiber proteomics, to allow for the assessment of the percentage of hybrid fibers and fibers undergoing any fiber type switch during hibernating periods. Our results do observe a modest, albeit not significant, increase in the number of type I muscle fibers in 13-lined ground squirrels and Garden dormice during torpor which is consistent with previous studies[8]. Previous studies have demonstrated that lower temperatures may promote a shift towards more oxidative type I muscle fibers in mammals[9]. This could be an explanation for why we see this specifically in the smaller hibernators, however as we demonstrate and discuss, these lower temperatures are vital for the survival of these smaller mammals during hibernation so it would be inconsistent to hypothesize that these shifts are for heat-production purposes. Further studies are warranted to understand the relevance of these shifts further, particularly those with a higher sample size. It would also be on interest to examine fiber type percentages during the progression these long hibernating periods to observe if these changes are progressive.</p><p>As for the triggers and mechanisms which facilitate these changes to myosin dynamics, this is of current investigation by the field. One which may be of particular relevance to the changes seen during hibernation would that of steroid hormones previous research has demonstrated that steroid hormone levels in make and female bears change differentially[10]. This may be of relevance as the steroid hormone estradiol has been shown to slow the resting myosin ATP turnover via the binding of myosin RLC[11]. Considering these studies, future work which looks at hibernating animals of each sex as different groups may be fruitful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>i.
