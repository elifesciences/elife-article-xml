mammalian promoters are CpG islands; regions of high CG density that require protection from DNA methylation to be functional. Importantly, how sequence architecture mediates this unmethylated state remains unclear. To address this question in a comprehensive manner, we developed a method to interrogate methylation states of hundreds of sequence variants inserted at the same genomic site in mouse embryonic stem cells. Using this assay, we were able to quantify the contribution of various sequence motifs towards the resulting DNA methylation state. Modeling of this comprehensive dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of their unmethylated state. Instead, these data argue for a principal role for transcription factor binding sites, a prediction confirmed by testing synthetic mutant libraries. Taken together, these findings establish the hierarchy between the two <italic>cis</italic>-encoded mechanisms that define the DNA methylation state and thus the transcriptional competence of CpG islands.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04094.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04094.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04094.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Regions of DNA called genes produce the proteins and other molecules that are essential for life. The act of making these molecules is known as gene expression, and being able to switch this process on and off allows cells to adapt to changing conditions. For example, some genes may be turned on in response to injury or may only turn on during waking hours.</p><p>There are several ways gene expression can be switched on and off. Proteins called transcription factors can bind to DNA and act like a switch that affects nearby genes. Alternatively, special tags called methyl groups can attach to the ‘letters’ that make up the DNA code and turn off gene expression. However, it is not understood how these tags work with transcription factors and other forms of gene regulation.</p><p>Regions of DNA that boost the expression of a neighboring gene are called promoters. Many promoters in mammals contain repeating patterns of the DNA letters ‘C’ (which is a chemical called cytosine) and ‘G’ (guanine), and these regions are tagged less often than other regions of DNA. This led scientists to wonder whether the DNA sequence itself controls where the tags are placed, but existing experimental techniques made it difficult to establish if DNA sequence alone can prevent tagging.</p><p>Krebs et al. created a technique that allows thousands of different DNA sequences to be inserted into the same part of the genome of mouse stem cells. Comparing the tagging across these different sequences revealed that the CG pattern is not as closely associated with tagging as was thought. If the CG pattern is repeated many times it does seem to prevent tagging, but sequences with fewer repeats also sometimes escape tagging.</p><p>Krebs et al. found that a sequence was much less likely to be tagged if the nearby DNA also contains a site that transcription factors can bind to. However, regions with a very high number of CG repeats are able to avoid tagging without help from transcription factors.</p><p>Krebs et al. found that this behavior is not seen in cancer cells. DNA in cancer cells is heavily tagged, even in CG-rich regions, and transcription factors do not appear to play a major role in directing tagging. The new approach developed by Krebs et al. should benefit researchers working to understand the multiple mechanisms that control gene activity.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04094.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04094.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>high throughput genome editing</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>epigenetic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003043</institution-id><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long Term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krebs</surname><given-names>Arnaud R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004336</institution-id><institution>Novartis</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krebs</surname><given-names>Arnaud R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dessus-Babus</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><name><surname>Burger</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name><name><surname>Schübeler</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Union</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NoE ‘EpiGeneSys’ FP7-HEALTH-2010-257082, ‘CADMAD’ FP7-ICT-265505, ‘Blueprint’; FP7-282510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schübeler</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EpiGePlas</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schübeler</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss Initiative in Systems Biology (SystemsX.ch)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RTD Cell Plasticity</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krebs</surname><given-names>Arnaud R</given-names></name><name><surname>Dessus-Babus</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><name><surname>Burger</surname><given-names>Lukas</given-names></name><name><surname>Schübeler</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sinergia Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schübeler</surname><given-names>Dirk</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Large numbers of DNA sequence variants comprehensively define how transcription factor binding sites and CG density preserve mammalian promoters from repression by DNA methylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple levels of regulation control correct expression level of a gene. In addition to transcription factors (TF), epigenetic signals enable temporal integration of regulatory events through dynamic processes including cell division and organism development. Considerable progress has been made in mapping the occurrence of various epigenetic marks during the course of mammalian development. This has refined our picture of the spatio-temporal occurrence of epigenetic marks, yet our mechanistic understanding on how their deposition is regulated remains limited.</p><p>In mammals, methylation of DNA occurs mainly at cytosines lying in a CG context and its presence correlates with transcriptionally repressed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jones, 2012</xref>). Unmethylated CGs are concentrated in regions that are unusually rich in CG dinucleotides as compared to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird, 1980</xref>). The extrapolation of this observation led to the concept of CG islands (CGI), as an operational definition of regions that are likely unmethylated based on their sequence composition. Recently generated methylation maps at basepair resolution from several tissues and organisms have experimentally identified unmethylated regions at unprecedented detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ziller et al., 2013</xref>). These datasets revealed that many unmethylated regions (UMRs) extend far beyond the CGI definition and that CGI can show variable levels of methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meissner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, these studies identified CG poor regions outside of CGIs having low methylation levels (Low Methylated Regions–LMRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ziller et al., 2013</xref>). These findings challenged the notion that a simple sequence definition provides the most accurate prediction for the methylation state of a DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2013b</xref>) and motivated to derive improved models to predict CGIs that integrate multiple genomic features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wrzodek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed that contribute to an unmethylated state on the basis of their correlative occurrence with unmethylated regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Deaton and Bird, 2011</xref>). From sequence perspective, these include binding of unmethylated CGs by CXXC domain containing proteins, which have been proposed to inhibit or counteract methyltransferase activity directly or through the establishment of a specific chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ooi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cedar and Bergman, 2009</xref>). This model would predict that local CG content is the sole determinant of the unmethylated state. Recent experiments suggested that classical transcription factors that bind motifs more complex than CG generally promote a hypomethylated states within CG poor region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). Notably transcription factors have been previously implicated to impact activity but also methylation state of CGI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandeis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macleod et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>). Yet, it is inherently difficult to dissociate the effects of CGs and TF binding sites since both coincide at UMRs. Transgenic studies have argued that both local CG concentration and binding of transcription factors (TF) have a role in promoting low methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandeis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Macleod et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dickson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>). The cumbersome nature of targeted genetics in mammals limited the scale of these experiments preventing generalization of the observed effects as well their translation into predictive models. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that genetic information is necessary and sufficient to instruct methylation states, opening the possibility to study the regulation of methylation states through genetic perturbation.</p><p>However this requires a large number of sequence variations in order to be comprehensive, which is a general prerequisite and experimental bottleneck in the analysis of DNA sequence contribution to regulation of biological processes. In order to be informative, such experiments have to be performed in a controlled environment to minimize context related interference. Recently such approaches have been successfully developed to dissect the organization of cis-regulatory elements by generating large pools of sequence variants and measuring their effect on transcription using transient reporter gene assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patwardhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>). Such transient assays however are not suitable to study chromatin regulation, which requires stable genomic integration of the sequences of interest at the same chromosomal locus to account for influences of copy number and local chromatin environment.</p><p>To move beyond these limits, we developed an assay that allows parallel insertion of thousands of DNA fragments in a defined locus in murine embryonic stem cells (ESC). We isolated and synthesized various collections of DNA sequences in order to separately test the quantitative effect of sequence features proposed to influence methylation states. Parallel profiling of the methylation status of this catalogue of sequences allowed us to derive a comprehensive dataset that permits the systematic association between sequence motifs and methylation states. Using this information, we derive quantitative models describing the sequence determinants that govern the establishment of DNA methylation states. This surprisingly reveals that transcription factor binding sites are essential to explain the unmethylated state of the majority of CpG islands. We further demonstrate the utility of such datasets by explaining methylation changes observed in the course of normal differentiation. Moreover, we observe that deviation from the derived models is a characteristic hallmark of methylation changes associated with cancer states suggesting that this phenomenon is mechanistically distinct from differentiation related methylation changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Recombinase based targeting of DNA libraries in murine stem cells</title><p>In order to combine genomic targeting and high-throughput measurements, we developed a method that allows parallel insertion of hundreds of DNA fragments in a defined locus in murine ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Moreover CG content varies within individual regions that contain short stretches of differential CG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In order to ask how this local heterogeneity translates into an unmethylated state and if different mechanisms function in different parts of islands, we inserted fragments of CGIs to define their individual potency to regulate methylation and to potentially identify DNA sequence determinants of this regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To create libraries allowing the exploration of CG rich regions, we took advantage of our previously described murine ESC methylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>).

Subsequently the libraries were targeted into a defined genomic site in murine stem cells as described above. DNA extracted from the pool of cells after selection served as a template for PCR after bisulfite conversion using universal primer binding sites that flank all inserts. The resulting PCR products were analyzed by next generation sequencing resulting in high coverage methylation measurements for ∼30% of the initially inserted fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This translates into 100–600 fragments per transfection depending on initial library complexity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Density of CGs correlates with the ability of DNA fragments to recapitulate their methylation states</title><p>We initially inserted three independent libraries enriched for sequences from unmethylated CGIs. This resulted in high-resolution methylation measurements for ∼400 fragments with variable length (100–400 bp). The acquisition of methylation of fragments between different insertions was reproducible for most fragments between independent library insertions (R &gt; 0.6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next we compared the methylation state of fragments after insertion with that of the matching endogenous sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis reveals that the majority (63.5%) of tested sequences are methylated similarly to their endogenous counterparts despite the fact that they only represent short sub-fragments of CGIs. Interestingly, the length of individual fragments did not appear to be critical for this autonomy. For example, elements as small as 100 bp were found to be sufficient to establish an unmethylated state. However 40% of the inserted fragments gained methylation relative to their endogenous site. Surprisingly, this gain of methylation does not result in a completely hypermethylated state but covers a broad range in frequency from 20–100% despite the fact that these fragments originate from regions devoid of methylation. Thus, dividing unmethylated regions into shorter entities transforms a methylation frequency that is mostly binary in the genome to a continuous variable. Having derived this observation from a large pool of sequences opens the possibility to infer quantitative relationships between sequence composition and resulting methylation.</p><p>We initially assayed how much dinucleotide frequency could explain the observed differential methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In fact the frequency of CG explains only 14% of the observed variation (R = −0.37), suggesting that differences in CG density between fragments contribute to a certain extend to their differential methylation. A comparison of the average ectopic methylation for all fragments relative to their CG density reveals that at the upper end of CG densities (≥12CGs/100 bp) the inserted sequences tend to behave as the cognate endogenous sequence since they show little to no methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly however, at CG densities that are more representative for islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, upper panel), the methylation of endogenous and inserted fragments starts to significantly deviate. While some stay unmethylated, others gain methylation as indicated by the spread of methylation levels. This trend of increased methylation over a wide range becomes stronger with reduced CG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Thus at very high frequencies, CGs appear sufficient to explain an unmethylated state of small fragments after insertion, while at lower densities numerous fragments of similar CG density show highly variable methylation.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04094.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Systematic determination of the autonomy of DNA sequences to acquire DNA methylation patterns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of methylation levels of inserted fragments with their methylation at endogenous locus (n = 394; grey transparent dots).

In order to ask how the presence or absence of such motifs affects the methylation after insertion, we next introduced libraries of sequences with different CG densities derived from the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. This prokaryotic DNA is not under selection for binding sites for mammalian transcription factors, allowing us to measure the effect of CG density in an isolated context. The combination of two library designs, allowed us to measure a total of 183 prokaryotic sequences covering a broad range of CG densities. We compared their acquired methylation once inserted in the mouse genome in relation to their CG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similar to the inserted mouse fragments the unmethylated state can be observed at the highest CG densities (≥12CG/100 bp) consistent with previous observations that CG density can also protect prokaryotic sequences from de novo methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lienert et al., 2011</xref>). At a lower CG density however prokaryotic sequences get readily methylated, as revealed by higher average methylation and a significantly reduced spread compared to mouse fragments with similar CG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, we observe a much stronger negative correlation between CG density and methylation for these fragments than the mouse fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, R = 0.65). The reduced spread and the high number of fragments that cover a broad range of CG densities and methylation states enable us to model the relationship between CG frequency and methylation quantitatively in a sequence context where the influence of TF sequence motifs is limited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

By doing so we hope to subtract the effect of CG density on mouse fragments and furthermore isolate those that contain additional sequence cues that influence methylation. This comparison reveals that the ‘CG only’ model indeed has predictive power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, R = 0.38), however numerous mouse fragments are significantly less methylated than predicted based on their CG content, arguing that additional sequence cues contribute to their unmethylated state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Contribution of transcription factor binding</title><p>Next we wanted to ask if transcription factor binding could explain differential behavior of fragments with similar CG density. As an indirect indicator of transcription factor binding, we annotated the presence of DNaseI hypersensitive (DHS) sites in mouse ESCs at the endogenous loci from which the inserted fragments were derived (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Despite being predicted to be methylated based on their CG content, those fragments that are unmethylated indeed show significantly higher DHS enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In turn, this is compatible with the notion that TF binding motifs other than CG can contribute to the observed deviation from the CG only model.</p><p>To test this hypothesis we synthesized mutated sequences of mouse fragments that were identical in CG position and density but where all non-CG nucleotides are replaced by <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence in order to alter putative TF motifs. This assay was performed for fragments that we expect to have strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–1</xref>) as well as weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–2</xref>) protection based on their CG concentration. This reveals that those fragments for which we predict a minor role for CG density indeed display a strong shift in their methylation states while the ones where we predict CG density to have a major role only shift slightly. Thus the amplitude of methylation gain upon removal of TF binding sites is related to the CG density of the fragment, resembling the prediction from the CG only model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, R = 0.64). We conclude that in the absence of complex sequence motifs, methylation tends to approach the prediction of the ‘CG only’ model.</p><p>Next we asked whether insertion of TF binding motifs leads to reduced methylation in a CG rich context. We inserted both the perfect and the lowest score motif (with identical CG composition, see ‘Materials and methods’ for details) for the well-studied TF REST in an <italic>E. coli</italic> fragment that we previously observed to be fully methylated (from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Insertion of the high score motif leads to a loss of methylation while the low score motif has no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus as previously shown for CG poor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>), protein binding at regions with high CG densities contributes to a spatially constrained reduction of the methylation acquired by the inserted fragment.</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that mouse fragments derived from CG rich regions are maintained unmethylated by the combined action of two different mechanisms. This argues that while CG rich regions appear homogeneously unmethylated in the genome, they are maintained at this state by cumulative effects of CG density and sequence specific protein binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Modeling the relative importance of individual determinants</title><p>After assaying separately the contribution of CG dinucleotide frequency and the effect of TF binding, we tested the relative ability of each parameter to explain methylation patterns genome-wide.

Consistent with the results obtained with the inserted mouse fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), we found that considering only CG densities in the prediction overestimates the methylation levels for a large fraction of the CGs in the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.47, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In order to account for this effect, we attempted to define the quantitative relationship between protein binding and methylation by creating models that integrate the presence of DHS to predict hypomethylated regions. Such model indeed outperforms and complements a CG based model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It improves predictions for CGs residing in LMRs as well as UMRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which reinforces the idea that DNA binding factors significantly contribute to the existence of unmethylated states at CG rich regions. Combining CG and DHS into one model readily explains over two thirds (68% genome wide and 60% at CG rich regions) of the methylation variations observed in mESCs suggesting that CG density and TF binding are the major determinants of genomic methylation.</p><p>Similar modeling in different human methylomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Xie et al., 2013</xref>) revealed that these regulatory principles apply similarly in other somatic cell types and organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus information derived from inserting a large number of short sequences enables to model the methylation variation observed throughout mammalian genomes. It suggests that CG density and binding of proteins to more complex transcription factor motifs explain most regions with reduced methylation in the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>CG density defines methylation dynamics during cellular differentiation</title><p>Having established a predictive model consisting of two determinants to explain methylation states in mESCs, we wondered how effects driven by CG density or TF recruitments relate to the dynamics of DNA methylation observed during cellular differentiation. To do so, we compared the methylation prediction from the CG only model with the measured differences in methylation between murine stem cells and neuronal progenitors (NP). To better illustrate the influence of CG density on methylation changes, we contrasted CG rich unmethyated regions (UMRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), with CG poor low methylated regions (LMRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As a whole CG rich regions show little variation between both cell states in line with continuous hypomethylation of CGIs during cellular differentiation. This is in contrast to CG poor regions that experience extensive methylations changes across cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). However, detailed analysis within CG rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) identifies a subgroup of cytosines that show dynamics (primarily hypermethylation) in their methylation status during differentiation. Interestingly, cytosines that change their methylation status reside within fragments where a CG only model predicts a methylated state, and little changes are observed within regions where an unmethylated state is predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably the observed increased methylation during differentiation approaches the methylation state as predicted by the CG only model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). One likely explanation is that the unmethylated state of these sites depends on binding of TFs that are present in stem cells but not in the neuronal progenitors. Indeed, motifs for stem cell or neuron specific TFs are enriched around differentially methylated CGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example we observe a methylation increase in neuronal progenitors within CG rich regions at binding sites of the stem cell specific pluripotency factor Oct4 (Pou5f1), while regions bound by factors expressed in both cell types such as REST do not change their status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). This effect is reminiscent of the effect of sequence mutations that abolish TF recruitment within individual fragments shown above, resulting in increased methylation that follows the CG-only model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We conclude that variation in DNA methylation within subparts of islands is a function of TF binding and local CG density.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04094.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>CG concentration restricts the amplitude of methylation changes during cellular differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>B</bold>) Methylation gain during differentiation reaches a maximum that can be predicted by the local CG density of the region.

We observe that the methylation changes are tightly anti-correlated to DHS changes at CG poor regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, when DHS changes of similar amplitude are detected at higher CG densities, methylation levels do not change. This suggests that methylation levels at these regions are independent from the binding of TFs, and that a CG dependent mechanism is sufficient to explain their methylation.</p><p>These data are consistent with the model that TF binding contributes to the unmethylated state at CG poorer regions within CGIs, while TF binding is non-essential within highly CG rich regions of islands. We observe that, unlike the TF driven effect, the CG dependent effect is remarkably stable across cell types. One potential explanation is that the responsible trans-acting factors are widely expressed, as it is the case for some of the CXXC domain containing proteins, which are <italic>bona fide</italic> CG binders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long et al., 2013a</xref>). A direct consequence of this observation is that within islands, a subset of CGs embedded in short CG dense patches are unmethylated regardless of the binding by TFs in their neighborhood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly however, these patches are not essential to form unmethylated regions, as they are absent in 50% of all CGIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) and only contain 30% of all CGs within islands. They further do not show any particular positioning pattern within islands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This suggests that for the majority of CGs (67.5%) within islands TF binding could contribute to their unmethylated state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Cancer related hypermethylation is not restricted by CG density</title><p>Our data suggest that methylation dynamics observed within islands during differentiation are mostly the result of changes in the binding profiles of transcription factors. Additionally, we observed that the local concentration of CGs restricts the amplitude of these TF driven changes. Aberrant methylation, including hyper-methylation of CGIs is an established hallmark of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baylin and Jones, 2011</xref>). Since the origin and the regulation of these changes during transformation are largely unknown, we wondered how these changes relate to our model.</p><p>To this end, we contrasted the methylation gain at UMRs between human stem cells (hES) and normal colon cells and between normal colon and related cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2012</xref>). This reveals that normal colon cells show methylation changes that follow our model, while colon cancer cells display a distinct hyper-methylation phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). We observe a significant gain in methylation even at CGs that are constitutively unmethylated in normal tissues due to their high CG density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Interestingly, the same is observed when comparing a large set of healthy tissues and cancer types arguing that this is not unique to colon cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This argues that cancer hyper-methylation at islands is mechanistically distinct as it cannot be modeled with the same local determinant that describe methylation changes during normal development. Since both CG driven and TF mediated effects are affected this can unlikely be explained by alterations in transcription factor binding patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report a high-throughput genome engineering protocol and demonstrate its potential to determine the contribution of DNA sequence to the establishment of epigenetic states. We establish that DNA insertions at a given locus in mammalian genomes through RMCE can be performed with high complexity DNA libraries, opening the possibility to dissect regulatory mechanisms such as the ones that govern the establishment of DNA methylation patterns. In principle this approach can be adapted for any genomic readout (e.g. transcription or replication) in order to understand the interplay between multiple regulatory layers that function in <italic>cis.</italic> It further circumvents the limitations of previously used transient transfections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Melnikov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patwardhan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sharon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arnold et al., 2013</xref>), which lack a proper chromosomal context and are not controlled for amount of sequence variants per cell and their copy number.</p><p>We measured the ability of several thousand DNA sequence variants to acquire DNA methylation in mouse embryonic stem cells. The specific design and scale of the tested libraries enabled us to gain insights into the sequence determinants that drive the establishment of unmethylated states at CG rich regions and to build predictive models based on these methylation measurements and the underlying DNA sequence characteristics.</p><p>One of our key findings is the quantification of the effect of CG density on methylation states. Surprisingly, while we confirm that CG density is sufficient to create an unmethylated state, only every second island harbors sequence stretches above that threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combined, these CG rich stretches only cover 30% of the total number of CGs that reside in islands. Mechanistically, it remains to be determined how CG richness drives unmethylated states, yet several scenarios are compatible with our observations. Proteins that specifically recognize unmethylated CG via a CXXC domain could antagonize de novo DNA methylation as previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Long et al., 2013a</xref>). Alternatively, presence of dinucleotide concentrations such as CG stretches could alter nucleosomal organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brogaard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>) and thereby impact DNA methylation. Since, transcription factors and CG richness can both impact nucleosome positioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Struhl and Segal, 2013</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that nucleosome depletion could be a unifying principle underlying the formation of unmethylated regions.</p><p>Our data suggest that a key driver of hypomethylated states is the local binding of transcription factors. Others and we have recently shown that TF binding creates reduced methylation at CG poor regulatory regions such as tissue specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>), a finding that extends to CG rich regions. Their methylation however is less dynamic during cellular differentiation since most CGIs are constitutively active as promoters of housekeeping genes. Moreover the effect driven by CG density is stable across cell types restricting the amplitude of the changes. Our data argue that the higher the CG content, the lower the TF dependent changes in methylation and vice versa.</p><p>This scenario explains mechanistically why unmethylated regions frequently extend beyond CGI definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hodges et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2013b</xref>) and predict that the methylation changes at borders of CG rich regions (also referred to as CGI shores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doi et al., 2009</xref>)) are a function of TF binding. Importantly however the observed variability in methylation is not restricted to any particular location within CGIs but is only defined by local CG frequency. We believe it is important to account for this property when studying differential methylation patterns.</p><p>We identified a striking contrast in the type of CGs affected by methylation changes within CG rich regions during normal differentiation vs those that occur during transformation to a cancerous state. Notably it is not individual cytosines that are predictive for cancer, as these vary widely between types, but it is rather the class of CGs affected as defined by our CG density model. While the nature of this predictive difference remains unknown, we note that unlike methylation changes occurring during normal cellular changes, the loss of TF binding is unlikely to explain the observed differences. Hypermethylation in cancer particularly targets CGIs that control genes that are inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gebhard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sproul et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, the study of cancer methylomes revealed that hyper-methylated CGIs were embedded within larger domains of intermediate methylation (Partially Methylated Domains–PMDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hansen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2012</xref>). If CGI methylation changes within PMD's are a general phenomenon it might indicate that the observed changes at CGIs in cancer reflect the loss of the local sequence autonomy in determining correct DNA methylation.</p><p>The observation that TF binding contributes substantially to hypomethylation at CGIs has potential implications for their evolutionary origin as it is compatible with the idea that the emergence of CG rich regions could have occurred indirectly through TF-driven demethylation and resulting reduced C to T transition. This is in line with reports of limited positive selection for the CG content of islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Molaro et al., 2011</xref>) and that nucleotide composition including CG frequencies vary substantially between unmethylated regions across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2013b</xref>). Thus our findings support the notion that CGIs arose as an evolutionary footprint of ancient regulatory regions. Such scenario is still compatible with a subsequent specialization of proteins such as CFP1 or KDM2A to recognize unmethylated CGs by CXXC domains in order to target chromatin processes to regulatory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackledge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Thomson et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Library cloning</title><p>For targeted insertion, DNA libraries were cloned into a plasmid containing a multiple cloning site flanked by priming regions for a pair of universal primers and two inverted L1 <italic>Lox</italic> sites (pL1-LPP1-1L).</p><p>For constructing the mouse primary libraries, a set of enzymes was selected on the basis of a screen of all available CG methyl-sensitive enzymes (NEB - Ipswich, MA).

One of the reviewers had no suggestions for improvement. The Reviewing editor and other reviewer have made some suggestions for improvement and we would like you to modify the text of the manuscript accordingly.</p><p>1) The claims in the Abstract are a bit too general. “Modeling of this dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of the unmethylated state of CpG islands. Instead, these data identify a principal role for transcription factors, a prediction confirmed by testing synthetic mutant libraries.” The only TF tested in any detail is REST, with one Figure panel pertaining to Oct4 and no studies were done using protein binding or other functional assays, so it is based on presence of binding sites only. While DHS sites are also used, these are not only determined by TFs.</p><p>2) The authors make no mention of island length, which is also highly variable. Tested fragments that are much smaller than their host CGI might be expected to fail to recapitulate the methylation state of the whole island when moved to an ectopic location, as indeed they do. With regard to the model, an R2 value of 0.51 for the sigmoidal curve is not great and visual inspection would support this view, since the curve misses large clusters of points in <italic>E. coli</italic> (e.g. between 8-15 below 20% in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A steeper curve might fit better here and would also fit with biological observations (low CG density low meth and vice versa, with a steep transit in middle). It is perhaps not surprising then that many mouse fragments do not follow this model. I wouldn't agree that “the influence of TF sequence motifs is limited” in <italic>E. coli</italic> sequence: perhaps eukaryotic TFs, but the influence of prokaryotic TFs is still likely to be high.</p><p>3) Some of the interesting conclusions in the Discussion are not easy to relate to the data, e.g. “only every second island harbors stretches above the needed threshold...these only cover 30% of the total # CGs that reside in islands”: where do these figures come from? Or “the observed variability in methylation is not restricted to any particular location within CGIs”: the authors don't look at this effect across CGI in situ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04094.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The claims in the Abstract are a bit too general. “Modeling of this dataset revealed that CG density alone is a minor determinant of the unmethylated state of CpG islands.

While one cannot rule out that TF independent DHS signal exists, many lines of evidence argues that TF binding is a dominant component of the DHS. Nevertheless, we do agree that we do not test factors but rather the presence/absence of their binding sites. Thus we changed the Abstract to read “Instead, these data identify a principal role for transcription factor binding sites…” We hope this solves this point.</p><p><italic>2) The authors make no mention of island length, which is also highly variable.

While we do not provide a figure highlighting this point, this was stated in the original version of the manuscript: ‘…the length of individual fragments did not appear to be critical for this autonomy. For example, elements as small as 100bp were found to be sufficient to establish an unmethylated state.’</p><p><italic>With regard to the model, an R2 value of 0.51 for the sigmoidal curve is not great and visual inspection would support this view, since the curve misses large clusters of points in</italic> E. coli <italic>(e.g. between 8-15 below 20% in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3B</italic></xref><italic>).

We introduce the <italic>E. coli</italic> sequences in a mouse cell line were prokaryotic TFs are not present. Thus we think it is a fair assumption to state that influence of TFs is limited over those sequences.</p><p><italic>3) Some of the interesting conclusions in the Discussion are not easy to relate to the data, e.g. “only every second island harbors stretches above the needed threshold...these only cover 30% of the total # CGs that reside in islands”: where do these figures come from?
