Here, we show that macrophages, either treated with statin in vitro or from statin-treated mice, have reduced cholesterol levels and higher expression of <italic>Jmjd3</italic>, a H3K27me3 demethylase. We provide evidence that lowering cholesterol levels in macrophages suppresses the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane and changes the proton gradient in the mitochondria. This activates nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) and <italic>Jmjd3</italic> expression, which removes the repressive marker H3K27me3. Accordingly, the epigenome is altered by the cholesterol reduction. When subsequently challenged by the inflammatory stimulus lipopolysaccharide (M1), macrophages, either treated with statins in vitro or isolated from statin-fed mice, express lower levels proinflammatory cytokines than controls, while augmenting anti-inflammatory <italic>Il10</italic> expression. On the other hand, when macrophages are alternatively activated by IL-4 (M2), statins promote the expression of <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Ym1</italic>, and <italic>Mrc1</italic>. The enhanced expression is correlated with the statin-induced removal of H3K27me3 from these genes prior to activation. In addition, <italic>Jmjd3</italic> and its demethylase activity are necessary for cholesterol to modulate both M1 and M2 activation. We conclude that upregulation of <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is a key event for the anti-inflammatory function of statins on macrophages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>macrophages</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004411</institution-id><institution>Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G-19-0026359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zha</surname><given-names>Xiaohui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-180504</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dilworth</surname><given-names>Jeffrey F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL020948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McDonald</surname><given-names>Jeffrey</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Regional Government of Madrid</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2018/BAA-4403SINOXPHOS-CM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>López-Montero</surname><given-names>Iván</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic and biochemical analysis reveals that the anti-inflammatory effect of statins is due to decreasing cholesterol in macrophages and upregulating <italic>Jmjd3</italic> to achieve the anti-inflammatory action.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis, are associated with a low-grade level of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tabas and Glass, 2013</xref>). In atherosclerosis, macrophages are overloaded with cholesterol and are inflamed, which causes lesion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tabas and Lichtman, 2017</xref>). Statins, by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and upregulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression in hepatocytes and other cells, lower the level of circulating LDL. This leads to a decrease in the amount of cholesterol in peripheral tissues including macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levy et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hochgraf et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lijnen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parihar et al., 2014</xref>). Statins reduce inflammation, but the mechanism for this effect is yet to be defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Libby, 2021</xref>). Previously, we and others have observed that the level of cholesterol in resting macrophages, i.e., prior to stimulation, correlates directly with their pattern of inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yvan-Charvet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). For instance, when encountering lipopolysaccharides (LPS), cholesterol-rich macrophages release more inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-6, and IL12p40, and less anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, relative to control macrophages. Conversely, macrophages with reduced cholesterol content, such as those expressing ABCA1/G1 or being treated with statins, express fewer inflammatory cytokines, and more IL-10 upon identical LPS exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yvan-Charvet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). Noticeably, this association of cholesterol with specific type of macrophage inflammation is observed with multiple inflammatory stimuli, including ligands to TLR2, 3, 4, and other TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yvan-Charvet et al., 2008</xref>), implying a shared background in resting macrophages. It is known that, in order to mount a timely and vigorous defence against pathogens, macrophages activate several hundred genes immediately after sensing danger signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Raetz et al., 2006</xref>). This is achieved by employing a few select signal-dependent transcription factors, such as NF-κB, on a genome that is largely poised, i.e., epigenetically configured, prior the stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Link et al., 2015</xref>). The organization of the epigenome in macrophages is initially defined by lineage-determining transcription factors and subsequently by metabolic/environmental cues, including those experienced in the past (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Link et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Troutman et al., 2021</xref>). This forms a poised state in resting macrophages and allows the expression of context-dependent inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Spann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivashkiv, 2013</xref>). We therefore speculate that cholesterol levels may directly influence the epigenome in resting macrophages, thereby influencing the inflammatory phenotype upon activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reducing cholesterol levels in macrophages activates the NF-κB pathway and upregulates Jmjd3, a histone demethylase</title><p>To test whether cholesterol levels alone can produce factors that change the epigenetic configuration in macrophages, we first treated RAW macrophages with statins. Lovastatin, compactin, simvastatin, and pravastatin were used exchangeably throughout the study without significant differences in results. Cells were treated with statins for 2 days, reducing cellular cholesterol by about 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mayor et al., 1998</xref>). We also used methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) 1-hr treatment to acutely reduce cholesterol by a similar amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). This was to verify the cholesterol specificity of statins’ effects and also to provide a 1-hr protocol for inhibitor studies. RNA-seq was performed at the end of statin- or MCD-based treatments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, macrophages treated with statins altered the expression of a large number of genes (log<sub>2</sub> &gt;1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; the top 40 upregulated genes: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We applied the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to all differentially expressed genes (DEGs; up- and downregulation), using the Hallmark genes database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, b</xref>). Genes of the NF-κB pathway activated by TNFα were the most highly represented group upon statin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, b, c</xref>). Similarly, MCD-treated macrophages showed an identical, highly represented group, i.e., NF-κB pathway activated by TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The top 40 upregulated genes are in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. This analysis suggests that cholesterol depletion induces activation of NF-κB pathways in macrophages. Additional analysis, using a mouse transcriptional regulatory network database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), also identified the <italic>Nfkb1</italic> as the top transcription factor (TF) in the promoters of genes upregulated by statins or MCD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Genes downregulated by statins, on another hand, are less enriched in TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In fact, MCD treatment produced no enrichment of TFs among downregulated genes. Together, the RNA-sequencing data suggest that reducing cholesterol in macrophages primarily activates NF-κB pathways to enhance gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Satins upregulates the expression of <italic>Jmjd3</italic> in macrophages through NF-κB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Statins activate NF-κB pathways in RAW 264.7 cells.

Both statins and MCD enhanced <italic>Jmjd3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, b</xref>). This upregulation was abolished by several structurally unrelated NF-κB inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), confirming that <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is a NF-κB target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">De Santa et al., 2009</xref>). We further confirmed that JMJD3 protein level is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, d</xref>) and that the level of H3K27me3, the substrate of JMJD3, is reciprocally decreased in MCD-treated macrophages - with reduced cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, e</xref>). The elevated level of phosphorylated Creb (pCreb) is an indicator of effective cholesterol reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Similar results were seen in macrophages treated with statins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) responded to cholesterol reduction identically: <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is upregulated by statins or MCD in an NF-κB-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, a, b</xref>). Lastly, to verify the specificity of cholesterol in <italic>Jmjd3</italic> upregulation, MCD/cholesterol complex was used to replenish cellular cholesterol in MCD-treated BMDMs. This reversed the <italic>Jmjd3</italic> upregulation by cholesterol reduction in BMDMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, c</xref>).

We thus directly examined NF-κB activities in macrophages treated with statins or MCD. Using RAW-Blue cells containing an NF-κB reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2015</xref>), we observed elevated NF-κB activity when cells were treated with MCD or statins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, a, b</xref>).

Using the extracellular flux analyzer (Seahorse), we found that 1 hr MCD treatment of BMDMs decreased overall resting mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, a</xref>). Moreover, this decrease was entirely attributable to the suppression of the ATP synthase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, b</xref>), a protein embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) and a component of electron transport chain. Interestingly, the maximal respiration remains unchanged by MCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, c</xref>).

In mammalian cells, the majority of cholesterol is in the plasma membrane. However, all intracellular membranes, including those in the mitochondria, also contain cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steck and Lange, 2010</xref>). Cholesterol distribution among cellular membranes is governed by a dynamic steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lange and Steck, 2020</xref>), such that reduction in total cellular cholesterol content by statin or MCD will decrease cholesterol levels in all membranes, including those in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2009</xref>). Levels of IMM cholesterol can be assessed by the activity of an IMM enzyme, sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1), which catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-HC) as a function of cholesterol availability in IMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2006</xref>). The amount of 27-HC in macrophages thus directly reflects IMM cholesterol levels, if CYP27A1 remains constant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lange et al., 2009</xref>). We found that <italic>Cyp27a1</italic> levels are significantly reduced by 2-day statin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) but remain steady after 1-hr MCD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We thus analyzed 27-HC contents by mass spectrometry on MCD-treated macrophages to assess the cholesterol levels in IMM. We found that the amount of cellular 27-HC was decreased in a dose-dependent manner after a 1-hr MCD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating a reduction in cholesterol levels in IMM by MCD. Statins decrease total cholesterol content in macrophages similar to MCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2012</xref>), which should then similarly lower cholesterol levels in IMM, even though this particularly assay could not be applied due to the changes in <italic>Cyp27a1</italic> expression described above.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cholesterol levels modulate the mitochondrial ATP synthase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sterol 27-hydroxylase, <italic>Cyp27a1</italic>, expression in 1 hr methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD)-treated and control RAW macrophages.

Various levels of cholesterol can be incorporated into the IMVs to assess the impact of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mahammad and Parmryd, 2015b</xref>). With this system, we observed that the activity of the ATP synthase, both in synthesis and hydrolysis mode, is highly sensitive to cholesterol concentration in the membrane: the highest activity is found in IMV with membrane containing 7% cholesterol; decreasing cholesterol from 7% cholesterol suppresses ATP synthase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The steady-state IMM cholesterol level in mammalian cells is about 5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horvath and Daum, 2013</xref>). If MCD reduces cholesterol in IMM, as we show above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), ATP synthase activity should be suppressed, as we have seen in OCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, b</xref>).

As shown by extracellular flux analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), MCD suppresses the activity of ATP synthase.

However, if glutamine, the precursor of α-KG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), is absent in the medium, there is little change in the ratio of <italic>Il10</italic>/<italic>Tnfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, b</xref>, black bars), regardless of MCD concentration. Furthermore, if the demethylase activity of Jmjd3 is inhibited by a specific inhibitor GSKj4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kruidenier et al., 2012</xref>), the ratio of <italic>Il10</italic>/<italic>Tnfa</italic> also failed to rise upon MCD treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, c</xref>). BMDMs similarly modify their response upon glutamine availability. When stimulated by LPS, MCD-treated BMDMs rise <italic>Il10</italic>/<italic>Tnfa</italic> ratio, dependent on glutamine: <italic>Il10</italic>/<italic>Tnfa</italic> fails to increase by MCD in the absence of glutamine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, a</xref>). Glutamine is also necessary for MCD to boost IL-4-targeted <italic>Arg1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, b</xref>). We next used shRNA to knockdown <italic>Jmjd3</italic> (<italic>Jmjd3</italic> KD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>) and tested its impact on statin-treated macrophages.

Cholesterol reduction also modifies the epigenome in macrophages. Upon subsequent activation by either M1 or M2 stimuli, statin-treated macrophages are phenotypically more anti-inflammatory. This anti-inflammatory phenotype is also observed in peritoneal macrophages freshly isolated from statin-treated mice.</p><p>We speculate that <italic>Jmid3</italic> is the key responsible factor. Macrophages have two H3K27me3 demethylases, <italic>Utx</italic> and <italic>Jmjd3</italic>. Only <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is upregulated by statin or MCD. It is plausible that <italic>Jmjd3</italic>, by removing H3K27me3 from <italic>ll10</italic>, <italic>Arg1</italic>, <italic>Yam1</italic>, and <italic>Mrc1</italic>, poises these genes in resting macrophages to promote their activated expression. On the other hand, statins suppress a large group of proinflammatory genes activated by LPS, which could not directly be attributed to <italic>Jmjd3</italic>. However, <italic>Il10</italic> is poised by Jmjd3 and shows higher expression upon LPS stimulation. It could be that upregulation of <italic>Il10</italic> leads to the suppression of the proinflammatory phenotype under LPS activation. Recent studies have shown that endogenously produced IL-10, through autocrine/paracrine mechanisms, modulates mitochondria respiration to inhibit cellular events, such as glycolysis and mTORC1. This suppresses the expression of proinflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ip et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dowling et al., 2021</xref>). The elevated <italic>Il10</italic> expression in statin-/MCD-treated macrophages could play a similar role to suppress the proinflammatory phenotypes. Of note, this current study focuses mostly on the regulation of gene expression. The ultimate impact of statins on inflammation should be confirmed at the protein level in future studies.</p><p>We also document that reducing the level of macrophage cholesterol alters the epigenome, concurrent with <italic>Jmjd3</italic> upregulation. Removing H3K27me3 by JMJD3 could open certain genome regions and contribute to the changes in the epigenome seen in ATAC-seq. However, the changes we observed are much more profound, indicating that other epigenetic modifiers, are activated by cholesterol reduction. Future studies will be required to identify these modifiers. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence support the notion that <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is most relevant to inflammatory activation. First of all, only <italic>Jmjd3</italic>, among the members of the JmjC demethylase family, is upregulated by statin or MCD. <italic>Utx</italic>, also a H3K27me3 demethylase, is not altered by statin or MCD. Second, the JmjC demethylase family members require glutamine, the source of alpha-ketoglutarate, for demethylation. Since <italic>Jmjd3</italic> is the only upregulated demethylase, glutamine could be used to specifically probe <italic>Jmjd3</italic> demethylation function in macrophages M1/M2 activation. Glutamine is indeed necessary for MCD to modulate both LPS and IL-4 activation. Third, GSKj4, the inhibitor for H3K27me3 demethylases (Utx and Jmjd3), abolishes the MCD effect. Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Jmjd3</italic> by shRNA diminishes the effect of statins on LPS or IL-4 activations. Thus, the upregulation of <italic>Jmjd3</italic> by statin/MCD significantly contributes to poise the epigenome in resting macrophages, which controls the subsequent inflammatory response to LPS or IL-4.</p><p>Our results here support the notion that the epigenome in resting macrophages is largely poised for inflammatory activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Escoubet-Lozach et al., 2011</xref>). This also agrees with previous studies where cholesterol reduction was shown to decrease proinflammatory responses to multiple stimuli against multiple TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yvan-Charvet et al., 2008</xref>). We have focused on classically activated (M1) and alternatively activated (M2) phenotypes, two extremes of inflammatory activation in macrophages. This could be an experimental starting point, since macrophages likely encounter a wide range of stimuli within a continuum between M1 and M2 phenotypes. The poised epigenome in resting macrophages, i.e., prior to activation, may serve as an initial blueprint to propel the activated inflammatory responses. In addition, the inflammation processes are thought to initially engage the M1 phenotype to fight pathogens and then gradually gain the M2 phenotype to restrain excessive damage and restore tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ivashkiv, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Another novel finding here is that the level of cellular cholesterol directly controls mitochondria respiration. Except for specialized cell types (i.e., steroidogenic cells), the mitochondrial cholesterol in mammalian cells is in equilibrium with overall cellular cholesterol and, as such, fluctuates with cellular cholesterol through a dynamic steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steck and Lange, 2010</xref>). Our study here for the first time suggests the mitochondrial membrane as a locus sensing the cellular cholesterol level, which in turn contributes to the regulation of metabolic processes and gene expression. This is somewhat analogous to the regulation of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP) pathways by the cellular cholesterol level through the endoplasmic reticulum membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Goldstein, 1999</xref>). We speculate that the mitochondria likely function far beyond the traditionally called powerhouse that produces ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages are a major component in both the innate and adaptive immune systems. The anti-inflammatory effect of statins is essentially due to their primary pharmacological action discovered in 1970s, i.e., the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Endo et al., 1976</xref>), decreasing the level of circulating LDL and inhibiting de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the macrophages themselves. Macrophages with less cholesterol are anti-inflammatory, thereby contributing to the anti-inflammatory action of statins.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and chemicals</title><p>Cell culture Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) was purchased from Gibco (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Watham, MA).

The supernatant was separated from cell debris by centrifugation at 4°C for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. For detection, the cell supernatant and an SEAP detection reagent (QUANTI-Blue) were mixed and the absorbance was measured at 650 nm as described in the assay instructions.

Specially designed polystyrene tissue culture-treated 96-well microplates with a clear flat bottom (Seahorse XF96 V3 PS Cell Culture Microplates; Agilent Technologies) were then seeded with 80 µl of cell suspension (4.4 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml) per well and incubated 2–3 hr under cell culture conditions to allow cell attachment. For treatment with MCD, cells were washed with pre-warmed sterile PBS and the culture supernatants were replaced with medium containing MCD (5 mM). Then, the cells were incubated for 1 hr under cell culture conditions. For treatment with statins, cells were washed with pre-warmed sterile PBS and the culture supernatants were replaced with medium supplemented with lipoprotein-deficient serum, containing statins (7 mM lovastatin + 200 mM mevalonate). Then, the cells were incubated for 2 days under cell culture conditions.

OCR was measured to assess resting respiration, followed by ATP production-dependent respiration, maximal respiration, and non-mitochondrial oxygen consumption, after sequential injections of oligomycin (an ATP synthase inhibitor) at 1 µM (final concentration), CCCP (an ionophore acting as a proton uncoupler) at 2 µM, and rotenone together with antimycin A (complex I and III inhibitors, respectively), each at 0.5 µM. Mitochondrial ATP production-dependent respiration was calculated by subtracting the lowest OCR after oligomycin injection from resting OCR. For each parameter, OCR measurements were performed at least three times at 6-min intervals. Each condition was performed in 7–8 replicate samples. All OCR measurements were corrected for the OCR of cell-free wells containing only medium. Upon completion of the OCR measurements, the cells were washed once with PBS and lysed in 1 M NaOH (40 µl/well). The lysates were kept at 4°C for up to 24 hr, and protein determination was performed using the Bradford colorimetric assay with BSA as the standard protein (Thermo Scientific).

The RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data are presented in a very limited and superficial manner. Instead of showing only the inferred transcription factor binding sites, it would be helpful to first show the most upregulated and downregulated genes and gene expression pathways in the RNA-seq data. Similar in-depth analysis of the ATAC-seq data would be helpful, and further determination of concordance versus discordance between the RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. Importantly, as H3K27 methylation is a key part of the conclusions, it would be important to perform ChIP-seq for H3K27 methylation instead of selected PCR.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Satyajit Rath (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions that were requested during the last review have not been addressed. This includes some in vivo data to support the key claims of the work as well as a standard bioinformatic analysis which shows all the differentially expressed genes (top 25 or 50 can be shown in heatmaps, full table can be a supplement). The answers that were provided to the essential revisions do not adequately address the reviewer comments. The interpretations and conclusions of the manuscript do not match the data that are presented.</p><p>Please review the comments and essential revisions requested from the 1st review and also take into account the comments provided again below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are no in vivo studies in the revision even though demonstrating in vivo relevance of the findings would be essential to bolster the claims of the work. There are several animal models available in which statin efficacy has been demonstrated</p><p>See Pecoraro et al., 2014:</p><p>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/eci.12304</p><p>There are also classic review articles highlighting statin efficacy in mouse models:</p><p>https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/atvbaha.107.142570</p><p>In addition, non-rodent models such as rabbits are also an option.</p><p>2. The bioinformatic analysis does not show the various differentially regulated genes nor is there an in-depth analysis of the epigenetic data that was recommended as essential. In-depth analyses recommended listing all the differentially expressed genes – not just selected pathways via GSEA – for RNA, differentially accessible chromatin regions, etc. GSEA just gives a limited perspective and does not convey a sense of the overall data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed many of my concerns; however, I suggest they review their language closely in their manuscript one more time to make sure that they are pursuing conservative interpretations of their data without overclaiming.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the findings are potentially of interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readership, regrettably the revised manuscript and author responses fail to address the comments pointed out by this reviewer.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85964.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>RNA-seq data from statin- and MCD-treated macrophages was re-analyzed by unsupervised Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Figure 1 A &amp; B), which includes all differentially expressed genes, up and down, by cholesterol reduction. The conclusion is identical to the previous analysis, i.e. NF-κB is the top pathway activated by cholesterol reduction. The analysis in last version, which used a different program, is now moved to Supplementary Figure 1.</p><p>ATAC-seq data was similarly re-analyzed with GSEA (Figure 6 A). Again, NF-κB is the top pathway activated by cholesterol reduction (Figure 6 A, b). Examples of the lineups between ATAC-Seq peaks and RNA-seq peaks have been added (Figure 6 B).</p><p>RNA-seq data from LPS-stimulated macrophages with or without statins is also re-analyzed. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of genes showing decreased expression upon statin treatment revealed that statins primarily suppress inflammatory processes (Figure 7 A, b), while genes involved in cellular homeostatic functions were upregulated (Figure 7 A, <italic>c</italic>).</p><p>2) Mechanistic studies using more specific treatments such as genetic silencing of ATP synthase and JMJD3 (using siRNA, shRNA, or CRISPR with appropriate controls) and the use of additional NFKB inhibitors to ensure the specificity of the findings</p></disp-quote><p>Jmjd3</p><p>Jmjd3 was knocked down in macrophages by siRNA to &lt; 20% of the control value (Supplementary 7). The impact of the knockdown on the statin effect on LPS- or IL-4 stimulated gene expression was tested. The results are identical to that of the glutamine removal strategy (Figure 8 B, a and b). With Jmjd3 KD, statin could no long promote anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression and fail to raise the ratio of TNF-a/IL-10. At the same time, Arg1 expression, which was elevated by statin, remains the same in statin-treated macrophages (Figure 8 C, a and b).</p><p>Mitochondria ATP-synthase</p><p>We agree with reviewer that directly manipulating ATP synthase in the mitochondria would significantly reinforce our existing observations and conclusions. However, as we have observed OCR by Seahorse, MCD decreases ATP synthase activity by 20% in BMDMs (Figure 3). The quick recovery of activity by cholesterol repletion (Figure 1 D, c) was seen in the case of this degree of inhibition. This reversible perturbance is not likely to occur by silencing ATP synthase – genetic silencing ATP synthase was shown to cause severe mitochondria structure damages (Quintana-Cabrera R. et al. The cristae modulator Optic atrophy 1 requires mitochondrial ATP synthase oligomers to safeguard mitochondrial function. Nat Commun. 2018 Aug 24;9(1):3399).</p><p>Additional NFKB inhibitors</p><p>Two additional NF-κB inhibitors have been tested on MCD-induced Jmjd3 expression. Once again, NF-κB inhibitors completely abolished MCD-induced Jmjd3 expression (Supplementary Figure 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Demonstrate in vivo relevance of the observed statin effects in order to justify that this is indeed a mechanism by which statins can affect inflammation</p></disp-quote><p>To understand the function of statins in vivo, we need to go back to some of the basic cell biology and lipid regulation.</p><p>About 50% of the total body cholesterol is derived from de novo synthesis in humans. The primary site of endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis is the liver, where statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis as their primary pharmacological action. This blockade of cholesterol production in the liver activates a compensatory mechanism: the upregulation of hepatic LDL-receptors. The liver then increases LDL uptake from the circulation to acquire cholesterol, thereby lowering plasma LDL levels.</p><p>In addition, statins can decrease cholesterol content in extrahepatic tissues by two processes.</p><p>1) Lowering the circulating LDL by statins would decrease cholesterol content of peripheral tissues/cells <italic>--</italic> LDL has evolved to transport cholesterol (which is insoluble in plasma) to supply cholesterol to the peripheral tissues (Brown MS, Kovanen PT, Goldstein JL. Evolution of the LDL receptor concept-from cultured cells to intact animals. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1980; 348:48-6) The uptake of cholesterol into peripheral cells is through LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis. LDL receptors are widely expressed on the plasma membrane of nearly all peripheral tissues in animals, including blood immune cells (Kovanen PT, Basu SK, Goldstein JL, Brown MS. Low density lipoprotein receptors in bovine adrenal cortex. II. Low density lipoprotein binding to membranes prepared from fresh tissue. Endocrinology. 1979 Mar;104(3):610-6.)<bold>.</bold> Therefore, cholesterol content of peripheral cells is directly associated with circulating LDL levels.</p><p>2) Statins could directly act on the peripheral tissues to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis -- Statins taken orally reach the liver though the circulation, which inevitably results in significant concentrations of statins in the plasma. The pharmacological effects of statins on peripheral cells depend on the half-life and dosage of statins and also on hydrophobicity of statin varieties. Nevertheless, statins are extremely potent (Ki = 0.2 to 1 nM) (Endo A, Hasumi K. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Nat Prod Rep. 1993 Dec;10(6):541-50) and could significantly interfere with cholesterol synthesis in extrahepatic tissues. In addition, bone-marrow derived immune cells are highly proliferative and hence have a high demand for cholesterol, which makes them particularly susceptible to the inhibitory effects of statins. This is confirmed by studies that show that statins can inhibit cholesterol synthesis in circulating macrophages (Chow OA et al., Statins enhance formation of phagocyte extracellular traps. Cell Host Microbe. 2010 Nov 18;8(5):445-54).</p><p>We speculate that it is the reduction of cholesterol content in immune cells by statins that underlines the anti-inflammatory functions of statins. Thus, our in vitro studies reported here constitute an important first step and a proof-of-principle: lowering cholesterol content in macrophages leads to an anti-inflammatory state in macrophages.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the definitive test is an in vivo intervention with human subjects. For example, in matched individuals taking statin or not, macrophage/ cholesterol/Jmjd3 would be evaluated. Inflammatory responses to various stimuli would then follow. However, a clinical trial of this nature is beyond the scope of our current study. We hope that publishing the data in our manuscript will be a spark for readers to consider such in vivo studies as a future goal.</p><p>As for in vivo mouse models, the situation here is unique. Mice intrinsically have almost no LDL in the circulation and the major lipoprotein is HDL (unlike humans). In order to study the role of plasma cholesterol in atherosclerosis, applicable to humans, LDLr<sup>-/-</sup> or ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mouse models (apoE is an LDL associated protein and binds to LDLr to enable LDL uptake) were established. These mouse models have elevated levels of plasma LDL, similar to that in human, and have greatly contributed to our knowledge of atherosclerosis. However, statins could not be used in these mouse models to lower plasma cholesterol, since there is no LDLr nor apoE -mediated uptake of LDL at the liver in these animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide details on which statins were used, which concentrations, and treatment durations</p></disp-quote><p>Stains names, concentrations and treatment conditions are added in figure legends.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. in vivo treatment with statins (either humans or animal models) versus control, followed by isolation of macrophages to assess gene expression, mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial membrane composition would be important to support the core conclusions</p></disp-quote><p>See responses to Essential revision 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

This showed the NF-κB pathway is the dominant process activated by statin or MCD (Figure 1).</p><p>Similar GSEA on ATAC-seq gave identical conclusion (Figure 6 A), which is consistent with RNA-seq GSEA (Figure 1 B). The examples of IL-1b and TNF-a were added (Figure 6 B).</p><p>The current study focused on established anti-inflammatory genes, IL-10, Arg1, Ym1, and Mrc1. Their expressions are enhanced by statin. ChIP-PCR of H3K27me3 supplied a potential mechanism for this enhancement, which is sufficient at this stage of study. On another hand, ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 would provide genomic information of H3K27me3 distribution, including these mentioned above. It would be a big and complex undertaking and would also require RNA-seq of LPS and IL-4 RNA-seq to be meaningful. This is, in our opinion, beyond the scope of current study but in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

I hope the reviewer will agree they are good enough as is.</p><p>We are also not in a position to add data at the protein level. At this stage of our investigations, the mechanism we are examining is at the stage of regulation of gene expression. However, I agree with the reviewer this is a limitation and we have added a comment to the manuscript to state this (P8, line 10): “Of note, this current study focuses mostly on the regulation of gene expression. The ultimate impact of statins on inflammation should be extended and confirmed at protein level in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also don't really discuss the literature about cholesterol and the inflammasome which may be contributing to the results that they are seeing with IL1b.</p></disp-quote><p>In terms of cholesterol levels and the inflammasome, it appears that the inflammasome is activated by excess cholesterol, not by cholesterol reduction (PMID: 25614320). Also, inflammasome activation does not necessarily leads to IL1b expression, as recently reviewed by Tall et al. (PMID: 37228237). In addition, the magnitude of change in IL1b by MCD or statin is extremely low, compared with LPS (Figure 2B, b), suggesting a mechanism that is unrelated to inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several figures that don't convey a clear message. For example, the presentation of the omics results could be improved in order to better convey a strong message.

We showed that NF-κB is upstream of JMJD3 upregulation. NF-κB could alter epigenome, as has been well documented by other studies. Jmjd3, by removal of H3K27me3, should further alter ATAC -seq. Therefore, the change in ATAC-seq by cholesterol reduction is consistent with NF-κB activation and JMJD3 upregulation. This change prompted us to hypothesize that cholesterol reduction changes epigenome and poises genes for alternative expression when activated. We therefore investigated LPS and IL-4 stimulated gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All small molecule perturbation experiments would benefit from (1) controls to show that the drugs are not toxic at the concentration used and (2) evidence that these results are specific for the target of interest and not just wholesale altering gene expression across the transcriptome.</p></disp-quote><p>Toxicity tests have been added.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential revisions that were requested during the last review have not been addressed.

The bioinformatic analysis does not show the various differentially regulated genes nor is there an in-depth analysis of the epigenetic data that was recommended as essential. In-depth analyses recommended listing all the differentially expressed genes – not just selected pathways via GSEA – for RNA, differentially accessible chromatin regions, etc. GSEA just gives a limited perspective and does not convey a sense of the overall data.</p></disp-quote><p>Following data have been added to supplementary files:</p><p>Excel file of differentially regulated genes (RNA-seq) by statin: Supplementary file 1.</p><p>Excel file of differentially regulated genes (RNA-seq) by MCD: Supplementary file 2.</p><p>Excel file of genes with altered accessibilities to transposase (ATAC-seq) by MCD: Supplementary file 3.</p><p>List of genes shared in ATAC-seq (Supplementary file 2) and RNA-seq (Supplementary file 3): Supplementary file 4.</p><p>Excel file of differentially regulated genes (RNA-seq) in LPS and statin/LPS stimulated cells: Supplementary file 5.</p><p>In addition, the following has been added to supplementary figures:</p><p>Top 40 upregulated genes by statin: Figure 1—figure supplement 1, A, a.</p><p>Top 40 upregulated genes by MCD: Figure 1—figure supplement 1, A, b.</p><p>Genes down-regulated by statin or MCD are analyzed for TF enrichment: Figure 1—figure supplement 2, C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have addressed many of my concerns; however, I suggest they review their language closely in their manuscript one more time to make sure that they are pursuing conservative interpretations of their data without overclaiming.</p></disp-quote><p>Text is edited to be more conservative in interpretations of the data and restrain on speculations.
