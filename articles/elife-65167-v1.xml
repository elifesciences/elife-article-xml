An advantage of <italic>Drosophila</italic> is that it exemplifies a ground pattern organization that is largely consistent across hexapod lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li and Strausfeld, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sinakevitch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Groh and Rössler, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Montgomery and Ott, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Because of the importance of mushroom bodies in understanding the relevance of synaptic organization in sentience and cognition, recognizing evolutionary divergence of these centers would be expected to yield experimentally testable predictions about evolved modifications of circuitry in relation to ecological demands imposed on the species. However, insect mushroom bodies show a remarkably conserved organization, which makes them relatively unsuited for neuroevolutionary studies. There are some minor exceptions, to be sure: in honey bees and ants, calycal domains receive modality-specific afferents; in beetles, dietary generalists have more elaborate calyces than specialists; in aquatic beetles, a modality switch has replaced olfactory input with a visual input into the calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gronenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Farris and Schulmeister, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lin and Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). Less attention has been given to neural arrangements comprising the mushroom body lobes (columns), although some studies have addressed distinctions in basal groups such as silverfish (Zygentoma), dragonflies and mayflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The evolutionary stability of the insect mushroom body contrasts with the recent demonstration that mushroom bodies of malacostracan crustaceans have undergone substantial and often dramatic modification of the mandibulate (ancestral) mushroom body ground pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Stegner and Richter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Strausfeld et al., 2020</xref>). Whereas Stomatopoda (mantis shrimps), the sister group of Eumalacostraca, possesses mushroom bodies that correspond to those of insects, equipped with calyces from which arise prominent columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>), the trend over geological time has been a reduction of those columnar components such that the ancestral ground pattern organization of parallel fibers and orthogonal Hebbian networks has morphed to provide planar arrangements within domed centers lacking columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Strausfeld et al., 2020</xref>). These neuronal adaptations, nevertheless, share the property with insect mushroom bodies of being immunopositive to an antibody raised against the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, encoded by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene DC0, that is required for effective learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kalderon and Rubin, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Skoulakis et al., 1993</xref>). Antibodies raised against DC0 are reliable identifiers of neuropils mediating learning and memory in arthropods and other phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wolff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Whereas the evolutionary shift from columnar mushroom bodies to noncolumnar homologues is demonstrated across most decapod crustaceans, one lineage has until now defied unambiguous identification of a columnar or even a noncolumnar center. This is Brachyura, known in the vernacular as true crabs, here represented by <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic>. Brachyura is a comparatively young lineage, recognized from fossils dating from the mid-Jurassic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schweitzer and Feldmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guinot, 2019</xref>). Phylogenomics places the origin of Brachyura also as mid-to-late Jurassic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wolfe et al., 2019</xref>). Brachyura is the most species-rich decapod clade, comprising 6793 currently known species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ng et al., 2008</xref>). It is also a hugely successful lineage; extant species occupy benthic, littoral, estuarine, brackish, fresh water, terrestrial and even arboreal habitats. Many of these ecologies are defined by complex topographies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartnell, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Historically, identifying a mushroom body homologue in the crab’s brain has been problematic. Claims for homologous centers range from paired neuropils in the brain’s second segment, the deutocerebrum, later attributed to the olfactory system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bethe, 1897</xref>), to an insistence that the crab’s reniform body is a mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maza et al., 2021</xref>). Demonstrated 138 years ago in stomatopod crustaceans, the reniform body is a morphologically distinct center that coexists in the brain’s lateral protocerebrum adjacent to its columnar mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellonci, 1882</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thoen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Until the present, observations of the varunid shore crab <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic> have identified large anti-DC0-reactive domains occupying almost the entire rostral volume of its lateral protocerebrum but no evidence for mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thoen et al., 2020</xref>). The affinity of these domains to anti-DC0 suggested, however, a cognitive center far more expansive than found in any other arthropod of comparable size, with the possible exception of the domed mushroom body of the land hermit crab <italic>Coenobita clypeatus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wolff et al., 2012</xref>). Here we demonstrate that in the shore crab there are indeed paired mushroom bodies. But these have been ‘hiding in plain sight,’ having undergone an entirely unexpected neurological transformation that is opposite to the evolutionary trend toward a domed noncolumnar morphology shown in other lineages.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence at the level of neuronal arrangements showing that in the shore crab paired mushroom bodies have undergone an evolved transformation that is possibly unique to Arthropoda. They are inverted: their calyces reside deep within the lateral protocerebrum, a location allowing outward expansion of the mushroom body columns, which reach expanded cortex-like folds beneath the brain’s surface. The entire disposition of the shore crab’s mushroom bodies is opposite to that of any other crustacean, or insect, in which the calyces are situated under the rostral surface of the lateral protocerebrum with their columns extending downwards into deeper neuropil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Traits defining neuronal organization demonstrate that the mushroom bodies of Stomatopoda phenotypically correspond to those defining the mushroom bodies of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>). The following description uses complementary methods that resolve those traits in <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic>. Reduced silver staining demonstrates spatial arrangements of calycal and columnar neuropils and their detailed neuroarchitecture. Osmium-ethyl gallate treatment of intact brains resolves neuronal densities; and serial sections of these preparations provide the three-dimensional reconstructions shown throughout this account (see Materials and methods). Golgi mass-impregnations enable crucial insights into the exceptionally elaborate organization of mushroom body intrinsic neurons, identified as the phenotypic homologues of insect Kenyon cells. Immunohistology has been used to resolve DC0-immunopositive components of the mushroom body calyces and columns, and antibodies raised against GAD (glutamic acid decarboxylase) reveal putative levels of local inhibition. Antibodies raised against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5HT) demonstrate arborizations consistent with those of output and input neurons intersecting different levels of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and stomatopod mushroom body columns.</p><p>We show that despite the varunid mushroom body’s unparalleled intricacy and its unique transformation of the ancestral ground pattern, its defining traits nevertheless demonstrate phenotypic homology with the mushroom bodies of insects and those of other crustaceans. We close with a Discussion proposing that the evolution of such intricacy, and the expansion of the lateral protocerebrum to accommodate mushroom body enlargement, is likely to have contributed novel circuits and, ultimately, to cognitive flexibility permitting varunid Brachyura to exploit complex ecological topographies at the interface of marine and terrestrial biotopes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The Results are organized into eight sections, the first describing the overall location and structure of the varunid mushroom body. This is followed by the identification of its neural components and their arrangements as elaborate networks comprising the paired calyces. Descriptions of the internal organization of the calyces’ rostral extensions, and their two prominent columns, culminates with an explanation of the cortex-like organization of overlying gyri to which the columns project. The final observations address the relationship of the mushroom body to the reniform body, a center common to malacostracan crustaceans. To provide a three-dimensional understanding of this highly intricate system, descriptions refer to locations and arrangements within a reconstructed lateral protocerebrum and its major components (see Materials and methods).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The varunid lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>)</title><p>In crabs, as is typical of stomatopods and most decapod crustaceans, the most anterior part of its brain, the protocerebrum, is flanked each side by a lateral outgrowth that expands into an enlargement of the eyestalk immediately proximal to the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Its rostral domain (RLPR) includes the mushroom body calyces (Ca), columns (Clm) and their associated gyriform neuropils (Gy). Clusters of DC0-positive neuronal cell bodies (here DC0cb) are distributed over the neuropil. Distal volumes of the RLPR are associated with the reniform body (RB; here its pedestal and a gyrus RBGy), which is situated between the mushroom body and the optic lobe, here represented by its medulla (ME) and bilayered lobula (LO, LOi). The optic lobe provides outputs to discrete neuropils comprising the caudal lateral protocerebrum (CLPR).

The rostral lateral protocerebrum (RLPR), once referred to as the terminal medulla, a now defunct term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Strausfeld, 2020</xref>), is dominated by two centers: the mushroom bodies and the smaller reniform body. There are a small number of other satellite neuropils near the origin of the eyestalk nerve. The mushroom body is immediately recognizable by its intensely osmiophilic calyces from which arise columns that extend outwards, branching into a cortex-like neuropil composed of gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). These occupy the outermost volume of the RLPR. The reniform body comprises an independent system of interconnected neuropils situated laterally constrained to a volume of the RLPR that extends from its dorsal to its ventral surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thoen et al., 2020</xref>).

The eyestalk nerve also carries other efferent axons to the lateral protocerebrum: these include relay neurons from other sensory neuropils, relays from the opposite lateral protocerebrum and optic lobes, and interneurons relaying from various midbrain neuropils.</p><p>The caudal volume of the lateral protocerebrum (CLPR) is mainly associated with outputs from the optic lobe neuropils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Most of these originate from the lobula, each bundle of outgoing axons representing a population of one of the numerous morphological types of columnar neurons. Bundles segregate to a system of interconnected neuropils called optic glomeruli, as occurs in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Okamura and Strausfeld, 2007</xref>). Further relays from the glomeruli send information centrally to the midbrain via the eyestalk nerve. The nerve also carries to the midbrain the axons of efferent neurons from the lateral protocerebrum’s rostral neuropil, from the mushroom bodies and their associated gyri and from CLPR neuropils associated with the optic glomeruli.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Organization of DC0-positive volumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>)</title><p>Densely osmiophilic calyces and their extended columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) correspond to discrete neuropils showing high levels of immunoreactivity to antibodies raised against DC0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Each morphological type is defined by the patterning of its initial branches from its globuli cell neurite and the subsequent reticular trajectories made by their tributaries down to the details of their final specializations. The latter indicate points of functional connection and are morphologically comparable to the claws, clasps, and dendritic spines that decorate the dendritic branches of Kenyon cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Strausfeld and Li, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>) and the dendrites of homologous intrinsic neurons in the mushroom bodies of marine hermit crabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Strausfeld and Sayre, 2020</xref>). As in those taxa, in the varunid calyx these specializations invariably relate to the distribution and patterning of its microglomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Microglomeruli revealed by reduced silver beautifully match the size and mosaic arrangement of microglomeruli resolved by their intense immunoreactivity to antibodies raised against DC0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The bundled branches of intrinsic neurons resolved by antibodies against α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>) further resolve microglomeruli as participants of an elaborate organization of orthogonal networks that correspond to distinct morphological types of intrinsic neurons revealed as single cells by Golgi-impregnation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Each microglomerulus signifies the site of an incoming terminal’s presynaptic bouton or varicosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Combined anti-synapsin immunoreactivity and F-actin labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>) further demonstrates the profusion of postsynaptic sites belonging to intrinsic neurons that converge at each microglomerulus. The densely packed presynaptic specializations further confirm the status of a microglomerulus as the site of massive transfer of information from presynaptic terminals onto many postsynaptic channels.</p><p>As remarked, the shapes and arrangements of intrinsic neurons and their synaptic specializations contribute to orthogonal networks in the calyces and define calycal domains. However, the domains are not arranged as neatly adjacent territories as in the insect calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gronenberg, 2001</xref>). Instead, the varunid calyx can reveal domains that extend vertically or horizontally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), or comprise unexpectedly elaborate arrangements that are understood only after they are matched to an appropriately oriented osmium-ethyl gallate section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). One of the most challenging of these arrangements consists of a population of intrinsic neurons defining a cylindrical domain that splays out as it extends toward the proximal margin of the lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The entire ensemble comprises densely branched narrow-field arborizations that surround the initial branches of a subset of globuli cell neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C,D</xref>). The core leads to a terminal expansion that is confluent with the base of one of the two large columns that extends to the overlying gyri. Serial reduced-silver sections reveal this as originating only from calyx 2, indicating that calyx 2 differs from calyx 1 with regard to at least one population of intrinsic neurons. As in many insect lineages where there are paired calyces, it is such subtle distinctions that demonstrate disparate organization across paired calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Farris and Strausfeld, 2003</xref>). Reduced-silver stains showing axon tracts reveal inputs to calyx 2 originating from a tract that recruits its axons from the reniform body and the medulla. Collaterals from this tract spread into a deep level of calyx 2 neuropil where they spread across microglomeruli bordering one side of the incoming neurites from the globuli cell tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The correspondence of this arrangement with insect calyces is considered in the Discussion.</p><p>There is one critical exception to the generalization that calycal subdivisions are denoted by different types of intrinsic neurons. The exception is that there is a system of neurons that arborizes uniformly throughout both calyces. These arborizations belong to GAD-immunoreactive local processes originating from a dorsal cluster of large cell bodies, each of which provides an anaxonal field that arborizes throughout both calyces, and into each of its domains. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). These densely packed processes are exceptional in that they do not obey the orthogonal leitmotif of the calyx, as revealed by anti-α-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>), nor do they reflect the mosaic arrangement of microglomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>). Instead, anti-GAD-immunoreactive branchlets populate all the calycal domains and do so in great numbers, the totality suggesting that local inhibitory elements are distributed amongst all intrinsic cell processes irrespective of whether they are in immediate proximity to or distant from a microglomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Evidence for local inhibition in the calyx by anaxonal neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A total of 40–50 large perikarya situated rostrally above the gyri are immunoreactive to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), as shown in the right inset.

This ambiguity is seconded in brains treated with osmium-ethyl gallate, which show lateral protocerebral neuropil supplied by globuli cell neurites gradually fading from black to gray, signifying decreasing densities of neuronal membrane, finally giving way to the uniformly pale aspect of the overlying gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D,E</xref>). 3D reconstructions of the dark volumes show a layered arrangement at deeper layers of the calyces changing to a more corrugated appearance, particularly at its outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Silver impregnations show that the base and some of the initial length of a column are clearly reticulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, these are not microglomeruli. Double Golgi impregnation shows that these networks receive contributions from two sources: the extensions of axon-like processes from intrinsic neuron fields in the calyx; and intrinsic arborizations, many extremely complicated, that originate from thin neurites, presumed to belong to globuli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). An additional system of networks extends outwards to flank each calyx’s column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These finger-like extensions originate from a tangle of processes situated at a deeper level of the calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) that does not reflect any relationships with microglomeruli. The likely origin of this system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) is not from globuli cells but from a small cluster of cell bodies, some DC0-immunoreactive, situated caudally close to the inner margin of the lobula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We interpret this tangle of processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>) as belonging to interstitial local interneurons providing elements to the columns at a level limited to their emergence from the calyces. The topology of these arrangements, including the small column-specific intrinsic arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E–K</xref>) is reminiscent of interstitial neurons interposed between the calyces and pedunculus of the honeybee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Origin of calycal extensions and columns.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anti-α−tubulin (cyan) reveals the organization of large fiber bundles and coarse neuropil but, at low magnification, shows neuropils of the calyces as almost featureless.

Serial sections resolve the uneven rostral border of the calyces and the two columns reaching outwards toward the overlying gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). The series also demonstrates the agreement between how silver and osmium-ethyl gallate resolve the origins of the columns from the two calyces. These aspects emphasize that the seemingly irregular morphology of the rostral part of the calyces is not irregular by happenstance but is a defining feature of the lateral protocerebrum.</p><p>Reduced silver preparations demonstrate that a column is subdivided into parallel components as in insect mushroom bodies, where each subdivision has a distinctive arrangement of intrinsic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sjöholm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>) and is defined by distinctive patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yang et al., 1995</xref>). What is unexpected is the degree of elaboration observed in the varunid mushroom body. Golgi impregnations demonstrate that, compared with other pancrustaceans, mushroom bodies in a crab are stunningly complex with regard to both their calyces and columns. The varunid’s columns consist of parallel intrinsic cell fibers that are almost obscured by numerous other arrangements, the variety of which is compatible with the variety of their morphological fields in the calyces. A silver-stained column originating from calyx 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) and one revealed by mass Golgi impregnation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>) both suggest longitudinal subdivisions of the columns. Golgi impregnations resolve discrete and complicated systems of processes, some providing bridgelike connections across them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>), others having irregular branches, lateral prolongations, and bundled parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E,F</xref>). In addition, larger dendrite-like elements arising from stout processes within the columns suggest that those processes may provide outputs to the overlying gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,F</xref>), a feature to which we return in Section 7.</p><p>Golgi impregnation has its own peculiar limitations: it is stochastic, revealing probably less than 1% of the total population of neurons, even after double impregnation. Nevertheless, mass impregnation further suggests that the columns from the two calyces are not identical. Although networks of intrinsic cells in both columns receive terminals from branches of the olfactory globular tract, there are clear differences between the columns from calyx 1 and calyx 2. Column 2 is broader and more difficult to discern in reduced silver, in part because its intrinsic processes are extremely thin, many less than a micron in diameter (see section Transitions to gyri below). At first sight, the organization of processes comprising column 2 appears to be chaotic. However, closer inspection reveals subsets of different arrangements of its dendrites and collaterals disposed across its width and at different levels along it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). Reciprocal channels to the column from the gyri are suggested by the presence of descending axons flanking the column, providing varicose collaterals into it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These varieties of columnar arrangements are further considered in the Discussion.</p><p>Fields of 5HT- and TH-immunoreactive dendrites extend across columns. Here we show fields relating to column 1 from calyx 1 that provide clear resolution of their arrangements from the calycal origin to the interface with gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Fields are arranged at specific levels along the column, and they intersect different domains across the column, as occurs across the parallel subdivisions of the columns (lobes) of mushroom bodies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nässel and Elekes, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamanaka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Tedjakumala et al., 2017</xref>). The first of these fields occurs at the origin of the column from the calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,B</xref>) above where the neat orthogonal arrangements seen at deeper levels give way to the first appearance of looser arrangements, including parallel fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C,F</xref>). Anti-5HT- and anti-TH-immunoreactive fields are clearly segregated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and D</xref>) at or near the column origin but begin to overlap at more rostral levels closer to the gyri, at locations where osmium-ethyl gallate preparations show the columns branching, with tributaries extending to overlying gyri. At those levels, immunoreactive processes appear to spread laterally into the gyri themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G,H</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>5HT and TH immunoreactivity resolve different levels in the calyx 1 column.</title><p>Looking downwards through the rostral surface of the LPR, this sequence of confocal slices (<bold>A,D,E,G,H</bold>) starts at the column’s origin from calyx 1 (panel <bold>A</bold>) then follows its outward passage rostrally to the level at which the column merges with the overlying gyri (panels <bold>G</bold>, <bold>H</bold>).

Although stochastically impregnated, the abundance and variety of these neurons suggests the gyri contain dense arrangements of efferent (output) and local interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1D–I</xref>). Golgi impregnations reveal swathes of axons extending across the gyri, suggesting lateral interactions amongst them. Oblique palisades of dendritic trees, which have branching patterns peculiarly reminiscent of vertebrate pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), send axons to fascicles that extend to the midbrain via the eyestalk nerve.</p><p>Like deeper levels of the lateral protocerebrum, gyri comprising this superficial level of the lateral protocerebrum are supplied by terminals of afferent neurons, the axons of which radiate out from the eyestalk nerve. Many of these terminals originate from discrete fascicles that comprise the olfactory globular tract, denoting not only their identity as axons of projection neurons from the olfactory lobes but suggesting that different classes of projection neurons comprise different fascicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D,E</xref>). The terminals of projection neurons are denoted by their swollen boutons, the different morphologies of which are distinctive. For example, terminals spreading out over the surface of gyrus 1, belonging to calyx 1, have rough ball-shaped profiles that are distinct from larger smooth boutons from extremely slender axons supplying the proximal gyrus (pGy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B,E</xref>). That gyrus’s large allatostatin-immunoreactive processes and the paucity, even absence, of GAD-immunoreactive networks suggests its complete independence from the mushroom body’s organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>).

However, despite the dark staining by osmium that suggests a well-defined transition between columns and gyri, neither silver staining nor Golgi impregnations provide a sharply defined inner margin of a gyrus or an obvious termination of the column. Here we consider neural arrangements that denote the ambiguity of the interface between the mushroom body’s columns and their corresponding gyri.</p><p>Tangential sections across the gyri demonstrate novel and as yet puzzling aspects of their composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). One is the presence of dendritic trees, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>, here represented by a neuron, the axon of which joins with others extending to the lateral protocerebral root of the eyestalk nerve. Its dendrites overlap elaborate networks of finely branching processes that terminate in small bead-like swellings suggestive of presynaptic specializations. This network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>) derives from extremely thin processes that ascend into the gyrus from outward extensions of the calyx (lower bracket in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Further examples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>) show that the dendrites of a gyrus's efferent neurons overlap other arrangements of putative ascending presynaptic fields. In this example, the fields do not appear to be part of an intervening synaptic network, but instead their disposition with the efferent dendritic trees suggests that they likely terminate there (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>). In addition, highly restricted systems of mixed spiny and beaded arborizations suggest local anaxonal neurons that may provide synaptic interfaces between such terminal systems arising from the columns and the dendrites of gyral efferent neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D,E</xref>). Evidence that arborizations predominantly equipped with presynaptic specializations likely originate from the calyces is indicated by densely packed elements situated distally in the columns.

Reduced silver preparations show that tracts from caudal neuropil associated with the optic lobe extend rostrally to the superficial levels of a gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12—figure supplement 1D</xref>), yet another indication of the complexity of organization and its multimodal nature at all levels of the mushroom body and its gyri. The possible significance of this is considered below in the Discussion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The reniform body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>)</title><p>We have shown that the lateral protocerebrum is divided into a rostral and caudal part (RLPR and CLPR), the former containing the paired mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies are not, however, the sole components of the RLPR. The gyrus nearest the RLPR’s junction with the eyestalk nerve, termed the proximal gyrus (pGy), is distinct and probably to some degree functionally separate from the gyri associated with the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>). In addition, another prominent system of circumscribed neuropils is situated near the lateral border of the RLPR, arising from a dorsal group of relatively small perikarya almost adjacent to the optic lobes. These neuropils comprise the reniform body, a center identified in stomatopods by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bellonci, 1882</xref>, who distinguished it from the very prominent mushroom bodies in that taxon. The same center has been described in detail in the stomatopods <italic>Neogonodactylus oerstedii</italic>, <italic>Gonodactylus smithii</italic>, and <italic>G. chiragra</italic>, and the carideans <italic>Lebbeus groenlandicus</italic> and <italic>Alpheus bellulus.</italic> In all these species, the reniform body has the same morphology: a densely populated bundle of axons, referred to as the pedestal, extends from the dorsal surface of the RLPR to its ventral surface, providing four discrete neuropils called the initial (dorsal), lateral, and the ventrally situated proximal and distal zones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thoen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Strausfeld et al., 2020</xref>). In all the cited taxa, the reniform body is situated between the columnar mushroom body and the lobula.</p><p>Precisely the same placement is observed in the varunid lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). The reniform body occupies a location lateral to the ensembles of neurons that constitute the mushroom body gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref>). Reconstructed from serial osmium-ethyl gallate sections, the reniform body’s pedestal lies immediately above, that is, rostral to, the two tracts of neurites from the globuli cell cluster (the globuli cell tract) that provide intrinsic neurons to the mushroom body calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13C</xref>). In <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic>, the reniform body pedestal extends from a cluster of cell bodies at the dorsal surface of the lateral protocerebrum and extends almost to the lateral protocerebrum’s ventral surface, bifurcating into two main tributaries about half way along its length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13F</xref>). These give rise to the lateral, distal and proximal zones, each zone composed of substantial volumes of arborizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13D</xref>). The reniform body is thus entirely distinct from the mushroom bodies and is situated distally with respect to their centrally disposed calyces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13E</xref>). The reniform body’s thick pedestal, albeit columnar in form, is distinct from a mushroom body column in that its constituent axons are naked, lacking spines or other specializations that define a mushroom body. The reniform body’s four zones of branching collaterals contribute to structures reminiscent of microglomeruli. However, they are of larger girth, and synapsin-actin labeling shows them to have significantly fewer converging presynaptic elements than a calycal microglomerulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Despite these clear differences from the mushroom body, the reniform body is strongly immunoreactive to anti-DC0, showing that it too is a learning and memory center, as proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maza et al., 2016</xref>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Disposition of the reniform body.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) 3D reconstruction of gyri from osmium-ethyl gallate specimens identifies their 2:1 relationship with the paired calyces.

Recent comparisons of the brains of reptantian decapods have confirmed that its lineages share the evolutionary trend of reduction and loss of the mushroom body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>). Those mushroom bodies nevertheless retain most elements of ancestral networks: diffusely arranged in Axiidea, Astacidea, and Achelata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>), but precisely stratified in terrestrial and marine Anomura (hermit crabs: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harzsch and Hansson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wolff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Ocypodidae (fiddler crabs) and Varunidae (shore crabs), two lineages of Brachyura (true crabs), do not conform to this trend. As demonstrated previously and again here, large DC0-positive domains cover much of the varunid lateral protocerebrum, suggesting relatively large (for an arthropod) learning and memory neuropils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Strausfeld et al., 2020</xref>). The proposition that the reniform body is the crab’s mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maza et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maza et al., 2021</xref>) is refuted by Golgi impregnations and 3D reconstructions of the lateral protocerebrum demonstrating the reniform body as entirely distinct from the huge DC0-positive mushroom body adjacent to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Similarity, conjunction, and congruence are established criteria for assessing phenotypic homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Patterson, 1988</xref>). In all the lineages where reniform bodies have been identified these criteria exclude it as mushroom body homologue.</p><p>That the brachyuran mushroom body has until now remained unrecognized can be attributed to its unexpected and radical reorganization. Even its population of conservatively estimated 22,000 densely packed globuli cells is not where it would be expected to be. Based on observations of other pancrustaceans, the expectation is that globuli cells are clustered over the rostral surface of the lateral protocerebrum, close to where it joins the eyestalk nerve (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>). But in <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic> the globuli cell cluster is sandwiched between the lobula and the lateral protocerebrum. As in the shore crab <italic>Carcinus maenas</italic>, where new neurons are generated lifelong in the antennular lobes and lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schmidt, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen and Schmidt, 2001</xref>), osmium-ethyl gallate histology on <italic>H. nudus</italic> indicates that new globuli cells also continue to proliferate, as do neurons supplying the reniform body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maza et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the unique disposition of the globuli cells, the reorganization has inverted the entire mushroom body such that its two voluminous calyces are deeply buried in the rostral domain of the lateral protocerebrum where they receive inputs from the deutocerebrum’s olfactory lobes and the protocerebrum’s optic lobes.</p><p>We show here that each calyx gives rise to a large column extending outwards and merging with broad overlying gyri that form the rostral surface of the lateral protocerebrum. The gyri are pillowed into folds and sulci thus forming a cortex-like architecture. This system receives additional afferent supply and gives rise to ensembles of pyramidal cell-like efferent neurons, the axons of which extend to the eyestalk nerve. Throughout this massive structure, the mushroom body and its gyri are strongly immunoreactive to antibodies raised against DC0.</p><p>Although the crab mushroom body appears vastly different from the right-way-up ‘traditional’ insect or stomatopod homologue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>), it nevertheless shares their defining traits. For example, intrinsic neurons originating from globuli cells contribute to the brachyuran calyces and columns, as do the Kenyon cells of an insect mushroom body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14A,B</xref>). As in stomatopods, shrimps, and insects, the axon-like processes of intrinsic cells are clustered in their respective fascicles, as they are in any one of the longitudinal divisions of the insect mushroom body columns, where short intermingling collaterals can provide orthogonal connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sjöholm et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Strausfeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). Other longitudinal divisions of the varunid mushroom body column are populated by intrinsic processes that interweave to provide rectilinearity, as they do in one of the two mushroom body columns of the shrimp <italic>Lebbeus groenlandicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>), or in the stratified dome-like mushroom body of hermit crabs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolff and Strausfeld, 2015</xref>). We show here that true crabs express the whole panoply of intrinsic cell arrangements. These include segregated and intermingling ‘parallel fibers’ as in Stomatopoda or the core lobe (column) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Strausfeld et al., 2003</xref>); rectilinear networks that extend part way into a column from the calyx; dense arrangements of intrinsic processes extending across the columns comparable to certain neurons populating the mushroom body column in honey bees or crickets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamanaka and Mizunami, 2019</xref>); and arrangements comparable to the longitudinal laminations of the mushroom body lobes (columns) of Dictyoptera and Lepidoptera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sinakevitch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sjöholm et al., 2005</xref>). In short, the crab mushroom body column appears to embody all known arrangements across Pancrustacea. If each arrangement of a specific type of intrinsic neurons represents a distinct computational property, as suggested from studies of honeybees and fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Perisse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Traniello et al., 2019</xref>), then the crab would appear to be singularly well-equipped. The same applies to its calycal arrangements, which in <italic>H. nudus</italic> are elaborate and discretely partitioned into territories denoted by different morphologies of intrinsic neurons and afferents. This zonal organization corresponds to the more compact and highly ordered modality-specific domains typifying hymenopteran calyces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gronenberg, 2001</xref>), and, to a lesser extent, <italic>Drosophila</italic> calyces as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yagi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2020a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Mushroom body inversion and gyriform organization.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Schematics of corresponding neuron ground patterns.

This doubling of the calyx has many precedents. In the stomatopod lateral protocerebrum there are four adjacent columns, each associated with a distinct ensemble of globuli cells and hence a calyx. That organization has been compared to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body, which is a composite neuropil of four hemi-mushroom bodies derived from four clonal lineages, as it is in the honey bee (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ito et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Farris et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, the mushroom bodies in an insect’s lateral protocerebrum are paired but completely fused. The varunid has two calyces in immediate contact, but not quite fused as no intrinsic neuron has been seen that extends its field of processes into both. Only one calyx (Ca2) appears to receive input from a tract of axons carrying relays from the medulla and from the reniform body. Such an asymmetric input to twin calyces is not unique: a comparable arrangement is found in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body, where visual inputs terminate in an ‘accessory calyx’ attached to one side of the fused calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vogt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2020b</xref>). A similar arrangement involving visual inputs has been described from the swallowtail butterfly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kinoshita et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Of particular note is the extensive organization of GAD-immunoreactive arborizations that extend into every domain of the <italic>H. nudus</italic> calyces. These provide dense systems of minute processes, the dispositions of which would allow synaptic contact with every neuronal process supplying a microglomerulus. Accepting that varunid intrinsic neurons correspond to insect Kenyon cells, these GAD-immunoreactive systems suggest correspondence with wide-field anaxonal inhibitory neurons that extend throughout the <italic>Drosophila</italic> calyx (‘APL neurons’: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, such putatively inhibitory anaxonal neurons in the crab suggest a global role in local synaptic inhibition at microglomeruli. Arrangements of aminergic neurons in the calyces and columns further correspond to mushroom body input and output neurons recognized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Owald et al., 2015</xref>). It is also notable that highly localized and densely branching TH- and 5HT-immunoreactive neurons occur at different levels of the crab’s calyces. These correspond to similar dispositions of immunoreactive neurons in the layered calyces of columnar mushroom bodies, including those of stomatopods and shrimps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>). Neurons in the <italic>Hemigrapsus</italic> mushroom body having the same immunoreactive signatures are associated with columns, from their origin at the calyces out to the level of their ‘fuzzy’ interface with gyri and also in the gyri.

As described above, there is no obvious terminus of a mushroom body column: its efferent neurons merge with systems of local interneurons in the gyri and, with these local interneurons, they extend amongst the dendrites of efferent neurons that leave the gyri. If these arrangements do not correspond to organization in other pancrustaceans and mandibulates, then what developmental events might have given rise to such a departure from the reptantian ground pattern?</p><p>Three developmental studies on the malacostracan lateral protocerebrum should be noted. Two demonstrate early stages of the formation of the larval lateral protocerebrum, in which there is not yet evidence for morphogenetic reorganization in what will become the lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harzsch and Dawirs, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sintoni et al., 2007</xref>). The third demonstrates that massive reorganization and new generation of neuropils can accompany late development in the pelagic larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin and Cronin, 2018</xref>). All of those authors have indicated that crustaceans can undergo radical metamorphosis during the change from a pelagic larva to a preadult, the larval stage providing pools of neural precursor cells for subsequent development. Those precursors would likely contribute not only to the formation and differentiation of adult centers in the lateral protocerebrum but also to any taxon-specific morphogenic rearrangements.</p><p>Might the relationship of the insect mushroom body with the rest of the brain suggest an origin for the gyri? In insects, many of the mushroom body efferent neurons terminate in neuropils of the superior medial protocerebrum (honeybee: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Strausfeld, 2002</xref>; cockroach: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li and Strausfeld, 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li and Strausfeld, 1999</xref>; <italic>Drosophila</italic>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ito et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). This is the most rostral part of the forebrain in insects, comprising dense networks of local interneurons that are interposed between the terminals of mushroom body outputs and the dendrites of interneurons whose axons terminate in successive strata of the central complex’s fan-shaped body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Phillips-Portillo and Strausfeld, 2012</xref>). A comparable arrangement in crustaceans with eyestalks requires that efferent neurons (particularly TH-immunoreactive MBONs) from the mushroom bodies extend axons from that distant origin into the midbrain’s superior protocerebrum. These connections are suggested by silver-stained brains of <italic>H. nudus</italic> showing numerous axons from the eyestalk nerve directly targeting the medial protocerebrum. This speaks against the gyri being medial neuropils displaced distally.</p><p>One possible interpretation of the gyri is that they represent enormously expanded versions of tubercles, swollen ends of a column typifying mushroom bodies of certain caridid shrimps (in Stenopodidae and Thoridae: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sayre and Strausfeld, 2019</xref>) and insects (Zygentoma, Ephemeroptera: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Farris, 2005</xref>). Tubercles of caridid (or insect) mushroom bodies are compact, comprising tangled extensions of intrinsic neuron processes associated with a concentrated system of TH- and 5HT-immunoreactive processes intersecting that level of the column. Those arrangements are absent from gyri. Although there are TH- and 5HT-immunoreactive fields in gyri, these do not appear to interact with intrinsic fibers in the columns. Nevertheless, that gyri are as strongly DC0-immunoreactive as the calyces and columns suggests that they play crucial roles in memory acquisition and, or, maintenance. There is one gyrus (pGy), however, that is not obviously DC0-immunoreactive and is quite distinct from the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A,B,F</xref>). This gyrus is situated most proximally, near the entry of the olfactory globular tract into the lateral protocerebrum from the eye stalk nerve. It is denoted by its association with allatostatin-positive processes. Its afferent supply suggests a role in olfaction, but its sensory associations and roles in behavior await functional studies.</p><p>Far more elaborated than a tubercle, gyri comprise many morphologically distinct types of neurons, including efferents of unknown antigenicity. The presence in gyri of local interneurons and rectilinear networks further indicates an identity that is indirectly associated with the mushroom body. A clue is suggested by other Reptantia, in which certain mushroom body outputs target neuropils at deep levels of the lateral protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mellon et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mellon et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKinzie et al., 2003</xref>). If these less well-studied neuropils became inverted, they would overlie the inverted brachyuran mushroom bodies as do the gyri (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14B,E</xref>). In that scenario, the relationship between a mushroom body and its target neuropils is essentially the same as in other reptantians (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14D</xref>), except a consequence of inversion is that those neuropils have been able to undergo unparalleled lateral expansion and gyrification.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The varunid mushroom body in the context of pancrustacean evolution and cognition</title><p>The organization of traits defining mushroom bodies is phenotypically identical in stomatopods and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wolff et al., 2017</xref>).

A homologous location is occupied by the hippocampi, rostral to the vertebrate midbrain-hindbrain boundary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bridi et al., 2020</xref>). Mushroom bodies and hippocampi are restricted, respectively, to the protocerebrum and its vertebrate homologue the telencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hirth and Reichert, 1999</xref>). Neuroanatomical arrangements that are intensely immunoreactive to antibodies against DC0 are shared by the hippocampus and mushroom bodies.

Donkey anti-mouse Cy3 and donkey anti-rabbit Cy5 or Alexa 647 (Jackson ImmunoResearch; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2340813">AB_2340813</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2340607">AB_2340607</ext-link>; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2492288">AB_2492288</ext-link>, respectively) IgG secondary antibodies were added to Eppendorf tubes at a concentration of 1:400 and spun for 12 min at 11,000 g. The top 900 μL of the secondary antibody solution was added to the tissue sections, which were then left to incubate overnight at room temperature on a rotator. For F-actin staining, tissue sections were left to incubate in a solution containing phalloidin conjugated to Alexa 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2315147">AB_2315147</ext-link>) at a concentration of 1:40 in PBST for 2–3 days with constant gentle agitation following secondary antibody incubation. To label cell bodies, tissue sections were then rinsed twice in 0.1 M Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4) and soaked for 1 hr. in Tris–HCl buffer containing 1:2000 of the nuclear stain, Syto13 (ThermoFisher Scientific; Cat# S7575) on a rotator. Next, sections were rinsed six times in Tris–HCl over the course of 1 hr. before being mounted on slides in a medium containing 25% Mowiol (Sigma Aldrich; Cat# 81381) and 25% glycerol in PBS. Slides were covered using #1.5 coverslips (Fisher Scientific; Cat# 12-544E). To verify secondary antibody specificity, primary antibodies were omitted resulting in complete abolishment of immunolabeling. TH immunolabeling required a modified staining procedure with a shorter fixation time as well as antibody incubation in whole unsectioned tissue. Standard fixation times or sectioning the tissue prior to immunostaining resulted in poor or absent labeling as has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cournil et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lange and Chan, 2008</xref>). For TH labeling, neural tissue was dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing 3% sucrose for 30–45 min. Following fixation, neural tissue was rinsed twice in PBS, and then twice in 0.5% PBST over the course of 40 min. Tissue was then transferred to blocking buffer containing 5% NDS in 1% PBST and left to soak for 3 hr. TH primary antibody was next added to the blocking buffer at a concentration of 1:250. To assist antibody permeation, whole tissues were microwave-treated for 2 cycles of 2 min on low power (~80 W) followed by 2 min no power under a constant vacuum. Tissue was subsequently left to incubate in primary antibody solution for 2–3 days and was microwave-treated each day. After primary antibody incubation, tissue was washed with 0.5% PBST six times over the course of 2 hr and then transferred to a solution containing 1:250 Cy3 secondary antibody. Whole mounts were left in secondary antibody overnight on a gentle shaker before being sectioned and mounted as described above. In dual labeling experiments, sectioned tissue labeled with anti-TH was then stained with an additional primary and secondary antibody also as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Imaging</title><p>Confocal images were collected as Tiff files using a Zeiss Pascal five confocal microscope (Zeiss; Oberkochen, Germany). Image projections were made using Zeiss Zen System software. Light microscopy images were obtained using a Leitz Orthoplan microscope equipped with Plan Apochromat oil-immersion objectives (X40, X60, and X100). Series of step-focused optical sections (0.5–1.0 μm increments) were collapsed onto a single plane using Helicon Focus (Helicon Soft; Kharkov, Ukraine). Images were transferred to Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc; San Jose, CA) and processed using the Photoshop camera raw filter plug-in to adjust sharpness, color saturation and luminance, texture and clarity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>3D-reconstruction</title><p>Serial sections of osmium-ethyl gallate stained eyestalks were imaged using a brightfield Leitz Orthoplan microscope at a pixel scale of 0.5 µm x 0.5 µm. The sections were cut at a thickness of 15 µm using a rotating microtome. To account for compression and error using dry lenses because of the difference in refractive indices between glass/section and air, image sections were digitally adjusted to a voxel size of 0.5 x 0.5 x 24 µm. Additionally, to obtain a better Z-resolution, two snapshots at two focus planes were taken for each section. The resulting images were manually aligned using non-neuronal fiduciaries in the software TrakEM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cardona et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Neuropils, cell bodies, and large nerve tracts were segmented using the software Amira (Amira 2019.4; Thermo Fisher Scientific; Waltham, MA; USA). We achieved this using the Segmentation Editor, a tool which enables tracing of image data by assigning voxels to materials (i.e. user defined objects such as neuropils, cell bodies, etc.) using a paintbrush tool. Selected sections were outlined in the XY plane and interpolated across sections. Then, using the aid of the interpolated outlines, selected sections were traced in the XY, YZ and XZ planes to create a scaffold of the region of interest. The function ‘wrap’ was then used to interpolate a 3D reconstruction of the object constrained by the scaffold. For visualization purposes, the label field containing ‘wrapped’ labels was interpolated in Z using the ‘Interpolate Labels’ module, adding an additional three slices for each already existing slice while maintaining the overall dimension of the reconstruction. This helped to account for the anisotropic Z-resolution (i.e. ‘staircase effect’). The 3D model was then visualized using the ‘Surface Generator’ module, which created a 3D polygonal surface mesh. Images used for the figures were generated using the snapshot function. The globuli cell population was estimated on the basis of spherical globuli cells, each with the average radius of 3 μm, occupying a volume of 2.5074<sup>3</sup> μm<sup>3</sup> calculated from the serially reconstructed globuli cell mass.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The research described here is supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1754798 awarded to NJS.

In this paper Strausfeld and Sayre analyze the detailed architecture of the mushroom body in a shore crab (Brachyura) as the most recent chapter of a comprehensive treatise on crustacean brain evolution. They show how this architecture is very different from that present in many other arthropod groups; providing a clear example of how anatomical structures can vary in different animals to better cope with their specific lifestyles. The emerging picture of homology and divergence of crustacean mushroom bodies is of substantial value for two reasons: 1) it provides a solid framework for continued evolutionary and functional studies at the molecular, developmental, and behavioral levels. 2) comparative neuroscience is critically important for accurate generalization of findings in genetic model species that currently dominate in neuroscience research.</p><p>Minor points:</p><p>The reviewers have identified a number of minor concerns that must be addressed before publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I have no major comments or criticisms, only a few suggestions as listed below.</p><p>Throughout: I am curious about the rostral, proximal cells that are DC0 positive and the proximal gyrus that is DC0 +AT positive. Could they be associated with each other? Although they are designated MBONs I am skeptical as MBONs are typically not DC0 positive. They are reminiscent of Y-tract Kenyon cells in the Lepidoptera- cell bodies separate from main mass of granule cells, possibly producing a separate neuropil with their dendrites (if proximal gyrus is indeed associated with them).</p><p>Figure legends, figures, and text sometimes do not match up, for example:</p><p>Results: describe the pedestal of the reniform body but it is not indicated in either figure of Figure 1—figure supplement 1;</p><p>The Results describe projection neurons to the LPC in the AGT, which is labeled as the OGT in the figure and legend;</p><p>Another pass through the figures/legends/text would clear up any other discrepancies.</p><p>Introduction: what is a Hebbian network?

The experimental details and the description of tracts, neuronal processes, and network connections are exhaustive. The evolutionary discussion is particularly interesting, though I would prefer to have a hypothetical scenario on how the specific structure and position of the brachyuran mushroom body has arisen within the crustacea, or eventually, within the Arthropoda (if the authors can provide any).</p><p>There are some minor issues that I have to note:</p><p>1) There are several typos (or misspelled words) through the text. Please, give another careful read to the text.</p><p>2) The name of the species used does not appear until the end of the Introduction. Please provide this name in the Abstract and early in the Introduction; otherwise, the reader needs to wait unduly to discover which species is the target of the paper.</p><p>Other comments pertaining to the general presentation of the work:</p><p>While, as mentioned, the anatomical description of the mushroom body is exceptional (the Golgi impregnations are spectacular), one is left with the impression that the &quot;proof&quot; that the structures that are constitutive parts of a mushroom body (a center that integrates sensory information) are functioning as such. Needless to say, homology propositions should (if possible) include structural and functional data.</p><p>In this context, it would have been nice to have complementary imaging assays on output responses to specific stimulus; a functional approach taken already in crabs by Maza et al. in 2020. Moreover, the lack of tracing experiments, allowing the visualization of projections to the mushroom body substructures does not allow the identification of the afferent tracks providing the sensory information to it.</p><p>Other comments that would be important to address:</p><p>The lack of resolution (in general) provided by 3D reconstructions make difficult to appreciate the relative disposition of some structures. I would suggest helping the reader by providing a diagram with the positions of key structures such as: Ca1, Ca2, Ca1Gy1, Ca1Gy2, gct1, and gct2. The diagram should include the medial and rostral axis for orientation. Figure 10 gives a partial solution to the problem, though a diagram would be clearer.</p><p>We are told that in Figure 10 there is a &quot;synapsin-actin&quot; labelled section. Is that correct? I cannot see any panel with that staining method; while I do see this method used in Figure 3.</p><p>The authors have used previously antibodies against DC0, phosphorylated CaMKII (pCAMKII), and Leo in other animals to identify the mushroom body; why not all of them also here?</p><p>The Discussion of the results is exhaustive (I am particularly impressed by the discussion of the gyri system). However, I missed a very specific discussion on the terminology and characteristics of the brachyuran mushroom body. I am thinking specifically of a discussion of the data provided by Maza and co-authors. To the point, a similar study in the crab species <italic>Neohelice granulata</italic> (done by Maza and collaborators) has raised some controversy on the specific nature of the mushroom body and its components in the Brachyura.

We have introduced the species name <italic>Hemigrapsus nudus</italic> in the Abstract and early in the Discussion. We have followed the advice of the second reviewer and promoted Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into the main body of the paper where it is now Figure 1. The same has been done for Figure 2—figure supplement 1, which is now Figure 4, responding to the comments of the third reviewer. The existing figures have been renumbered accordingly and references to them in the text are adjusted accordingly. These figure numbers are self-evident and do not appear as red mark-ups although the relevant legends do.</p><p>Responding to a question from reviewer 1, at this stage of our studies we are unable to identify further traits that might suggest correspondence of the proximal allatostatin containing gyrus to the Y-tract of lepidopteran mushroom bodies. Concerns regarding proximal large perikarya, many of which are DC0 positive, are appropriate and we have responded to these. Our interpretation of them as MBONs is based on Golgi-impregnated morphologies of neurons originating from that cell cluster, the branches of which appear to spread across gyri associated with the calyces and lobes. DC0-immunoreactive axons have been identified extending from those levels into the eyestalk nerve and we have added an inset showing this in what is now Figure 2. The image suggests that some of these neurons may have the status of efferent neurons. Further exploration is required to determine if this is accurate. In the interest of caution we have changed the putative identity of MBONs in this figure to a more neutral status of DC0-positive cell bodies (DC0cbs). All other corrections requested by reviewer 1 have been made.</p><p>We agree with the second reviewer that a future aim of studies on brachyuran (and other crustacean) brains should be to employ calcium imagining of sensory induced activity. This is our intention in the longer term. The entire lateral protocerebrum is accessible for optical imaging, as already shown by Maza et al., 2020, the description of which is cited in the present references. Likewise, there is much to be done with regard to tracing all of the afferent supply to the mushroom bodies and efferent from them, not just of this taxon but also of others that are available for experimentation (at present limited due to current conditions), and our focus on evolutionary divergence. A start on that undertaking by us (Strausfeld et al., 2020) demonstrated the ready accessibility of these lateral brain regions by virtue of their disposition in the eyestalk.</p><p>The second reviewer suggested the addition of a line diagram that would clarify some of the 3D reconstructions. On first reading this we were puzzled, as our considerable investment in generating a 3D model was specifically geared to demonstrate the elaborate relationships described here. However, on further scrutiny we realized that a critical layer of what was originally Figure 11 had been accidentally inverted such that the gyri ended up unrelated to their respective calyces. This demonstrated how intently the reviewer must have studied this figure, and the perplexity that it generated. This figure has now been corrected to show the accurate relationships of all parts of mushroom bodies and the accompanying reniform body, as well as their correct medial, rostral, and ventral axes (see the revised illustrations, now Figure 13). A supplementary figure for Figure 13 has been added showing a schematic of the relationship between the two calyces and their cognate gyri.</p><p>Reviewer 2 proposed that we further reflect on two papers by Maza and colleagues, working on another varunid crab species, that claim a different set of neuropils constituting the crab’s mushroom body (Maza et al., 2016, 2020, both cited). However, consideration of these differences requires considerable discussion and it has the potential of opening a Pandora’s box of dissenting opinions; and, as remarked by the second reviewer, unnecessary polemics. In the present work we simply state that the identification of a center by Maza et al. corresponds to the center identified by Bellonci in 1882 as the reniform body. Bellonci discovered this in the mantis shrimp, where he also discovered the first example of a crustacean mushroom body. He described the two as distinct. The same center in crabs has, however, been given the identity of a mushroom body by Maza et al., despite Thoen et al., 2019, and others pointing out that this interpretation is insecure: our remark in the discussion of the present work is that “similarity, conjunction, and congruence are established criteria for assessing phenotypic homology (Patterson, 1988).” The present work distinguishes the reniform body from the mushroom body. In other lineages, where mushroom bodies accompanied by reniform bodies have been identified Patterson’s criteria exclude the latter as a mushroom body homologue (expressio unius; exclusio alterius). This is unlikely to put the matter to rest, however, and the box will eventually have to be opened as a separate commentary that will include those other lineages.</p><p>We know from pleasing experience that the third reviewer is meticulous in inspecting manuscripts and we thank him for his scrutiny of this one; and, also for pointing out two important papers of adult neurogenesis in crabs. Reference to these has been added to the Results section and both references have contributed to remarks in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
