Here, we identified a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), VPS9D1-AS1, which was located in ribosomes and amplified TGF-β signaling and ISG expression. We show that high expression of VPS9D1-AS1 was negatively associated with T lymphocyte infiltration in two independent cohorts of CRC. VPS9D1-AS1 served as a scaffolding lncRNA by binding with ribosome protein S3 (RPS3) to increase the translation of TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1/5/9. VPS9D1-AS1 knockout downregulated OAS1, an ISG gene, which further reduced IFNAR1 levels in tumor cells. Conversely, tumor cells overexpressing VPS9D1-AS1 were resistant to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing and lowered IFNAR1 expression in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In a conditional overexpression mouse model, VPS9D1-AS1 enhanced tumorigenesis and suppressed the infiltration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Treating tumor-bearing mice with antisense oligonucleotide drugs targeting VPS9D1-AS1 significantly suppressed tumor growth. Our findings indicate that the tumor-derived VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG signaling cascade promotes tumor growth and enhances immune evasion and may thus serve as a potential therapeutic target for CRC.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>long noncoding RNA</kwd><kwd>T lymphocyte infiltration</kwd><kwd>TGF-β</kwd><kwd>interferon</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81802349</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>8213234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wen</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004826</institution-id><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>7192070</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Municipal of Hospitals Incubating Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PX2018013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Scientific Research Project of Beijing Educational Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KM20190025016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Open Project of Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Disease Medical Engineering, Ministry of Education</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019XXG-KFKT-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Overexpression of VPS9D1-AS1 is a lncRNA to activate TGF-β and IFN signaling pathways, regulates crosstalk between cancer cells and T lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major cause of cancer-related death worldwide and shows a high propensity for metastatic dissemination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Siegel et al., 2020</xref>). Microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC is regarded as immunologically ‘cold’, meaning that it is scarcely infiltrated by T cells and possibly nonimmunogenic and therefore unlikely to benefit from immune therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is more effective in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC but not in MSS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). The lack of a DNA mismatch repair mechanism in MSI patients results in a higher tumor mutation burden and thus high neoantigen exposure that favors ICB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). However, important immune features, including the degree of T cell infiltration and the differentiation or activation state of T cells, remain to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benci et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Effective ICB relies on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration in the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, advanced-stage tumor cells secrete high levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β to reduce the activity of intratumoral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), thereby inhibiting their antitumor effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katlinski et al., 2017</xref>). As a result, solid tumors evade anticancer immunity by establishing immune-privileged niches in the TME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chongsathidkiet et al., 2018</xref>). Increased TGF-β in the TME limits the adaptive immune responses by inhibiting T effector cell functions and ushering exhausted T cells to apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tauriello et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). The receptors of interferon (IFN) are found to regulate TGF-β signaling pathway and are associated with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mariathasan et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>IFN signaling is essential for communication between tumor cells and their neighboring cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sistigu et al., 2014</xref>). Endogenous IFNs contribute to antitumor immunity by stimulating specific CD8α lineage dendritic cells to cross-present antigens to CTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Katlinski et al., 2017</xref>) and provide a ‘third signal’ to stimulate the clonal expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gracias et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, high levels of tumor-derived IFN stimulating genes (ISGs) are associated with immunological resistance. For example, IFN alpha receptor (IFNAR)–1 knockout (KO) in mouse cancer cells provoked pronounced immune responses after ionizing radiation, and the cancer cells were more susceptible to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In tumor cells, PDL1 expression is promoted by IFN-γ secretion, which results in tumor cells escaping immune elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cerezo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, the IFN pathway plays contradictory roles in tumor cells and T lymphocytes.</p><p>VPS9D1-AS1 (also known as MYU), a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) that has been proven to be overexpressed in multiple types of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan and Yang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), was identified as a target of Wnt/c-Myc signaling and exhibited pro-oncogenic roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawasaki et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, VPS9D1-AS1 was reported to enhance colon cancer progression through upregulating integrin subunit alpha 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2022</xref>). VPS9D1-AS1 was demonstrated to upregulate the kinesin family member 11 through competitively sponging miRNA-30a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we first report that VPS9D1-AS1 is an essential lncRNA that decreases CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration by enhancing TGF-β and ISG expression in CRC. In addition, we propose that VPS9D1-AS1 might serve as a drug target to enhance the efficacy of ICB treatment against CRC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased VPS9D1-AS1 levels are positively associated with TGF-β signaling in CRC tissues</title><p>To study the clinical relevance of VPS9D1-AS1 expression, we used RNAscope to evaluate VPS9D1-AS1 levels in two independent cohorts.

Mechanistically, VPS9D1-AS1 enhances TGF-β signaling by increasing the expression of TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1/5/9 at the protein level through scaffold mechanisms. Meanwhile, VPS9D1-AS1 KO in tumor cells downregulates the expression of many ISG genes, thus inactivating IFN signaling, and VPS9D1-AS1 KO in tumor cells increases the sensitivity of tumor cells to T cell cytotoxicity, which is illustrated by high levels of secreted IFN. Thus, VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG signaling consists of the pathway that crosstalks between tumors and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Our in vivo assays support the use of VPS9D1-AS1 as a therapeutic target for CRC treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The dual roles of IFN signaling in tumor immune reactions have recently received intense attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benci et al., 2016</xref>). Autocrine type I IFNs from activated T cells augment T cell-mediated tumor regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>) and are essential for the proliferation and differentiation of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lopes et al., 2021</xref>). In the TME, both tumor cells and infiltrating T cells express IFNA/GR, which sense and bind IFN molecules and then activate the expression of a series of ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grasso et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, the suppression of IFN signaling in tumor cells stimulates the production of chemokines, such as CXCL13, which results in tumor infiltration of NK cells and subsequent inhibition of tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muthalagu et al., 2020</xref>). Our data show that VPS9D1-AS1 OE in CRC cells increases IFNAR1 through upregulated OAS1, which is an ISG gene. Hundreds of ISG genes have been identified, and they act either as tumor drivers, such as ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fritzell et al., 2019</xref>), or tumor repressors, such as UBA7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). We also found that both OAS1 and IFI27 are ISGs highly expressed in CRC. Consistent with these findings, OAS1 is a prognostic factor in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang and Yu, 2020</xref>), while IFI27 is overexpressed in cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, OAS1 (but not IFI27) is the downstream ISG gene that is activated by VPS9D1-AS1.</p><p>IFN-activated STAT1 promotes PDL1 expression in tumors, which further accelerates tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lv et al., 2021</xref>). This result is consistent with our finding that STAT1 is activated by VPS9D1-AS1. However, the effect of VPS9D1-AS1 on promoting IFN-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 does not persist for a long time, and it might be associated with the role of pSTAT1 in activating the downstream cGAS-STING pathway, which is essential for defective-mismatch-repair-mediated immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has shown that TGF-β blocks IFN production, which is secreted in a paracrine fashion by activated CTLs and limits tumor regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerin et al., 2019</xref>).

Chronic inflammation contributes to intestinal symptoms, such as bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>).

ASO drugs targeting VPS9D1-AS1 inhibited tumor-associated symptoms such as bleeding and prolonged survival time. Thus, this preclinical model demonstrates that suppressing VPS9D1-AS1 is an effective way to treat CRC.</p><p>In summary, we described the mechanism by which VPS9D1-AS1 promoted tumor immune evasion through the TGF-β signaling pathways and ISGs and provided compelling evidence that the VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG axis might serve as a drug target to enhance the efficacy of ICB treatment against CRC. These findings expand our current mechanistic understanding of CRC progression and provide potential therapeutic approaches by targeting VPS9D1-AS1 to enhance immunotherapy in patients with

assay</title><p>RNA in situ hybridization assays were performed using an RNAscope kit (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Hayward, CA, USA). VPS9D1-AS1 mRNA molecules were detected with single-copy detection sensitivity. Single-molecule signals were quantified on a cell-by-cell basis by manual counting. The signals per cell were evaluated to quantitate the levels of VPS9D1-AS1. The signals were graded as 0 (0–1 dots/10 cells), + (1–3 dots/cell), ++ (4–10 dots/cell), +++ (&gt;10 dots/cell with &lt;10% of dots in clusters), and ++++ (&gt;10 dots/cell with &gt;10% of dots in clusters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). The scores were classified as follows: ‘−, +’ represented negative expression and ‘++, +++, ++++’ represented positive expression of VPS9D1-AS1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mice</title><p>Conditional floxed human VPS9D1-AS1 knock-in alleles with LoxP sites were introduced into the <italic>Rosa26</italic> gene locus to construct C57BL/6J-Gt (ROSA)26Sor<sup>em(CAG-VPS9D1-AS1)1Smoc</sup> mice. A mixture of the construct and CRISPR/Cas9 vector was microinjected into zygotes. The zygotes were implanted into foster mice. The above procedures were performed by Shanghai Model Organisms. Successful integration in the founder mice was identified by PCR analyses of genomic DNA using primers targeting VPS9D1-AS1. After screening, the positive founder (bearing R26-eCAG-VPS9D1-AS1) was crossed with Cre-<italic>Villin</italic> mice to produce conditional VPS9D1-AS1 transgenic (VPS <italic><sup>Tg</sup></italic>) mice in the intestinal epithelium. VSP<italic><sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for at least six generations. The VPS <italic><sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice did not show any differences in comparing with WT mice in lifespan and body weight.</p><p>To induce colorectal cancer with AOM/DSS, C57BL/6 VPS <italic><sup>Tg</sup></italic> mice received a single intraperitoneal injection of AOM (Sigma Aldrich) at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight. One week later, animals were exposed to 1–3 cycles of 2% DSS (MW = 36,000–50,000, MP Biomedicals, CAT# 216011050). For in vivo inhibition of VPS9D1-AS1, mice in the treatment group received 10 nmol (100 μl, 100 mM ASO in PBS) ASOs i.p., once a week. Intestinal tumor volumes were calculated by the formula: π × (1/2 width)<sup>2</sup> × length.</p><p>For the xenograft tumor model, 2×10<sup>6</sup> HCT116 or SW480 cells were implanted subcutaneously in 6-week-old female BALB/c nude mice (Charles River). For MC38 cells, 4×10<sup>6</sup> cells were subcutaneously injected into the lower abdominal region of 6-week-old C57BL/6 WT mice (Charles River). Tumors were assessed two to three times a week by a caliper measurement, and the volumes were calculated with the following formula: 1/2 × (length × width<sup>2</sup>). MC38 cells were stably transfected with luciferase to label tumor progression and were monitored using a Carestream in vivo imaging system (MS FX Pro).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, 0one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by W Kimryn Rathmell as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Philippe Krebs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanistic study regarding VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG was mainly carried out in vitro, while this part shall be tested in cell line-derived xenografts or mouse tumors to support the claims.</p><p>2) The data volume is large and the methodology has covered a broad range in the work, while the arrangement of the manuscript could be improved to optimize the presentation and enhance the readability.</p><p>3) Some details of the figures conflict with the statement in the manuscript, and corrections are warranted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Here are some major concerns:</p><p>Figure 1/S2: The authors shall explain or discuss why FOXP3 T cells showed a different trend in OUTDO and BJCYH cohorts.</p><p>Figure 2: Which cohort(s) was analyzed in 2F? Did OUTDO and BJCYH show the same or different patterns?</p><p>Figure 4/S6: 4H-I showed that at 0 hours, OAS1 and IFI27 did not change between CTRL and VPS OE; however, in S6H, OAS1 and IFI27 were much lower in VPS OE, conflicting with 4H-I.</p><p>Figure 5/S7: In S7A, VPS OE+sgOAS1 (last three lanes) show a substantial OAS1 expression. This made the claims on OAS1 (5B) less convincing. How did VPS KO cells impact IFNAR1 level of T cells in coculture?</p><p>Figures 6 and 7: The mechanistic model proposed by in vitro studies (Figures 4 and 5) shall be tested in cell line-derived xenografts or mouse tumors. For example, the IFNAR1 level of VPS OE tumors was examined (7H) but the IFNAR1 level of infiltrated T cells was not. Moreover, CRC patient-derived xenografts shall be used and treated with VPS ASO, which will be more physiologically relevant than the cell line with 600-fold VPS upregulation used in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>My comments are detailed below:</p><p>(Figure 1)</p><p>1. Panels A and B (and S1A) are not useful for the conclusions of the paper – the histology is difficult to distinguish and it is not clear of levels (of expression) or frequencies (of positive cells) were quantified in panel B. Those data are better presented in panel D.</p><p>2. Panel F, for instance, doesn't actually corroborate what is indicated in panel A, as the authors already gate on &quot;high&quot; populations, and there are still some samples with almost no VPS9D1-AS1, this suggests the staining protocol is not a good replacement for qRT PCR.</p><p>3. In the text the authors write that VPS expression doesn't correlate with the expression of genes in the TGFb pathway (pp4, lines 18-20), but do not actually separate by gene expression, but rather by cancer and normal tissue. A better analysis may actually be a xy graph with regression curves.</p><p>(Figure 2)</p><p>1. There seem to be artefacts or resolution issues in panel A; in panel B, the inlays seem to have different magnifications (size bars are not provided).</p><p>2. It seems data were mixed up data in panel E; in addition, panel D shows Ca/STM ratios while panel E indicates cell numbers, making it difficult to compare the two cohorts. The same applies to Sfig2 panel C versus F.</p><p>3. Panel F needs to be more clearly explained, it is difficult to interpret these data with the explanation given and certain p values are missing. The same applies to SFigure panel G.</p><p>4. Panel A doesn't show what is indicated in the text (cancer vs stromal pp 5 lines 2-3). It shows neg. vs pos. according to the figure and it is difficult to distinguish healthy from tumor tissue.</p><p>(Figure 3)</p><p>1. Is SMAD1/5/9 in Figure 3D indeed the top band?</p><p>2. In panels E and M (and several other western blot data), automated quantification would help support the statements by the authors on increased / lower expression of specific proteins, which are not always convincing as stated.</p><p>3. L – the oligonucleotide design is not fully clear to me; how can these differences between probes be justified, e.g. between RPD1 and RPD2? Why not compare to the entire VPS9D1-AS1 molecule?</p><p>4. O – these data are not convincing.</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>1. In panel E it seems the labels have been swapped.</p><p>2. In panel F: there are differences in the two cell lines after VPS-KO; are the labels correct?</p><p>3.

In panel K: how were the decimal values for OAS1, IFNAR1, and TGFBR1 determined?</p><p>(Figure 5)</p><p>1. Panel B: some of the samples seem to have been swapped. Please cross-check.</p><p>2. Panel D: How were patients selected to be either VPS neg. or pos.? This is also relevant due to the apparent intra-tumor heterogeneity of VPS9D1-AS1 expression. FACS plot, VPS positive condition, upper and lower rows: both T cell and non T cell populations are shifted down, respectively up, suggesting a problem or changes in the settings of the flow cytometer instrument. The quality of the flow cytometry data in panel G is also not convincing (several cells are out of the depicted area). Panel E and F: the authors should provide information on the cell types that have been gated on.</p><p>3. One concern about the T cell killing (panel F) is that the differences could be due to cell growth changes in the VPS OE cells as seen previously. Is there a way to account for/eliminate that in this setting? Check the units on the y axis of the graph. There is no clear effect of neutralizing antibodies (the conditions including MC38 cells + OT-1 cells should be compared).</p><p>(Figure 6).</p><p>1. The murine counterpart of VPS9D1-AS1 is mentioned in the text, but all experiences in vivo are performed using (human) VPS9D1-AS1. The rationale for not using NR045849 in wild-type mice should be better justified.</p><p>2. Panel B: are there differences in vitro in the growth of control and VPS OE MC38 cells? This should be indicated to better understand the in vivo phenotype of these cells.</p><p>3. In general, the flow cytometry data are not convincing. Some cell populations are squished on the top of the graph, there is no indication of what cells are gated on (no gating path or gating strategy indicated). Have isotype controls (or FMO) been used for PD1? The label of the X axis in E should be revised (2 markers on the same axis). If Figure 6D tumor left panel: CD8 numbers are close to 0; therefore, I am not sure how confident one can be about %PD1 in Figure 6F.</p><p>(Figure 7)</p><p>1. There should be an indication of the phenotype of VPS9D1-AS1 transgenic mice at steady-state; are these animals normal? And is VPS9D1-AS1 indeed only expressed in epithelial cells (this is not clear from FigS9B).</p><p>2. &quot;However, Ifnar1 levels in tumor tissues were increased in VPS Tg mice (Figure 7H), indicating that the tumor-promoting effect of VPS9D1-AS1 OE was dependent on Ifnar1 expression&quot;: this is a strong statement or a conclusion that is not supported by the current data. Only a blockade of IFNAR (pharmacologically or genetically) would actually prove this statement.</p><p>3. What are the units on the Y axis for G? and how were the cells quantified?</p><p>4. Panel H: there seem to be differences in the quality of these stainings. It would be helpful to show healthy intestinal tissue (note that the current magnification does not allow to discern well the malignant tissue). How were IFNARI levels quantified? Note that the same comments also apply to panel N.</p><p>5. I think the author over-interpret the panel K data; again (semi-)quantitative densitometry would help to support their statements.</p><p>The authors do not discuss how the T cells and the VPS9D1-AS1 expressing tumors interact in vivo. Is this also mediated via TGFb (note that this is not shown)? And how do they explain that IFNARI becomes increased on T cells in the tumor micro-environment?</p><p>As mentioned in the public review section, the paper could be better served in several ways:</p><p>(1) The paper could be split into two parts. The paper has plenty of data to support the hypothesis of VSP importance in cancer with a less exhaustive look at the binding partners/etc. In particular, the data on downstream miRNAs (Figure 3O, currently not convincing) would benefit from a more in-depth analysis, possibly in a follow-up study that may as well include some of the data presented in Figure 4.</p><p>(2) The data could be slimmed.</p><p>A few additional suggestions:</p><p>– Introduction: the already reported roles of VPS9D1-AS1 for cancer in general and colon cancer, in particular, could be presented in greater detail.</p><p>– Figure 3A: For non-specialists, it would be helpful to indicate which cells originate from CRC tissue.</p><p>– Figure 3: why swap the colors from F and G?

Figures to present the expression difference of VPS9D1-AS1 between benign and malignant tissue should be consistent in Figure 1D and 1E for better visualization;</p><p>2. The P value between VPS 0 and VPS1 was more prominent than that between VPS 0 and VPS 2-4 in Figure 1F, while the Figure 1G only compares the difference between stroma and VPS 4, please explain the reason;</p><p>3. In Figure 1I, the difference in the expression level of TGFBR1, SMAD1/9, VPS9D1-AS1, and TGF-β seems not significant between the normal and cancer tissue, which is not consistent with the description in the manuscript;</p><p>4. The quantification of immune cell subsets was presented with two staining methods in Figure 2A and 2B, please specify the reason;</p><p>5.

The data volume is sufficient enough to support most of the conclusions, while the logicality of the Results warrants improvement, so does the diagram;</p><p>9. Since IFN plays a double role in suppressing or promoting tumor progression, the specific circumstances when employing IFN or target IFN would better be discussed in the Discussion section for better comprehension.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression amplifies intratumoral TGF-β signaling and promotes tumor cell escape from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing in colorectal cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by W Kimryn Rathmell (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Figure 2A: the artefact previously mentioned (obvious quadrant-type shapes, possibly from stitching scanned images together) have not been addressed. These images should be rescanned. Also, it is unclear how these issues may have impacted the analysis of their data.</p><p>2) Figure 2E: this panel has not changed compared to the last time, and contrary to what the authors claim in their reply. And contrarily to what is written on lines 147-149, they are changes in CD8 T cells between VPS9D1-AS1 positive versus negative samples in this cohort.</p><p>3) Figure 3 J and K, (and maybe I). The data from the pull-down assays are not fully convincing as the binding of the probes seems to be arbitrary; there is a large difference for RPD1 versus RPD2 in binding RPS3, while these probes are quite similar. Compared to RPD1, RPD2 is missing 1 bp at the 5' end from 1 but has 15 residues added at the 3' end… What is the rationale for this different but comparable design?</p><p>4) Along these lines: the short RPD3 construct is the best binder of all the tested compounds, but RPD4 still binds RPS3 and SMAD even having no overlap with RPD3. These data would need to be refined to be publishable and would be better served by being moved to the other study mentioned.</p><p>5) Line 256: this sentence claims that TGFb can enter the nucleus to act as a transcription factor. Is this what the authors mean? They should be more explicit in the text. If this is not what they mean, they should rephrase the text accordingly.</p><p>6) Figures 5D and 5G: these flow cytometry data need further improvement to be more convincing. E.g. for Figure 5D/upper panels, the gates to indicate IFNAR1 positivity do not seem to be appropriate. Did the authors use an isotype or FMO control for these data to set their gates (this aspect was not mentioned for IFNAR1 in their reply)? Figure 5D: the axes of the flow plots need to be labelled. Also, why the different stainings for CD4 and CD8 T cells in the top and bottom panels? This seems needlessly confusing.</p><p>7) Figure 5 Panels E and F: the authors should provide information on the cell types that have been gated on in the graph/axis labels; e.g.: % IFNAR1 of CD4 and CD8, … this would facilitate the understanding of these data. In general, it would be much better and informative to distinguish the expression of these molecules on CD8 and CD4 T cells taken individually (and not together), in particular, if they want to make the point that PD1/PD-L1 interaction has a functional impact on CD8 + T cells in their model. Are the values plotted in panel F directly taken from the FACS plots in panel E (it should be the case to better compare the data)?</p><p>8) Figure 5G: to make clearer which cells have which compounds added, I would increase the font a bit, and also add the labels to the bottom panels. Are the authors sure they didn't accidentally switch any of the bottom panels? The percent values indicated in the quadrant do not seem to fit the data plots. Why do the authors detect 2.45% of IFNγ+ OT-1 cells in naïve / unstimulated conditions?</p><p>9) Text lines 296-300 (&quot;VPS9D1-AS1 OE reduced the cytotoxicity of activated OT-1 CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells&quot;): my interpretation of figure 5F differs from the authors. I see the only differences in survival of cancer cells as being due to increased growth of VPS9D1-AS1 OE MC38 cells (as also clearly shown in Figure 6B). This is still a major issue for the paper. I don't think the authors have adequately addressed that the increased tumorigenic potential of VPS9D1-AS1 OE could just be due to enhanced growth, not immune evasion, as posited by the authors. In addition, and as previously mentioned, the effect of PD1 and TGFb blockade are not convincing; the significance appears to come from the higher variation of the data in the condition w/o blockade (and did they add an isotype control there?).</p><p>10) Figure 7: There is still no indication in the manuscript methods of the phenotype (and not genetic background) of VPS9D1-AS1 transgenic mice at steady-state / in untreated conditions. In other terms: are these animals entirely normal? i.e. do they show a weight, lifespan, reproductivity, etc that are comparable to their non-transgenic counterparts?</p><p>11) Figure 7E: Did 80% of the transgenic mice really die by week 12 of this experiment? And why do in Figure 7L / M transgenic mice in the ASO-NC group start dying at around 10w of AOM/DSS treatment, while there is no death in the ASO-VPS group, and considering the ASO-NC or ASO-VPS treatment only starts from week 14 of AOM/DSS treatment on?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;VPS9D1-AS1 overexpression amplifies intratumoral TGF-β signaling and promotes tumor cell escape from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing in colorectal cancer&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by W Kimryn Rathmell (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Several of the previous comments have still not been adequately addressed, but there are still several issues to be resolved, which are listed below. The same numbering is kept to facilitate the reading.</p><p>2) Figure 2E: this panel has still not changed compared to the last time, and contrarily to what the authors claim in their reply. Positive sample (please correct spelling in the Figure ) are in red in this Fig2E and show increased numbers of CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes (this is not in line with the text on line 148-149), while FigD indicates increases Ca/STM ratios for CD8 lymphocytes in negative cases (displayed in red).</p><p>4) Again: RPD1 and RPD2 are very much comparable, yet their respective ability to binds RPS3 is quite different. In addition, RPD2 entirely overlaps with the sequence of RPD4, yet it binds RPS3 with reduced efficacy. This, together with my previous comments raises concern on the robustness of these data, which the authors did not discuss.</p><p>5) There are no definitive date proving TGF-β co-localization in the nucleus; the staining in Figure 3I is difficult to assess. In addition, I could not find clear evidence in the literature that TGF-β can indeed translocate to the nucleus and I would therefore be cautious before making such statement. Did the authors entirely control for the quality of their reagents (specificity of anti-TGF-β antibody, etc.)?</p><p>6) In the data newly provided in their reply, the upper row appears to indicate isotypes controls for CD4 and CD3 (and not PD1, as claimed). For the lower row, apparently showing the isotype control, there is a distinct shift in all cell populations between the isotype staining and the staining with the anti-IFNAR1 antibody. This raises concern on the robustness of these data. Possibly, the antibodies need to be titrated and the gating needs to be readjusted. In addition, in Figure 5D, the data show CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4- cells (upper row) and CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD8- cells (lower row). It is formally not correct to assume the CD4- cells are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and vice-versa, since the authors have not combined these antibodies in the same staining panel.</p><p>9) Contrarily to what the authors claim, in their reply, there is in Figure 5F not obvious killing between the conditions with MC38+OT-1 without antibody versus MC38+OT-1 and PD1 or TGF-β antibody-mediated blockade (irrespectively of MC38 cells being used as controls or overexpressing VPS) – there is no p value &lt;0.05 indicated for these comparison groups. In other terms, the authors do not compare the right groups to support their statement (lines 299-300). This needs to be addressed and corrected in the manuscript (lines 299-300).</p><p>Please improve the figures appropriately to supplement solid evidence, and provide more logical descriptions in the manuscript to fulfil the requirement of <italic>eLife</italic>, which would help accelerate the final decision towards your manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79811.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The mechanistic study regarding VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG was mainly carried out in vitro, while this part shall be tested in cell line-derived xenografts or mouse tumors to support the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>In our study, we had applied cell line derived xenograft or allograft tumor models (in vivo) to explore the regarding mechanism for VPS9D1-AS1/TGF-β/ISG.

For example, down regulation of IFNAR1 in tumor stroma stimulated CRC development and growth, this finding has been proved by many studies (Inactivation of Interferon Receptor Promotes the Establishment of Immune Privileged Tumor Microenvironment, 2017, Cancer Cell). However, genetic elimination of IFNAR1 in tumor cells enhanced immunological response depended on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and was more susceptibility to T cell-meditated kill (Type I IFN protects cancer cells from CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell mediated cytotoxicity after radiation, 2019, JCI). Cancer-specific IFNAR1 engagement has been demonstrated to promote cancer stemness and higher expression levels of PDL1 (Cancer-specific type-I interferon receptor signaling promotes cancer stemness and effector CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell exhaustion, 2021, Oncoimmunology). Collectively, there are many studies indicate that IFANR1 exert dichotomous function in cancer cells and lymphocytes. Our present study demonstrates that IFNAR1 could be upregulated by VPS in cancer cells, these cells with low IFNAR1 are more susceptible to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing. On the other hand, we found that cancer-derived IFNAR1 exhibit a negative relationship with CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells IFNAR1. In this study, we did not dig out the detail mechanism. We hypothesized that IFNAR1 overexpressed in tumor cells regulated many ISGs and then released by tumor cells in TME, which would regulate IFNAR1 in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

Panel F, for instance, doesn't actually corroborate what is indicated in panel A, as the authors already gate on &quot;high&quot; populations, and there are still some samples with almost no VPS9D1-AS1, this suggests the staining protocol is not a good replacement for qRT PCR.</p></disp-quote><p>RNAscope technique enabled direct counting of mRNA molecules in single cells in routine formalin-fixed tissue specimens using bright-field microscopy.

The noncanonical pathway regarding TGFβ activated a series of targeting genes through AKT, mTOR, NF-κB et al. (as mentioned in Reference Derynck, R., Turley, S. J., and Akhurst, R. J. (2021). TGFbeta biology in cancer progression and immunotherapy. Nat Rev Clin Oncol 18, 9-34.). However, the roles regarding tumor-derived TGFβ overexpression are remained to be elucidated. One possible clue for TGFβ controlling OAS1 transcription might be that tumor-derived TGFβ activated AKT, in tumor cells, newly synthesized latent(L)-TGFβ crosslinked to GARP controlled TGFβ signaling (Overcoming TGFβ- mediated immune evasion in cancer, 2022, Nature Reviews Cancer). GARP has been proved to localize in nuclear compartments (GARP as an Immune Regulatory Molecule in the Tumor Microenvironment of Glioblastoma Multiforme, 2019, Int J Mol Sci).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

This feedback plays a role on maintaining the balance of TGFβ signaling pathway. In tumor cells, high activation of TGFβ signaling pathway prevents T cell killing, high levels of VPS9D1-AS1 help to hold the activation of TGFβ signaling pathway.

The data from the pull-down assays are not fully convincing as the binding of the probes seems to be arbitrary; there is a large difference for RPD1 versus RPD2 in binding RPS3, while these probes are quite similar. Compared to RPD1, RPD2 is missing 1 bp at the 5' end from 1 but has 15 residues added at the 3' end… What is the rationale for this different but comparable design?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3J is RIP assay, use antibodies to bind with VPS9D1-AS1. Figure 3K is RNA pulldown assay. The probes used in RNA pulldown assay were four transcripts of VPS9D1-AS1, which were transcribed using an in vitro RNA Synthesis Kit. Then, the RNA products were labeled with desthiobiotinylation. After that, these labeled VPS9D1-AS1 sequences were mixed with cell lysis. The binding proteins were tested using western blotting at last. High repeat sequences of VPS9D1-AS1 result that the transcription of full length VPS9D1-AS1 is very difficult in vitro. To transcribe RNA transcripts of VPS9D1-AS1 from cDNA template, two paired primers (RPD1 and RPD2, 1bp is different for upper primer) were used to transcribe the long probes, which is similar to the full length of VPS9D1-AS1. RPD1 and RPD2 share some same sequence with RPD3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Along these lines: the short RPD3 construct is the best binder of all the tested compounds, but RPD4 still binds RPS3 and SMAD even having no overlap with RPD3.

Four probes can bind with RPS3. RPD3 shown higher binding ability with RPS3, TGF-β and SMAD1/5/9. RPD2 show a higher binding ability with TGFBR1. These results indicated that VPS9D1-AS1 located in ribosome of cancer cell by interacting with RPS3 and then regulated the transcriptions of TGF-β, TGFBR1 and SMAD1/5/9 through different sequence. In our study, Figure 3J was designed to proteins binding with VPS9D1-AS1, meanwhile, Figure 3K was designed to VPS9D1-AS1 binding with proteins, each assay complementing each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Line 256: this sentence claims that TGFb can enter the nucleus to act as a transcription factor. Is this what the authors mean? They should be more explicit in the text.

The reference (Derynck et al., 2021, TGFbeta biology in cancer progression and immunotherapy. Nat Rev Clin. ) indicated that TGFβ-induced activation of ERK–MAPK, AKT and NF-κB signaling might initiate from the distinct receptor complexes. Our study tried to reveal both SMAD4 and TGF-β acting as regulators of OAS1 gene. SMAD4 has been prove to act as the transcription factor for many genes. Our study indicated that TGF-β might be of direct or indirect transcription factor to control OAS1 expression. IF staining (Figure 3I) indicate that TGF-β can be found to co-locate with nucleus of HCT116 cells. Our ChIP assay further demonstrated that TGF-β-antibody could IP the promotor region of OAS1.

I don't think the authors have adequately addressed that the increased tumorigenic potential of VPS9D1-AS1 OE could just be due to enhanced growth, not immune evasion, as posited by the authors.

And why do in Figure 7L / M transgenic mice in the ASO-NC group start dying at around 10w of AOM/DSS treatment, while there is no death in the ASO-VPS group, and considering the ASO-NC or ASO-VPS treatment only starts from week 14 of AOM/DSS treatment on?</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 7E, three cycles of DSS after one week of AOM treatment were treated WT and VPS<sup>tg</sup> mice. In contrast, one cycle of DSS treated mice after one week of AOM treatment in Figure 7L. Therefore, more DSS treatment lead higher death rate in Figure 7E than Figure 7L/M. To view the therapeutic effect of ASO-VPS, we used one cycle of DSS induced tumor in Figure 7L/M. After DSS treatment for one week, ASO-VPS and ASO-NC drugs were applied to treat mice. This would be the reason for ASO-NC group start dying at 10<sup>th</sup> week.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several of the previous comments have still not been adequately addressed, but there are still several issues to be resolved, which are listed below. The same numbering is kept to facilitate the reading.</p><p>2) Figure 2E: this panel has still not changed compared to the last time, and contrarily to what the authors claim in their reply. Positive sample (please correct spelling in the Figure ) are in red in this Fig2E and show increased numbers of CD8 and CD4 lymphocytes (this is not in line with the text on line 148-149), while FigD indicates increases Ca/STM ratios for CD8 lymphocytes in negative cases (displayed in red).</p></disp-quote><p>We deeply sorry for our mistake in Figure 2E and thanks for your kindly comment. At this time, we accordingly revised these figures. Previous figure 2E wrongly labeled ‘positive’ (red) and ‘negative’ (blue) group. We fixed these errors. The labels for Figure 2D were correct, the Ca/STM ratios for CD4/8 lymphocytes were increased in patient with negative VPS9D1-AS1 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Again: RPD1 and RPD2 are very much comparable, yet their respective ability to binds RPS3 is quite different. In addition, RPD2 entirely overlaps with the sequence of RPD4, yet it binds RPS3 with reduced efficacy. This, together with my previous comments raises concern on the robustness of these data, which the authors did not discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We firstly response to reviewer previous comment. In view that, the binding VPS9D1-AS1 with TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1/5/9 had been proved by several assays in our study, as shown in Figure 3I and J. We thus revised RNA-pull down related data and deleted the results of TGF-β, TGFBR1, and SMAD1. According reviewer suggestion, these issues should be moved to another research to be addressed. All related description and figure legend had been consistent revised. Among of all these detecting binding proteins for VPS9D1-AS1, the RNA-pull down assay for RPS3 was better than other protein. In this revised manuscript, we tried to preserve this result for VPS9D1-AS1 binding with RPS3, this would help to hint the subcellular location for VPS9D1-AS1.</p><p>About RPD probes concern, as be pointed out by reviewer, four designed probes show different binding ability with VPS9D1-AS1 in our RNA-pull down assay. We thought that the specific repetitive sequences (from 1298bp to 1753bp, total 279 bp) in the 3’ end of VPS9D1-AS1 play an important role during binding with RPS3 and other proteins. The most important difference between RPD1 and RPD2 are the sequences in 3’end, RPD2 contained 13 bp repetitive sequences. On the other hand, RPD3 is the 5’ end transcript of VPS9D1-AS1, shown the highest binding affinity with RPS3, indicated that VPS9D1-AS1 bound with RPS1 through 5’ end of RNA chain. Although RPD3 shared same sequence with RPD1 and RPD2, did not contained repetitive sequences, shown higher binding ability than RPD2, but lower than RPD1 and RPD3, which further indicated the binding mainly occurring in the 5’ end.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are no definitive date proving TGF-β co-localization in the nucleus; the staining in Figure 3I is difficult to assess. In addition, I could not find clear evidence in the literature that TGF-β can indeed translocate to the nucleus and I would therefore be cautious before making such statement. Did the authors entirely control for the quality of their reagents (specificity of anti-TGF-β antibody, etc.)?</p></disp-quote><p>According this suggestion, we revised the related statement in our manuscript (line 256~262, page 8~9). Figure 4J and legend were also consistently revised to delete the results of TGF-β. The issue for TGF-β acting as transcription factor might be discussed in future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the data newly provided in their reply, the upper row appears to indicate isotypes controls for CD4 and CD3 (and not PD1, as claimed). For the lower row, apparently showing the isotype control, there is a distinct shift in all cell populations between the isotype staining and the staining with the anti-IFNAR1 antibody. This raises concern on the robustness of these data. Possibly, the antibodies need to be titrated and the gating needs to be readjusted. In addition, in Figure 5D, the data show CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD4- cells (upper row) and CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD8- cells (lower row). It is formally not correct to assume the CD4- cells are CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and vice-versa, since the authors have not combined these antibodies in the same staining panel.</p></disp-quote><p>The strategies for gating IFNAR1 and PD1 in T cells were shown as follow picture. Our previous response indicated the method for gating IFNAR1. The lower row represented an isotype sample with staining ISO-PE antibody. On the other hand, right graph shown the CD3/CD4 staining cells. This might be the reason for the shift in cell populations between lower graphs. We further regrouped these FCM graphs and tried to show gating strategies. We used isotype as the negative controls for gating positive IFNAR1 and PD1 cells to represent their levels in CD4 and CD8 T cells. As our mentioned in our previous response, we used CD3/CD4 antibodies and CD3/CD8 antibodies to discern CD4 and CD8 cells, this method allowed us to reduce an antibody for each panel, this might be not rigorous enough. However, CD3/CD4/IFNAR1 antibodies staining could represent the levels of IFNAR1 in CD4 cells, while, CD3/CD8/PD1 antibodies staining could represent the levels of PD1 in CD8 cells. Therefore, we revised our results in Figure 5 D and E. The related statement had also been revised in manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Contrarily to what the authors claim, in their reply, there is in Figure 5F not obvious killing between the conditions with MC38+OT-1 without antibody versus MC38+OT-1 and PD1 or TGF-β antibody-mediated blockade (irrespectively of MC38 cells being used as controls or overexpressing VPS) – there is no p value &lt;0.05 indicated for these comparison groups. In other terms, the authors do not compare the right groups to support their statement (lines 299-300). This needs to be addressed and corrected in the manuscript (lines 299-300).</p></disp-quote><p>Current comment help us to more precise understand reviewer’s intent. We labeled the p values for comparison among VPS OE, VPS OE+OT-1, VPS OE+OT-1+TGF-β<sup>ab</sup>, and VPS OE+OT-1+PD1<sup>ab</sup> groups. TGF-β<sup>ab</sup> and PD1<sup>ab</sup> supplied in media lowered MC38 VPS OE cell proliferation, but there are no statistically significant difference. We thus revised our statement in manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
