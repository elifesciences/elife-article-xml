independent inputs to the hippocampus, each carrying different types of information. Here, we evaluate the possibility that information is integrated between divisions of the entorhinal cortex prior to reaching the hippocampus. We demonstrate that, in mice, fan cells in layer 2 (L2) of LEC that receive neocortical inputs, and that project to the hippocampal dentate gyrus, also send axon collaterals to layer 1 (L1) of the MEC. Activation of inputs from fan cells evokes monosynaptic glutamatergic excitation of stellate and pyramidal cells in L2 of the MEC, typically followed by inhibition that contains fast and slow components mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively. Inputs from fan cells also directly activate interneurons in L1 and L2 of MEC, with synaptic connections from L1 interneurons accounting for slow feedforward inhibition of L2 principal cell populations. The relative strength of excitation and inhibition following fan cell activation differs substantially between neurons and is largely independent of anatomical location. Our results demonstrate that the LEC, in addition to directly influencing the hippocampus, can activate or inhibit major hippocampal inputs arising from the MEC. Thus, local circuits in the superficial MEC may combine spatial information with sensory and higher order signals from the LEC, providing a substrate for integration of ‘what’ and ‘where’ components of episodic memories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>hippocampal formation</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200855/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/V010107/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vandrey</surname><given-names>Brianna</given-names></name><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

According to standard models, information about spatio-temporal context is processed through medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), while information about objects and events is processed in parallel through the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), with both streams being integrated in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burwell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eichenbaum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Knierim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nilssen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Whittington et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this framework, neurons in the MEC represent spatial variables including location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fyhn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hafting et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Høydal et al., 2019</xref>), head direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>), and running speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kropff et al., 2015</xref>), whereas neurons in the LEC encode information about local features of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kuruvilla and Ainge, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wan et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Xiang and Brown, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Young et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhu and Brown, 1995</xref>). However, recent experiments suggest that spatial and non-spatial signals may be combined in the entorhinal cortex, upstream from the hippocampus. Spatial cells in the MEC, including grid cells, can encode information about object identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keene et al., 2016</xref>) and the superficial layers of the MEC contain neurons that encode vector relationships between objects and an animal’s position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Høydal et al., 2019</xref>). These findings raise the question of whether entorhinal circuits upstream from the hippocampus are organised to support integration of spatial and non-spatial signals.</p><p>Projections from layer 2 (L2) of the MEC and LEC converge on common postsynaptic targets within the dentate gyrus and CA3 regions of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hainmueller and Bartos, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steward, 1976</xref>). These projections primarily originate from reelin expressing neurons, which in MEC and LEC are referred to respectively as stellate cells (L2 SCs) and fan cells on the basis of their distinct dendritic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alonso and Llinás, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolorfo and Amaral, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klink and Alonso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nilssen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tahvildari and Alonso, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vandrey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varga et al., 2010</xref>). An additional projection to the CA1 region of the hippocampus arises from calbindin expressing pyramidal cells (L2 PCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ohara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sürmeli et al., 2016</xref>), which in MEC form clusters that intermingle with L2 SCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ray et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varga et al., 2010</xref>), and in LEC form a separate sub-layer located deep to the fan cell layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vandrey et al., 2020</xref>). Stellate cells in the MEC play important roles in contextual and spatial memory and are a major population of grid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tennant et al., 2018</xref>), while pyramidal cells are important for temporal associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, fan cells in LEC have been shown to contribute to the processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>) and memory encoding of olfactory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2021</xref>), learning of object locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fernández-Ruiz et al., 2021</xref>), and processing of object-place-context associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vandrey et al., 2020</xref>). Neurons in the superficial layers of the LEC also generate representations of objects and object locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>), although these are yet to be mapped onto a specific type of neuron. Within both LEC and MEC, layer 2 principal neurons interact through nearby fast spiking inhibitory interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nilssen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>), such that inputs that target either principal cells or interneurons may in principle shape the entorhinal input to the hippocampus.</p><p>While signals from MEC and LEC are generally considered to be integrated in the hippocampus, classic anatomical observations suggest that information could in principle be transferred directly between the MEC and LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Köhler, 1988</xref>). Specifically, injection of anterograde tracers into the superficial LEC of the rat labelled axons that pass through the MEC. However, it is unclear which neurons in the LEC this projection originates from, whether the projection makes functional synaptic connections within the MEC, and if so, what the identity of the postsynaptic targets are. These features of the circuit architecture impose fundamental constraints on its possible functions. For example, if this pathway contributes to processing of information before it is delivered to the hippocampus, then it should connect neurons in LEC with hippocampal projecting neurons in the MEC. In this case it will also be important to establish how the pathway interacts with local excitatory-inhibitory microcircuits which appear critical for computations in superficial layers of MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shipston-Sharman et al., 2016</xref>). If the pathway drives postsynaptic activation of principal cells in the MEC then it could promote activation of convergent inputs to the downstream hippocampus, whereas if the pathway inhibits principal cells then it would oppose the influence of the MEC on the hippocampus.</p><p>It is of particular interest that axons from LEC appear to primarily pass through layer 1 ( L1) of MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Köhler, 1988</xref>), as this layer contains dendrites from L2 SCs and pyramidal cells with cell bodies in deeper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canto and Witter, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamam et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klink and Alonso, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sürmeli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van Haeften et al., 2003</xref>). A similar circuit arrangement has functional implications in neocortex, where L1 contains sparse populations of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons with distinct electrophysiological and morphological profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>). Neocortical L1 is targeted by various long-range subcortical and cortical inputs and is a locus for integration of external information about the environment and internally generated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schuman et al., 2021</xref>). Activation of neurons in L1 of neocortex enables long range inputs to exert powerful inhibitory effects on principal neurons in deeper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wozny and Williams, 2011</xref>). In contrast, very little is known about the external inputs to L1 neurons in the MEC or how they influence activity of neurons in other layers.</p><p>Here, we show that projections from LEC to MEC are mediated by axon collaterals of LEC fan cells. These projections are localised to L1 of MEC, and arise from neurons in LEC that receive synaptic input from piriform and prefrontal cortices. Activation of fan cell inputs to MEC drives excitatory postsynaptic potentials, in L2 SCs and L2 PCs, that are mediated by direct glutamatergic input, and feedforward inhibition that arises from local interneurons in L1 and L2. Inhibitory components of responses to input from fan cells are particularly prominent in L2 SCs, and are composed of fast and slow components mediated by GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors, respectively. The relative balance of excitation and inhibition is heterogeneous between neurons and appears largely independent of anatomical location. By delineating circuit mechanisms through which MEC can integrate inputs from the LEC, our results identify a pathway through which sensory and higher order information from neocortex may contribute to spatial and object coding in the superficial MEC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fan cells in LEC project to superficial MEC</title><p>As a first step toward determining the identity of neurons in the LEC that project to the MEC, we injected a retrograde AAV encoding mCherry (AAV-Retro-mCherry) into the MEC of wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, n=3 mice). Labelled neurons in the LEC were primarily localised to the most superficial sublayer of layer 2 (L2a, 21.6 ± 1.6% of neurons in L2a), with sparse labelling of neurons in layer 5a, suggesting that the majority of axonal projections from LEC to MEC arise from fan cells in L2a. To test this directly, we injected adeno-associated virus (AAV) mediating Cre-dependent expression of GFP (AAV-FLEX-GFP) into the LEC of <italic>Sim1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> mice (n=4), which we found previously to give specific genetic access to fan cells in the LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vandrey et al., 2020</xref>).

Instead, we show that L2 SCs, L2 PCs, and L3 PCs in the MEC, which together originate major inputs to all hippocampal subfields, each receive substantial inputs from LEC fan cells. These inputs can arise as collaterals of the projections from fan cells to the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Thus, when LEC fan cells are active they will influence the hippocampus directly, through their inputs to the dentate gyrus, and indirectly through their influence on hippocampal projecting neurons in the MEC. It is not yet clear whether this model applies to all fan cells, as our data do not rule out the possibility that fan cells that project to the dentate gyrus and MEC exist alongside fan cells that project to either area alone. Our observation of similar levels of axonal labelling in dentate gyrus and MEC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) may suggest that most hippocampal-projecting neurons also project to the MEC, and vice versa, though our data also suggest that the extent of overlap in these populations can vary with different cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and G</xref>). Further evaluation of these possibilities will likely require reconstructions of the axons of individual fan cells.</p><p>Recent analyses of perirhinal and postrhinal inputs to the entorhinal cortex suggest that both structures preferentially target the LEC over the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doan et al., 2019</xref>). This result also challenges standard models of entorhinal-hippocampal function, which had assumed that the MEC relays postrhinal input to the hippocampus. However, it leaves open the question of whether and how the MEC receives information from other cortical areas as neurons in the superficial layers of MEC appear to receive few other direct cortical inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cappaert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doan et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings address this question by showing that LEC fan cells that project to the MEC are downstream from neurons in the prefrontal and piriform cortices, suggesting that cortical signals could reach the MEC via LEC fan cells.</p><p>In this revised model, the organisation of inputs to LEC fan cells is likely to be critical for the computations implemented. For example, inputs from multiple cortical structures, in combination with inputs from perirhinal and postrhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doan et al., 2019</xref>), could converge on single fan cells prior to reaching hippocampus and MEC. Alternatively, different fan cells may receive distinct combinations of input from each structure. Thus, future experiments might distinguish whether fan cells are homogenous, or if there are distinct subpopulations that differ in the origin of their inputs or their preference for targets in the MEC and dentate gyrus.</p><p>While it has been recognised that layer 1 of the MEC contains sparsely distributed interneurons, the nature of the input to these neurons and their influence on the activity of other neurons in the MEC has received very little attention. Our data show that layer 1 interneurons are a major target of inputs from LEC fan cells. In contrast to principal cells, responses of layer 1 neurons to activation of fan cell inputs were exclusively excitatory and in many cases were sufficient to drive spike firing. Paired recordings between L1 interneurons and principal cells in L2 demonstrated that postsynaptic responses were a mix of fast and slow inhibitory components. This contrasts with interneurons in L2, which provide exclusively fast inhibitory input to layer 2 principal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Couey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nilssen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pastoll et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, L1 neurons are likely to contribute to feedforward inhibition of L2 SCs and L2 PCs and their activation can account for the slow GABA<sub>B</sub> mediated inhibition of these cells following activation of inputs from fan cells. This organisation is similar to neocortical circuits, where activation of interneurons in L1 by long-range cortical inputs drives inhibition of neurons in deeper cortical layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Oláh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wozny and Williams, 2011</xref>).</p><p>What are the implications of this local inhibitory connectivity? In neocortex, interneurons in L1 integrate external sensory information arriving from long-range cortical inputs with internally generated signals that arise from principal neurons in the deeper layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schuman et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that circuits encompassing interneurons in L1 have a similar role in the MEC. For example, the deeper layers of MEC contain spatially modulated cells that signal animal position, head direction, and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sargolini et al., 2006</xref>). If L1 interneurons receive input from these cells, then they would be well placed to integrate these signals with object and event information arriving from the LEC. In this way, they may inhibit hippocampal projecting neurons in superficial layers according to the specific conjunction of these signals.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The effects of fan cell activation differ between and within target cell types</title><p>As well as extending the targets of fan cells in the LEC to include neurons in MEC in addition to the dentate gyrus, our results suggest that the impact of fan cells differs between principal neuron cell types. Responses of granule cells, L2 PCs and L2 SCs to fan cell activation all include an initial EPSP followed by activation of feedforward inhibitory inputs, but the consequences of the inhibition differ. For granule cells, activation of fast feedforward inhibition opposes the excitation provided directly by the fan cell inputs and so reduces the probability of spike firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scharfman, 1991</xref>). In contrast, blocking fast inhibition typically had modest effects on the amplitude of fan cell driven EPSPs in L2 SCs and L2 PCs, but caused a several fold increase in their half-width. Thus, recruitment by fan cells of fast feedforward inhibition in the MEC may limit the time window for summation of direct fast excitation. A further striking difference is that in the MEC activation of fan cells often causes a prominent slow inhibition mediated by GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors. The extent to which this slow inhibition manifests differs between cell types: for dentate gyrus granule cells responses appear to be primarily depolarizing; for L2 PCs responses include a mix of depolarization and hyperpolarization but across the population the bias is consistently towards excitation; for L2 SCs responses are most heterogenous spanning the full range from excitation-dominated to inhibition-dominated. These differences suggest distinct functional consequences of fan cell activation for each neuron type. For dentate gyrus granule cells their primary effect may be excitation, with gain control provided by feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elgueta and Bartos, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ewell and Jones, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Scharfman, 1991</xref>). For L2 PCs the dominant effect also appears to be excitation, with integration time windows determined by inhibition. For L2 SCs, their effect is much more variable, with many neurons likely to experience net inhibition and others responding in similar ways to L2 PCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>Our results, together with recent investigations of peri- and postrhinal inputs to the MEC and LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Doan et al., 2019</xref>), suggest a revised circuit organisation for entorhinal-hippocampal interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). According to this view, neocortical signals may primarily reach superficial layers of the MEC via fan cells in LEC. Because object representations are well established in LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>), this pathway could provide signals for generation of object-vector representations in the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Høydal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). In principle it could also provide signals for visual representations in the MEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kinkhabwala et al., 2020</xref>), and for encoding of rewarded locations either through modification of grid firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boccara et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hardcastle et al., 2017</xref>) or through interruption of ramping activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tennant et al., 2021</xref>). Neurons in LEC also encode representations of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsao et al., 2018</xref>), therefore our finding of connectivity between fan cells and principal neurons in L3 could suggest a further role for this pathway in supporting temporal representations in CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kraus et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, this may not be the sole route for neocortical signals to reach MEC. For example, within the hippocampal formation neurons in the pre- and parasubiculum make prominent excitatory connections to neurons in L3 and L2 of the MEC, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caballero-Bleda and Witter, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Köhler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Swanson and Cowan, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Groen and Wyss, 1990</xref>). The pre- and parasubiculum may in turn be influenced directly by inputs from sensory cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Köhler, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Groen and Wyss, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vogt and Miller, 1983</xref>). An important future goal will be to dissociate functions for each of these input pathways. Here, the roles of L1 interneurons in generating slow inhibition, and the striking diversity of responses of L2 SCs to fan cells may be of particular interest, as it raises the possibility of computations that involve active suppression as well as generation of representations in the MEC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

A glass pipette was lowered at a 10° angle until a slight bend in the pipette indicated contact with dura. The pipette was retracted 0.2 mm and 100–300 nL of virus was injected. To target the dorsoventral extent of MEC, the injection protocol was repeated with the pipette angled at 8º. For anterograde expression of Cre in neurons that receive projections from cortex, pENN-AAV1-hSyn-Cre-WPRE (Addgene #: 105553, titer: 1.8x10<sup>13</sup> GC/ml) was injected into the piriform cortex or medial prefrontal cortex. To target piriform cortex, a craniotomy was made at 0.6 mm posterior to bregma and 3.3 mm lateral to the midline, a glass pipette was lowered vertically into the brain to a depth of 4 mm from dura, and 200 nL of virus was injected. To target medial prefrontal cortex, a craniotomy was made at 1 mm rostral to bregma and 0.35 mm lateral to midline, a glass pipette was lowered into the brain angled at 15° to a depth 1.34 mm from dura, and 200 nL of virus was injected. For all injections, the pipette was slowly retracted after a stationary period of four minutes. After injections, the incision was closed with tissue glue (Vetbond) or sutures. Mice were administered an oral analgesic prepared in flavoured jelly immediately after surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>For anatomical experiments, animals were sacrificed 3–8 weeks after viral injections. Mice were administered a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) followed by cold paraformaldehyde (PFA, 4%). For immunohistochemistry in slices, brains were fixed for minimum for 24 hr in PFA at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and transferred to a 30% sucrose solution prepared in PBS for a minimum for 48 hr at 4 °C. Brains were then sectioned horizontally at 50–60 µm on a freezing microtome. To counterstain neurons, slices were incubated in a Neurotrace 640/660 (Invitrogen, Cat # N21483, 1:500) solution prepared in 0.3% PBS-T (Triton) for 24 hr at room temperature. Slices were washed with 0.3% PBS-T 3 x for 20 min and then mounted and cover-slipped with Mowiol. Mounted sections were stored at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Slice electrophysiology</title><p>Horizontal brain slices were prepared from 5- to 12-week-old <italic>Sim1</italic><sup>Cre</sup> or wild-type mice. Where experiments relied on expression of AAV, animals were sacrificed 2–4 weeks after viral injections. Mice were sacrificed by cervical location and decapitated. The brains were rapidly removed and submerged in cold cutting artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) at 4–8°C. The cutting ACSF was composed of the following (in mM): NaCl 86, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, KCl 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, Glucose 25, Sucrose 50, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, MgCI<sub>2</sub> 7. The dorsal surface of the brain was glued to a block submerged in cold cutting ACSF and 400–450 µm thick horizontal slices were cut using a vibratome. Slices were transferred to standard ACSF at 37 °C for a minimum of 15 min, then incubated at room temperature for a minimum of one hour. Standard ACSF consisted of the following (in mM): NaCl 124, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.2, KCI 2.5, NaHCO<sub>3</sub> 25, Glucose 25, CaCI<sub>2</sub> 2, MgCI<sub>2</sub> 1. For recordings, slices were transferred to a submerged chamber and maintained in standard ACSF at 35–37°C. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings were made from neurons in MEC using borosilicate electrodes with a resistance of 3–8 MΩ. Electrodes with resistances in the higher end of this range (6–8 MΩ) were found to be optimal for recording from interneurons in layer 1 of the MEC. Electrodes were filled with an intracellular solution comprised of the following (in mM): K gluconate 130, KCI 10, HEPES 10, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, EGTA 0.1, Na<sub>2</sub>ATP 4, Na<sub>2</sub>GTP 0.3, phosphocreatine 10, and 0.5% biocytin (w/v). Recordings were made in current-clamp mode from cells with a resting membrane potential ≤ –50 mV and series resistance ≤ 50 MΩ with appropriate bridge-balance and pipette capacitance neutralisations applied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Recording protocols</title><p>A series of protocols were used to characterise the electrophysiological properties of each cell recorded in MEC. Sub-threshold membrane properties were measured by examining membrane potential responses to injection of current in hyperpolarizing and depolarizing steps (−160–160 pA in 80 pA increments, or –80–80 pA in 40 pA increments, each 3 s duration), and to injection of an oscillatory current with a linearly varying frequency (ZAP protocol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nolan et al., 2007</xref>). Suprathreshold properties were estimated from responses to depolarizing current ramps (50 pA/s, 3 s). Connectivity between cells in layer 1 and layer 2 of MEC was established by performing simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and measuring the changes in membrane potential of one cell during injection of current to evoke an action potential (1–2 nA, 3ms) in the other cell. Responses to optogenetic activation of LEC fiber inputs to MEC were evaluated by stimulation with 470 nm wavelength light for 3ms at 22.4 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. The majority of neurons had subthreshold membrane potential responses to stimulation at this intensity, but for neurons in which action potentials were evoked (n=15) the threshold intensity required to elicit spiking responses was established and stimulation protocols were repeated at an intensity just below this threshold. To test roles of glutamate and GABA receptors, a baseline series of responses to light stimulation were recorded, glutamate or GABA receptor antagonists were bath-applied, and then responses to light stimulation were re-evaluated using the same stimulation protocols. Glutamatergic transmission was blocked using antagonists for AMPA (NBQX, 10 µM) and NMDA receptors (APV, 50 µM). GABAergic transmission was blocked using antagonists for GABA<sub>A</sub> (Gabazine, 10 µM) and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors (CGP 55485, 100 µM). To isolate monosynaptic connections, the response to light stimulation was re-evaluated after bath application of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel-blocker tetrodotoxin (500 nM) and Kv channel-blocker 4-AP (200 µM). Upon completion of investigatory protocols, diffusion of biocytin into the cell was encouraged by injecting large depolarizing currents into the cell (15x4 nA, 100ms steps, 1 Hz). Each cell was left with the electrode attached for up to 90 min before being transferred to PFA (4%). Slices were stored at 4 °C for a minimum of 24 hr before histological processing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recovery of neuronal morphology</title><p>Fixed slices containing biocytin-filled neurons were washed with PBS 4 x for 10 min and transferred to a solution containing AlexaFluor Streptavidin 647 (Invitrogen, Cat # S21374, 1:500) and Neurotrace 435/55 (Invitrogen, Cat # N21479, 1:500) in 0.3% PBS-T for 24–48 hr at room temperature. Slices were washed with PBS-T 4 x for 20 min and then mounted and cover-slipped with Mowiol. Mounted sections were stored at 4 °C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopy</title><p>Epifluorescent images were acquired using a Zeiss Axioscan slide scanner with ZenPro software. Confocal images were acquired using a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope and ZenPro software. To confirm the location of virus expression in the LEC or MEC, images were acquired at a ×10 magnification on the epifluorescent microscope or using a 10 x or 20 x objective on the confocal microscope. Images used for quantification of synaptic puncta in the MEC or establishing the morphology and position of biocytin-filled neurons were acquired on the confocal microscope. For quantification of synaptic puncta, z-stacks were acquired of regions of interest (ROI) at 1 µM steps using a 40 x oil-dipped objective. For imaging of neurons after slice electrophysiology, z-stacks were acquired of biocytin-filled cells at 1–2 µM steps using a 20 x objective. Where possible, different cell types were distinguished by visual comparison of the shape of the soma and arrangement of dendrites to published morphological descriptions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of immunohistochemistry</title><p>For anatomical experiments, the location of virus expression was determined by referencing an atlas of the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paxinos and Franklin, 2003</xref>). Puncta density and fluorescence intensity of fan cell axons was quantified in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fiji.sc">http://fiji.sc</ext-link>) using the 3D Objects Counter plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/3D_Objects_Counter">https://imagej.net/3D_Objects_Counter</ext-link>). Threshold values were set for each ROI to subtract background fluorescence. For quantification across layers, a rectangular extract (150 µm wide) was taken from the ROI for each layer of MEC. For quantification across the mediolateral axis of MEC, six sequential identical rectangular extracts (150 µm wide) were taken from the ROI to span the mediolateral extent of layer 1, starting from the border of MEC with the parasubiculum. Within each extract, volumetric puncta density was calculated as puncta count/tissue volume (mm<sup>3</sup>). To compare the fluorescence intensity of fan cell axons labelled in the dentate gyrus (DG) and MEC, ROIs (100 x 50 µm) were taken from the outer molecular layer (oml) of DG and layer 1 of MEC. Pixel intensity was calculated as a gray value from a possible range of 1–255, where 1 corresponds to black and 255 corresponds to white. Mean pixel intensity was calculated for each ROI, and the mean pixel intensity of a baseline ROI of the same size, taken from a region of perirhinal cortex with no labelled axons, was subtracted from this value. For comparison of fluorescence intensity with location, the RGB profiler plug-in (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/plugins/rgb-profiler">https://imagej.net/plugins/rgb-profiler</ext-link>) was used to extract mean pixel intensities across a 400 x 100 µm (MEC) or 200 x 100 µm (DG) window to produce expression plots showing changes in intensity across MEC or DG layers. ROIs were oriented so that layers were perpendicular to distance. Values were normalised to the minimum and maximum fluorescence values using the formula: (intensity value - minimum intensity value) / (maximum intensity value - minimum intensity value). The slice with the brightest fluorescence from each animal was chosen for these analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of electrophysiological data</title><p>Neurons were classified into different types by their electrophysiological profiles and morphology. Interneurons in layer 2 of the MEC were classified as either low-threshold spiking or fast-spiking using criteria described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gonzalez-Sulser et al., 2014</xref>. Electrophysiological data were analyzed with AxoGraph (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://axographx.com">https://axographx.com</ext-link>), IGOR Pro (Wavemetrics, USA) using Neuromatic (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com">http://www.neuromatic.thinkrandom.com</ext-link>), and customised MATLAB scripts. Input resistance, time constant and time-dependent inward rectification (‘sag’) were measured from the membrane potential response to hyperpolarizing current steps (–80 or –40 pA). Input resistance was estimated by dividing the steady-state voltage change from the resting membrane potential by the amplitude of the injected current. Time constant was estimated as the time taken for the change in voltage to reach ~63% of its steady-state value. Sag was measured as the ratio between the maximum decrease in voltage and the steady-state decrease in voltage. Rheobase was measured as the minimum amplitude of depolarizing current which elicited an action potential response. Action potential duration was measured from the action potential threshold, which was defined as the point at which the first derivative of the membrane potential exceeded 1 mV ms<sup>–1</sup>. Action potential amplitude was measured as the change in voltage between the action potential threshold and peak. To determine the resonant frequency of the cell, membrane impedance was first calculated by dividing the Fourier transform of the membrane voltage response by the Fourier transform of the input current from the ZAP protocol, which was then converted into magnitude and phase components. The resonant frequency was defined as the input frequency which corresponded to the peak impedance magnitude. To quantify the response of MEC neurons to optogenetic stimulation of inputs from LEC, the change in amplitude was measured between baseline resting membrane potential (average of 490ms window before stimulation, excluding the 10 ms immediately prior to stimulation) and the membrane response to stimulation (average of 1ms window after stimulation at peak depolarisation and hyperpolarisation). For experiments where trains of stimuli were delivered, the baseline window was calculated as the average of a 990 ms window before stimulation (excluding the 10 ms immediately prior to stimulation) and the change in amplitude for each pulse was measured as the peak depolarisation and hyperpolarisation in the window (100 ms for 10 Hz or 50 ms for 20 Hz stimulation) between pulses. The latency and half-width were usually measured for postsynaptic potentials with amplitudes ≥ 1 mV. For half-width measurements of excitatory potentials from experiments with GABA receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) or half-width measurements of inhibitory potentials evoked by stimulation of layer 1 interneurons in paired recording experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), half-width values were calculated from the single average of all pulses to optimise measurement of smaller potentials. The latency of postsynaptic potentials was measured as the time taken from stimulus onset to reach a10 % deviation from baseline membrane potential. The ratios of excitation to inhibition in postsynaptic potentials evoked after stimulation of fan cell axons were calculated using the following formula: ratio = mean peak amplitude of excitatory component/(mean peak amplitude of excitatory component-absolute value of the mean peak amplitude of the inhibitory component).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Establishing neuron position in MEC</title><p>For slice electrophysiology experiments, the depth of the slice from bregma and the borders of the LEC and the MEC were determined by referencing an atlas of the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Paxinos and Franklin, 2003</xref>). For each biocytin-filled cell in the MEC, the encompassing layer was determined by examining the soma position in relation to laminar delineation with counterstaining using Neurotrace. The distance of the soma from the medial MEC border with the parasubiculum was measured in ImageJ using a built-in tool calibrated to the scale of the image. Where tissue damage or insufficient reconstruction of the neuron prevented precise localisation of the neuron to a dorsoventral or mediolateral position, the neuron was excluded from analyses of neuron position in relation to membrane response properties. In slices with expression of AAV in the LEC, the region of virus expression was examined in relation to the border between LEC and MEC. Data was discarded from all animals with any expression of virus in MEC or apparent labelling of MEC axons in their established termination zone in the middle molecular layer of the dentate gyrus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses and plots were generated using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). Non-parametric statistics were used in all analyses because our datasets contained non-normal distributions, small samples sizes, and unequal group sizes. To compare puncta density across layers or the mediolateral axis of the MEC, we used a repeated measures Friedman test with layer or distance of the cell body from the MEC border with parasubiculum as factors. The effect size of the result was quantified with Kendall’s <italic>W</italic>. A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the fluorescence intensity of fan cell axons in the dentate gyrus and MEC. Posthoc comparisons for repeated measures Friedman tests were performed using pairwise Wilcoxon tests with a Bonferroni adjustment for multiple comparisons. To compare membrane response amplitudes or latencies across principal cell types, we performed Kruskall-Wallis tests with cell type as a between-subjects factor. Posthoc pairwise comparisons for Kruskal-Wallis tests were performed using a Dunn test with a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Analysis of measurements of response amplitudes and width after application of receptor antagonists was performed using a Friedman test with receptor antagonist as a within-subjects factor and data grouped by either cell or stimulus sweep (n sweeps: 30–50). A Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare postsynaptic response amplitudes and latencies across layer 1 and layer 2 interneurons and to compare ratios of excitation to inhibition across layer 2 stellate and pyramidal cells. Distributions of values were compared between cell types using Kolgmorov-Smirnov tests. The relationships between the amplitude of excitatory and inhibitory components, resting membrane potentials and membrane response characteristics, or neuron location and membrane response characteristics were quantified using simple linear regression models with the equation <italic>y</italic> = β0 + β1x + ϵ, where β0 is the estimate of the intercept, β1 is the estimate of the effect of <italic>x</italic> on <italic>y</italic>, and ϵ is a random variable/error. Model fit was quantified using an <italic>F</italic>-statistic. Amplitude measurements between single pulse data, and data from the first and last sweep of 10 Hz or 20 Hz stimulation were compared using paired Wilcoxon tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Data availability statement</title><p>Data will be made available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/777">https://datashare.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/777</ext-link>.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Kei Igarashi (Reviewer #1); Mark Brandon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 2 have a number of comments regarding citations and text changes that should be made. Reviewer 3 also has some suggestions regarding combining figures that should be considered but are not necessary for the revision.</p><p>2) Reviewer 2 suggests quantifying the proportion of fan cells that project to both MEC and DG. If this is possible to do, I would recommend adding it, as it would add significant relevance to this report.</p><p>3) Reviewer 3 raises a few points that should be addressed. First, to show population data and statistical analyses for the points in Figures 2 and 3, rather than just example images. Second, discussion regarding why NBQX does not completely block the ESPSs and disynaptic IPSPs (see more detailed comment below). Third, discussion regarding the chloride reversal potential (see more detailed comment below).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Page 2 Line 5. The reference on the parallel streams from the LEC and MEC needs to include several established reviews by Rebecca Burwell, Menno Witter, and Jim Knierim.</p><p>2. Page 2 Line 10. &quot;neurons in the LEC encode local features of the environment&quot;</p><p>Please include Igarashi et al., 2014 and Lee et al 2021 here. As these works showed the encoding of olfactory memory by LEC neurons, the sentence might be like this: &quot;neurons in the LEC encode local features and items near animals generated from tactile and olfactory inputs.&quot;</p><p>3. Page 3 Line 1. &quot;fan cells in LEC have been shown to contribute to the processing of olfactory information (Lee et al 2021; Leitner et al., 2016)&quot;</p><p>Lee et al paper showed encoding of olfactory memory by fan cells whereas Leitner paper showed only responses of fan cells to olfactory stimuli in anaesthetized animals.

Are → and.</p><p>Interneurons in L1 of MEC mediate slow components of inhibitory input to layer 2 principal neurons</p><p>&quot;The EPSPs were abolished after application of NBQX and AP-5 (Figure 7E), indicating that they are glutamatergic, and were maintained in the presence of TTX and 4-AP, indicating that they result from direct monosynaptic activation (Figure 7F)&quot; (end of the second paragraph) EPSPs in L1/L2 INs are abolished in the presence of TTX but recovered after application of 4-AP.</p><p>Comments</p><p>It would be nice to have an idea of the proportion of fan cells that project to both MEC and DG. This would add significant relevance to this report, especially if the point of this study is to revise the classic entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. This point is discussed at the beginning of the Discussion section. However, elucidating this question is in my opinion quite important to speculate about the relevance of this new route of communication between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus.</p><p>Since the authors also observed that a fair proportion of L2 SC in the LEC project to L3 PC in the MEC (that project to CA1) and that L2 SCs make a rich connection with L1 IN. Thus, I would also discuss the implication of this result regarding the classic view of the temporammonic pathway function. As the authors speculate that this new route might be the first stage of integrating &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot;, through L3 PC to CA1, it might also have important implications in the &quot;when&quot; information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I feel that there are more figures than necessary to get the most straightforward points the authors are making across. Figures 1-3 seem like they could be combined, as they are all making points about the anatomy which aren't overly complex individually. Maybe figures 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 could also be combined, as they are thematically similar.</p><p>I think it's important to show population data and statistical analyses for the points made in Figures2 and 3 rather than just example images.</p><p>Two potential issues of concern with the physiology:</p><p>1. Why does NBQX not completely block the EPSPs and disynaptic IPSPs? It would be highly unusual for these to be mediated by NMDARs in the absence of AMPARs at hyperpolarized voltages and normal extracellular divalent concentrations. The authors do not mention anything about this. An NMDAR-mediated form of transmission would be particularly interesting in this circuit and is worth further discussion and study.</p><p>2. The authors are rightly interested in the effects of inhibition in this circuit but don't seem to discuss the chloride reversal potential, which may be critically important for mediating the effects they have observed. They should specifically deal with this point.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83008.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 2 have a number of comments regarding citations and text changes that should be made.

However, collectively the evidence in this paper argues that the behavioural deficits result from disruption of communication between the MEC/LEC and dentate gyrus/CA3. Because fan cells are the source of input from the LEC to the dentate gyrus/CA3, the evidence in the study therefore points to a role of fan cells in learning of object locations. Given this we have kept the sentence as it is. Hopefully the question raised and our response here will be helpful to readers interested in a more nuanced interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

This would add significant relevance to this report, especially if the point of this study is to revise the classic entorhinal-hippocampal circuit. This point is discussed at the beginning of the Discussion section. However, elucidating this question is in my opinion quite important to speculate about the relevance of this new route of communication between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results address this in two ways:</p><p>First, the retrograde labelling experiment presented in Figure 1A establishes a lower bound (p 4, line 123). These data show that ~ 22 % of fan cells are labelled in the LEC following injection of retrograde tracers into the MEC. Because the efficiency of labelling is unknown, and is likely to be incomplete, it is probable that the actual proportion is much higher.</p><p>Second, we have compared fluorescence intensity of axons in dentate gyrus and MEC after labelling fan cells with different strategies. When fan cells were labelled using the Sim1:Cre mouse line (Figure 1B) or based on their projection to the hippocampus (Figure 2A), the intensity of labelling appears similar in the MEC and DG (Figure 1B, Figure 2D, E). This would be expected if the average efficacy of projections to each area is similar. When fan cells were labelled by their input from the prefrontal cortex, their axonal fluorescence in the MEC and DG was similar (Figure 3G), although when they were labelled by their input from the piriform cortex, their axonal fluorescence appeared greater in the DG compared to MEC (Figure 3D), hinting at a degree of heterogeneity in the organisation of the fan cell subpopulations. These analyses are referenced in the main text (p 5, lines 151-153; p 12, lines 410-412) and described in the Methods (p 21, lines 682-695; p 23, lines 761-762).</p><p>In considering this point it is important also to recognise that our electrophysiological experiments clearly demonstrate a substantial functional impact of the pathway. This holds whether all DG projecting fan cells project to MEC, or whether only a subset do. In either case our data argue for functional importance of the pathway, although in each scenario the computational role would be expected to differ.</p><p>In summary, our analyses support the interpretation that many (and perhaps all) fan cells project to both the DG and the MEC, and clearly show the substantial functional impact of this projection. While delineating variability between individual fan cells in their connectivity is beyond the scope of the experiments described here, we agree that this will be an important question to address in the future. We therefore note in the Discussion that further answers to the Reviewer’s question will likely require reconstructions of the axons from many individual fan cells (p 12, lines 411-412).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the authors also observed that a fair proportion of L2 SC in the LEC project to L3 PC in the MEC (that project to CA1) and that L2 SCs make a rich connection with L1 IN. Thus, I would also discuss the implication of this result regarding the classic view of the temporammonic pathway function. As the authors speculate that this new route might be the first stage of integrating &quot;what&quot; and &quot;where&quot;, through L3 PC to CA1, it might also have important implications in the &quot;when&quot; information.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point which we now consider in the Ideas and Speculation part of the discussion (p 15, lines 493-497).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I feel that there are more figures than necessary to get the most straightforward points the authors are making across. Figures 1-3 seem like they could be combined, as they are all making points about the anatomy which aren't overly complex individually. Maybe figures 7 and 8 and 9 and 10 could also be combined, as they are thematically similar.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully considered this suggestion. Though there is thematic overlap in some instances, the question addressed by each figure is distinct. We therefore feel that condensing the figures would reduce clarity. The inevitable reduction in size of the panels would also make it harder for a reader to assess the data. Given that <italic>eLife</italic> does not have constraints on space we have therefore kept the number of figures the same as in the original submission.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it's important to show population data and statistical analyses for the points made in Figures2 and 3 rather than just example images.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added measurements of axonal fluorescence intensity in dentate gyrus and MEC to Figures 2 and 3. This data shows an increase in layer 1 relative to the baseline fluorescence in both areas for all experiments across all animals. We refer to these data in the Results section (p 5, lines 151-153; p 12, lines 410-412) and described the additional analyses in the methods section (p 21, lines 682-695; p 23, lines 761-762).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Two potential issues of concern with the physiology:</p><p>1. Why does NBQX not completely block the EPSPs and disynaptic IPSPs? It would be highly unusual for these to be mediated by NMDARs in the absence of AMPARs at hyperpolarized voltages and normal extracellular divalent concentrations. The authors do not mention anything about this. An NMDAR-mediated form of transmission would be particularly interesting in this circuit and is worth further discussion and study.</p></disp-quote><p>In our view the most likely explanation, and also the most mundane, is that the block of NMDA receptors by physiological Mg<sup>2+</sup> is incomplete at membrane potentials between -60 mV and -70 mV. This is well established (e.g. see Wrighton et al., J. Physiol., 2008) although perhaps often overlooked. Two more exotic possible explanations also come to mind. First, it may be that the remaining response is mediated by NMDA receptors assembled from the less Mg<sup>2+</sup> sensitive GluN2C and GluN2D subunits (e.g. see Wyllie et al. Neuropharmacology, 2013). This seems unlikely given their expression level is low in the mature MEC. Second, it may be that the synaptic locations are depolarised relative to the recording site at the soma. Because both ideas are speculative at this point and as they are not central to the core hypotheses we aim to test, we have not addressed them further in the text. We hope the comment here will be of use to an interested reader.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors are rightly interested in the effects of inhibition in this circuit but don't seem to discuss the chloride reversal potential, which may be critically important for mediating the effects they have observed. They should specifically deal with this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume here that the reviewer is referring to whether differences in the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential could contribute to heterogeneity of the responses of L2SCs. Because in our experiments the recorded neurons are dialysed with the pipette solution we expect the chloride reversal potential to be similar between neurons. Variability in the E-I ratio could result from differences in the baseline membrane potential relative to the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential. However, we find that in L2 SCs the E-I ratio is independent of the baseline membrane potential (discussed on p 10, para 2 and shown in Figure 9, Supplement 1A). This may be because the peak of the IPSP is often mediated by the GABAB component, in which case it will not be determined by the Cl<sup>-</sup> reversal potential (e.g. see Figure 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
