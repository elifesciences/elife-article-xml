biology has reached unprecedented levels of detail, and computer visualisation techniques can be used to create three-dimensional (3D) representations of cells and their environment that are useful in both teaching and research. However, extracting and integrating the relevant scientific data, and then presenting them in an effective way, can pose substantial computational and aesthetic challenges. Here we report how computer artists, experts in computer graphics and cell biologists have collaborated to produce a tool called Nanoscape that allows users to explore and interact with 3D representations of cells and their environment that are both scientifically accurate and visually appealing. We believe that using Nanoscape as an immersive learning application will lead to an improved understanding of the complexities of cellular scales, densities and interactions compared with traditional learning modalities.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>3D visualisation</kwd><kwd>science education</kwd><kwd>virtual reality</kwd><kwd>receptors</kwd><kwd>tumour environment</kwd><kwd>science forum</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ARC Centre of Excellence in Convergent Bio-nano Science &amp; Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CE140100036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadir</surname><given-names>Shereen R</given-names></name><name><surname>Lilja</surname><given-names>Andrew</given-names></name><name><surname>Gunn</surname><given-names>Nick</given-names></name><name><surname>Strong</surname><given-names>Campbell</given-names></name><name><surname>Hughes</surname><given-names>Rowan T</given-names></name><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>Benjamin J</given-names></name><name><surname>Rae</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Parton</surname><given-names>Robert G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Computer visualization techniques developed for video games can be repurposed to enable viewers to explore cells and their environment in three dimensions.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Template</meta-name><meta-value>5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Since the invention of the microscope in the 16<sup>th</sup> century and the subsequent discovery of a world concealed from our bare eyes, advances in experimental science and technology have excelled our understanding of cell biology. Modern imaging techniques were central to unravelling the intricacies of the cellular landscape at a molecular level. X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy and cryo-electron microscopy achieve atomic- or near-atomic resolution of individual proteins and cell architecture, while live-cell imaging enables observation of cellular structures, processes and behaviours in real-time. Further, the use of enhanced fluorescent tags and biosensors has shed considerable light on protein kinetics, interactions and diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wollman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodsell et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Three-dimensional (3D) visualisation of scientific concepts and experimental data is nowadays a popular tool to provide insight where traditional, two-dimensional graphical illustrations or descriptive text cannot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goodsell and Jenkinson, 2018</xref>). The educational benefits are numerous, from clarifying complex or abstract concepts to testing hypotheses and generating new ideas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daly et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenkinson and McGill, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">McClean et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kadir et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, no single experimental modality is sufficient to elucidate the structure and dynamics of macromolecular assemblies and cellular processes. Therefore, integrative modelling of data from multiple, complementary techniques and scientific disciplines is crucial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ornes, 2016</xref>). Scientific journals and bioinformatics databases contain a wealth of such data, but the extraction, interpretation and consideration of the relevant data is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Conesa and Beck, 2019</xref>). Moreover, many biomedical visualisations do not cite journals or databases, meaning that users do not know if a given visualisation has been informed by empirical data, or if it owes more to artistic license (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodsell and Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jantzen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Biomedical animators often use 3D computer animation and modelling software popular in the games and entertainment industry, such as Autodesk Maya (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://autodesk.com/maya">https://autodesk.com/maya</ext-link>), SideFX Houdini (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/">https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/</ext-link>) and Pixologic Zbrush (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pixologic.com/features/about-zbrush.php">http://pixologic.com/features/about-zbrush.php</ext-link>). However, the true complexity of the cellular environments is often deliberately diminished to clarify or emphasise features and mechanisms of interest. It may also be reduced for other reasons, such as technical limitations of computer graphics or time constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodsell and Johnson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The last couple of decades have seen an increase in visualisation software tools and accurately scaled, static reconstructions at the molecular level. Notable examples are the HIV-1 virus and <italic>Mycoplasma mycoides</italic> (created with the packing algorithm CellPACK), and a snapshot of a synaptic bouton obtained through integrating a plethora of imaging techniques, quantitative immunoblotting and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, simulations of Brownian or molecular dynamics have been incorporated into 3D atomic resolution models of bacterial cytoplasmic subsections to examine the effect of the interactions, stability and diffusion of proteins in crowded cellular environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feig et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McGuffee and Elcock, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, mathematical and computational modelling platforms such as V-Cell, M-cell, and E-cell are designed to be used by experimental biologists and theoretical biophysicists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moraru et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stiles and Bartol, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stiles et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tomita et al., 1999</xref>). These platforms can run simulations of cell biological phenomena based on a combination of multiple ‘omics’ technologies and imaging data, thereby enabling scientists to analyse 3D representations of their raw data and test hypotheses with varying degrees of molecular and spatial resolution.</p><p>However, many of the existing techniques described above do not fully represent cellular environments, mostly due to sheer complexity but also because of lack of funding or knowledge, or computational limitations. Our previous project (Journey to the Centre of the Cell) already showed significant improvement in the students’ comprehension of cellular structures and processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnston et al., 2018</xref>). It provided an immersive, virtual reality educational experience of an entire 3D cell based on serial, block-face scanning electron microscope imaging data. Although the project successfully depicted cellular features from real microscopy data, portrayal of the cell surface environment had to be oversimplified due to various constraints, including working at higher virtual reality frame rates (over 90 fps) and a smaller development team.</p><p>Nanoscape is a collaborative follow-up project between computer artists, experts in computer graphics and cell biologists to create an interactive real-time open-world experience that enables a user to navigate a cell terrain within a tumour microenvironment. This first-of-its-kind application distils and integrates a vast archive of scientific data into an interactive immersive experience using a comprehensive library of existing visualisation tools, while employing distinct principles of art and design. Nanoscape is primarily an educational tool for tertiary-level science students, and it is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1654050/Nanoscape">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1654050/Nanoscape</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Using Nanoscape to visualize cell surface proteins and cancer cells</title><p>Here, we present some of the challenges and limitations experienced during the data collection process and the conceptualisation of 3D assets, and examine the practicability of visually replicating experimental data. We discuss the implications of gaps in scientific knowledge, modification or simplification of data, and the use of artistic license for visual clarity. Our work raises important questions about whether molecular visualisations can support outcomes beyond the educational field and could help experimentalists to better understand their data.</p><p>As part of the pre-production stage, information on the major surface components, extracellular features and processes commonly found in breast cancer scenarios was collated through a comprehensive review of the literature along with analysis of experimental data obtained from scientific collaborators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This cell type was chosen as the focus of the visualisation due to the abundance of protein and structural data available from these sources.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Relative scales and temporal dynamics of the cell surface components featured in Nanoscape.</title><p>A 3D model of a breast cancer cell (upper left panel).

Subsequently, over 30 prevalent surface proteins associated with breast cancer that were available from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB) were selected and organised in a cast of characters (see Appendix 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berman et al., 2000</xref>).

Molecular Maya (mMaya) modelling and rigging kits (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/">https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/</ext-link>), which qualitatively replicate molecular dynamics, were used to simulate ligand binding events and transitions between conformational states (see Materials and methods). These rudimentary mechanism of action animations provided an interpretation of protein movement based on experimental data available and were subsequently used to inform the artistic design team on how best to approach rigging a refined, stylised 3D protein mesh using traditional rigging methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Representations of surface receptors and plasma membrane lipids.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural and dynamic information about the four proteins in the ErbB family of proteins (EGFR, Her2, Her3, and Her4) and their ligands.

Unfortunately, most proteins have no reliable, or only partial experimentally determined 3D structures, available. Such limitations may lead to a presentation of a single, ‘native’ structure in visualisations, instead of multiple flexible conformational variations, further perpetuating misconceptions about protein structure, folding, stability and effects of mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Robic, 2010</xref>). Where possible, Nanoscape used several conformational states of proteins sourced from the PDB as well as conformational changes simulated with mMaya (see Materials and methods). The choice of protein mesh detail and representation will also affect the viewer. A low poly mesh will significantly reduce the computational burden in rendering but may compromise important scientific information, such as the specificity of a ligand binding pocket that may be essential for conveying the mechanism of action. Nanoscape incorporates a level-of-detail feature that reduces the polygon density of proteins as a function of distance to the user, thereby decreasing the computational burden of distant proteins without affecting perceived detail. It also allows more proteins to be displayed on screen simultaneously.</p><p>Protein dynamics can range from localised movement in specific residues to large rearrangements in domains and multiple subunits. Representing these broad spatio-temporal scales is a major challenge for biomedical animators. Protein bond vibrations and domain motions can range from femtoseconds to milliseconds respectively, and in turn, many cellular processes occur in the order of seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGill, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Miao et al., 2019</xref>). Multi-scale representations in landscape animations of cells often have constrained computer graphics performances, sacrificing atomic resolution and motion.</p><p>Cellular environments are heterogeneous, highly dynamic and densely packed. Up to 20% to 30% of intracellular environments is occupied by macromolecular components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goodsell et al., 2020</xref>). Molecular crowding is known to influence the association and diffusion of proteins, as well as the rates of enzyme-catalysed reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mourão et al., 2014</xref>). Yet many visualisations eschew depicting stochastic motion and extreme crowding due to fear of losing focus on the visual narrative or cognitive overload (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Goodsell and Johnson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenkinson and McGill, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, the computational expense involved with animating and rendering large numbers of meshes is a significant hurdle. However, underrepresentation or oversimplification has been shown to worsen deep rooted misconceptions, particularly amongst students (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Garvin-Doxas and Klymkowsky, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gauthier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, our inherent ability to picture such numbers in real life is a challenge, and therefore it is useful to perform ‘sanity checks’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zoppè, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the feasibility of replicating receptor densities based on empirical data, using the 3D computer graphics application Blender (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.blender.org/">https://www.blender.org/</ext-link>) and the plugin autoPACK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2015</xref>).

The packing simulations revealed 12,650 proteins of variable sizes were easily accommodated with moderate molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The diversity of surface proteins varies significantly between different cell types, and whilst a fairly equal distribution was modelled for this scenario, proteins are often clustered in functional units or spread unevenly. In addition, the limitations of experimental techniques ought to be scrutinised, for instance, variations in the specificity of antibodies measured with flow cytometry could potentially lead to under- or over exaggeration of numbers. Often, the receptor density data measured is only a snapshot in time, while the receptor population on a cell is highly dynamic and stochastic. Nevertheless, further exploration of experimentally derived population densities using packing algorithms such as autoPACK will improve our understanding of surface protein distribution and organisation.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cell surface receptor density modelling from experimental data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PDB meshes of 6 well-known surface biomarkers (CD44, EGFR, EpCAM, Her2, ICAM1 and αVβ3 integrin) on MDA-MB-231 cells from flow cytometry data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cahall et al., 2015</xref>).

A more authentic depiction might be a random walk (constrained by kinetics and thermodynamics) through a packed environment, where the ligand undergoes many non-specific interactions before binding successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenkinson and McGill, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Robic, 2010</xref>). Biomedical artists may be disinclined to animate unsuccessful binding events to save on animation and render time, but this will only deepen superficial understanding or promote misconceptions. Whether visual clutter in crowded molecular environments has a negative impact on audiences is a point of contention.

It is also a landscape where many signalling events and biological processes take place. Inside cells, specialised compartments are enclosed by lipid membranes to form discrete organelles, segregating their contents from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kobayashi and Menon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lipidomics studies have brought great insight into the structure, dynamics and interactions of a variety of lipids within cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingólfsson et al., 2014</xref>).

The most common structural lipids in eukaryotic membranes are glycerolipids (~65%), sterols (~25%) and sphingolipids (~10%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shahane et al., 2019</xref>). Whilst cholesterol is generally evenly distributed between the bilayer leaflets, an asymmetric distribution of lipids contributes to their functionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>). The inner leaflet has a greater proportion of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol lipids; in contrast, the outer leaflet is more abundant in phosphatidylcholine and sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kobayashi and Menon, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In vivo imaging of membranes is experimentally difficult due to their inherent flexibility and highly dynamic fluctuations. Consequently, computational simulations mainly based on in vitro data have been important for understanding the heterogeneity and dynamics of plasma membranes that may exist in distinct phases, and the organisation of protein complexes therein. Near-atomic models of cell membranes composed of numerous lipid constitutions have been created in silico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ingólfsson et al., 2014</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> depicts a typical lipid bilayer of a cancer cell, with a representative complement of lipid species visualised using the CHARMM-GUI Membrane Builder to highlight some of the differences between the inner and outer leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shahane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jo et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lipids can move rotationally and laterally within their leaflet and transversely between bilayers. Lateral mobility can be expressed by an experimentally determined diffusion coefficient (D). Many lipids have a D value of ~1 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, which corresponds to a lipid diffusing a distance of 2 μm within 1 s. In contrast, transverse diffusion or ‘flip-flop’ is a far slower process that can take hours and is regulated by flippases and floppases to maintain bilayer asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Replicating lateral diffusion of millions of lipids at speed in whole-cell and environmental molecular visualisations is not only computationally intensive – it is also questionable whether the viewer can fully observe or appreciate such minutiae in a large scene or glean any real insight.

It works as a scaffold for the cellular environment and can also influence behaviours, processes and communication of a cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insua-Rodríguez and Oskarsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mouw et al., 2014</xref>). The ECM consists of two biochemically and morphologically distinct forms: the basement membrane, which is a thin layer that forms between epithelial and stromal cells, and the adjacent interstitial matrix, which is a more loosely organised network surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mouw et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite its vital role, the ECM is often overlooked in many cellular and molecular visualisations due to several reasons. Firstly, high resolution imaging of the ECM in its native state is inherently difficult in opaque tissue. Whilst optical tissue clearing and decellularisation methods are routinely used to enhance the visibility in stained tissues and organs, they are often harsh treatments that may modify the physical and chemical properties of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acuna et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, many in vitro models consisting of a limited mix of collagens and matrix proteins, such as cells suspended in 3D gels, may not always be physiologically relevant.</p><p>The components within the matrix are often very large macromolecular complexes, and although complete protein sequences are available on Uniprot, many PDB structures are only of truncated or incomplete proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">UniProt Consortium, 2018</xref>). Consequently, it is an arduous task to visualise these large ECM structures in their entirety, and some artistic license may be needed.</p><p>To visualise the ECM within a 3D breast tumour microenvironment, we collated information from the literature, including images, and sought advice from experts in the field during the conceptualisation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Although there are a multitude of ECM components that make up the tumour microenvironment, for simplicity it was decided the focus would be only on four key ECM players: collagens I and IV, hyaluronic acid and fibronectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mouw et al., 2014</xref>).

Following advice from an ECM expert (S.

Exactly how ECM proteins interact with one another to eventually form higher order structures such as fibrils, fibres and ultimately matrices, is very unclear. ECM remodelling is a highly dynamic ongoing process, which involves both proteolytic breakdown of existing matrix components by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) and deposition of new components by cells. This intrinsic activity has significant implications on tissue development, cell migration and pathologies including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Frantz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insua-Rodríguez and Oskarsson, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mouw et al., 2014</xref>).

This may be a combination of incomplete information about precise binding interactions, and a reluctance to complicate a scene for fear of cognitive overload. However, its frequent omission or aggressive simplification will only exacerbate a naive view of the ECM in vivo, whereas there is evidence that more complex molecular representations can in fact improve understanding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jenkinson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenkinson and McGill, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Tumour microenvironment components</title><p>In addition to malignant cells and the ECM, a breast tumour microenvironment is made up of a complex mix of cells (including immune cells, fibroblasts, pericytes and adipocytes), blood vessels, lymphatics and various signalling molecules, and many studies show that cancer cells significantly impact their environment; it has also been shown that interactions with non-transformed cells and the tumour vasculature promote the progression of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balkwill et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Quail and Joyce, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Insua-Rodríguez and Oskarsson, 2016</xref>).

Whilst the dynamics of the major cellular processes could be animated accurately, atomic resolution was sacrificed, and protein conformational movement was appreciably slowed down to enable viewers to observe protein-protein interactions more clearly.

These arts-led influences allow Nanoscape to sit alone as a piece of science-based art, inviting the user to wonder at the chaotic molecular landscapes within the body. Whether this type of visualisation offers benefits to the wider scientific research community is yet to be seen. While the artistic and computer graphics-related treatments of proteins and cellular components in Nanoscape is unlikely to make this application suitable for rigorous data interrogation, it may stimulate more holistic reflection of biological systems. Applications that allow multimodal data exploration are promising and may promote broader scientific speculation than each modality examined separately.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Data collection archiving</title><p>Created in 1971, the PDB remains the largest international repository for experimentally determined atomic structures. Considerable progress has been made in recent years to develop platforms and standards for archiving, validating, and disseminating new biological models defined by the PDBx/mmCIF dictionary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Young et al., 2018</xref>). Integrative or hybrid modelling structures are, however, not currently included in the PDB because data standards for archiving have not yet been implemented. Hence, the PDB-Dev was established in 2018 as a prototype archiving system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org">https://pdb-dev.wwpdb.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Vallat et al., 2018</xref>). This repository contains embedded 3D viewers, links to download structures and related database entries, but also includes citations, input data and software used in the creation of models. Whilst many biomedical animators take models from such sources, clear citation of their molecular visualisation content is often limited.</p><p>The information gathered during the pre-production phase of Nanoscape is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and Appendix 1 (which includes the PDB IDs for the proteins). Furthermore, Appendixes 2–9 document the methodology behind the creation of mMaya mechanism-of-action animations for the following receptors: EGFR and Her3 (Appendix 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>); αVβ3 integrin (Appendix 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>); VEGFR1 (Appendix 4; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sarabipour et al., 2016</xref>); c-KIT (Appendix 5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Felix et al., 2015</xref>); insulin receptor (Appendix 6; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gutmann et al., 2018</xref>); Tetraspanin CD81 (Appendix 7); the TNFR superfamily of receptors (Appendix 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Naismith et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vanamee and Faustman, 2018</xref>); and GLUT1 (Appendix 9). These appendixes also include associated references, and information on the artistic approaches taken for modelling assets, along with explanatory comments.</p><p>Archiving the information taken from a variety of literature, databases and communication with experts in the field and presenting it in an accessible format will enable others to freely scrutinise or validate the work impartially, and to potentially build new, improved future versions. Selecting and curating vast amounts of information is, however, extremely time consuming, requires an aptitude for interpreting scientific data, and is a constant race to keep abreast of the latest discoveries. Similarly, sustaining up-to-date versions of large-scale complex projects such as Nanoscape whenever new data becomes available, or existing information is proved redundant, is a huge challenge and only reinforces the need for transparent systems of citation in scientific visualisations and comprehensive procedural frameworks to seamlessly implement new models or animations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Nanoscape is an innovative collaboration that has produced a multi-scale, explorable 3D environment of a cell. Our work sheds light on some of the technical and creative processes, decisions and sacrifices made in depicting cell surface entities and dynamics as close to experimental data as possible, whilst balancing concerns for the user experience and visual aesthetics. Although initially its main purpose was to be a unique educational and outreach tool to communicate some of the complexities of a tumour microenvironment, the final visualisation experience may also help experimentalists to reflect upon their own data.</p><p>Integrative modelling and visualisation of biomolecular systems and multi-scale cell models are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and immersive, virtual field trips to a cell environment such as Nanoscape may provide insights into function and behaviour of a cell. As computer hardware and software continues to evolve to cope with processing enormous amounts of data, improved visual or interactive 3D representations may one day lead the way for scientists to perform in silico experiments and potentially help with the development of new drugs.</p><p>Ideally, such a model would fully reflect the spatio-temporal complexities and heterogeneity of the entire cell and its environment and would be capable of continuous iterations and be falsifiable. To accomplish such an ambitious feat, researchers and developers from multiple scientific, computer graphics and design fields must work together.</p></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s5-1"><title>Software</title><p>Commercially available 3D computer graphics software for animation and modelling, Maya (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://autodesk.com/maya">https://autodesk.com/maya</ext-link>), the plugin Molecular Maya (mMaya; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/">https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/</ext-link>), and Zbrush (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pixologic.com/features/about-zbrush.php">http://pixologic.com/features/about-zbrush.php</ext-link>) were used to build and animate assets. The 3D procedural software Houdini (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/">https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini/</ext-link>) and the cross-platform game engine Unity3D (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://unity.com/">https://unity.com/</ext-link>) were used to compile the Nanoscape open-world environment; see ‘Nanoscape open-world compilation’ below for details. Unless stated, all images were rendered in Maya using Arnold at 4K (3840 × 2160).</p><p>The Unity3D game engine was used to assemble the various components into a coherent representation of a cell surface environment. Static assets were imported into the engine by standard methods. The animated cellular processes and horde of proteins were integrated and simulated in Houdini and output as custom caches that are streamed into Unity3D at runtime.</p></sec><sec id="s5-2"><title>Proteins</title><p>Protein structures were retrieved from the RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB), and mechanism-of-action animations were simulated using the mMaya modelling and rigging kits.

All 3D assets were modelled in Zbrush or Maya. Cellular processes were animated in Maya.</p></sec><sec id="s5-5"><title>Surface protein simulations</title><p>Mechanism-of-action (MoA) animations for nine selected receptors were made using the mMaya Modelling and Rigging Kits (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/">https://clarafi.com/tools/mmaya/</ext-link>). mMaya simulations are qualitative and were used to inform the artistic design about general conformational changes and movements that may occur in receptor-ligand binding events. The mMaya Rigging Kit relies on Molecular Mechanics force fields to model molecular structures and their interactions and uses Maya’s particle system and nucleus solver to simulate structural changes and interactions. Molecular Mechanics force fields model how atoms can interact through simplified potentials, and provide a set of spatial restraints (distance, angular, dihedral) to preserve the stereochemistry of each chemical building block imported into the software. By using these force field parameters and molecular topologies, the Rigging Kit builds molecular ‘rigs’ and provides a set of tools for users to apply various external forces interactively. Unlike molecular dynamics simulations, which follow strict thermodynamic laws and make them suited to explore the unsupervised evolution of a molecular system, the mMaya Rigging Kit provides a molecular simulation environment for atomic and coarse-grained molecular models that avoids steric clashes while allowing users to orchestrate complex transitions and large conformational changes.</p><p>All rigs were ‘all atom no hydrogen’ constructs and conformational changes were simulated by either target morphing between two endpoint PDB structures (usually inactive and active states), for example EGFR (1NQL → 3NJP) (see Appendix 2, which includes a MoA animation for EGFR), or manually moving handles added to selected regions of the protein rig (e.g., domains). For some proteins where only one PDB structural state was available, as with Her3 (inactive, 1M6B), movement was approximated by targeting protein domains to morph into the conformational state of another known family member (in this case active Her4 3U7U; see Appendix 2, which includes a MoA animation for Her3). In addition, simulations were inferred from MoA hypotheses published in the literature, and rig handles were applied to manipulate the movement of protein rigs to create a ‘hypothetical’ conformation, as in the case of αVβ3 integrin extended form conformation (see Appendix 3, which includes a MoA animation for αVβ3 integrin). When morph targets were set between a rig and a PDB chain, the PDB chain was positioned manually to be near the rig i.e., the C-termini of the chains were aligned as close as possible. Elastic networks were made for protein domains and the strength adjusted, if necessary, to maintain the domain structures. Rig environmental dynamics were adjusted accordingly (e.g., turbulence field magnitude and damping) and simulations tested until the rig moved in a ‘smooth’ manner. Final rig simulations were cached, and receptor surface or backbone meshes extracted. Ligand binding events were added later by key-framing the motion of the meshes manually. In some of the MoA animations, the ligand binding event was omitted and only the resultant conformational change in the protein was shown.</p></sec><sec id="s5-6"><title>ECM asset creation</title><p>Collagen I is the most abundant structural component of the interstitial membrane. Protein fibrils of varying thicknesses (10 nm–1 μm) were sculpted to highlight striated 67 nm d-space repeats and arranged into bundles to represent fibres. A bespoke insert mesh zBrush tool was created to wrap the proteoglycan hyaluronic acid around collagen I structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,E</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, an insert mesh zBrush tool was made for modelling Collagen IV protomers, which consisted of three intertwining α-chains that form a triple helix 400 nm in length. Two collagen IV protomers were joined head-to-head via NC1 dimers (PDB structure 1M3D) at the C-termini, and four collagen N-termini overlaid to form the 7S domain (28 nm overlaps), to create an extensive branched mesh network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,E</xref>).</p><p>Fibronectin monomers are made up of three repeating units (FN types I, II, III) and usually form dimers linked by a pair of disulphide bonds at their c-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pankov and Yamada, 2002</xref>). Fibronectin dimers are long and can form fibrils (ranging from ~133–190 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Früh et al., 2015</xref>). However, the precise molecular arrangement and their associations with multiple binding partners is still unclear. Alternative splicing can lead to over 20 protein variants in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pankov and Yamada, 2002</xref>). Therefore, a simplified dimer mesh was modelled, which was shown only bound to integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s5-7"><title>Cancer cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts and blood vessel</title><p>Tumour microenvironment components: additional neighbouring cancer cells (~10 μm diameter), cancer-associated fibroblasts (~20 μm length) and a leaky blood vessel (~10 μm diameter) with red blood cells (~6–8 μm diameter) were modelled in zBrush based on various microscopy images taken from the literature (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gael McGill (Reviewer #1); Jodie Jenkinson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers were mostly positive about the article, but they raised a number of concerns, so we are inviting you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses these comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Nanoscape, a data-driven 3D real-time interactive virtual cell environment by Kadir et al. describes the creation of an advanced molecular and cellular landscape that can be explored interactively by users. The authors describe the numerous technical and design considerations and challenges inherent to such an endeavor and provide detailed information on both the software and workflow processes they employed to meet these challenges.</p><p>A clear strength of the paper is not only the multidisciplinary approach that was used to tackle such a complex visualization, but also the extensive technical expertise brought to bear on this task. Whereas many biomedical animators or teams of animators often rely on a relatively limited (yet advanced) software solution to create their work, McGhee et al's team explored the use of many advanced solutions and deployed them where most relevant. This team combined software ranging from 'Hollywood-style' animation packages (Maya, Houdini, Blender), specialized plugins that allow not only structural and other scientific data to be brought in to these 3D packages but also to create guided/coarse-grained conformational morphs and procedural environment creation (BioBlender, Molecular Maya, autoPack), molecular graphics packages commonly used in the scientific community (Chimera), molecular dynamics simulations (CHARMM), and finally game engine technology (Unity). This is an impressive array of software solutions to deploy and the authors do so with skill.</p><p>Despite the technical prowess and impressive visual result, one unfortunate weakness of the paper as currently written is the lack of a clear definition of the 'target user' and a more explicit statement of the intended learning objectives (or intended impact on the user). While the authors do a nice job of addressing the myriad limitations intrinsic to attempting an 'authentic' visualization of molecular and cellular worlds, they do not spend much time describing the design parameters that actually drove their decision-making process. This is touched upon in the 'Nanoscape User Experience' section, but in a rather fleeting way where much of the rich and detailed work and technical description provided in previous sections is rather abruptly wiped away with statements like &quot;depiction of extreme molecular crowding and the ECM had to be compromised.&quot; While the decision itself is absolutely defendable, the reasoning behind it is not properly fleshed out. Given the technical expertise of the team, why not address such limitations by giving the user control of crowding parameters? This is offered as a potential next step in the 'Conclusion', but seems fundamental to a study that explores the difficult balance between what to show and what not to show. As noted above, this reviewer feels that this is partly due to the lack of a clear definition of what the authors consider a &quot;user.&quot; Should the reader assume that this is a non-scientist – and if so, a student? At what educational level? Or is this a science museum goer? What are the specific goals of this experience? The authors mention wanting to promote &quot;some cell biology fundamentals,&quot; but which ones specifically? Why is this set of visual experiences centered around breast cancer?</p><p>A more specific definition of 'user' would also help justify some of the important design decisions that were made both in terms of the representational choices (coarser protein meshes processed in Zbrush, and simplified lipid representations with a texture instead of meshes) but also the simplifications in dynamics of molecular actors (where the authors describe a process of developing 'MoA' animations based on coarse-grained simulations, but then using these only to inform more traditional 'rigging and animation' workflow typical of the entertainment industry). I would also have liked to read more specifics about how the different levels and environments in the visualization were connected together – how does the viewer navigate from one environment to another? Does this experience contains UI/interactive elements to do this beyond the freedom to gaze in any direction?</p><p>Finally, the authors do not touch at all on a discussion of how they would test the efficacy of their visualization on their target audience. While including such a protocol and carrying such work may not be part of this study and beyond the scope of the authors' initial project, I would recommend that they at least address how they would go about such an endeavor because the design challenges they describe and acknowledge throughout the paper cannot, ultimately, be 'guessed' – they have to be tested empirically.</p><p>Overall, the authors have accomplished an impressive amount of work and created what is no doubt a stunning experience. This is also evident in the quality of the images and figure design in the manuscript itself. The supplementary tables and figures are highly detailed and very useful to any who would seek to understand and recreate some of the technical aspects of this work. Although the authors discuss and lament the lack of a database beyond the PDB to share and annotate integrative modeling efforts like theirs, they do not follow-up by offering to share the models created in this study as a way to remedy such a problem. Nevertheless, I would recommend that this study be published in <italic>eLife</italic> as I believe it represents an impressive effort towards the advanced visualization of environments relevant to the readership. I would however ask that the authors address the points made above and summarized here for clarity here:</p><p>1. Please provide a clearer definition or discussion of your intended user.</p><p>2. For this user, what are the specific learning/communication objectives?</p><p>3. Draw more direct connections between these objectives and the specific design decisions that drove your project implementation.</p><p>4. Although carrying out an assessment study may be beyond the scope of this manuscript, please discuss how this could be carried out and, in doing so, provide a more explicit statement of learning goals and outcomes.</p><p>5. I would also want to know (and have the authors describe) whether they intend to share their models and the experience itself (since they say it can be set up on a user desktop – as opposed to their previous project which appears to require a more involved set-up for VR).</p><p>6. Finally, I find the suggestion in the conclusion that such environments may become useful for scientists to 'reflect upon their own data' is very interesting. However, such a statement requires some level of discussion addressing how visual design choices may need to change to accommodate the goals of this new kind of audience. Is there a difference in what molecular actors (or representational choices) could be left out or included, and what specific aspects of this interactive and immersive environment do the authors find most promising for use by the scientific community?</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript reports on the design considerations undertaken in the development of virtual reality cell explorer &quot;Nanoscape&quot;. The authors describe in detail the process by which molecular entities and extracellular elements are sourced, modelled, distributed, and ultimately rendered. Detailed rationale is provided for the stylistic decisions both as it pertains to technological concerns and clarity of representation. For researchers working in the domain of molecular visualization this offers an interesting and insightful overview of this collaborative project.</p><p>I thoroughly enjoyed reviewing this manuscript, particularly because of the high level of detail and transparency provided by the authors with respect to the ways in which the environment they have created has been informed by empirical data. They describe the ways in which data has been modified and in each case provide rationale for decisions made (modifications or simplification of data as well as the use of artistic license for visual clarity). The supplemental materials too were very informative. This manuscript represents a standard for how all projects of this type should be documented and reported.</p><p>I have but one concern that is relatively very minor. It would be helpful if the authors provided some additional context as to who their users are? The users are mentioned several times throughout the manuscript as a consideration in design decisions made, but no clear characterization of the anticipated user group is ever offered.</p><p>In sum, I think this manuscript makes a valuable contribution to the domain of molecular visualization from both a technical and design perspective.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This article discusses the use of computer visualization techniques to create an explorable 3D virtual environment, called Nanoscape, depicting a breast cancer cell within the context of a tumor.</p><p>1. Although the title suggests that the article will describe the Nanoscape application in detail, we were disappointed that only a cursory description of this project was given. While we understand that Nanoscape has yet to be released (and so user feedback should not be expected), we hoped to better understand what the purpose of the overall project is. Who is the target audience, how would the application be implemented, and what do the authors hope to achieve? An explanation of the novel features of Nanoscape (in comparison to other similar efforts) is particularly important given that many of the software techniques that have been used for this project have been previously released and/or described by others (e.g.Molecular Maya for protein modeling, CellPack for creating crowded environments) and do not represent new methods.</p><p>2. We were concerned that the article appears to be written primarily for 3D biomedical illustrators, rather than for research biologists. The article itself questioned whether 3D visualizations could support experimentalists (see lines 115-117). Given the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, we felt that a much stronger consideration for the role of 3D visualization in the research sphere, and/or a more in-depth discussion of how these types of applications (and Nanoscape in particular) can impact public engagement and outreach is warranted.</p><p>3. In many sections of the article, the authors discussed general challenges faced when creating molecular environments, but did not discuss how they met these challenges in creating the Nanoscape models and how they made the decisions that they ultimately made. For example, the authors discussed the issue of conformational flexibility of proteins (paragraph starting on line 227) and the limitation posed when only one conformation of a protein has been structurally solved. How did the authors solve this problem in the case of Nanoscape? Likewise, when discussing the dynamics of lipids within a membrane, the authors point out that depicting the movement and heterogeneity of membranes is challenging, but did not describe how this challenge was met in the context of Nanoscape.</p><p>4. In line 202, mMaya is described as a software that &quot;qualitatively replicate(s) molecular dynamics,&quot; and this software is described throughout the article as the main tool that was used to create dynamic animations of different proteins. A direct comparison of the process and computed trajectories produced by mMaya and those produced by established molecular dynamics simulation packages and/or coarse-grained modeling would ideally be provided to better support this description of mMaya, especially considering that mMaya is likely to be a software that is unfamiliar to many readers, and that there are (as far as we know) no other publications that describe the use of mMaya in the scientific literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64047.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Overall, the authors have accomplished an impressive amount of work and created what is no doubt a stunning experience.

To avoid being visually overwhelmed, we had to reduce the number of proteins and small molecules (eg. water) in the environment. This also allowed a better appreciation of the 'vistas' of organic landscape and how several components interact with one another. In another example, the complexity of the ECM had to be simplified due to uncertainties about how the components co-ordinate their interactions with surface receptors. Proteins were stylised as polygonal meshes to highlight protein domains (some later animated), instead of atomic representation. In most cases, the appearance of the mesh of each component (protein/cell/blood vessel, etc.) was modified (made low-poly) to ensure real-time performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We would like to understand if Nanoscape, with its increased level of authenticity can help deepen the understanding of advanced topics such as protein density and molecular scale. Assessors can vary these parameters in application and evaluate the effect each has on basic and advanced cellular topics through exams.

This application did not intend to offer rigorous molecular dynamics simulations, as this was outside the scope of the work. Where several protein states existed, we were able to animate those proteins with a reasonable level of confidence. Another option that we did not explore was to simply use artistic licence and artistically manipulate conformational changes to suggest flexibility of the proteins, but this was not completed for the current version of the application. We also note that due to performance reasons, we elected to simulate the cell membrane as an animated texture instead of individual lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
