Recent work has shown that these channels play a role in necroptosis following prolonged acidic exposure like occurs in stroke. The C-terminus of ASIC1a is thought to mediate necroptotic cell death through interaction with receptor interacting serine threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1). This interaction is hypothesized to be inhibited at rest via an interaction between the C- and N-termini which blocks the RIPK1 binding site. Here, we use two transition metal ion FRET methods to investigate the conformational dynamics of the termini at neutral and acidic pH. We do not find evidence that the termini are close enough to be bound while the channel is at rest and find that the termini may modestly move closer together during acidification. At rest, the N-terminus adopts a conformation parallel to the membrane about 10 Å away. The distal end of the C-terminus may also spend time close to the membrane at rest. After acidification, the proximal portion of the N-terminus moves marginally closer to the membrane whereas the distal portion of the C-terminus swings away from the membrane. Together these data suggest that a new hypothesis for RIPK1 binding during stroke is needed.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Acid-sensing ion channels</kwd><kwd>RIPK1</kwd><kwd>transition metal ion FRET</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>L-ANAP</kwd><kwd>Non-canonical amino acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM137912</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bankston</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY024267</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bankston</surname><given-names>John R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE028739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cullinan</surname><given-names>Megan M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL007822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klipp</surname><given-names>Robert C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel FRET approach suggests that the intracellular termini of acid-sensing ion channel 1a do not form a complex at rest requiring a new hypothesis for ASIC1a involvement in stroke.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are members of the Deg/ENaC (Degenerin/Epithelial Sodium Channel) superfamily, with relatives including the mechanosensitive MEC4 from <italic>C. elegans,</italic> Pickpocket from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and most recently identified, the heat-activated BRNTaC1 from <italic>S.s mutilans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yao et al., 2023</xref>). ASICs are trimeric, proton activated, sodium selective channels located primarily in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In mammals, there are four ASIC genes giving rise to six unique isoforms that can assemble into homo- and heteromeric channels. ASICs have been shown to be involved in diverse physiological and pathophysiological conditions including pain sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bässler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazzuca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sluka et al., 2009</xref>), mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermanstyne et al., 2008</xref>), fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coryell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2014</xref>), and memory and learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wemmie et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The first structure of a member of this family, ASIC1 from chicken (cASIC1), was solved at 1.9 Å and revealed the overall architecture of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>). A single subunit of cASIC1 is comprised of a large cysteine-rich extracellular domain, two transmembrane domains and short intracellular N- and C-termini. More recent structures of cASIC1 from the same group using CryoEM on channels solubilized with styrene-maleic acid copolymer revealed that residues 19–41 reenter the membrane and form part of the lower permeation path: a feature that was termed the re-entrant loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>). Nonetheless, the C-terminus and the cytosolic portion of the N-terminus remain unresolved. It is likely these domains are highly dynamic and largely unstructured.</p><p>Despite the lack of structure, the termini play a critical role in channel function and regulation. ASICs have been shown to interact with a wide variety of intracellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cullinan et al., 2021</xref>) like stomatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klipp et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Price et al., 2004</xref>), NHERF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deval et al., 2006</xref>), and CIPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anzai et al., 2002</xref>). These proteins can influence trafficking, gating, and localization. Moreover, mutations and truncations in the termini have been shown to impact channel gating as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Of critical physiological importance, ASIC1a has a clearly demonstrated role in cell death resulting from ischemic stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Inhibition of ASIC1a or genetic knockout each result in a dramatic reduction in neuronal death following ischemic event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chassagnon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCarthy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pignataro et al., 2007</xref>). It has long been suggested that ASIC1a may lead to cell death by contributing to Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload in neurons as this isoform has some permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2004</xref>). However, an intriguing newer hypothesis has suggested that ASIC1a can act as a receptor in addition to its function as an ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). This hypothesis posits that, during stroke, the pH of the extracellular solution falls, leading to a conformational change in the channel which exposes a binding site on the C-terminus for serine/threonine receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). RIPK1 is a cytosolic protein with multiple domains including an N-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain, and a C-terminal death domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mifflin et al., 2020</xref>). RIPK1 is known for its involvement in necroptosis or regulated necrotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galluzzi et al., 2017</xref>). There are multiple ways to trigger necroptosis but the ensuing signaling cascade is relatively conserved. Generally, RIPK1, RIPK3 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like pseudokinase (MLKL) are necessary to form the necrosome which is the required functional unit for cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Given the hypothesis that ASIC1a is a cell death receptor, it would be very attractive to design drugs that stabilize the complex between the N- and C-termini or destabilize the C-terminal interaction with RIPK1. With this idea in mind, our goal in this study is to test the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) of ASIC1a may form a dynamic complex that changes with pH. To do this, we have adapted a transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET) approach which is ideally suited to measure distances on this length scale. First, we incorporate the non-canonical amino acid fluorophore, 3-((6-acetylnaphthalen-2-yl)amino)–2-aminopropanoic acid (L-ANAP) into various sites within the NTD and CTD to serve as the FRET donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). We then measure the position of the L-ANAP relative to a metal ion that is either attached to the channel using a cysteine-reactive metal chelator or incorporated into the membrane via an NTA conjugated lipid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>). Using this approach, we do not see evidence that the NTD and CTD are in close proximity during resting pH that would be consistent with an interaction between the two domains. In addition, we measure modest movements towards one another during acidification. To confirm this result with a direct measure of binding, we also used microscale thermophoresis (MST) to test for binding between peptides of the termini and see no binding in this assay as well. Finally, we measure FRET between L-ANAP in our cytosolic domains and metal incorporated into the plasma membrane to determine the rearrangements that these domains undergo during acidification. Based on our results, we speculate that proximity of the CTD to the membrane during resting conditions, rather than a stable complex between the NTD and CTD, may prevent RIPK1 binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine the conformational changes that the intracellular domains of ASIC1a undergo, we first needed to develop an approach well-suited to make this measurement in full-length channels in intact membranes. To do this, we employ transition metal ion FRET (tmFRET). tmFRET utilizes a transition metal ion, such as Co<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup>, as a non-fluorescent FRET acceptor and a small fluorophore attached to the channel at a specific site as the donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Latt et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Latt et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Taraska et al., 2009</xref>). The transition metal ion quenches the donor fluorophore in a highly distant dependent manner.</p><p>Our approach needed to satisfy a number of criteria. (1) We needed to be able to site-specifically attach a fluorophore that is appropriate for tmFRET to our channel. (2) We needed to have a method for incorporating metal ions into our channel. (3) The probes we used cannot be sensitive to changes in pH. (4) The distance range over which our probes work needed to correspond with the distances between the intracellular domains. To accomplish all of this we adapted multiple methods to suit our needs for developing short distance probes for ASICs.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Site-specific labeling of ASICs with an unnatural amino acid</title><p>To site specifically incorporate a small molecule fluorophore compatible with FRET utilizing a transition metal, we opted to incorporate the fluorescent unnatural amino acid (UAA) 3-[(6-acetyl-2-naphthalenyl)amino]-L-alanine (L-ANAP) at sites in the channel. L-ANAP, a derivative of prodan, has several advantages for measuring short intramolecular distances within an ion channel. First, L-ANAP has a small side chain, similar in size to a tryptophan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This reduces artifacts in FRET measurements associated with the large size of fluorescent proteins (FP) and organic dyes, as well as long linkers that attach these chromophores to the protein of interest. In addition, its modest spectral overlap with the absorbance spectra of transition metals makes it well suited as a donor for measuring FRET over shorter distances. L-ANAP has been used to measure conformational dynamics in multiple ion channels and other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shandell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Suárez-Delgado et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Incorporation of L-ANAP into ASIC1a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic illustrating L-ANAP incorporation into rASIC1a using the amber suppression method.

This approach utilizes two plasmids. The first encodes the channel with a TAG stop codon engineered at the desired site of labelling. The second plasmid, developed by Peter Schultz’s lab and termed pANAP, encodes 4 copies of a tRNA as well as an evolved tRNA synthetase that together allows for the loading of a tRNA complementary to the TAG codon with L-ANAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chatterjee et al., 2013</xref>). These two plasmids were co-transfected into CHO-K1 cells that were incubated in cell-permeable methyl ester version of L-ANAP (see Methods for details of the incorporation protocol).</p><p>For these studies we used ASIC1a from rat with a genetically encoded mCitrine attached to the CTD of the channel via a 13 amino acid linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since many of our desired labelling sites were in the short NTD of the channel, we needed to ensure that we minimized any ‘leak’ expression where the channel expresses even in the absence of L-ANAP. Work on the Shaker potassium channel has shown that TAG codons in the N-terminus can lead to translation re-initiation at non-canonical start codons downstream of the TAG site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalstrup and Blunck, 2015</xref>). To minimize this potential problem, we made a number of conservative mutations in the first 90 base pairs (30 amino acids) of the channel to minimize the chance of alternate initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the CTD has four native cysteine residues present which were mutated to serine, allowing us to then reintroduce a single cysteine residue at a site of our choosing. All cysteine residues in the extracellular region are engaged in disulfide bonds and are also too far away to contribute to a FRET signal given the working distance of tmFRET.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> shows representative images of rASIC1a-S24TAG with a single intracellular cysteine at C469. Robust mCitrine expression was only observed when both plasmids are transfected and L-ANAP is added to the media, indicating full-length channel expression. Omission of either L-ANAP from the media or pANAP from the transfection results in failure to produce full-length channels and an absence of any measurable mCitrine signal.</p><p>To further ensure that full-length channels are only produced in the presence of the UAA, western blots were performed containing a number of potential TAG positions in the NTD, re-entrant loop, and CTD of the channel. Positions were excluded if no channels were seen on the blot or if a substantial signal was detected in the absence of L-ANAP in the media. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows two western blots that contain four different TAG mutation sites along with our pseudo wild-type construct, C469 WT, which has a single intracellular cysteine at position 469 and no introduced TAG mutation. Position S485TAG shows no expression even in the presence of L-ANAP in the growth media. Position H515TAG shows channel expression in both the presence and absence of L-ANAP. These are each an example of positions we did not pursue further. S464TAG and M505TAG, however, show robust ASIC1a expression only when L-ANAP is present in the media making these suitable positions to move forward with.

Each mutant channel showed a robust current when L-ANAP was present in the media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Each mutant showed the typical rapid activation upon a fast switch from pH 8 to pH 5.5 followed by channel desensitization. While rASIC1a-G11TAG showed a slightly altered desensitization rate, all mutants show complete desensitization in less than 10 s. In addition, we measured the pH dependence of channel activation. Our pseudo wild-type construct, C469 WT, showed a half-activating pH of 6.52 similar to our previously measured pH<sub>0.5</sub> for WT ASIC1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klipp and Bankston, 2022</xref>). The pH<sub>0.5</sub> values for the mutants all fell between 6.42 and 6.67 indicating that normal pH-dependent gating remains largely intact in each mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

The first, termed ACCuRET (ANAP Cyclen-Cu<sup>2+</sup> resonance energy transfer), incorporates metal ions at specific sites on the channel using a cysteine reactive metal chelator, 1-(2-pyridin-2-yldisulfanyl)ethyl)–1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (TETAC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>). TETAC has a short linker connected to a cyclen ring that binds transition metals with a sub-nanomolar affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mutsuo Kodama et al., 1977</xref>). The second method involved attaching the metal to the plasma membrane using a synthesized lipid with a metal-chelating head group called stearoyl-nitrilotriacetic acid (C18-NTA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>). We termed this method memFRET for clarity. Using TETAC and C18-NTA allowed us to introduce transition metal ions at a specific site within the protein (TETAC) or scattered across the plasma membrane (C18-NTA).</p><p>For each of these approaches we calculated the expected FRET efficiency between L-ANAP and the coordinated metal ion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> shows the emission spectrum of L-ANAP along with the extinction coefficient of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC.

We confirmed that result here by mimicking incorporation of L-ANAP into the protein by conjugating L-ANAP to amine reactive agarose beads and measuring the emission spectra for L-ANAP on the same microscope setup used for the subsequent experiments. The emission spectrum of L-ANAP did not differ in either our rest (pH 8) or acidification (pH 6) buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). In addition, the extinction coefficient of Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC and Co<sup>2+</sup>-NTA also do not change when the pH of the solution is changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref> respectively). This results in a minimal change in R<sub>0</sub> values between pH 8 and pH 6 for ACCuRET (17.6 Å and 17.2 Å, respectively) and for memFRET (12.4 Å and 12.6 Å, respectively).</p><p>Finally, in order to apply either of these metal labels to the CTD or the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, we needed access to the intracellular side of the channel. To do this, we used cell unroofing which was originally used for EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heuser, 2000</xref>) but has been adopted for tmFRET experiments as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gordon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zagotta et al., 2016</xref>). In short, we used a fluid stream to create a mechanical shearing force to remove the dorsal surface and all the intracellular components leaving only the ventral surface of the plasma membrane that is attached to the cover glass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Before unroofing the cells, the L-ANAP signal is diffuse throughout the cell, without obvious membrane localization as expected, and the mCitrine signal can be seen in the membrane and in other intracellular membranes. After unroofing the cells, only fluorescence associated with the ‘footprint’, or ventral surface, of the cell membrane is left behind. L-ANAP and mCitrine fluorescence colocalized well in the unroofed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). All together, these data show that we were able to combine multiple approaches to site-specifically label ASIC1a with the small molecule fluorophore, L-ANAP, as well as metal ions and none of the probes we use were impacted by changes in pH. With these combined approaches, we can measure conformational changes that occur in the intracellular domains of the channel.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cell unroofing isolates the plasma membrane for imaging.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of unroofing method used.

The ACCuRET approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) is particularly well-suited for measuring the distance between the NTD and the CTD for several reasons. (1) The R<sub>0</sub> for our FRET pairs is on the order of ~17–18 Å which is ideal for measuring distances between the intracellular domains as the distance between the bottom of TM1 and TM2 in the channel is on the order of 10–20 Å. (2) We can measure these distances in intact channels embedded in native membranes. (3) The fluorophore and metal ion are small and have relatively few bonds connecting them to the protein backbone making them good proxies for the position of the NTD and CTD relative to one another.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>ACCuRET measures short-range distances between the NTD and CTD of ASIC1a.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the ACCuRET approach (Created with <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorender.com/">Biorender.com</ext-link>).

The putative interaction site between the intracellular domains was speculated to involve four consecutive glutamate residues at positions 6–9 on the NTD and residues 468–476 on the CTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, inset) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, Rosetta modelling showed a very close (4.7 Å) proximity between residues E7 and K468 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This hypothesis predicts that the positions along the short NTD should show high FRET efficiency with metal ions incorporated into the channel at C469 at rest and that the FRET between the intracellular domains should decrease with prolonged (~minutes) acidification.</p><p>ACCuRET between L-ANAP at E8 and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC at C469, the two residues immediately adjacent to the modelled close contact between the NTD and CTD, showed a modest 20% FRET efficiency putting the NTD and CTD ~22 Å apart which is significantly farther than the modelling predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). However, it is possible that the presence of the labels in the binding site may impact the two domains ability to interact.

position. Modest FRET signals are measured again consistent with distances 20–22 Å range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Upon acidification, a slight increase in FRET efficiency is seen for all three positions, consistent with the NTD and CTD moving slightly closer together under these conditions. In addition, we moved the site of TETAC incorporation out of the putative binding site to residue 477 and remeasured ACCuRET between G11TAG and Q14TAG at this new position. Again, we measured only modest FRET efficiencies consistent with distances in the ~20 Å range and a trend towards increased FRET at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that the quenching we see is from the transition metals is due to FRET between L-ANAP and the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC, we repeated some of these measurements loading TETAC with Zn<sup>2+</sup> instead of Cu<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lacerda et al., 2007</xref>). Zn<sup>2+</sup> does not absorb light in the visible spectrum and thus does not quench L-ANAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, no FRET is measured between L-ANAP and E8TAG or G11TAG and Zn<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC at C469 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) indicating that the quenching we see in our experiments is due to the presence of the transition metal. Additionally, the lack of measured FRET in our Zn<sup>2+</sup> control precludes the possibility that FRET between L-ANAP and mCitrine convolute our tmFRET measurements.</p><p>It is possible that the CTD binding site for the NTD is at a more distal position along the CTD than originally speculated. To test this, we again moved the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC-labelled cysteine to residues further along the CTD. Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC at C485 shows similar FRET at pH 8, but, interestingly, shows a larger movement (~6 Å) towards the NTD at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Again, this movement towards one another is likely inconsistent with a model where the termini are in complex at rest and move apart during acidification. Finally, the most distal positions we measured (C505, C515), also display modest FRET signals at pH 8 with 515 showing a larger (~5 Å) movement towards the NTD upon acidification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>ACCuRET does not suggest an interaction between the NTD and more distal positions on the CTD.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized FRET efficiency between L-ANAP on the NTD and Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC at position C485 at pH 8 (black) and pH 6 (red).

At the onset of this project, these positions were thought to be part of the cytosolic region as well, but newer Cryo-EM structures have demonstrated that residues ~19–41 are part of a loop that reinserts itself into the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>). In each case, the FRET efficiency at rest is slightly higher than the efficiencies we measured between the NTD and CTD suggesting perhaps that the CTD might be somewhat closer to the re-entrant loop, and the membrane, than it is to the NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Measurements at pH 6 reveal that the CTD moves closer to the re-entrant loop with the notable exception of the position at A44TAG which is the only position we measure that shows a modest decrease in FRET with acidification.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Peptides of the N- and C-termini do not bind in solution</title><p>While ACCuRET is a powerful tool for looking at changes in intracellular domains in intact channels in real membranes, it is not a direct measure of binding. To look for direct interaction between the NTD and CTD, we employed microscale thermophoresis (MST; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). MST is an immobilization-free, solution-based method that measures biomolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wienken et al., 2010</xref>). This approach measures the motion of a fluorescent molecule along a microscopic temperature gradient created by an IR laser. This motion depends on a number of factors including the size and chemical environment of the molecule. Any binding between the molecule attached to the fluorophore and second molecule result in a change in the motion. To perform MST, we synthesized peptides for the NTD and CTD of ASIC1a from rat. The NTD peptide contained residues 1–17 with an additional C-terminal cysteine to which Alexa-647 was conjugated. The CTD peptide contained residues 460–526 with the endogenous cysteine residues mutated to serine. The labelled NTD peptide was kept at a constant 2.5 nM concentration with increasing amounts of the CTD. Little to no change in fluorescence signal was seen at any concentration of CTD. Using this approach, we see no signs of binding between the two domains up to 250 μM providing additional evidence that a complex between these two domains does not form.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>memFRET suggest termini reside in close proximity to the plasma membrane</title><p>Since our data suggest that the intracellular domains of the channel likely do not bind at rest and subsequently unbind during prolonged acidification, we decided to determine the topology of the NTD and CTD and then examine what sort of rearrangements these domains make during acidification. To do this, we employed a second tmFRET method that again uses L-ANAP as the FRET donor and metal ions as FRET acceptors but with the metal ions coordinated by membrane imbedded lipids instead of conjugated onto the channel which we termed memFRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). By doing this, we measure distances between a single distinct L-ANAP position within a protein relative to the plasma membrane. We utilize a lipid with an NTA head group (stearoyl-nitrilotriacetic acid, C18-NTA) which introduces high-affinity metal binding sites throughout the plasma membrane. The R<sub>0</sub> for this pair is shorter than seen in ACCuRET (12.4 Å at pH 8) and distances are calculated taking into consideration the presence of multiple acceptors (see Methods). We found no difference in the distance between E8TAG, G11TAG, and Q14TAG and the plasma membrane under resting conditions suggesting that the NTD may lay parallel to the membrane. L-ANAP at Q14TAG moved nearly ~4 Å closer at pH 6 but we did not detect a change at the other two positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Not surprisingly, L-ANAP at S24TAG and I33TAG, which are within the bilayer, both showed very large FRET efficiency with metal in the membrane with I33TAG displaying a lower FRET efficiency at rest compared to S24TAG at both pH 8 and pH 6, as well as itself at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). A number of the FRET efficiency values that we measured here were so large that they exceeded the resolvable range of memFRET. While we cannot determine a precise distance from the membrane, they are likely in very close proximity.

During acidification, however, the CTD appears to begin to move away from the plasma membrane with the more distal position moving farther than the more proximal position.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The major aim of this work is to evaluate the hypothesis that the NTD of ASIC1a binds to the CTD in order to occlude a potential binding site for the cell death protein, RIPK1. Previous Rosetta modeling of the intracellular domains suggested that 4 consecutive glutamate residues in the NTD, E6-E9, electrostatically interact with positively charged residues in the CTD, K468, K471, K474 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The closest distance measured in the modeled closed state was 4.7 Å between E7 and K468. The modelled open state shows that the NTD and CTD are separated, suggesting that acidification leads to a conformational change in the intracellular domains that moves them apart. Moreover, experimental data using spectral FRET between CFP and YFP fused to the ends of each terminus observed a FRET efficiency of ~30% at rest and ~10% at pH 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The authors interpreted this FRET signal as evidence for complex formation and the decrease in FRET efficiency as an indicator that the termini moved apart during prolonged acidification.</p><p>Following up on these previous studies, we used the amber suppression method to incorporate L-ANAP throughout the NTD and CTD of ASIC1a. We then used these labelled channels to measure conformational changes using two tmFRET-based methods, ACCuRET and memFRET. To our knowledge, this is the first study to combine these two approaches to examine the structural rearrangement within a single protein. Our results show that the NTD and CTD of the channel sit ~18–26 Å apart on average and make small movements towards one another during acidification. The simplest interpretation of these results is that the intracellular domains do not form a stable complex at rest that unbinds during acidification and that a new hypothesis for how acidification controls RIPK1 binding to ASIC1a is needed.</p><p>Given these results, we decided to look at dynamic rearrangements within the intracellular domains that might be occurring in order to potentially formulate alternative hypotheses for RIPK1 binding to ASIC1a. As expected, our memFRET measurements showed a large FRET efficiency between Co<sup>2+</sup> in the membrane and L-ANAP at S24TAG. This position is very near the bottom of the transmembrane segments in the plane of the inner leaflet providing a reasonable measure of the maximum FRET measurable in this assay. Looking, then, at our 3 positions in the cytosolic NTD we found comparable FRET efficiencies for each position consistent with the idea that the NTD might lay parallel to the plasma membrane, ~10 Å away from the inner leaflet, at rest. During acidification we detect a small move of the proximal NTD towards the plasma membrane.</p><p>Making the same measurements with L-ANAP at positions along the CTD, we found that position S464TAG, very near the bottom of transmembrane domain 2, shows an expected large FRET signal similar to S24TAG. Surprisingly, M505TAG showed large FRET with metal in the membrane, consistent with the idea that parts of the CTD may reside in close proximity to the plasma membrane as well. During exposure to pH 6 we see a decrease in FRET efficiency, especially at the more distal position, suggesting that during prolonged acidification the CTD may move away from the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>The NTD and CTD of ASIC1a likely do not interact.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon schematic of axial movements of the N- and C-termini relative to the membrane at rest and prolonged acidification.

The first used CFP and YFP attached to the NTD and CTD and measured a change in the ratio of YFP/CFP intensity over time as a measure of FRET between the two domains. They found a slow pH dependent decrease in that ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). The second study repeated this measurement with FPs that are not sensitive to pH in the pH 6–8 range and found that there was no change in the ratio of acceptor/donor fluorescence with prolonged acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couch et al., 2021</xref>). YFP has a pKa of around 6.9 and its fluorescence changes dramatically between pH 7.4 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Llopis et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, the first study used spectral FRET between CFP and YFP fused to the ends of each terminus and observed a FRET efficiency of ~30% at rest and ~10% at pH 6. These efficiencies would suggest distances in the 55–70 Å range between the intracellular domains which is unlikely given the close proximity of the two transmembrane segments (10–20 Å based on published structures). Potential problems with these measurements likely stem from the inherent limitations to measuring intramolecular rearrangements over small distances with FP-based FRET. The classical FRET pairs have long R<sub>0</sub> values (30–60 Å), long flexible linkers (~15 Å), and are large in size (15–30 Å; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Best et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Posson and Selvin, 2008</xref>). Given this, it is hard to measure short distances and small rearrangement with these probes.</p><p>As stated above, the same group used Rosetta modelling to show that the termini may get as close together as 4.7 Å between E7 and K468. Our measurements suggest that the termini likely do not get closer than ~18 Å and may move closer during acidification, not farther apart. More specifically, we measured tmFRET between E8TAG and C469 which are the residues immediately adjacent to E7 and K468 and saw only a 20% FRET efficiency at pH 8 consistent with a distance of 22 Å apart.</p><p>The second study also used fluorescence lifetime imaging to show FRET between FP-tagged ASIC1a termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couch et al., 2021</xref>). These measurements showed that the FRET primarily originated from intra-subunit proximity and not from proximity between subunits. In addition, the structure shows that the intrasubunit distances between TMs are closer than the inter-subunit ones as well. While our data do not directly weigh in on the question of intra- vs intersubunit proximity, based on these two reasons, we would suggest that the FRET we measure is likely from intra-subunit FRET as well.</p><p>This same study mapped the topography of the intracellular termini of ASIC1a comparable to our memFRET experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couch et al., 2021</xref>). In these experiments, they used the membrane soluble small molecule DPA as a FRET acceptor with CFP or YFP attached either to the end of the NTD or at 4 different positions along the length of the CTD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couch et al., 2021</xref>). The results from the NTD are consistent with our findings here. They suggest that the most distal part of the NTD is ~6–10 Å from the membrane at rest and moves slightly closer at pH 6. This is consistent with our observation that the most distal position we measure is ~10 Å away from the membrane and moves slightly closer during acidification.</p><p>Their results from the CTD quenching experiments are somewhat in contrast to what we see here. Our results suggest that the distal portion of the CTD spends significant time near the plasma membrane: enough to generate the large quenching signal we measure. The DPA quenching experiments suggest the proximal portion of the CTD is ~12–16 Å from the plasma membrane and the more distal portions extend down into the cytosol. Determining the motion of the CTD is complicated by the biphasic nature of the distance dependence curves for DPA quenching. The authors conclude that the CTD moves towards the membrane during acidification but acknowledge that their data could also be consistent with a move away, similar to what we see. There are a number of potential sources of the differences in our measurements. First, the previous study used ASIC1 from chicken whereas we used ASIC1a from rat. The sequences of the termini are largely conserved but the conformational changes that surround prolonged acidification could differ. It is well established, for instance, that ASIC1a from rat (and human) undergo a slow inactivation process during acidosis called tachyphylaxis that is absent in the chicken isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Gründer, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rook et al., 2020</xref>). Second, insertion of large FPs into a relatively short CTD could impact the ability of the CTD to position itself near the plasma membrane.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations to our approach</title><p>It is important to note that our approaches has limitations that need to be considered when thinking about our results. A number of controls are required when attempting to incorporate UAAs. The western blots and function give us confidence that we are primarily measuring full-length ANAP-incorporated ASIC1a. Given the position of the N-terminal TAG mutations, premature truncation at any of these positions would yield very short peptides that are not capable of forming functional channels. We only see bands in the presence of -LANAP in our western blots suggesting that readthrough, where the ribosome inserts a natural amino acid instead of L-ANAP, should not present a major problem. However, it is possible that premature truncation at positions in the CTD yield truncated subunits capable of forming functional channels. These truncated subunits could co-assemble with other truncated subunits and full-length L-ANAP containing subunits. The truncated channels would be invisible to the memFRET measurement but it is possible that co-assembled truncated channels could alter the position of the CTD.</p><p>It is also possible that the bulky FP on the CTD could impact the ability of the termini to interact. We do not think this is likely the case. First, previous work looking at the interaction between the N- and C-termini used the same bulky FPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Couch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). In those experiments there was often an FP on each terminus. Second, our tag was attached following an 11-residue linker which should give enhanced flexibility and reduced steric hindrance. We previously showed that ASIC3 channels containing mCerulean after this linker were able to bind the protein Stomatin at a binding cite in the distal CTD near the FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klipp et al., 2020</xref>). Given that the NTD is significantly smaller than Stomatin, we believe there is likely sufficient room for the complex to still form.</p><p>ACCuRET has a number of potential complications, some of which apply to our system. First, unincorporated L-ANAP, or any background fluorescence, can contaminate our fluorescence signals and alter our measurements. In cells that do not express mCitrine, we see little to no L-ANAP signal, suggesting that this is not likely a big contributor to our measurements. Second, it is not possible to verify complete labelling of the channel with either L-ANAP or TETAC. Third, in order to perform these experiments, we needed to unroof the cells to have access to the CTD cysteine residues. In doing so, we expose both sides of the membrane to the changes in pH. It is possible that acidification of the intracellular side of the channel alters the normal positions and conformational changes of these domains. However, prolonged extracellular acidification can lead to drops in intracellular pH as well so our approach may not differ as much as expected from external application (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doyen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salameh et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, unroofing could disrupt the interaction between the NTD and CTD by washing away other proteins that are critical to maintain this interaction. Finally, FRET is highly non-linear with the closest approach distances most represented in the FRET signal. It is likely that the intracellular domains are largely unstructured and dynamic. Our distance measurements are more representative of an average position between the domains rather than a fixed distance and that average position is skewed towards the closest approach between the donor and acceptor. However, this limitation, we believe, strengthens our hypothesis that the intracellular domains are likely not in close proximity to one another at rest. Given this averaging of the position of the termini, it is possible that the termini exist in close proximity for a very small proportion of time. However, if this interaction is crucial for preventing the initiation of necroptosis, the termini would need to be in complex for enough time to prevent RIPK1 binding which is inconsistent with our data.</p><p>Our memFRET approach is also potentially impacted by non-specific fluorescence and incomplete labelling of the channel. However, it has other potential concerns as well. (1) The C18-NTA could bind to the CTD in addition to intercalating into the membrane. However, the quenching is long lasting, and the measurements are made 5–20 min after exposure to the lipid which would mean this non-specific interaction would have to be quite durable. (2) The plasma membrane may deform around the channel putting the metal ions closer than expected to the L-ANAP in the CTD. (3) Similarly, the lipid could bind to the channel in the membrane artificially concentrating the metal ions around the channel. A number of lipids have been shown to bind and regulate ASICs, although ones with shorter acyl tails and no double bonds tend to show no effect on ASICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klipp and Bankston, 2022</xref>). (4) The distances measured between the intracellular domains and the membrane were based on a model of FRET with multiple acceptors in two dimensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fung and Stryer, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>). The model assumes a random arrangement of acceptors in the membrane and an approximate metal density of 0.002 molecules/ Å<sup>2</sup>. We confirmed this approximate density using the approach detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>). However, the previous use of this approach found FRET efficiencies higher than would have been predicted based on cryoEM structures. It is possible that the model underestimates the amount of metal in the membrane or the effect that multiple acceptors has on the fluorescence signal of the donor. (5) Finally, the most likely source of error comes from the highly nonlinear nature of FRET. As noted above, the closest approach distance is more highly represented in the overall FRET signal than other positions. The dynamic nature of these domains might be such that these intracellular domains spend some time in close proximity to the plasma membrane and it is these positions that dominate our signal.</p><p>We would argue that these limitations may impact the precise measurements made here but are unlikely to impact the overall trends. For instance, the dynamic nature of the NTD might mean we overestimate the proximity of the domain to the plasma membrane but is less likely to impact the conclusion that the proximal portion of this region spends a portion of its time mostly parallel to the membrane surface. Similarly, the distances we report for the position of the CTD relative to the membrane may be closer than reality, but the observation the acidification moves the domain away from the membrane is less likely impacted. Finally, the major goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that the NTD and CTD interact at rest and unbind during acidification and none of these caveats to our approach seem to suggest that our conclusion should be anything other than the N- and C-termini do not bind at resting pH.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We believe the simplest interpretation of our results is that the NTD and CTD of ASIC1a do not interact at rest and that some other factor must be preventing RIPK1 binding under resting conditions. In addition, these data are most consistent with a model where the intracellular domains both spend significant time in close proximity to the plasma membrane with the CTD perhaps moving away during acidification. There is precedence for intracellular domains laying largely parallel to the plasma membrane. AMPA receptors are thought to have C-termini that are largely parallel to the membrane surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zachariassen et al., 2016</xref>) and the NTD of P2X receptors appears to lay along the plasma membrane across the pore region and form a ‘cap’ on the permeation pathway which can impact selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoder and Gouaux, 2020</xref>). Given the structural relationship between P2X channels and ASICs and the results we show here, it will be interesting to see if perhaps the NTD of ASIC could act in a similar way.</p><p>Together our data suggest an alternative hypothesis for the inhibition of RIPK1 binding at rest. It is possible that the membrane itself acts to block RIPK1 binding to the CTD and that the change in conformation during acidification exposes the binding site by moving it away from the bilayer. This idea is consistent with the original findings for how ASIC1a triggers cell death in a RIPK1-dependent manner. Ultimately, more work needs to be done to understand this model of ASIC1a as a cell death receptor and to further understand how acidosis controls the binding of RIPK1 to ASIC1a during ischemia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Buffer was removed and cells were washed 5 x with SBT pH 8 or pH 6.</p><p>tmFRET experiments with unroofed cells were performed using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope and a UPlanSAPo 60 x/1.35 oil immersion objective (Olympus; Shinjuku, Japan). Illumination was provided by a SOLA SE 5-LCR-VB light engine (Lumencor; Beaverton, OR). The filters used for L-ANAP excitation and emission were 357/44 nm and 460/80 nm, respectively. The filters used for mCitrine excitation and emission were 509/22 nm and 544/24 nm, respectively. Images were collected using a 500ms, 20% power L-ANAP exposure and 100ms, 5% power mCitrine exposure using an ORCA Flash4.0Lt CMOS Camera (Hamamatsu; Shizuoka, Japan).</p><p>25 mm coverslips that had already been unroofed were mounted onto Quick Exchange Platform with a RC-40LP chamber (Warner; Hollistan MA) on the microscope stage. All solutions were applied directly to the chamber with a pipette. 1 mL x 5 was added for all washes to ensure complete washout of the chamber. TETAC, C18, DTT and EDTA were added in the amounts noted in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Labeling with C18-NTA</title><p>C18-NTA (N2,N2-bis(carboxymethyl)-N6-(1-oxooctadecyl)-l-lysine) was made into individual 10 mM stocks in DMSO and stored at –20 °C. C18-NTA was diluted to 10 μM in Stabilization Buffer Tris (SBT) for tmFRET experiments. Individual aliquots were freshly thawed for each experiment and freeze/thaw cycles were avoided.</p><p>A typical memFRET experiment followed these steps. Cells were unroofed as described in unroofing section.

Initial images were taken at either pH 8 or pH 6. Solution is removed and 1 mL of 10 μM C18-NTA is added for 5 min x2. C18-NTA was removed, and coverslip was washed 5 x with SBT. 1 mL of 11 μM CoSO<sub>4</sub> was added for 1 min x2. Coverslip was washed 5 x with SBT at intended pH prior to taking the FRET image to remove any unbound or loosely bounded cobalt. FRET image was taken in appropriate pH SBT.

For tmFRET experiments, 1 μL TETAC stock and 1 μL of 110 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> were mixed together and incubated for 1 min. The solution turned a deep blue, indicating that the Cu<sup>2+</sup> was bound to the TETAC cyclen ring. This mixture was diluted to 1 mM TETAC and 1.1 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub> by adding 98 μL of SBT. This solution was then brought up to 10 mL so that the Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC was used at a final concentration of 10 μM. There is a 10% over-abundance of Cu<sup>2+</sup> to ensure saturation of the TETAC.

Coverslip was searched using mCitrine to look for unroofed cells expressing rASIC-TAG and these cells were marked using the Stage Navigator position finder in cellSens software (Olympus; Shinjuku, Japan). Initial image was taken with either pH 8 or pH 6 SBT. Solution is removed and 1 mL of pre-reacted 10 μM Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC was applied for 1 min x2. Coverslip was washed 5 x with SBT at intended pH prior to taking the FRET image to remove any unreacted Cu<sup>2+</sup>-TETAC.

Regions of interest (ROI) were selected by thresholding the image based on the mCitrine channel and using the wand tool to automatically select the cell perimeter. Regions of the cell that were not unroofed were omitted from the selected ROI. For each cell, a nearby background region containing no cell or debris was selected. The mean gray value of the background ROI was subtracted from the mean gray value of the ROI for the corresponding cell. Photobleaching was measured by performing mock experiments at multiple TAG positions where no metal was added but washes and time between imaged remained the same at both pH 8 and pH 6. L-ANAP fluorescence was normalized to the first image. The normalized L-ANAP fluorescence of the second images, which represents the FRET image, were averaged together across multiple images and multiple experiments.

They expressed channels tagged at their N- and C-termini with the fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid ANAP in CHO cells using amber stop-codon suppression. Interaction between the termini was assessed by FRET between ANAP and colored transition metal ions bound either to a cysteine reactive chelator attached to the channel (TETAC) or metal-chelating lipids (C18-NTA). A key advantage to using metal ions is that they are very poor FRET acceptors, i.e. they must be very close to the donor for FRET to occur. This is ideal for measuring small distances/changes in distance on the scales expected from the initial hypothesis. In order to apply chelated metal ions, CHO cells were mechanically unroofed, providing access to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. At high pH, the N- and C- termini are close enough for FRET to be measured, but apparently too far apart to be explained by a direct binding interaction. At low pH, there was an apparent increase in FRET between the termini. FRET between ANAP on the N-and C-termini and metal ions bound to the plasma membrane suggests that both termini move away from the plasma membrane at low pH. The authors propose an alternative hypothesis whereby close association with the plasma membrane precludes RIPK1 biding to the C-terminus of ASIC1a.</p><p>The findings presented here are certainly valuable for the ion channel/signaling field and the technical approach only increases the significance of the work. The choice of techniques is appropriate for this study and the results are clear and high quality. Sufficient evidence is presented against the starting hypothesis. I have a few questions about certain controls and assumptions that I would like to see discussed more explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>--As discussed by the authors, the C-terminal citrine could potentially disrupt the hypothesized interaction between the N- and C-termini.</p><p>--There is apparent read-through of some of the stop codons in the absence of ANAP, which could complicate interpretation of the experiments. The largest amount of read-through is for the E6TAG, L18TAG, and H515TAG constructs, which were not used for further experiments.

We appreciate your time and effort and have incorporated many of these suggestions to improve our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary: Cullinan et al. explore the hypothesis that the cytoplasmic N- and C-termini of ASIC1a, not resolved in x-ray or cryo-EM structures, form a dynamic complex that breaks apart at low pH, exposing a C-terminal binding site for RIPK1, a regulator of necrotic cell death. They expressed channels tagged at their N- and C-termini with the fluorescent, non-canonical amino acid ANAP in CHO cells using amber stop-codon suppression. Interaction between the termini was assessed by FRET between ANAP and colored transition metal ions bound either to a cysteine reactive chelator attached to the channel (TETAC) or metal-chelating lipids (C18-NTA). A key advantage to using metal ions is that they are very poor FRET acceptors, i.e. they must be very close to the donor for FRET to occur. This is ideal for measuring small distances/changes in distance on the scales expected from the initial hypothesis. In order to apply chelated metal ions, CHO cells were mechanically unroofed, providing access to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. At high pH, the N- and C- termini are close enough for FRET to be measured, but apparently too far apart to be explained by a direct binding interaction. At low pH, there was an apparent increase in FRET between the termini. FRET between ANAP on the N-and Ctermini and metal ions bound to the plasma membrane suggests that both termini move away from the plasma membrane at low pH. The authors propose an alternative hypothesis whereby close association with the plasma membrane precludes RIPK1 binding to the C-terminus of ASIC1a.</p><p>Strengths: The findings presented here are certainly valuable for the ion channel/signaling field and the technical approach only increases the significance of the work. The choice of techniques is appropriate for this study and the results are clear and high quality. Sufficient evidence is presented against the starting hypothesis.</p><p>Weaknesses: I have a few questions about certain controls and assumptions that I would like to see discussed more explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>My biggest concern is with the C-terminal citrine tag. Might this prevent the hypothesized interaction between the N- and C-termini? What about the serine to cysteine mutations? The authors might consider a control experiment in channels lacking the C-terminal FP tag.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is certainly possible that the C-terminal citrine tag is preventing the hypothesized interaction between the intracellular termini, there are a few things that mitigate (but not eliminate) this concern. First, previous work looking at the interaction between the intracellular termini used FPs on both the N- and C-termini and concluded that in fact there is an interaction (PMID:31980622). Our channels have only a single FP, and we use a higher resolution FRET approach. Second, we aVach our citrine tag with a 11-residue linker, allowing for enhanced flexibility of the region and hopefully allowing for more space for an interaction that was posited to be between the very proximal part of the C-terminus (near the membrane and away from the tag) and the untagged N-terminus. Third, we previously showed that Stomatin, a much larger protein than the NTD, could bind the distal C-terminus of rASIC3 with a large fluorescent protein connected by the same linker on the C-terminus. In the case of Stomatin, the interaction involved the residues at the distal portion of the C-terminus close to the bulky FP. Interestingly, while we did not publish this, without this flexible linker, Stomatin could not regulate the channel and likely did not bind.</p><p>Despite this, we agree that this is possible and have added a statement in our limitations section explicitly saying this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 supplement 1 shows apparent read-through of the N-terminal stop codons. Given that most of the paper uses N-terminal ANAP tags, this figure should be moved out of the supplement. Do Nterminally truncated subunits form functional channels? Do the authors expect N-terminally truncated subunits to co-assemble in trimers with full-length subunits? The authors should include a more explicit discussion regarding the effect of truncated channels on their FRET signal in the case of such co-assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>The positions that show readthrough (E6, L18, H515) were not used in the study. We eliminated them largely on the basis of these westerns. We elected to put the bulk of the blots in the supplement simply because of how many there were. We believe this is the best compromise. It allows us to show representative blots for all our positions without making an illegible figure with 7 blots.</p><p>The N-terminally truncated subunits would create very short peptides that are not able to create functional channels. A premature stop at say E8 would create a 7-mer. Our longest N-terminal truncation would only create a protein of 32 amino acids. These don’t contain the transmembrane segments and thus cannot make functional channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the epitope used for the western blots in Figure 2 and supplements is part of the C-terminal tag, these blots do not provide an estimate of the fraction of C-terminally truncated channels (those that failed to incorporate ANAP at the stop codon). What effect would C-terminally truncated channels have on the FRET signal if incorporated into trimers with full-length subunits?</p></disp-quote><p>Alternatively, C-terminally truncated subunits would be able to form functional channels because they contain the full N-terminus, the transmembrane domains, the extracellular domain and a portion of the C-terminus. We don’t think this is a major contaminant to our experiments. The only two C-terminal ANAP positions we use are 464 and 505. In each of these cases, they are only used for memFRET. The ones that do not contain ANAP are essentially “invisible” to the experiment. Since we are measuring their proximity to the membrane, having some missing should not maVer. However, there is some chance that truncations in some subunits could allosterically affect the position of the CT in other subunits. We have added a discussion of this in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some general discussion of these results in the context of trimeric channels would be helpful. Is the putative interaction of the termini within or between subunits? Are the distances between subunits large enough to preclude FRET between donors on one subunit and acceptor ions bound on multiple subunits?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We did not directly test whether the distances are within or between subunits. We considered using a concatemer to do this, however, the concatemeric channels do not express particularly well. Then, UAA incorporation hurts the expression as well. It was unlikely we would be able to get sufficient expression for tmFRET.</p><p>However, the Maclean group has previously tested this using FRET between concatenated subunits and determined that FRET is stronger within than between subunits. We have updated the manuscript to reflect a more thorough discussion of our results in the context of their trimeric assembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors conclude that the relatively small amount of FRET between the cytoplasmic termini suggests that the interaction previously modeled in Rosetta is unlikely. Is it possible that the proposed structure is correct, but labile? For example, could it be that the FRET signal is the time average of a state in which the termini directly interact (as in the Rosetta model) and one in which they do not?</p></disp-quote><p>The proposed RoseVa model does not include the reentrant loop of the channel, so it is probable that this model would change if it were redone to include this new feature of the channel.</p><p>However, we do discuss the limitation of FRET as a method that measures a time average that is weighted towards closest approach in our discussion section. The termini are most certainly dynamic and it is possible that spend some time in close proximity. Given that FRET is biased towards closest approach, we actually think this strengthens our argument that the termini don’t spend a great deal of time in complex. In addition, our MST data suggests that the termini do not bind. We have added some commentary on this to the discussion section for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use previously characterised FRET methods to measure distances between intracellular segments of ASIC and with the membrane.

Having a positive control for binding would be great but we are not sure such a thing exists. You could certainly imagine a complex between two domains where each label (ANAP and TETAC) are pointed away from one other (giving comparatively modest quenching) or one where they are very close (giving comparatively large quenching), both of which could still be bound. This is essentially a less significant version of the problem with using FPs to measure proximity…they are not very good proxies for the position of the termini. These small labels are certainly beVer proxies but still not perfect. Our conclusion here is based more on the totality of the data. We tried many combinations and saw no sign of distances closer than ~ 20A at resting pH. We think the simplest explanation is that they are not close to one another but we tried to lay out the limitations in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One limitation that is not mentioned is the unroofing.

However, we have updated the section to include the possibility that the act of unroofing and washing could also disrupt the potential interaction between the intracellular domains as well as between these domains and other intracellular proteins. This was the best approach we could use to address our questions and it required that we unroof the cells. However, we look forward to future studies or new techniques that do not require the unroofing of the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The distances calculated depend on the R0 between donor and acceptor. In turn, this depends on the donor's emission spectrum and quantum yield. The spectrum and yield of ANAP is very sensitive to local environment. It is a useful fluorophore for patch fluorometry for precisely this reason, and gating-induced conformational changes in the CTD have been reported just from changes in ANAP emission alone (PMID 29425514). Therefore, using a single R0 value for all positions (and both pHs at a single position) is inappropriate. The authors should either include this caveat and give some estimate of how big an impact changes spectrum and yield might have, or actually measure the emission spectra at all positions tested.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a reasonable concern and one we considered. Measuring the quantum yield would be quite difficult. However, we have measured spectra at a number of positions and see a relatively minimal shik in the peak. Most positions peak between 481 and 484nm. If you calculate the difference in R0 using theoretical spectra with a blue shik of 20nm, the difference in R0 is only ~1.5A. A shik of 20nm is on the higher side of anything we have seen in the literature (PMID 30038260) and since even with that large a shik, the difference is minimal we do not think measuring spectra for each position would impact the overall conclusions presented. As you noted, though, the quantum yield also changes. Assuming a change in yield from 0.22 to 0.47, the largest we found reported in the literature (PMID:29923827) , the R0 would increase by 2A. This same paper showed that the blue shiked position was the one with the higher extinction coefficient so these changes would be working in opposition to one another making the difference in R0 even smaller. It is important to note, that while tmFRET is a much more powerful measure of distance than standard FRET, these distances, as you point out, are quite challenging to measure precisely. Our conclusions are based less on the absolute distances and more on the observation that no positions show large quenching and that if there is any change upon acidification, it is in the wrong direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, the writing and presentation of figures could be much improved with specific points mentioned in the recommendations for authors section.</p></disp-quote><p>See below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors argue that the CTD is largely parallel to the plasma membrane, yet appear to base this conclusion on ANAP to membrane FRET of positions S464 and M505. Two positions is insufficient evidence to support such a claim. Some intermediate positions are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not see in the paper where we suggest that the CTD is parallel. However, your point that we could try and determine if this was the case is correct. However, we aVempted to create several other CTD TAG mutants but struggled with readthrough and poor expression of these mutants so we opted to just include S464 and M505. Our point from these data is only that the distal CTD (505) must spend significant time near the membrane to explain our FRET data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Upon acidification, NTD position Q14 moves towards the plasma membrane (Figure 8B). Q14 also gets closer to C515 or doesn't change relative to 505 (Figures 7C and B) upon acidification. Yet position 505 moves away from the membrane (Figure 8D). How can the NTD move closer to the membrane, and to the CTD but yet the CTD move further from the membrane? Some comment or clarification is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a reasonable question and one that is hard to definitively answer. Our goal here was to test the hypothesis that the termini are bound at rest. Mapping the precise positions of the termini is difficult for reasons we will enumerate in the question that asks why we didn’t make a model. There are potentially multiple explanations but the easiest one would be that the CTD could move away from the membrane but closer to Q14, for instance, if the distal termini, say, rotated towards the NTD. This would move 505 closer and have no impact on whether or not the NTD and CTD moved away or toward the membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor concerns</p><p>The authors show the spectrum of ANAP attached to beads and use this spectrum to calculate R0 for their FRET measurements. Peak ANAP fluorescence is dependent on local environment and many reports show ANAP in protein blue-shiked relative to the values reported here. How would this affect the distance measurements reported?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. See above for the answer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the lack of interaction between the N- and C-terminal peptides in Figure 7 arise from the cysteine to serine mutations or lack of structure in the synthetic peptides. How were peptide concentrations measured/verified for the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>It is possible that cysteine to serine mutations could prevent the interaction. It is also possible that these peptides are not capable of adopting their native fold without the presence of the plasma membrane or due to being synthetically created. However, the termini are thought to be largely unstructured. We received these peptides in lyophilized form at &gt;95% purity and resuspended to our desired stock concentration (3 mM C-terminus, 1 mM N-terminus). Even if our concentration was off, we see no signs of interaction up to quite a high concentration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How was photobleaching measured for correcting the data?</p></disp-quote><p>We executed several mock experiments at various TAG positions using either pH 8 and pH 6, where we performed the experiments as usual but with a mock solution exchange when we would normally add the metal.

(1) Given that the FRET is a time average of positions, these distance constraints would not do much constraining. (2) Given that the termini are likely unstructured and flexible this makes the problem in 1 worse. (3) There is no structural information to use as a starting point for a model. (4) The flexibility of the linkers for each FRET pair also introduces uncertainty. This can, in theory, be modeled as they do in EPR but all of this together made us decide not to do this. What we hope readers take home, is the overall picture of the data is not consistent with the original RIPK1 hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe it would be good to draw a band on the graphs in Figure 6 for the FRET signal expected for interaction (and thus, disfavoured by these data). This would at least give context.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this could be helpful, but it is not so easy to do. What distance would we choose? We could put a line at ~5Å (the model predicted distance). As we noted above, a number of distances could be compatible with an interaction. However, we think it’s unlikely that if a complex was formed that none of our measurements would show a distance closer than 20Å at rest and that an unbinding event would then lead to a decrease in distance. This, to us, is the take home message.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points:</p><p>&quot;Aker unroofing the cells, only fluorescence associated with the &quot;footprint&quot;, or dorsal surface, of the cell membrane is lek behind.&quot;</p><p>The authors use dorsal and ventral in this section to describe parts of an adherent cell.

We reperformed the ANOVA here separating out the “outlier” day and nothing of substance changed. Both populations were still different with P value less than 0.001.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typo: Lumencore</p></disp-quote><p>Changed</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Maybe just a matter of taste but the panel created with Biorender in Figure 8 is not attractive and depicts the channel differently to in Figure 5D, which is again different from Figure 1A.

Yet citrine has a strong tendency to dimerize (PMID 27240257). Did the authors use mCitrine or just Citrine? This is quite important in interpreting their data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this important distinction. We use mCitirine which we have added to the methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has numerous instances of imprecise language. For example, page 10, last para, first line, &quot;previous studies have looked at...&quot; or page 7, final paragraph &quot;tell a similar story&quot;. Related, the figures could be much better. For example, in Figure 1, where the authors depict the anap chemical in red, as opposed to the blue one might expect of a blue emiqng fluorophore. In figure 6, ANAP is also in red with the quenching group in green. This is opposite to how one typically thinks of FRET with the warmer color being the acceptor not the donor. Moreover, the pH 6 condition is also colored the same shade of red as the ANAP. Labels of Cys positions would again be useful here. In Figure 3, the heteroatoms of TETAC and C18-NTA are very small and difficult to see. It would also be good to label these structures, and the spectra below, so the reader can tell at a glance without looking at the caption, what the structures and spectra arise from. Also, how are the absorption spectra normalized? This is not discussed in the methods. The lack of attention to presentation mars an otherwise nice study.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these points. We have made modifications to the manuscript to address these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract, second last line &quot;Aker prolonged acidification, ...&quot;, 'prolonged' could be interpreted as 'it takes a while for the domain to move' or 'the movement only happens aker a while'. This not what the authors intend to convey. Consider modifying to just 'Aker acidification,'</p></disp-quote><p>We updated the main text to indicate that prolonged acidification is intended to describe acidification that occurs over the minutes timescale.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Pdf page 6, bottom para on Anap incorporation not altering channel function: What is meant by 'steady state pH dependence of activation'? This implies the authors applied a pH stimulus, then waited until equilibrium was achieved ie. until desensitization was complete and measured the current at that point. It seems more likely they simply applied different pH stimuli and measured the peak response and that the use of 'steady state' here is a typo.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed the phrase steady state.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Same section, controls of electrophysiology allude to 485, 505 and 515 ANAP-containing channels. In fact, the authors have no way of determining what fraction (if any) of the pH evoked currents arise from channels containing Anap in those positions versus from simply having a translation stop but still functioning. This should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. We cannot be sure the CTD TAG positions are not a mixture of ANAP-containing channels and truncations. See above for why we do not think this a big concern for the FRET experiments. Functionally, though, you are correct that we cannot tell. We now mention this in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods, the abbreviation for SBT should be defined somewhere.</p></disp-quote><p>Added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Methods, unroofing section, middle paragraph, the authors use nM not nm to list wavelengths of light.</p></disp-quote><p>Changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3C-D: There's an unexpected blip in the Anap emission spectra at ~500 nm.

The data are not corrected for either camera efficiency or grating efficiency. We don’t have easy access to the actual data (although we can see a pdf version of each). There is a liVle blip in the grating efficiency graph that could partly explain the blip in our spectra.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5C, were recovery experiments routinely done?

The data are whole numbers and people can easily determine the Δ distance. We felt that including that column would bring too much focus on what we think are preVy small changes.

These data, as well as G11, are unlikely to be parametric and hence ANOVA is inappropriate. A normality test, and likely Kruskal-Wallis test is called for.</p></disp-quote><p>Aker testing for normality, the data for Q14TAG C485 pH8 are non-normally distributed. However, a Kruskal Wallis is a non-parametric test for a one-way ANOVA and not applicable here. We separated the data out into population 1 and 2 and repeated the two-way ANOVA statistical test. When Q14TAG pH 8 is split into 2 populations, the statistics hardly change. When the data is not separated, Q14TAG pH 8 relative to pH 6 has a p-value &lt;0.0001. When the 2 populations are separated, both populations relative to Q14TAG pH 6 still have a p-value of &lt;0.0001.</p></body></sub-article></article>
