Article (Li et al., 2019) revealed a continuous tunnel traversing the protein from extracellular to intracellular pores. We proposed the tunnel as the conductance channel closed by three constrictions: C1 in the extracellular half, mid-membrane C2 containing the photoactive site, and C3 on the cytoplasmic side. Reported here, the crystal structure of bromide-bound <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 reveals structural changes that relax the C1 and C3 constrictions, including a novel salt-bridge switch mechanism involving C1 and the photoactive site. These findings indicate that substrate binding induces a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark that facilitates channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions. The results provide direct evidence that the tunnel is the closed form of the channel of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 and shed light on the light-gated channel activation mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>channelrhodopsin</kwd><kwd>GtACR1</kwd><kwd>bromide binding</kwd><kwd>Guillardia theta</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>ACR</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM027750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM140838</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Endowed Chair AU-0009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spudich</surname><given-names>John L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18TPA34230046</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CBET-1264434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothschild</surname><given-names>Kenneth J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007601</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>701647</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huang</surname><given-names>Chia-Ying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Substrate-induced structural changes in <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 provide new insight into the chemical mechanism of natural light-gated anion conductance and facilitate its optimization for photoinhibition of neuron firing in optogenetics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 is a light-gated anion channel discovered in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>) now widely used in optogenetics as a neuron-silencing tool. <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 conducts both bromide and chloride ions effectively with higher relative permeability for the former substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>). We and the group of Karl Deisseroth independently determined X-ray crystal structures of the dark (closed) form of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 homodimer at 2.9 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>). We proposed that the conductance pathway was attributable to a full-length intramolecular tunnel traversing each protomer from the extracellular side to the intracellular side of the membrane lined by mostly hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Current rectification by charges introduced inside but not outside the tunnel support our hypothesis that the tunnel serves as the anion-conducting path upon photoactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sineshchekov et al., 2019</xref>). However, no substrate was found in either structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>) despite the presence of chloride in the crystallization conditions. The mechanism of anion conductance is still elusive.</p><p>In the apo form (i.e., without anion substrate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>) the tunnel is narrowed by three constrictions blocking ion permeation: Constriction 1 (C1) in the extracellular half, C2 mid-membrane consisting of the photoactive retinylidene Schiff base and interacting residues, and C3 in the cytoplasmic half. In our model, retinal photoisomerization at C2 needs to open all three of these gates to form a conductive anion channel through the protein. However, structural changes at the two constrictions, C1 and C3, which are located on each side of the Schiff base, and their roles in the channel gating mechanism are unclear.</p><p>To address these questions, here we report the crystal structure of bromide-bound <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1. The structure in bromide provides direct evidence for our proposed conductance mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>) and also demonstrates protein conformational changes in C1 and C3, which shed light into the role of the constrictions in channel opening.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall structure of bromide-bound <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1</title><p>Bromide-bound <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 crystals were obtained in the same conditions and pH used for the apo form structure, except for replacement of NaCl with NaBr in both protein purification and crystallization buffers.

The widened constriction regions indicate a pre-activated conformation exhibiting a closed channel with fractional transition to an open-channel state.

Based on the composite omit map, the signal of bromide in chain A is stronger than in chain B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). A priori, given the larger number of electrons in Br (Z = 35), it would be difficult to mistake it for a water molecule (Z = 10), but to test this possibility directly, the bromide ion was replaced with a water molecule and the structure refined using <italic>PHENIX</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The refinement showed a strong positive electron density at the bromide position in the <italic>F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub></italic> difference map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>) and it was diminished only when a bromide ion was placed at that position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>). This evidence excludes a water molecule as responsible for the electron density at the position. From these data and additional evidence presented below, we conclude a bromide ion resides at the tunnel entry in each protomer.</p><p>The bromide-binding site is formed by three cyclic residues: Pro58 from the cytoplasmic loop between TM1 and 2, and Trp246 and Trp250 from TM7 in a triangular configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the binding site, a bromide is stabilized by a H-bond interaction formed by the indole NH group of Trp250. This type of anion binding conformation has also been found in several chloride-bound nucleotide structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffinger et al., 2004</xref>). Pro58 may play an important role in substrate binding by pressing its ring towards the bromide anion with a distance of 3.6 Å and 3.1 Å between the bromide ion and CG and CD atoms of Pro58 in chain A and 4.0 Å and 3.2 Å in chain B. Unlike other aromatic residues, the ring of proline exhibits a partial positive charge due to electron withdrawal by the adjacent protein backbone and the lower electronegativity of the hydrogens on the ring surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zondlo, 2013</xref>). The partial electropositivity of Pro58 may contribute to the binding of bromide via electrostatic interactions. Notably, this type of proline-halide interaction has also been observed in the structure of the chloride-pump rhodopsin ClR (site 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Structure of the bromide-binding site in the apo and bromide-bound <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 and electrophysiological properties of site mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A bromide ion (<italic>magenta</italic> sphere) stabilized by three cyclic residues (<italic>green</italic> sticks) via H-bond interaction (<italic>black</italic> dashed line) with superimposition of the apo form structure (<italic>orange</italic>).

Based on the structure, the two tryptophan residues, Trp246 and Trp250, appear to have different roles in bromide binding; for example, compared to distant Trp246 moving its aromatic ring away from the bromide, Trp250 is close to the anion and forms an H-bond interaction between its indole NH and the bromide. In further examination of this bromide binding conformation, we found that W250F shows reduction of the current amplitude by 50%, whereas W246F behaves like WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In the structure of ClR, a chloride ion (site 1) is bound between Arg95 and the Schiff base via H-bonds and salt-bridges.

We identified a novel bromide-binding site at the cytoplasmic entry of the transmembrane tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The identification of bromide is supported by multiple lines of evidence: (1) the composite omit map indicates the presence of bromide at the cytoplasmic port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>); (2) we exclude the possibility of a water at the bromide position as demonstrated in the <italic>F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub></italic> difference map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>); (3) the bromide-binding site exhibits a similar chemical conformation seen in chloride-binding structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auffinger et al., 2004</xref>); (4) functional analysis of W250F and W246F is consistent with the H-bond interaction in the bromide-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); (5) specific interaction of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 with bromide in the unphotolyzed dark state was further demonstrated by FTIR analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In sum, these data confirm the bromide binding conformation in the structure.</p><p>These findings provide direct evidence for our hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2019</xref>) that the tunnel we observe both in the apo form and in an altered form in the bromide-bound condition, is the closed anion channel. The structure shows protein conformational changes in the bromide-bound tunnel that widen the tunnel: (1) bromide binding at the cytoplasmic entry induces relaxation of the C3 constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); and (2) salt-bridge switching of Arg94 widens the tunnel and may facilitate anion binding with the protonated Schiff base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>).</p><p>The two protomers, chains A and B, share a very similar overall structure (rmsd = 0.5 Å). Both chains show a similar bromide binding conformation at the cytoplasmic entry and bromide binding to each site results in widening of the C3 constriction in each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). The most significant difference is found in the tunnel at the Arg94 residue located at the C1 constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In chain B, the conformation of Arg94 is nearly identical to that found in the apo form structure. Its side chain extends towards the extracellular side of the tunnel and is stabilized by a salt-bridge with Glu223. In contrast, Arg94 undergoes a salt-bridge switching in chain A; it rotates its side chain towards the retinylidene Schiff base to form an alternative salt-bridge with Asp234. This conformational change results in widening of the C1 constriction in chain A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Based on these observations, we propose as a working hypothesis that the conformational differences of Arg94 between chains B and A accompanied by bromide binding at C3 demonstrate a transition from an inactivated state to a pre-activated state in the dark.</p><p>The conformational change of Arg94 near C1 is not likely to be directly induced allosterically by bromide binding at distant C3 since it is only observed in chain A, not in chain B. Instead, this conformational change may reflect the intrinsic flexibility property of Arg94 in the tunnel in the bromide-bound state. Weak binding and low occupancy of bromide at C1 is also a possibility suggested by the similar conformations of Arg94 of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 (chain A) and Arg95 of ClR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These two counterpart residues appear to be stabilized by distinct H-bond networks. In <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1, inward Arg94 only forms a salt-bridge with Asp234 and an H-bond with a water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, in the ClR structure, in addition to the salt-bridge, Arg95 is further stabilized by three polar residues, Asn92, Gln224, and Thr228, via two water molecules from the extracellular side of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The absence of these polar residues and waters in the vicinity may liberalize Arg94 and facilitate its flip-flopping in the tunnel of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1.</p><p>Despite the conformational changes that expanded the tunnel in C1 and C3, C2 remains as the narrowest constriction attributable to the <italic>trans</italic>-configured retinal moiety within the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting a dominant role of the photoactive site Schiff base per se in the channel-gating mechanism. Moreover, the pre-activating conformational changes induced by bromide binding may facilitate channel opening by reducing free energy in the tunnel constrictions, consistent with the larger conductance of bromide vs chloride (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Govorunova et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>FTIR data show that bromide binding in the dark significantly alters the electron conjugation of the retinylidene polyene chain without perturbing the all-<italic>trans</italic> to 13-<italic>cis</italic> photoisomerization reaction occurring in the femtosec to picosec time window.

Data were collected with a 10 × 10 µm<sup>2</sup> micro-focused X-ray beam of 13.49 keV (0.91882 Å in wavelength) at 100 K using SLS data acquisition software suites (DA+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wojdyla et al., 2018</xref>). Continuous grid-scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wojdyla et al., 2018</xref>) were used to locate crystals in frozen LCP samples both from conventional loop and IMISX samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). The crystals harvested on loop were collected by the rotation method with 0.2 s exposure time, 0.2<sup>o</sup> oscillation for data collection and 30<sup>o</sup> wedge for each crystals. The sample using IMISX setup was measured by an automated serial data collection protocol (CY+) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Basu et al., 2019</xref>) using the following parameters: 0.2<sup>o</sup> oscillation and 0.1 s exposure time for data collection with 10–20<sup>o</sup> wedge for each crystal. 217 data sets were collected using the EIGER 16M detector operated in continuous/shutterless data collection mode. Data were processed with XDS and scaled and merged with XSCALE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kabsch, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kabsch, 2010b</xref>). Isomorphic data sets were selected using XDSCC12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Assmann et al., 2020</xref>). The selection is first performed using a multi-dimensional scaling procedure which identifies data sets with large non-isomorphism relative to clusters of other data sets, and then further selection based on the ΔCC1/2. The ΔCC1/2 represents the influence of a set of reflections on the overall CC1/2 of the merged data. By this mean, 31 IMISX data sets and five data sets obtained from loop-mounted samples were selected and then merged to a final complete data set yielding a 3.2 Å resolution structure.

The structure was refined using PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) and model building was completed manually using COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). The final structure yields a R<sub>work</sub>/R<sub>free</sub> factor of 0.26/0.29. Refinement statistics are reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. The structure factors and coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB entry code: 7L1E). Figures of molecular structures were generated with PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org">http://www.pymol.org</ext-link>).

Briefly, the wild-type expression construct was cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) in frame with an EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein). Mutations were introduced using a QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and verified by DNA sequencing. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney) cells were transfected using the ScreenFectA transfection reagent (Waco Chemicals USA, Richmond, VA). All-<italic>trans</italic>-retinal (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added at the final concentration 4 µM immediately after transfection. Photocurrents were recorded 48–72 hr after transfection in whole-cell voltage clamp mode at room temperature (25°C) with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA) and digitized with a Digidata 1440A using pClamp 10 software (both from Molecular Devices). Patch pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass and filled with the following solution (in mM): KCl 126, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 2, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 0.5, EGTA 5, HEPES 25, and pH 7.4. The standard bath solution contained (in mM): NaCl 150, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 1.8, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1, glucose 5, HEPES 10, pH 7.4. To test for changes in the permeability for Cl<sup>-</sup>, this ion in the bath was partially replaced with non-permeable aspartate (the final Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration 5.6 mM). For each cell, a single value of the E<sub>rev</sub> was calculated. The holding potential values were corrected for liquid junction potentials calculated using the Clampex built-in LJP calculator. Continuous light pulses were provided by a Polychrome V light source (T.I.L.L. Photonics GMBH, Grafelfing, Germany) at 15 nm half-bandwidth in combination with a mechanical shutter (Uniblitz Model LS6, Vincent Associates, Rochester, NY; half-opening time 0.5 ms). The maximal light intensity at the focal plane of the objective lense was 7.7 mW mm<sup>−2</sup> at 515 nm.</p><p>Batches of culture were randomly allocated for transfection with a specific mutant; no masking (blinding) was used. Individual transfected HEK293 cells were selected for patching by inspecting their tag fluorescence; non-fluorescent cells were excluded, as were cells for which we could not establish a gigaohm seal. Results obtained from different individual cells were considered as biological replicates. The raw data obtained in individual cells are shown as diamonds. Sample size was estimated from previous experience and published work on a similar subject, as recommended by the NIH guidelines. No outliers were excluded. Normality of the data was not assumed, and therefore non-parametric statistical tests were used as implemented in OriginPro 2016 software; P values &gt; 0.05 were considered not significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Only a commercially available cell line authenticated by the vendor (HEK293 from ATCC) was used; no cell lines from the list of commonly misidentified cell lines were used. The absence of micoplasma contamination was verified by Visual-PCR mycoplasma detection kit (GM Biosciences, Frederick, MD).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>FTIR difference spectroscopy</title><p>The expression, purification, and reconstitution of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 into proteolipid membranes using <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipids was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yi et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 membranes were washed and centrifuged 5x in 1M NaF, NaCl and NaBr solutions and the pellet finally resuspended in a solution of 100 mM NaF, NaCl, or NaBr. Multilamellar films were formed by drying a small drop of this suspension on a BaF window which is rehydrated with a drop of water in a sealed cell. FTIR difference measurements at 80 K were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yi et al., 2017</xref>). All spectra were recorded using a Bio-Rad FTS-60A FTIR spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc) equipped with a liquid nitrogen cooled HgCdTe detector. Each acquired spectrum consisted of 200 scans (approximately one-minute total acquisition time) recorded at 4 cm<sup>−1</sup> resolutions. Difference spectra consisted of an average of at least five difference spectra recorded immediately before illumination each subtracted from a spectrum recorded during illumination using 505 nm LED light. In order to repeat this measurement and average multiple differences, the sample was photoreversed after illumination with 590 nm light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Yi et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants R01GM027750 and R35GM140838 and Endowed Chair AU-0009 from the Robert A Welch Foundation to JLS, American Heart Association Grant 18TPA34230046 to LZ, and the National Science Foundation Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Grant CBET-1264434 to KJR.

We thank the editors for pointing out that we should show more clearly the differences between the two protomers, which raised interesting aspects of the structure worthy of discussion. The two chains share a very similar overall structure (RMSD = 0.5Å). Both chains A and B show a similar bromide binding conformation at the cytoplasmic entry and bromide binding to each site results in widening of the C3 constriction in each protomer (Figure 1B and 1C). The identification of bromide in each chain is demonstrated in Suppl. Figure 1. The most significant difference is found in the tunnel at the Arg94 residue located at the C1 constriction (Figure 4A). In chain B, the conformation of Arg94 is nearly identical to that found in the apo form structure. Its side chain extends towards the extracellular side of the tunnel and is stabilized by a salt-bridge with Glu233. In contrast, Arg94 undergoes a salt-bridge switching in chain A; it rotates its side chain towards the retinylidene Schiff base to form an alternative salt-bridge with Asp234. This conformational change results in widening of the C1 constriction in chain A (Figure 1B). We have added discussion of these differences and their implications in the Discussion section (lines 255-266).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line237-239: Please explain the logic for merging the datasets collected from crystals in the IMISX setup and from crystals harvested on the loop.</p></disp-quote><p>We explain the logic here and in the revision the details are in the Materials and Methods section (lines 327-345). Data collection was carried out using both loop-mounted crystals and the IMISX setup. We initially performed data collection using crystals mounted on the loop. To avoid radiation damage, only a small wedge dataset was collected from each Br-<italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 crystal. To overcome the limited amount of data from each wedge, we then applied the IMISX method in order to screen a large number of crystals efficiently. We were able to collect 217 small wedges data sets using the IMISX setup. These datasets were carefully selected using XDSCC12 <italic>(Assmann et al., 2020</italic>) to eliminate non-isomorphism. The selection was first performed as a multi-dimensional scaling procedure that identifies data sets with large non-isomorphism relative to clusters of other datasets, and then further selects based on the ΔCC<sub>1/2</sub>. The ΔCC<sub>1/2</sub> represents the influence of a set of reflections on the overall CC<sub>1/2</sub> of the merged data. By this means, 31 isomorphic small wedge data sets were selected. To improve data completeness, we also selected 5 isomorphic datasets from loop samples. The total 36 small wedge datasets were merged using XDS to yield a final 3.2 Å complete data set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please use the dataset collected at 0.91882Å to draw an anomalous difference Fourier map. If the map does not support the bromide binding, then other experiments such as ITC or FTIR would be needed to validate bromide binding in the dark.</p></disp-quote><p>The datasets were collected at 0.91882 Å wavelength, but we did not detect any strong bromide signals in the anomalous difference Fourier map. This may be due to preferential orientation of the thin-plate <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 crystals in the IMISX plate. The weak Br signals may also be attributed to the weak bromide binding conformation, its partial occupancy, and poor intrinsic order. It is not unusual that anomalous signals are influenced by the location of the scatter. For example, in our previous structural determination of YfkE (Wu et al., PNAS 2013), Seleno-methionine was used to label 12 native Met residues. However, we could identify only 10 Se positions and the other 2 Se were undetectable in the anomalous difference map, despite the dataset collection at the Se absorption peak wavelength. Therefore, the lack of strong anomalous signals is not sufficient to exclude the presence of bromide in the structure.</p><p>During refinement, we carefully compared the new structure with our previous apo form since both structures were obtained in essentially the same conditions except for the replacement of NaCl with NaBr. We found an unusual density at an entry port to the tunnel. The structure could be better refined only if we included bromide at that position. Further supporting our conclusion, we present several lines of evidence confirming the presence of bromide: (1) We show the composite omit map calculated by PHENIX. As seen in Suppl. Figure 1A-1B, the omit map of bromide is contoured at 2σ in chain A and at 1.5σ in chain B. (2) We exclude the possibility of a water at the bromide position. PHENIX refinement with a water substitution showed a strong positive density in the <italic>F<sub>o</sub></italic>-<italic>F<sub>c</sub></italic> difference map (Suppl. Figure 1C-1D), which is diminished when refining a bromide at the position (Suppl. Figure 1E-1F). (3) A similar halide binding geometry is found in other halide-binding structures in microbial rhodopsins. (4) We have added FTIR data (Figure 3) showing specific interaction of bromide with <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 in the dark, with effects different from other halides. (5) We included additional functional analysis of W250F and W246F confirming the specific H-bond interaction between bromide and W250, but not with W246, as predicted by the binding site (Figure 2B). Considering all of this evidence, we are confident in the assignment of the Br<sup>-</sup> positions in the structure. We have addressed these data further in the Discussion section (lines 239-248).</p><p>Following the Editor’s suggestion, we applied a different method, FTIR, and validated bromide binding to <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 in the dark state. We analyzed FTIR spectra of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 in the presence of 3 different halide ions: F<sup>-</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, and Br<sup>-</sup>. Differences in major bands in the 1500-1600 cm<sup>-1</sup> region that reflect the ethylenic (C=C) stretch mode of the retinylidene chromophore show a large bromide-induced alteration in the electron conjugation of the retinylidene polyene chain in the dark, confirming that bromide causes a significant structural change. We have added the FTIR data in the revision (Figure 3) and analysis in the main text, and have added as authors Prof. Kenneth Rothschild, a well-known expert molecular spectroscopist in the rhodopsin field, and his coworker Dr. Adrian Yi.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please add a brief discussion on the change in C1 being an allosteric effect of bromide binding near C3 vs. the result of a low bromide occupancy at C1.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the editors for raising this issue. In the revision we address it in Discussion (lines 267-278) put in after the discussion of the differences between chain A and chain B conformations as follows:</p><p>“The conformational change of Arg94 near C1 is not likely to be directly induced allosterically by bromide binding at distant C3 since it is only observed in chain A, not in chain B. […] The absence of these polar residues and waters in the vicinity may liberalize Arg94 and facilitate its flip-flopping in the tunnel of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Include relevant citations to previously published work that also identified Asp 234 as a critical amino acid that is protonated in the dark state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following paragraph at the end of the Results section (lines 220-234):</p><p>“Studies in 3 different laboratories have concluded that Asp234 is neutral in the dark state from measurements of the D234N mutant of <italic>Gt</italic>ACR1 by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy (Kim et al., 2018; Sineshchekov et al., 2016), Resonance Raman spectroscopy (Yi et al., 2016), and FTIR (Kim et al., 2018). […] The electrostatic interaction of Arg94 with Asp234 in the pre-activated state may be correlated with the change in the electron conjugation of the retinylidene polyene chain in the dark that we observed by FTIR.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
