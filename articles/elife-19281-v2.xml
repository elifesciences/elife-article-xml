Here, we show that <italic>Guy1</italic>, a unique Y chromosome gene of a major urban malaria mosquito <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>, confers 100% female lethality when placed on the autosomes. We show that the small GUY1 protein (56 amino acids in length) causes female lethality and that males carrying the transgene are reproductively more competitive than their non-transgenic siblings under laboratory conditions. The GUY1 protein is a primary signal from the Y chromosome that affects embryonic development in a sex-specific manner. Our results have demonstrated, for the first time in mosquitoes, the feasibility of stable transgenic manipulation of sex ratios using an endogenous gene from the male-determining chromosome. These results provide insights into the elusive M factor and suggest exciting opportunities to reduce mosquito populations and disease transmission.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19281.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19281.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19281.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Much like humans, <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes have a pair of sex chromosomes that determine whether they are male or female: females have two X chromosomes, while males have an X and a Y. Genetic evidence has indicated that there is a dominant male-determining factor on the Y chromosome that acts as a master switch to cause mosquitoes to develop into males. Mosquitoes that lack a Y chromosome, and hence the male-determining factor, therefore develop into the default female sex.</p><p>Because only female mosquitoes feed on blood and transmit disease-causing microbes – including those that cause malaria – there is strong interest in identifying the male-determining factor. Introducing this gene into females could allow mosquito sex ratios to be manipulated towards the harmless non-biting males.</p><p>In 2013, a study of male <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes identified a gene called <italic>Guy1</italic> that is only found on the Y chromosome. Criscione et al. – who were involved in the 2013 study – now show that female <italic>A. stephensi</italic> mosquitoes die when the <italic>Guy1</italic> gene is placed on their non-sex chromosomes.</p><p>Further investigation confirmed that the protein produced from the <italic>Guy1</italic> gene kills the females. This protein is an initiating signal that affects embryonic development in a sex-specific manner, making it a strong candidate to be the male determining factor in <italic>A. stephensi.</italic> This is consistent with previous reports in which the master switches of sex determination could be manipulated to kill specific sexes in fruit flies and nematode worms.</p><p>Criscione et al. also found that males that carry the inserted <italic>Guy1</italic> gene on their non-sex chromosomes – and so could potentially pass it on to both male and female offspring – are reproductively more competitive than their non-modified siblings under laboratory conditions. As the resulting female offspring would not survive, it is thus feasible, in principle, to genetically manipulate the sex ratio of the mosquitoes.</p><p>A future challenge will be to identify how the protein encoded by the <italic>Guy1</italic> gene acts to kill female mosquitoes.

Similarly, the primary molecular signals that determine sex are highly divergent in insects. In honeybees which use the diploid/haploid system, heterozygosity of the <italic>complementary sex determiner (csd</italic>) gene is the primary signal that initiates female development ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hasselmann et al., 2008</xref>). In silkworms a piRNA gene on the W chromosome triggers female development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, which has XX/XY sex chromosomes, the collective dose of X-linked signal elements (XSE) functions as the signal that specifies sex in the early embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Erickson and Quintero, 2007</xref>). However, a dominant male-determining factor (<italic>M</italic>) on the Y chromosome initiates male development in many other insects that contain XX/XY sex chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanchez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biedler and Tu, 2016</xref>). Instead of a well differentiated and heteromorphic Y chromosome, mosquitoes of the <italic>Culicinae</italic> subfamily, which includes the genus <italic>Aedes</italic>, contain a homomorphic sex-determining chromosome that harbors an <italic>M</italic> factor in the male-determining locus (<italic>M</italic>-locus). A novel RNA-binding protein named <italic>Nix</italic> was recently shown to be an <italic>M</italic> factor in <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite rapid changes in the primary signals or master switches, two key transcription factors at the bottom of the sex-determination pathway, <italic>doublesex (dsx</italic>) and <italic>fruitless (fru</italic>), are highly conserved in insects. Sex-specific splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> pre-mRNAs leads to the production of sex-specific DSX and FRU protein isoforms, which program sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>). The alternative splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> pre-mRNAs is often controlled by a protein complex that includes a fast-evolving <italic>transformer</italic> (TRA) and a conserved <italic>transformer 2</italic> (TRA2), where TRA is the sex-specific protein in this TRA/TRA2 complex. Indeed, TRA often functions as an intermediate that transduces the selected sexual fate from the primary signal to the DSX and FRU effector molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bopp et al., 2014</xref>). For example, in the medfly <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>, which has XX/XY sex chromosomes, a functional TRA is produced in the zygotic XX embryo as a result of splicing by a maternally deposited TRA/TRA2 complex, leading to female-specific <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> splicing and thus the female sex, which is then maintained by the self-sustaining loop of <italic>tra</italic> splicing and function. In males, a yet-to-be-discovered M factor interrupts this loop of <italic>tra</italic> splicing, leading to the male sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pane et al., 2002</xref>). Sex-specific splicing of <italic>dsx</italic> and <italic>fru</italic> has been described in both <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, suggesting the presence of a TRA-like activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Scali et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Salvemini et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2013</xref>). However, a <italic>tra</italic> gene or its functional homolog has not yet been found in any mosquitoes.</p><p><italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes contain well-differentiated X and Y chromosomes and genetic evidence suggests that a dominant <italic>M factor</italic> on the Y chromosome controls male development in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Sakai, 1979</xref>). The <italic>Anopheles</italic> Y chromosome also regulates mating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fraccaro et al., 1977</xref>). There is tremendous interest in deciphering Y gene function in non-model insects, including <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, to shed light on the mechanism and evolution of sexual differentiation. There has also been strong interest in Y chromosome genes in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes for translational motivations. Only female mosquitoes transmit disease pathogens because only females feed on blood. Thus, it is ideal, if not required, to release only males when considering genetic approaches for reducing mosquito populations or for replacing competent vector populations with populations that are refractory to disease transmission (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benedict and Robinson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Windbichler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Black et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2012</xref>]). A better understanding of the Y chromosome function in sex-determination and male reproduction may provide novel targets for interference and lead to several practical applications. For example, transgenic lines may be obtained that produce male-only mosquitoes, resulting in more cost-effective mass production and sex separation methods than current approaches (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papathanos et al., 2009</xref>]). Furthermore, releasing such transgenic males is theoretically much more efficient than classic sterile insect techniques in achieving population reduction and disease control because of the added benefit of male-bias in subsequent generations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schliekelman et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Despite strong interest and the availability of genomic resources (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Holt et al., 2002</xref>]), earlier systematic efforts failed to identify Y genes in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krzywinski et al., 2006</xref>). Several Y genes were recently discovered in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Criscione et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2013</xref>) by sequencing males and females separately. None of these genes is homologous to the <italic>Nix</italic> gene in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2015</xref>) or encodes a predicted RNA-binding protein or splicing factor. However, among the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> Y chromosome genes, <italic>gYG2 (An. gambiae</italic> Y Gene 2) is the most likely candidate for the <italic>M</italic> factor because it showed early embryonic expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2013</xref>) and it is the only Y gene that is shared among all species within the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> species complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2016</xref>). In a recent report, <italic>gYG2</italic> (renamed YOB by the authors) was shown to confer female-specific lethality in a transient embryonic assay and shift <italic>doublesex (dsx)</italic> splicing towards the male isoform in an <italic>An. gambiae</italic> cell line, suggesting that gYG2/YOB functions as an <italic>M</italic> factor in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krzywinska et al., 2016</xref>). Among the four Y genes identified in <italic>An. stephensi, Guy1</italic> is the best candidate for the <italic>M factor</italic> because it is transcribed the earliest among all Y genes, at the very onset of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Criscione et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transient embryonic injection of <italic>Guy1</italic> caused male bias</title><p><italic>Guy1</italic> transcription is transient and its transcript tapers off approximately 8–12 hr after egg deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Criscione et al., 2013</xref>).

We have now shown in transgenic lines that the native <italic>Guy1</italic> promoter is able to direct <italic>Guy1</italic> transcription as well as GUY1 function when placed in the autosome of genetic females which lack the Y chromosome. Thus, <italic>Guy1</italic> is a primary signal, not a secondary signal, from the Y chromosome. We have also provided evidence that the small GUY1 protein is the functional molecule by analyzing various <italic>Guy1</italic> mutants or constructs in transgenic lines. When ectopically expressed in females, the small GUY1 protein confers 100% female lethality during embryonic and early larvae stages. As discussed in detail below, manipulations of master switches of sex-determination also cause sex-specific lethality in fruit flies and nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schutt and Nothiger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penalva and Sánchez, 2003</xref>). Taken together, we suggest that <italic>Guy1</italic> is a strong candidate for the <italic>M</italic> factor in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>. Unlike the newly discovered <italic>M</italic> factor <italic>Nix</italic> in <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2015</xref>), ectopic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> did not produce masculinized XX females. However, a recently reported <italic>M</italic> factor in <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, gYG2/YOB, also confers female-specific lethality instead of sex conversion in a transient embryonic assay using in vitro synthesized YOB mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krzywinska et al., 2016</xref>). The cause of female lethality in the transgenic <italic>An. stephensi</italic> is unknown. A few scenarios are possible, one being related to dosage compensation, which is a mechanism known to occur in <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hahn and Lanzaro, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mank et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>] <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rose et al., 2016</xref>), including <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), to ensure equal levels of X-linked gene products in females (XX) and males (XY). It is intriguing that three known master switches of sex-determination, <italic>Sex-lethal, Fem/Masc</italic>, and <italic>xo-lethal 1</italic>, also regulate dosage compensation in <italic>D. melanogaster, Bombyx mori,</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic>, respectively ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thomas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schutt and Nothiger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Penalva and Sánchez, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>]). Loss of function <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> alleles cause female embryonic lethality in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> due to mis-regulation of dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cline, 1978</xref>). Similarly, knockdown of <italic>Masc</italic> also casues female-specific letahlity in <italic>B. mori,</italic> most likely due to mis-regulation of dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kiuchi et al., 2014</xref>). If <italic>Guy1</italic> is also involved in the regulation of dosage compensation in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, ectopic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> in XX individuals may result in higher than normal levels of expression from X-linked genes, which could be lethal. Indeed, the sex-conversion phenotypes that resulted from ectopic expression of <italic>Nix</italic> were possible, presumably because <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> does not require dosage compensation as it contains homomorphic sex-determining chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There is no significant similarity between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB in their primary amino acid sequences. Thus, it will be difficult to determine whether Guy1 and YG2/YOB have a common evolutionary origin, especially as Y chromosome genes tend to evolve rapidly and similarities between very small proteins may not be easy to detect. However, both GUY1 and gYG2/YOB proteins are 56 amino acid long and have helical secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Criscione et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krzywinska et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, four out of the first five amino acid residues are identical between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB proteins. Thus, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that GUY1 and gYG2/YOB may be evolutionarily related. Regardless, it is unlikely that <italic>Guy1</italic> and <italic>gYG2/YOB</italic> are complete functional orthologs because <italic>Guy1</italic> is only expressed in the early embryos in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> (tapering off at 8–12 hr after egg laying, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Criscione et al., 2013</xref>) while <italic>gYG2/YOB</italic> is expressed in the early embryos as well as in later developmental stages in <italic>An. gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krzywinska et al., 2016</xref>). Our hypothesis is that <italic>Guy1</italic> is the initial or primary signal which triggers a cascade of events downstream. This is analogous to the early <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> gene product (SXL<sub>e</sub>) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herpin and Schartl, 2015</xref>]), which is only produced during the early embryonic stage. This transient primary signal, SXL<sub>e</sub>, is sufficient to trigger the female-specific cascade of events that are then maintained by downstream factors such as the late SXL protein throughout development. The transient expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> suggests that it may function as a trigger or initiating signal, but not as a gene that maintains sexual identity. If additional Y genes are indeed required for either initiating or maintaining sex determination in <italic>An. stephensi</italic>, ectopic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> alone may not be sufficient to change <italic>dsx</italic> splicing in female cells/embryos due to the lack of Y chromosome. The transient and early embryonic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> also made it difficult to knockdown <italic>Guy1</italic> simply because there is not enough time for RNAi to work in the early embryos. However, further characterization of other Y genes in <italic>An. stephensi</italic> may enable the experimental demonstration of potential <italic>Guy1</italic> targets, which could lead to the elucidation of the <italic>Guy1</italic>-dependent developmental pathway in the early embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Complete penetrance, stable inheritance, early-stage lethality, and reproductive competitiveness indicate the potential for powerful applications</title><p>Our results demonstrated, for the first time in mosquitoes, that a Y chromosome gene, namely <italic>Guy1</italic>, confers 100% female lethality when ectopically expressed from an autosome in XX individuals and this effect can be stably inherited for many generations.

However, the stability and penetrance of the phenotypes conferred by the <italic>Nix</italic> or <italic>gYG2/YOB</italic> transgenes remain to be determined as <italic>Nix</italic> or <italic>gYG2/YOB</italic> transgenic lines have yet to be reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krzywinska et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have proved in principle that sustained sex ratio manipulation can be achieved using a Y chromosome gene with high penetrance. Furthermore, males that carry the <italic>Guy1</italic> transgene are more competitive in overall reproductive output than their non-transgenic male siblings under laboratory conditions. Future studies based on analysis of progeny of individual females mated with transgenic and wildtype males will give insight regarding the mating competitiveness of the transgenic individuals. Competitive assays performed in semi-field or field conditions are needed to determine whether ectopic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> truly makes the males reproductively more competitive than wild type mosquitoes. Nonetheless, data presented in this study suggest that the <italic>Guy1</italic> transgene shows no obvious detrimental effects in males and may be developed as a new method to generate male-only mosquitoes for release.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, transgenic lines that produce only male progeny will improve current sex-separation methods and provide new ways to reduce mosquito population and disease transmission. The <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic lines offer several attractive features in this regard. With regard to sex separation, 100% female lethality is ideal for both effectiveness and ethical considerations of not accidentally releasing females. In addition, released females can compete with wild-type females to mate with the released males simply due to their presence and even through assortative mating. Thus, the complete penetrance of the male-only phenotype, as seen in every <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic line over many generations, with the exception of the negative controls, is a highly attractive feature when developing a novel genetic sex-separation approach based on <italic>Guy1</italic>. The current mass production of male mosquitoes relies on physical means of sex separation, which is labor-intensive, expensive, and not 100% accurate ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alphey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilles et al., 2014</xref>]). Transgenic lines that express fluorescent markers in a sex-specific pattern have been developed to allow machine-based sorting of the sexes (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Catteruccia et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marois et al., 2012</xref>]). However, such an approach is expensive with a relatively low throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilles et al., 2014</xref>). Another positive feature of the <italic>Guy1</italic> lines is the embryonic or early larvae lethality, which negates the need to rear female larvae altogether. The <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic lines also offer a few important advantages to strategies for reducing mosquito populations and disease transmission. The observed 100% female lethality will result in bias towards the non-biting males in multiple generations, which is theoretically much more efficient than classic sterile insect techniques in achieving population reduction and disease control ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schliekelman et al., 2005</xref>]). An exciting report recently showed that an artificial sex ratio distortion system based on the shredding of the <italic>An. gambiae</italic> X chromosome produced &gt;95% male offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galizi et al., 2014</xref>). The 100% female lethality described here was accomplished by simply expressing the endogenous <italic>Guy1</italic> gene from the autosome. Thus, the <italic>Guy1</italic>-based genetic strategy involves minimal genetic manipulation.</p><p>The existing <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic lines are heterozygous. Because no female transgenic individuals passed the first instar, homozygous individuals cannot be produced by mating transgenic males with transgenic females. Conditional control of transgenic <italic>Guy1</italic> expression will enable the production of transgenic females required for generating homozygous transgenic individuals ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Phuc et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marinotti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fu et al., 2007</xref>]), which is necessary for field applications. Alternatively, the <italic>Guy1</italic> transgene may be linked to recently developed CRISPR/cas9-based gene drives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gantz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammond et al., 2016</xref>) for rapid spread of this female-lethal gene over multiple generations. This may represent an effective yet self-limiting strategy to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases because the spread of <italic>Guy1</italic> could lead to severe reduction or local extinction of <italic>An. stephensi</italic> populations due to the lack of females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adelman and Tu, 2016</xref>). Research on <italic>Guy1</italic> has shown great promise for genetic control of mosquito-borne infectious diseases and revealed the complex and sex-specific effect of a Y gene during mosquito embryonic development. The unexplored mosquito Y chromosome may in fact turn out to be a gold mine for intriguing stories about sexual dimorphism and promising leads for new ways to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rearing of mosquitoes</title><p>Wild type Indian strain ('type' form) of <italic>An. stephensi</italic> and <italic>transgenic An. stephensi</italic> were reared in incubators at 27°C and 60% relative humidity on a 16 hr light/8 hr dark photoperiod.

Digestion of 1 μg of gDNA was performed overnight at 37°C with 80 units of restriction enzyme and 1x digestion buffer. Digestions were performed with HaeIII, PacI, and MspI and inactivated at 85°C for 5 min. The digested DNA was then allowed to self-ligate overnight at 4°C in a 200 μL ligation reaction consisting of 20 μL 10X ligation buffer, 40 μL digestion reaction, 10 μL DNA ligase, and 130 μL H<sub>2</sub>O.

For gDNA isolation 2.5 uL of the lysate was treated with 0.3 mAU of proteinase K for 30 min at 28°C, and then inactivated at 95°C for 2 min.

Transgene and RPS4 positive and <italic>sYG2</italic> negative embryos were considered transgenic females. Finally, RPS4 positive and <italic>sYG2</italic> and transgene negative individuals were considered wild-type females. For RNA isolation 2.5 uL of the lysate was treated with 130U of DNase I (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hr at 25°C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 1 μL of 25 mM EDTA and incubation at 65°C for 10 min. The resulting 4.5 μL reaction was carried over to cDNA synthesis using the SuperScript III reverse transcriptase and random hexamers.

F1 transgenic males were mated with wild type virgin females. The resulting F2 progeny was checked for expression of DsRed and for the presence of testes. Males that were DsRed positive and DsRed negative (siblings) were reared separately in pans with equal larval density. Two days after emerging, twenty transgenic males and twenty non-transgenic males were placed in a 44 oz Coke cup (44TDCB) together. Ten wild type virgin females (approximately three days post pupal emergence) were introduced and allowed to mate for twenty-four hours with the mixed males. The females were then blood fed for a minimum of thirty minutes and inspected for feeding. Seventy-two hrs post blood feeding, eggs were collected from these females for 24 hrs. The subsequent F3 progeny were screened for DsRed and sexed at the L3 larval stage. Biological triplicates were performed for these sets of experiments. The expected results for transgenic males, non-transgenic females, and non-transgenic males were 1/7, 3/7, and 3/7, respectively (see note of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref> for detailed explanations).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Flaminia Catteruccia (Reviewer #1); Giuseppe Saccone (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Your manuscript was reviewed favorably, and the reviewers have provided straightforward and constructive suggestions. Because the reviewers are in agreement in supporting the publication of your manuscript, and the suggestions are all straightforward, we decided to simply pass their comments to you.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This is a solid and interesting study that shows that a Y chromosome gene, <italic>Guy1</italic>, previously identified by the authors, confers female lethality in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> mosquitoes when autosomally expressed under a germ line specific promoter. The authors elegantly confirm the specificity of <italic>Guy1</italic>-induced female lethality using control lines where this gene is mutated. The results clearly show that <italic>Guy1</italic> may be used to generate male-only populations for transgenic releases, once a system for conditional expression is developed and optimized. Moreover, they are consistent with a role for <italic>Guy1</italic> as a male determining factor in these mosquitoes, although they don't prove it. The authors suggest dosage compensation as a possible mechanism for the observed female lethality but they don't test this hypothesis. This study therefore is a promising first step towards the generation of a potential new tool for mosquito control and towards the elucidation of the sex determination pathway in this <italic>Anopheles</italic> species, although neither is fully accomplished.</p><p>The experimental procedures are well performed using a variety of controls and multiple transgenic lines. My only issue concerns the mating competition experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which are difficult to interpret. Mating competitiveness is better measured by characterizing the progeny of each individual female rather than counting bulk numbers. How many females mated in 24 hours? And of these, how many mated to wild type versus transgenic males? What was the fecundity and fertility of the two groups? The 'wild type' males chosen in the experiments are non-transgenic <italic>Guy1</italic> siblings: what's the standard mating rate, fecundity and fertility of females mated to these males? In their current format I do not think those experiments unequivocally show that <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenics are more competitive than wild type males. If confirmed, it would be great if the authors could speculate on how <italic>Guy1</italic> may increase mating competitiveness, which in some of the competition experiments appears incredibly high.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The authors submitted a manuscript having the title:</p><p>GUY1 confers complete female lethality and is a strong candidate for a male-determining factor in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>.</p><p>They discovered that in the mosquitoes, <italic>An stephensis</italic>, female-specific lethality is unexpectedly provoked by a transgene from the Y-linked <italic>Guy1</italic> gene, when ectopically expressed in XX individuals using an integrated copy on an autosome.</p><p>The authors designed and performed an elegant experiment, using double transgenic fluorescence to mark one X chromosome and the autosomal <italic>Guy1</italic> transgene, showing that its presence in XX individuals is lethal at early larval stages.</p><p>The <italic>Guy1</italic> gene encodes a short protein, with no sequence homology with known proteins. So it is not clear which is its molecular function, neither it has been shown which is its normal developmental function in XY individuals. The gene is transiently expressed during early stages of XY embryogenesis, and hence it could be implicated in male-specific functions, considering that its presence is not tolerated in XX individuals. Based on previous <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetics studies on sex-specific lethal mutations, the most likely hypothesis for <italic>Guy1</italic> function would be its involvement in controlling dosage compensation of X-linked genes.</p><p>This novel data could help in future to develop an effective yet self-limiting strategy to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases because the spread of <italic>Guy1</italic> could lead to severe reduction or local extinction of <italic>An. stephensis</italic> populations due to the lack of females. Hence this study shows novel findings which can be used in the near future for consistent societal benefits consisting in protection of the human health. This study deserves publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, after some revisions.</p><p>Indeed, less clear is the potential role of <italic>Guy1</italic> in male sex determination, as stated already in the title.

We agree that the experiments suggested by the reviewer will give new insights regarding mating competitiveness of the <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic males. However, the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> are designed to assess the overall reproductive competitiveness, or overall reproductive outcome of these transgenic males. In other words, the question to be addressed was: would the transgenic males be competitive in overall reproductive output compared to their non-transgenic male siblings? This question is relevant to practical applications to be developed on the basis of these transgenic lines. We chose to compare transgenic males and their non-transgenic male siblings because we wanted to test whether insertion of a <italic>Guy1</italic> transgene would make the males significantly less fit in reproductive output, which, if true, would represent a challenge to the <italic>Guy1</italic>-based method.

However, we feel that more informative experiments from an application perspective are to determine the fitness and behavior of the <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic males in semi-field or even controlled field conditions, with wildtype males and wildtype females from the target mosquito populations, which are beyond the scope of this current study.</p><p>We have now clarified the above points in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors submitted a manuscript having the title:</italic> </p><p><italic>GUY1 confers complete female lethality and is a strong candidate for a male-determining factor in Anopheles stephensi.</italic> </p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>This novel data could help in future to develop an effective yet self-limiting strategy to control mosquito-borne infectious diseases because the spread of Guy1 could lead to severe reduction or local extinction of An. stephensis populations due to the lack of females.

If the authors would provide such data, they could propose GUY1 as a strong candidate for a male determining factor.</italic> </p><p>We first address the two specific comments: 1) RT-PCR to detect possible shifts in <italic>dsx</italic> splicing in dying XX transgenic first-instar larvae could offer proof that <italic>Guy1</italic> functions in male-determination. We have previously attempted to perform RT-PCR and qRT-PCR on the newly hatched wildtype first instar larvae. However, we could not detect any sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> transcripts at the L1 instar stage. Therefore, it has not been technically possible to perform the experiment suggested by the reviewer, possibly due to low abundance or lack of sex-specific expression of <italic>dsx</italic> in most cells of the newly hatched larvae. Even if sex-specific <italic>dsx</italic> splicing could be detected in wildtype early first instar, there is a more fundamental challenge. Because <italic>Guy1</italic> is only transiently expressed in the early embryos in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>, it cannot function as a gene that maintains sexual identity. This is different from the situation in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>, where <italic>gYG2/YOB</italic> is expressed throughout development. Ectopic expression of <italic>Guy1</italic> alone in XX embryos or cells may not be sufficient to change <italic>dsx</italic> splicing if additional Y factors are required. 2) In XY individuals, because <italic>Guy1</italic> is expressed transiently in the early embryo (tapering off at 8hours after egg laying), it has been difficult to knock it down simply because there is not enough time for RNAi to work in the early embryo. We are developing CRISPR/cas9-based knockout in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>. However, <italic>Guy1</italic> knockout may be lethal to males. To determine the mechanism of <italic>Guy1</italic> function, we are in the process of identifying potential <italic>Guy1</italic> targets, which will be informative but beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>In regards to the suggestion to reformulate the title and the rest of the manuscript to better reflect the findings, we have clarified specific questions from reviewers in the text. However, we respectfully disagree with reviewer 2 that the title needs to be revised.</p><p>Here is our rationale. In the earlier summary statement, the reviewer identified key findings that are consistent with <italic>Guy1</italic> being a candidate for a male-determining factor, namely its Y-linkage, early embryonic expression, and its ectopic expression causing female-specific lethality (a phenomena shared with known master regulators of sex-determination in other species). We will also add two points here: 1) we have also shown, using <italic>Guy1</italic> transgenic lines, that <italic>Guy1</italic> transcription from its native promoter does not require any other factors from the Y chromosome. Thus, <italic>Guy1</italic> is an initial or primary signal from the Y chromosome. Please note that we are not saying that this is the proof for <italic>Guy1</italic> being the initiating male-determining factor. We are saying that this is evidence that <italic>Guy1</italic> is a primary signal, not a secondary signal from the Y chromosome. 2) GUY1 is of the same length as the recently reported M factor in <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> gYG2/YOB (56 aa) and shares similar secondary structure with gYG2/YOB. Although there is no significant primary sequence similarity between GUY1 and gYG2/YOB over the whole sequence, four out of the first five amino acid residues are identical between these two proteins. We are not at all claiming that the two proteins share a common origin. But neither can we rule out this possibility because Y chromosome genes tend to evolve rapidly and similarities between very small proteins may not be obvious. We agree with the reviewer that additional evidence is needed to conclude that <italic>Guy1</italic> is the male-determining factor. However, taken all existing data together, we think it is appropriate to say that <italic>Guy1</italic> is a strong candidate for an M factor in <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic>.</p><p>We have now clarified the above two points in the first section of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
