undergo enterohepatic recycling (EHR), presumably mediated by the hepatic phase II enzymes. However, the disposition of extrahepatically generated phase II metabolites is unclear. This paper aims to determine the new roles of liver and intestine in the disposition of oral phenolics. Sixteen representative phenolics were tested using direct portal vein infusion and/or intestinal perfusion. The results showed that certain glucuronides were efficiently recycled by liver. OATP1B1/1B3/2B1 were the responsible uptake transporters. Hepatic uptake is the rate-limiting step in hepatic recycling. Our findings showed that the disposition of many oral phenolics is mediated by intestinal glucuronidation and hepatic recycling. A new disposition mechanism ‘Hepatoenteric Recycling (HER)”, where intestine is the metabolic organ and liver is the recycling organ, was revealed. Further investigations focusing on HER should help interpret how intestinal aliments or co-administered drugs that alter gut enzymes (e.g. UGTs) expression/activities will impact the disposition of phenolics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hepatology</kwd><kwd>gastroenterology</kwd><kwd>drug metabolism</kwd><kwd>polyphenols</kwd><kwd>bioavailability</kwd><kwd>recirculation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM070377</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA246209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new disposition mechanism for glucuronides, where liver serves as recycle organ and intestine serves as metabolism organ, is established to better explain the disposition of phenolics in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enterohepatic recirculation/recycling (i.e. EHR) refers to the recirculation/recycling of endogenous (produced within the body, like biliary acids and bilirubin) and exogenous (e.g. drugs or other substances) compounds. EHR involves the excretion of substances from the liver to the small intestine via bile, followed by absorption into enterocytes, which then enters the liver again via portal vein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lennartsson et al., 2012</xref>). EHR is important in the disposition of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. For endogenous compounds (e.g. bile acids), the recirculation through EHR keeps them from being eliminated into the feces and reduces the requirement of daily biosynthesis. For exogenous compounds, EHR prolonged the in vivo exposure and increased their apparent half-life. In other words, EHR could greatly affect the efficacy of drugs and the toxicity of xenobiotics (or exogenous compounds).</p><p>EHR was first conceptualized in the 1950s for bile acid recirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Norman and Sjovall, 1958</xref>). The recirculation of bile acids requires only the re-absorption of the intact bile acids in the intestine without any change. In the 1960s, this concept was expanded into the disposition of drugs and other xenobiotics that undergo phase II metabolism via enzymes such as uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs) and sulfotransferases (SULTs) primarily expressed in the small intestine and liver. Currently, a variety of drugs are known to undergo EHR, including anticancer drugs (e.g. sorafenib, SN-38), anti-cholesterol drugs (e.g. ezetimibe), anti-osteoporosis drugs (e.g. raloxifene), analgesics (e.g. morphine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gårdmark et al., 1993</xref>, and others (e.g. mycophenolic acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Trdan Lušin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oswald et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ando and Hasegawa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vasilyeva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hasselström and Säwe, 1993</xref>). In the case of exogenous compounds, the R in EHR was ‘recycling’ not ‘recirculation,’ as the enzymes of the microflora present in the intestine are required to hydrolyze the phase II metabolites and regenerate the aglycones (the parent form of the phase II metabolites) for reabsorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Williams et al., 1965</xref>). The current concept of EHR does not define or specify the sources of phase II metabolites (i.e. where they are formed) that excreted in bile. Previously, it is postulated that the phase II metabolites (especially glucuronide metabolites) found in bile are mainly produced by the liver because bile acids are biosynthesized in the liver.</p><p>EHR of bile acids led most investigators, ourselves included, to believe that liver is the major organ contributing to the formation of conjugated metabolites. Faster in vitro microsomal conjugation rates observed in the liver as compared to intestinal microsomes for many compounds also supported this assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhou et al., 2010</xref>). However, we recently found that certain phenolic glucuronides formed in the intestine were efficiently taken up by hepatocytes and then rapidly excreted into the bile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zeng et al., 2016</xref>). These phenomena suggest that glucuronides formed extrahepatically (such as in the intestine), available for hepatic uptake transporters (e.g. Organic Anion Transporting Polypeptides) and subsequently excreted by efflux transporters (e.g. Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 2), could be recycled by the liver. This led us to hypothesize a new recycling phenomenon, 'Hepatoenteric Recycling (HER)'.</p><p>EHR differs from HER in the predominant organs for formation and transport of phase II metabolites. We believe that it is important to delineate HER from EHR since the disposition of phase II metabolites in different metabolic organs (such as liver and intestine) could greatly change with age, gender, and disease conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolling et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhatt et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pimentel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Langmann et al., 2004</xref>). These conditions often dictate the organ-level expression and activities of phase II enzymes and transporters (both efflux and uptake) that could significantly impact the EHR vs HER-mediated disposition of glucuronides. The changes in HER-mediated disposition can lead to changes in systemic and intestinal exposure of drugs and their glucuronides by altering the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion of glucuronides, which could significantly affect the drug efficacy and toxicity, both locally (intestinal lumen) and systemically.</p><p>However, EHR redefinition, which could explain the disposition of extrahepatically derived phase II metabolites, requires a systemic study to provide initial evidence that is based on the sources of biliary phenolic glucuronides. The current study provides answers to the three key questions: (1) how efficiently extrahepatically derived phenolic glucuronides are recycled by liver; (2) how these glucuronides are taken up by the liver cells; and (3) whether the aglycone or glucuronides entering the liver is better source of biliary excreted glucuronides. By answering these questions, we aim to elucidate the mechanism of HER, and the significance of distinguishing it from traditional EHR.</p><p>Through the analysis of our study results, a new disposition mechanism called ‘Hepatoenteric Recycling (HER)’ mainly applied to the disposition of drugs and their glucuronides, with significant intestinal metabolism, is proposed. The new mechanism distinguish from the enterohepatic recirculation/recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), which is mainly applied to compounds which undergo recirculation in intact form or are metabolized by the liver. In HER, intestine is the organ for glucuronide formation and liver is the organ for its recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) as opposed to in EHR, where liver is the organ for glucuronide formation and intestine is the organ for its recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The newly proposed HER concept delineates more clearly the disposition mechanism of phenolic drugs and phytochemicals such as flavonoids and polyphenols, which are significantly metabolized in the human intestine (up to ~70% or more) before entering the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patrick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strassburg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kokawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kemp et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kosoglou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Teeter and Meyerhoff, 2002</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The pictorial representation of the newly proposed mechanism of hepatoenteric (HER) recycling and conventional mechanism of enterohepatic recycling/recirculation (EHR).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). HER starts from intestinal glucuronidation of orally dosed aglycones. The glucuronides are taken up into the hepatocytes via portal vein using hepatic uptake transporter OATPs, and then excreted back into bile by apical hepatic efflux transporters, allowing them to return to the small intestine. For biliary glucuronides, the gut microflora β-glucuronides (GUS) will hydrolyze them back into the aglycone form, which are then reabsorbed in colon to complete the recycling. (<bold>B</bold>) EHR starts from the hepatic metabolism of an aglycone entering liver (from intestinal absorption or blood circulation) into its phase II metabolites (mostly glucuronides). The glucuronides formed in the liver are excreted into bile by the apical hepatic efflux transporters,returned to the small intestine and then moved to colon, where the gut microflora GUS hydrolyze them back into the aglycone form. The aglycone is then re-absorbed from colon and reached the liver again to complete the EHR.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-58820-fig1-v3.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Portal vein infusion</title><p>The portal vein infusion uses a direct method to assess the recirculation efficiency of a phenolic glucuronide by the liver using liver recycle efficiency% (LRE%, defined as steady-state biliary secretion rate divided by the hepatic infusion rate).

HER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) differs significantly from EHR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) associated with bile acids and certain drugs, in that intestine is the main metabolite forming organ and liver is the recycling organ. Previously, EHR of bile acids and various drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2009</xref>) is associated with metabolites that are generated in liver and recycled in intestine. This new definition for the first-pass metabolism of phenolic drugs and phytochemicals pinpoints where the metabolites are formed and subsequently recycled. In other words, the roles of liver and intestine are reversed in the new HER vs the classical EHR. The word ‘Recycling’ refers to the fact that many extrahepatically generated phenolic glucuronides were able to achieve hepatic recycling in HER. The word ‘Recycling’ is also important in HER because biliary excreted glucuronides are not well absorbed in the intestine. They must be reactivated to aglycones, by the microflora β-glucuronidases, before reabsorption can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>The new definition is needed because: (1) unlike EHR of bile acids, intestine, not liver, is the source of the recycled metabolites (i.e. phenolic glucuronides); (2) unlike EHR of bile acids, liver, not the intestine, is the recycling organ for glucuronides; and (3) unlike EHR of bile acids, hepatic (e.g. OATPs) but not intestinal uptake transporters (e.g. ASBT) appears to be the rate-limiting step in determining the LRE% in HER. Due to the presence of HER, hepatic transporters (e.g. OATPs) will often determine the plasma concentrations of glucuronides, and play a much more important role than the relevant hepatic enzymes (e.g. UGTs) in determining how much glucuronides are excreted into the bile and participate in recycling. For orally administered dietary phenolics such as wogonin and drugs such as ezetimibe with high LRE%, double peaks caused by HER were observed in their plasma profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref> to 3D) even though biliary metabolites are not generated by the liver. For phenolics with more moderate LRE%, the role of metabolite generating organ or recycling organ is not mutually exclusive in HER vs EHR, in that biliary glucuronides may come from metabolites generated in the liver as well as the intestine, with variable contributions depending on the structure of aglycones.</p><p>How significant is this new disposition process called HER in determining how phenolics and their glucuronides are handled in vivo? We believe that HER is critically important in determining an orally administered phenolic’s pharmacokinetic profile with extensive intestinal metabolism. A high LRE% means that a phenolic could have double peaks in their plasma profile and a longer terminal half-life. This could mean high plasma levels of aglycone if glucuronides are readily hydrolyzed back into aglycones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>). In other words, for extrahepatically generated glucuronides, HER is critically important because almost every glucuronides we tested were more likely to be excreted into bile if they are given as glucuronides vs corresponding aglycones into the portal vein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1–B7</xref>). If HER is critical, how important is EHR in the recycling process? We believe that EHR is not that important here for compounds with high LRE%, since these compounds were nearly fully (&gt;80%) metabolized after the aglycones were absorbed in small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Therefore, we believe that HER is much more important than EHR for orally administered phenolics whose major metabolic pathway is rapid intestinal glucuronidation. The importance of HER can be further manifested in disease conditions. For example, in chemically (e.g. trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid) induced colitis model, small intestinal UGTs were significantly downregulated but hepatic UGTs were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These differences in UGTs regulation indicated that HER would likely to be impacted, whereas EHR might not, since changes in metabolism only occurs in the intestine. On the other hand, in hepatitis C, where hepatic CYPs, OATPs, OCTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nakai et al., 2008</xref>) and UGTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smolders et al., 2016</xref>) were all downregulated, EHR might be affected more than HER. However, for compounds that were metabolized both in the intestine and liver, the situation might be more convoluted.</p><p>We have proposed the new HER mechanism to delineate more clearly the significance and the need to describe the recycling of phenolics using a terminology different from EHR. How would HER impact the beneficial effects of dietary phenolics, therapeutic efficacy of phenolic drugs, and toxicities of phenolic toxins that are taken orally, produced by microbiota or formed as the result of phase II metabolism in the liver? The possible answers are made up of two parts, and subsequently combined to argue for the importance of HER in determining the disposition of orally administered phenolics with mainly extrahepatic glucuronidation.</p><p>Firstly, HER will shuttle more phenolic compounds and their metabolites, both beneficial and toxic to the colon. This is because there is no known mechanism that can rapidly take up glucuronides in the small intestine. For compounds with beneficial effects, including therapeutic efficacy, this new disposition mechanism can be useful in preventing or treating diseases in colon. The prevention or treatment effects can be achieved via a direct effect (e.g. suppress inflammation) or indirect effect (e.g. production of beneficial microbial metabolites that suppress inflammation). In contrary, some of the toxic phenolic metabolites can be further biotransformed by the microbial enzymes to more potent toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koppel et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, the presence of HER for an oral phenolic could substantially enhance its colonic impact and maintenance of a healthy colon microbiota (i.e. a desirable colon microbiome homeostasis) that is essential for our health. Therefore, the use of phenolics to maintain and improve the health of microbiota is an important future research goal. On the other hand, HER could promote the recycling of toxic phenolic metabolites, enhancing its exposure and toxicities, and this should be limited to improve human health.</p><p>Second, it may provide the theoretical foundation to understand a myriad phenomenon when there are drug-drug interactions involving glucuronidation. For example, if we only recognize the importance of EHR, if would be difficult to understand why inhibition of hepatic UGTs does not always increase aglycone concentration and decrease glucuronide concentration in the blood. If we recognize that a phenolic is mainly processed by HER, an inhibitor that only inhibit liver UGTs is not expected to affect plasma concentrations of orally administered aglycone and its glucuronides as long as intestine is the metabolite forming organ. In contrast, the emerging role of OATPs means that the plasma concentrations of both an aglycone and its glucuronide (if both are substrates of OATPs) or just glucuronide (if only glucuronide is substrate of OATPs), could increase by a drug that did not affect intestinal or liver UGT enzymes. Furthermore, one can propose a variety of drug-drug interaction schemes that can be explained by both HER and EHR. Therefore, the proposed HER mechanism should help us determine the dominating mechanism by which drug-drug interactions occur to influence the plasma concentrations of a phenolic aglycone and its glucuronides that are formed in the intestine. This influence is more significant when the glucuronides are pharmacologically active (i.e. ezetimibe and dabigatran [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jia and Zhao, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang and Li, 2010</xref>]) or can inhibit CYP enzymes (i.e. gemfibrozil and clopidogrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sivapathasekaran et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mutwil et al., 2010</xref>]).</p><p>When combined together, the new HER definition could help predict the potential drug-drug interactions under pathological conditions. Since small intestinal UGTs play a significant role in the HER of the compounds, factors that alter the UGT expression in small intestine will significantly influence the recycling of the compounds and their in vivo exposure. Searching in Google Scholar by using key words combination ‘UGT + intestine + disease’, yielded a total of 14,500 hits. Among the top 50 results ranked by relevance, 15 of them reported different causes leading to change in intestinal UGTs including diseases (colitis, Gilbert’s disease etc.), genetic polymorphism and drug-drug interactions. The results indicated that pathological conditions will greatly influence the intestinal UGTs expression level and thus change the in vivo exposure of a phenolic whose disposition is controlled by a HER process. Similar conclusion could be made on hepatic OATPs, since OATPs mediate the hepatic uptake step of glucuronides generated from intestinal metabolism. Using ‘OATP +liver + disease’ as key words combination, a total of 14,000 hits were found and 21 out of top 50 results ranked by relevance reported the hepatic OATPs expression changes due to disease like cholestasis, liver hepatitis, and carcinoma.</p><p>We have obtained several lines of evidence in support of new HER definition, especially for oral phenolics such as wogonin and ezetimibe. First, our data showed that when infused directly into the portal vein, the vast majority of their glucuronides reached bile, displaying a highly efficient recycling (LRE%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app2table5">Appendix 2—table 5</xref>). For those compounds, portal vein concentrations of glucuronides were much higher than the corresponding aglycones in the rat intestinal perfusion studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Second, direct portal vein infusion of aglycone was substantially less effective in producing biliary excretion of glucuronides than their corresponding glucuronides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B1–B7</xref>). Third, hepatic OATPs took up these glucuronides in a saturable process that can be inhibited by OATP inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C1–C3</xref>). Fourth, the structural differences between phenolic-glucuronides had a substantial impact on the LRE%. Taken together, these results showed clearly that intestine is the glucuronide forming organ, and liver is the glucuronide recycling organ for these two compounds. Hence, the term HER properly describes the determining disposition processes of these two compounds, a naturally occurring polyphenol flavonoid and a prescription drug, which share minimal structural similarity. The latter suggest that HER could be broadly applicable to other phenolic phytochemicals and drugs.</p><p>The new HER disposition process could explain the pharmacokinetic behaviors of many phenolic drugs, including ezetimibe, raloxifene and diclofenac. All three drugs were rapidly glucuronidated by intestinal microsomes and had a double peak PK profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watanabe et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herz and Bläsig, 1974</xref>). For diclofenac, extensive intestinal glucuronidation by microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bläsig et al., 1973</xref>) with &gt;95% glucuronides formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Herz and Bläsig, 1974</xref>), are consistent with it undergoing through HER instead of EHR. In addition, the recycle properties of ezetimibe reported in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christoffersen et al., 2015</xref>) was consistent with the proposed HER hypothesis. As over 80% of ezetimibe was converted into glucuronides in intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christoffersen et al., 2015</xref>) with a second peak in its PK profile attributable to hepatic recycling. Therefore, for compounds with extensive intestinal glucuronidation and hepatic recycling, HER will fully explain their pharmacokinetic behaviors.</p><p>Although many glucuronides with rapid uptake by OATPs are correlated with higher LRE% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), two glucuronides (i.e. Lut-G and Ica-G) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2015</xref>) did not. We found that these two glucuronides were further metabolized in liver, forming di-glucuronides of Lut and di-glucuronides of Ica, respectively, rendering the original glucuronides unavailable for biliary excretion. Whereas, we have obtained large amount of evidence in support of roles of OATP uptake transporters in enabling HER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we could not rule out the contribution of other transporters. This is because we could only achieve a maximum of 50% inhibition of Won-7-G and Lut-3’-G LRE% in portal vein infusion experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is likely that transporters belong to the OAT3 subfamily contributed to their liver uptake, since several flavonoid glucuronides were shown to be substrates of OAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rees et al., 2012</xref>), which is also expressed in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nema et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Lastly, we have significant but not overwhelming structural diversity in our phenolic glucuronides, and as such, we could not predict which structure will have high LRE%. The empirical evidence supports the hypothesis that good uptake of glucuronides by the OATPs will correlate with high LRE%, as long as the glucuronides taken up by the hepatocytes are not further metabolized. Because the direct portal vein infusion method is convenient to use with cassette dosing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), HER potential can be readily estimated using OATP overexpressing cells and confirmed using the portal vein perfusion model. The latter should allow medicinal chemists to design new compounds with primarily intestinal glucuronidation that are tailored to treat intestinal, especially colonic diseases. In addition to the involvement of multiple uptake transporters, the role of efflux transporters may further complicate the disposition behaviors of phenolics and their glucuronides, but that is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>In conclusion, a new disposition terminology HER has been proposed to describe and delineate more clearly the disposition of dietary phenolics and phenolic drugs that are taken orally with intestine as their major metabolism (i.e. glucuronidation) organ and liver as their major recirculating organ. The new terminology more accurately captures the recycling of relevant phenolics, similar to the use of ‘EHR’ to capture the recycling of bile acids, where the liver is the metabolism organ and intestine as the recycling organ. This new HER more accurately captures the disposition of oral phenolics and can be used to better understand why this class of compounds may have larger than expected effects in the colon for human health and diseases. It may also help to delineate drug-drug interaction mechanisms involving intestinal UGT enzymes and hepatic transporters of glucuronides, a major challenge that we are still facing today because of all the complexity involved.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials and reagents</title><p>Apigenin-7-O-glucuronide (Api-7-G) was purchased from HWI Analytik GmbH (Rheinzaberner, Rülzheim, German).

Briefly, Won and Bai were prepared together in oral suspension with ORA-Plus at the concentration of 50 mg/ml. Drugs were given to animals at the dose of 30 mg/kg. Eze/Ace were prepared and dosed the same way as described above for the other two flavonoids. Blood samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 hr after dosing.

Briefly, rats were anesthetized by i.p. injection of 50% urethane at the dose of 1.875 g/kg. The portal vein and bile duct were catheterized after the anesthesia. The phenolic compounds or their corresponding glucuronides were prepared in HBSS buffer (pH = 7.4) and infused from portal vein catheterization at the rate of 2 ml/hr. Bile samples were collected from bile duct catheterization and blood samples were collected by snipping the tail. The infusion lasted for 2.5 hr and samples were collected every 0.5 hr.

The authors argue that this has relevance for drug-drug interactions involving the OATP transporters and as a means to shuttle glucuronidated metabolites to the colon since the metabolism of phenolics by intestinal cells to glucuronidated forms as well as subsequent recycling means there should be large amounts of these metabolites in the colon.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The introduction could be more directed to the general audience.</p><p>– In describing Figure 2A4, the authors claim that RR% is plotted against steady state blood concentration which &quot;…displayed a saturating trend, indicative of transporter-mediated excretion.&quot; First, excretion rate not RR% is plotted and although these values tend to trend together the authors should be more precise in their description and better explain their rationale for making the claim that this indicates transport.

For example, we change the recirculation ratio (RR%) to liver recycling efficiency (LRE%), since the results we calculated did not actually reflect the whole process of HER. Only the recycling ratio of liver was determined. In addition, “recirculation” has been replaced by “recycling” at several places of the manuscript.</p><p>Lastly, because editors and reviewers were concerned about making our topic more general and as such we inserted the following paragraph into the “Introduction” to better address this concern.</p><p>“EHR differs from HER in the organs for formation and disposition of phase II metabolites. We believe It is important to delineate HER from EHR since the formation and disposition of phase II metabolites could be greatly different in disease condition related to different organs that could lead to differences in drug efficacy and toxicity both in systemic circulation and intestinal lumen. We believe that the differences in phase II enzymes, efflux and uptake transporters in different metabolic organs (such as liver and intestine) based on gender and disease conditions plays a significant role in determining the impact of EHR vs HER on the drug disposition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The introduction could be more directed to the general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the introduction as suggested by the reviewers.

It would also be helpful if there were more data in between 100 and 1000 uM.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we did not plot LRE% against the steady-state blood concentration. Instead we plotted the excretion rates against steady-state blood concentration. The saturation in the excretion rate as a function of blood concentration is expected if the blood concentration is correlated with the biliary excretion of wogonoside. This means that a higher blood concentration will result in a higher rate of excretion until the transporter is saturated. We also agreed that having more concentrations between 100 and 1000 μM would be valuable, but that was not done. However, the current data are enough to show that the transporter is involved because process is saturable.</p><p>Another reason we believe that the uptake/efflux transporters are involved in the recycling process is because of the hydrophilicity of glucuronides (precluding significant passive diffusion). The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 17, paragraph 2:</p><p>“It showed that at lower blood concentrations (&lt;100μM) of wogonoside, its biliary excretion rates increased linearly. At higher blood concentrations (&gt;=100μM), biliary excretion rates showed a saturation trend, indicative of transporter-mediated excretion (Figure 2A4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Figure 2B1-7, the authors show decreased recycling of the glucuronide relative to the aglycone form by monitoring appearance of the glucuronide in the bile after hepatic infusion. While the difference is dramatic, it is hard to know the relative roles of metabolism of the aglycone to the glucuronide versus uptake and transport of the aglycone form. It might be helpful to evaluate levels of the aglycone and glucuronide inside the liver after this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not disagree with the suggestion that “It might be helpful to evaluate levels of the aglycone and glucuronide inside the liver after this experiment”. Our recent measurement of liver concentration of Wogonin and Wogonoside showed a high ratio (&gt; 5) of aglycone/glucuronide (Appendix 2 Table S4), providing evidence that metabolism of aglycone is slow. Furthermore, our uptake studies in the several OATP-overexpressed cell lines (Appendix 2 Table S2 and table S3) indicated that uptake/transport of aglycone was always equal to or faster than corresponding glucuronides. Also, there was no significant reduction in the uptake of Wogonin in the presence of OATP inhibitors, suggesting that the hepatic uptake of aglycone is primarily by passive diffusion and not active uptake. Lastly, in Caco-2 cells studies, flavonoid aglycones always displayed high permeability [1-3]. Therefore, there is no evidence that the hepatic uptake of phenolic aglycones would be slow and become a rate-limiting step in the biliary excretion of glucuronides, suggesting that a low LRE% for the aglycones meant slow metabolism in the liver rather than slow uptake of aglycones.</p><p>The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 18, paragraph 2:</p><p>“Liver tissue concentrations of wogonin was at least 5 times higher than won-7-G concentrations (Appendix 2 supplement Table S4), which indicated that slow metabolism in liver was the likely reason for the lower LRE%.”</p><p>Page 18, paragraph 1:</p><p>“To rule out the possibility that slow aglycone uptake was the reason for lower LRE%, an uptake comparison between Won and Won-7-G in 3 cell lines were also conducted (Appendix 2 supplement Table S2 and Table S3). The results indicated that the uptake of Won was not influenced in the presence of specific transporter inhibitor, while Won-7-G was greatly inhibited, suggesting that aglycone uptake was mainly by passive diffusion, and often faster than their corresponding glucuronides.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors say they are examining the role of protein binding in section 3.1.3 by evaluating a higher concentration of Won aglycone, making the assumption that this would saturate protein binding.

It seems it would have been better to directly evaluate uptake of the aglycone form as previously suggested and just eliminate this evaluation.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the answer to the question #3, there is no evidence to suggest that uptake of flavonoid aglycones is slow, and therefore become the rate-limiting step in hepatic glucuronide formation. Based on the uptake experiments performed in our lab, we believe that uptake of aglycones into the hepatocytes is equal to or faster than the corresponding glucuronides. Therefore, apart from the slow metabolism, another possible explanation for low LRE% could be the plasma protein binding of phenolic aglycone, which impedes its hepatic transport by decreasing the effective concentration available to the liver.</p><p>We hypothesize that if protein binding plays a significant role, LRE% would be higher at a higher aglycone concentration once the protein binding becomes saturated. But our results showed the opposite, indicating that protein binding was not the major reason for low LRE%. Therefore, we are quite certain that decrease in LRE% is not the result of protein binding but possibly saturation of metabolic enzymes. This is supported by the ratio of liver concentration of wogonin and wogonoside (Table S1) when aglycone is infused in portal vein. It indicated that the decrease of LRE% was due to the slow metabolism.</p><p>The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 18, paragraph 2:</p><p>“However, the results indicated that LRE% at a higher concentration (100μM) was significantly lower (<italic>P&lt;.001</italic>) than at a lower concentration (2μM) (Figure 2C3), ruling out the impact of extensive protein binding on the lower LRE% of aglycones. Liver tissue concentrations of wogonin was at least 5 times higher than won-7-G concentrations (Appendix 2 supplement Table S4), which indicated that the slow metabolism in liver was the likely reason for the lower LRE%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In section 3.1.4, the authors evaluate different flavonoids to make a comment on the specific role of glucuronidation at the 7-position in RR%.

It was also unclear why the 7 location was so relevant. The authors should elaborate.</p></disp-quote><p>The 7-position is highly relevant because major dietary important flavonoids have a hydroxyl group at 7 position, and several UGTs are shown to have region-selective glucuronidation at this position [4]. For flavonoid compounds such as genistein [5], chrysin [6], apigenin [7], wogonin [8], and baicalein [9], at least one of their main glucuronides are conjugated at the 7position. We agreed with the reviewer that it would be better to study this problem with a flavonoids that have 3-5 OH groups and then make synthetic glucuronide for each of these OH positions, but this was not scope of the current study as it requires huge amount of efforts to purify mono-glucuronides from a mixture of other mono-glucuronides. Multiple monoglucuronides are expected if we use biosynthesis method, and chemical synthesis of these mono-glucuronides is beyond the scope of this work. However, we have turned down the importance of this 7-position in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The experiments describing sex differences and cassette dosing on glucuronide RR% seems insufficient and unnecessary for this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>For sex differences:</p><p>OATPs were identified as the major transporters determining LRE%. Since Oatps were reported to be male-predominant in rat liver [10], we hypothesized that sex differences could cause the changes of OATP expression levels and required investigating. In addition, E2G, a precursor for female sex hormone and a classical OATP substrate, has a drastically different blood concentrations in male and female. Therefore, we tested some of our model compounds to verify whether the sex difference matters.</p><p>For cassette dosing:</p><p>It’s a labor intensive and animal intensive experiments to determine LRE% of glucuronides. In order to improve the throughput of the experimental determination of LRE% and save the number of animal usage (IACUC 3R’s principle), we infused multiple compounds simultaneously. We chose to use a substrate concentration of 10μM because at concentrations lower than 10μM, many glucuronides cannot be detected in bile samples. Whereas experiment at higher concentration requires a much large quantities of glucuronides, which are generally not commercially available and hard to obtain via biosynthesis.</p><p>Another reason we did not use higher concentration because it is possible that these glucuronides would have competitive inhibition when infused together. To rule out the possibility that they may still compete at 10μM, we compared the single and cassette dosing of two model compounds (high recycle and low recycle compounds) and found no significant differences between single compound infusion and cassette infusion.</p><p>The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 19, paragraph 2:</p><p>“We are interested in determining the effects of sex difference on the OATP liver expression levels, because the expression level of Oatp in rat liver was reported to be significantly higher in males than in females [20]. Also, E2G is a classical OATP substrate that has a drastically higher blood concentrations in females than males. The results indicated that there was not sex related differences in the LRE% of Won-7-G and Lut-3’-G. (Appendix 2 supplement Table S6).</p><p>Interestingly, the LRE% of Bai-7-G increased from ~4% (male rats) to ~10% (female rats) <italic>(P&lt;.05)</italic>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In section 3.2.1 when discussing the outcome for Lut-3'-G it would be helpful if the authors could refer to the data for this point in figure 2B4 and to show the evidence for additional metabolism in supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewer’s suggestion, we have added additional reference in section 3.2.1. We have also added additional evidence of metabolite formation using in vitro glucuronidation of Lut-3'-G in rat liver microsomes (Figure 2 supplement Figure S1A-S1C) that may explain the low LRE% of Lut-3’-G. Our results showed that Lut-3’-G could be further metabolized to Lut-di-G (di-glucuronides), which may provide an explanation why Lut-3’-G was present in bile at much lower than expected concentration. Luteolin was previously reported to be metabolized into Lut-di-G, which is consistent with our observation [11].</p><p>The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 20, paragraph 3:</p><p>“The discrepancy can be explained by the fact that Lut-3’-G could be further metabolized into diglucuronides of Lut in vivo [23]. A liver microsome-mediated metabolism of Lut-3’-G confirmed the formation of Lut di-glucuronides by LC-MS (Figure 2 supplement Figure S2A and Figure S2B). Moreover, the peaks of Lut-3’-G and Lut-di-G both decreased upon incubation with glucuronidases (Figure 2 supplement Figure S2C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In Section 3.2.4 where the authors make the claim that substrates of the transporters make better inhibitors, it would again be helpful to evaluate uptake of the aglycone forms rather than just looking at accumulation of glucuronides.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that we did not articulate that clearly. We did not claim “that substrates of the transporters make better inhibitors”. Rather, we wanted to state that “phenolic glucuronides that do not inhibit the uptake of prototypical substrates are not substrates of OATP.” We expected to use this characteristic as a fast screening tool to determine whether a glucuronide is not a substrate of a specific OATP. The latter will save our time to develop an analysis method to measure the glucuronide. This has been updated in the section 3.2.4.</p><p>Page 22, paragraph 1:</p><p>“The results showed that if a compound was not an inhibitor of prototypical OATP substrate, it was not a substrate of that OATP (Figure 3D1 to 3D3), but the reverse was not true. In contrast, substrates of OATP1B1 were able to significantly inhibited (<italic>P&lt;.005</italic>) the uptake of glucuronides (Won-7-G, E2G and Lut-3’-G) that are good substrates of a specific OATP. Interestingly, aglycones were better inhibitors than their corresponding glucuronides, even though the corresponding glucuronides had higher LRE%.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors need to elaborate further in section 3.4 on the lack of physiological relevance for the 18/25 examples where there was no correlation between cellular uptake and RR% and the 7 which were not relevant with respect to relative expression of OATPs in human liver. Does the latter have something to do with Table S4? If so, that table should be referenced here.</p></disp-quote><p>We modified section 3.4 to further elaborate our statistical analysis methods to explain the physiological relevance as suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>The following is the revised changes along with page and paragraph information.</p><p>Page 23, paragraph 1:</p><p>“A total of 66 combinations with different OATP weightings were applied in Fisher exact test (Appendix 4 supplement table S1). OATP 1B1 is the most abundant OATP expressed in livers (Appendix 2 Supplement Table S1) [28] and also considered the most important among all OATPs.</p><p>OATP 1B3 is grouped with OATP1B1 in both localization and substrates, but the contribution of OATP 1B3 is considered to be always smaller than OATP 1B1. Therefore, combinations which assigned the highest weightings to OATP1B3 were considered not physiologically relevant and eliminated from the results. Of all the results from the Fisher exact test (Appendix 4 supplement Table S1), 22 combinations were eliminated based on this criterion. Of the remaining 44 combinations, 41 out of 44 results (93.2%) showed statistical significance. Taken together, these results demonstrated there were solid correlation between cellular uptake and LRE%. Thus, we showed that cellular uptake of glucuronides is the rate-limiting step in HER. In addition, this correlation (Figure 5) could be mathematically described by an E<sub>max</sub> model (E<sub>max</sub> 86%±17%) with an EC<sub>50</sub> value of 42±33 nM.”</p><p>Reference</p><p>1.

Since the metabolites of raloxifene are made of Ral-6-G and Ral-4’-G, with the latter represents 70% of its metabolites 2[], we made the statement that phenolic drugs are “significantly metabolized in the human intestine (up to ~70% or more) before entering the liver…”</p><p>The reason why the major metabolite of raloxifene Ral-4’-G is only formed in the human small intestine is because UGT isoforms UGT1A8 and UGT1A10 are responsible for its formation 34[, ], and both isoforms are predominantly expressed in the human enterocytes 5[]. Hence, small intestine was considered as being responsible for up to 70% of raloxifene metabolism in vivo.</p><p>Similar results showed that 78% of orally dosed ezetimibe could be found in feces of patients 6[]. Since intestine is the major metabolism organ of ezetimibe 7[], we believed that a large portion of that 78% (found in feces) was due to metabolism in the small intestine and subsequent excretion via HER. Our data in this paper also confirmed that ezetimibe was extensively metabolized in rat small intestine and underwent HER almost exclusively.</p><p>Genistein, a dietary flavonoid, is another compound extensively metabolized in the small intestine, and in humans only 10~30% of the dose was found in urine, suggesting 70-90% of the dose could be eliminated via feces in humans 8[].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please define meaning of &quot;LRE%&quot; abbreviation upon its first use on line 140.</p></disp-quote><p>The content has been edited as showed below:</p><p>“The portal vein infusion uses a direct method to assess the recirculation efficiency of a phenolic glucuronide by the liver using liver recycle efficiency% (LRE%, defined as steady-state biliary secretion rate divided by the hepatic infusion rate).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please change recycle rate to LRE% on line 554.</p></disp-quote><p>We found an incorrect term on line 548, and changed the text from “RR%” to “LRE%”. However the term “excretion rate at the steady-state” on line 548 is not as clear as it should be, and therefore we replaced it with “steady-state glucuronide excretion rate”, which is the same term used in Equation 1.</p><p>References.</p><p>1.
