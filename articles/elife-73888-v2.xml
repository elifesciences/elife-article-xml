Quantitative predictions for how a mutation will affect precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) structure and downstream function are particularly challenging. Here, we use a novel chemical probing strategy to visualize endogenous precursor and mature <italic>MAPT</italic> mRNA structures in cells. We used these data to estimate Boltzmann suboptimal structural ensembles, which were then analyzed to predict consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA structure. Further analysis of recent cryo-EM structures of the spliceosome at different stages of the splicing cycle revealed that the footprint of the B<sup>act</sup> complex with pre-mRNA best predicted alternative splicing outcomes for exon 10 inclusion of the alternatively spliced <italic>MAPT</italic> gene, achieving 74% accuracy. We further developed a β-regression weighting framework that incorporates splice site strength, RNA structure, and exonic/intronic splicing regulatory elements capable of predicting, with 90% accuracy, the effects of 47 known and 6 newly discovered mutations on inclusion of exon 10 of <italic>MAPT</italic>. This combined experimental and computational framework represents a path forward for accurate prediction of splicing-related disease-causing variants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>beta regression</kwd><kwd>RNA structural ensemble</kwd><kwd>Tau</kwd><kwd>disease variants</kwd><kwd>chemical structure probing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL111527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laederach</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM 140844</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laederach</surname><given-names>Alain</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM076485</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mathews</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weeks</surname><given-names>Kevin M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CPRIT Scholar (RR190054)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mustoe</surname><given-names>Anthony M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM142851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lackey</surname><given-names>Lela</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel model is presented that reconciles in-cell structure probing data with splicing regulatory elements to predict exon 10 inclusion of the Tau gene with high accuracy for 53 splice altering mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a highly regulated process in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang and Burge, 2008</xref>). Numerous factors control splicing including <italic>trans</italic>-acting RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), components of the spliceosome, and the pre-mRNA itself. Pre-mRNA structure is a key attribute that directs splicing, particularly alternative splicing, but we have a limited understanding of pre-mRNA structure-mediated splicing mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Taylor and Sobczak, 2020</xref>). It has proven challenging to develop quantitative models capable of predicting splicing outcome, specifically the percent spliced in (PSI) for alternatively spliced exons. It is especially difficult to predict outcome alterations due to genetic variation at exon-intron junctions because mutations affect both the binding by RBPs and also pre-mRNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tazi et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of mutations on pre-mRNA structure are difficult to predict. First, little is known about native pre-mRNA structure because pre-mRNAs are relatively short-lived in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Herzel et al., 2017</xref>). Only recently has high-resolution in-cell experimental characterization been applied to pre-mRNA structure determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustoe et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bubenik et al., 2020</xref>). Second, it is not clear which structures within a pre-mRNA modulate spliceosome assembly and activity. Finally, quantitative measures for the relative weighting of RBP affinity for individual motifs within a pre-mRNA relative to the importance of pre-mRNA structure are lacking.</p><p>In this study, we exploited several technical developments that address these issues to develop an integrated, RNA structure-based framework that accurately predicts splicing outcomes. We measured endogenous pre-mRNA structure in cells taking advantage of recent developments in mutational profiling (MaP) approaches for read-out of chemical probing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Homan et al., 2014</xref>) with targeted amplification of specific exon-intron junctions. This novel approach enabled us to obtain single-nucleotide RNA (snRNA) structure probing data for endogenous pre- and mature mRNAs in the same cell. Our RNA structure modeling considers the equilibrium between multiple alternative structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dethoff et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lai et al., 2018</xref>) and employed data-guided Boltzmann suboptimal sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Spasic et al., 2018</xref>) to predict free energies of unfolding for structures in the ensemble. We additionally leveraged recent high-resolution structures of the spliceosome at various stages of the splicing cycle to deduce the effective spliceosomal footprint on pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), quantitative analysis of exonic and intronic splicing enhancers (ESEs and ISEs)/silencers (ESSs and ISSs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fairbrother et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and a β-regression weighting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ferrari and Cribari-Neto, 2004</xref>).</p><p>For validation of our framework, we studied the effects of 47 experimentally measured mutations near the exon 10 – intron 10 junction of the human <italic>MAPT</italic> gene, which encodes the Tau protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silva and Haggarty, 2020</xref>). Exons 9, 10, 11, and 12 encode the critical microtubule binding repeat domain in Tau. Exons 9, 11, and 12 are constitutively spliced, but exon 10 is alternatively spliced resulting in <italic>MAPT</italic> isoforms with either four microtubule binding repeats (4R) or three repeats (3R) when exon 10 is included or skipped, respectively. The normal ratio of 3R to 4R isoforms is approximately 1:1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hefti et al., 2018</xref>). Twenty-nine clinically validated disease-causing mutations have been identified in the region of the exon 10 – intron 10 junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stenson et al., 2003</xref>). These mutations result in impaired Tau function and are implicated in neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Spillantini et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clark et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rizzu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goedert et al., 1999</xref>). Although some mutations alter the Tau protein sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mirra et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iseki et al., 2001</xref>), 20 of the disease-associated mutations deregulate <italic>MAPT</italic> pre-mRNA splicing altering the ratio of 3R to 4R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">D’Souza et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hasegawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jiang et al., 2000</xref>). The effect of an additional 27 mutations on exon 10 inclusion has been experimentally determined using cell-based splicing assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">D’Souza and Schellenberg, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grover et al., 1999</xref>). The exon 10 junction is the best experimentally characterized junction of clinical importance in the human genome and is thus an excellent system for developing forward-predictive models of splicing. Our work provides a framework for integrating endogenous pre-mRNA structure probing data with a structure-based understanding of spliceosome assembly and <italic>trans</italic>-acting RBPs to qualitatively predict the effect of mutations at exon-intron junctions on splicing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>MAPT</italic> 3R and 4R mRNA isoforms are expressed at a consistent 1:1 ratio across tissues</title><p>To confirm that <italic>MAPT</italic> pre-mRNA splicing results in a 1:1 ratio of alternatively spliced isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Goedert et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreadis, 2005</xref>) in a large population, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lonsdale et al., 2013</xref>).

We observed that only a few mutations were predicted to have a PSI of 0 (3R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> red bar). We therefore used splicing assays to experimentally determine the splicing preference of six instructive variants (Materials and methods): three VUSs predicted to be 3R, one VUS predicted to be 4R, and two VUSs predicted to maintain the WT splicing ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The spliceosome does not rely on sequence alone to correctly identify 5’ and 3’ splice sites; other cues ensure correct binding to appropriate locations. The <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 – intron 10 junction is a well-studied example of the effect of 5’ splice site secondary structure on splicing regulation. A hairpin was initially hypothesized to play a major role in splice site accessibility because disease mutations in this structure, close to the exon-intron junction, shifted the isoform balance to completely exclude or completely include exon 10 in the mature mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hutton et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grover et al., 1999</xref>). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), cell-free chemical probing, and computation analyses confirmed the presence of the hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varani et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lisowiec et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have shown that structures determined in cell-free conditions can differ dramatically from those in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rouskin et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that this is not the case for the exon 10 – intron 10 junction region: in-cell chemical probing of the endogenous <italic>MAPT</italic> pre-mRNA provided strong evidence for formation of this hairpin in cells and for structural features not previously captured.</p><p>Our analysis also revealed that, in cells<italic>,</italic> exonic regions were less structured than introns, as also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sun et al., 2019</xref>. Mature <italic>MAPT</italic> 3R and 4R are less structured in the region of exon 9 through exon 11 than is the pre-mRNA. The high correlations between structures of the exon in different <italic>MAPT</italic> isoforms and our finding that predicted exon 10 folding is only slightly impacted by the presence of intron 10 or exon 11 residues agree with previous observations of mRNAs. Specifically, mRNAs which encode yeast ribosomal proteins that indicate that RNA folding in both pre- and post-spliced exons is highly local and that most base pairs are intra-exon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zubradt et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unlike non-coding RNAs such as the ribosome and tRNA that rely on folding to a single, well-defined structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Petrov et al., 2014</xref>), most RNAs are dynamic, unfolding, and refolding within a landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cruz and Westhof, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giegé et al., 2012</xref>). We showed that structural ensembles have an important function at the exon 10 – intron 10 junction. If the 5’ splice site was always paired, only the 3R isoform would be produced. However, the presence of 3R and 4R isoforms, usually in a 1:1 ratio, implies that the junction is accessible in a subset of the structures. We found disease-causing mutations produced distinct shifts in the ensemble of the <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 – intron 10 junction region; these shifts showed strong correlation with changes in the 3R to 4R isoform ratio and confirmed that ensembles are essential at this junction. Our ability to accurately predict the effects of mutations on ensembles significantly improved our quantitative model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The U1 snRNA base pairs with a nine nucleotide sequence around the exon-intron junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Roca et al., 2012</xref>). However, our analysis of cryo-EM structures of the human spliceosomal assembly cycle revealed that a larger region of the pre-mRNA interacts with the spliceosome and must be unfolded during splicing. Our structural model performed most accurately when we required 43 nucleotides around the 5’ exon-intron junction to be unfolded, corresponding to the region within the spliceosome B<sup>act</sup> complex. This observation suggests that a large region of the pre-mRNA is dynamically remodeled by the spliceosome and that structures distal to the exon-intron junction can regulate splicing. Our finding corroborates evidence that RNA structure near this exon-intron junction is extensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Note that we do not claim that all 43 nucleotides need to remain fully unpaired during the splicing cycle, as the entire cycle is dynamic and likely involves other intermediate structures. Rather, our model argues that mRNA unfolding and accommodation into the B<sup>act</sup> complex are a key rate-limiting step in splicing, and considering this step is necessary to accurately model splicing outcome for a diverse set of mutations. Broadly, our definition of a functional footprint for splicing parallels a similar idea for translation initiation by the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mustoe et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mustoe et al., 2018b</xref>), for which the footprint is roughly 30 nucleotides. Thus, for both translation initiation and splice site selection, there is a region in which RNA structure functions as a rheostat.</p><p>Considerable evidence supports a function for both SREs (and their corresponding RBPs) and RNA structure in controlling alternative splicing of exon 10 of <italic>MAPT</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andreadis, 2012</xref>). However, the relative importance of these two factors has been controversial. The regression model we developed clarifies that there is a cooperative relationship between RNA structure and SREs in driving splicing outcome. Exonic non-synonymous mutations promote splicing changes primarily by altering SRE motifs, whereas exonic synonymous and intronic mutations altered RNA structure. A combined model that accounted for both structure and SREs was the most accurate predictor of exon 10 PSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). It was previously proposed that exon 10 is alternatively spliced due to a weak 5’ splice site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">D’Souza and Schellenberg, 2005</xref>), and indeed, we found that mutations that strengthened the splice site increase inclusion of exon 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). SRE strength alterations overall skewed more toward increased exon 10 inclusion, which suggest that SREs and the RBPs that bind them buffer the effects of RNA structure to maintain the 1:1 isoform ratio.</p><p>Although structure and SREs had opposing effects on splicing outcomes, disease variants frequently resulted in a synergistic effect on splicing outcome. The combined model was directly validated by accurate prediction of the effects of six previously untested VUSs on exon 10 splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Few VUSs were predicted to completely exclude exon 10 from the mature mRNA. Only five VUSs had PSIs less than 0.25. Our model accurately predicted the effect of the three with the lowest predicted PSI. Our systematic computational mutagenesis revealed a hotspot for mutations around 25–30 nucleotides downstream of the exon-intron junction that were predicted to result in production of only the 3R isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Indeed, the experimentally validated VUSs with PSIs less than 0.25 were in this region.</p><p>In principle, our splicing model can be extended to other exon-intron junctions, although RBPs that recognize SRE motifs have different binding contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dominguez et al., 2018</xref>) and the exact binding preferences of the RBPs that regulate the junction of interest are currently unknown. Another limitation is that the current model does not consider structural and sequence features around the 3’ splice site (in the case of <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10, the intron 9 – exon 10 junction) that are expected to impact exon 10 splicing regulation. Although our model provides an exact PSI prediction for each mutation, we emphasize that its principal utility is in predicting the direction in which the 3R to 4R isoform ratio shifted from the WT ratio.</p><p>In brain tissue from healthy individuals, exon 10 PSIs varied between individuals and between tissues within an individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Even in individuals with progressive supranuclear palsy, a tauopathy in which <italic>MAPT</italic> variants are implicated, there was variability in exon 10 PSIs in different brain tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Majounie et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, although our model combines both structural and sequence features to achieve quantitative prediction accuracy of the 3R to 4R ratio for a wide range of disease mutations (synonymous, non-synonymous, intronic, and exonic), it is not clear that PSI alone is predictive of severity of disease for the broad class of tauopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Majounie et al., 2013</xref>). Disease severity is compounded by other factors including gene-gene interactions and environmental factors. As such, the value of our model stems more from how it incorporates RNA structure in predicting alternative splicing rather than as a direct predictor of disease severity. Many neurodegenerative diseases are caused by mutations around the <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 – intron 10 junction, and there are no approved therapeutics that target this junction. Our work suggests that it is crucial to consider the larger structural context of this region of the pre-mRNA and the interplay between structure and SREs when considering the consequences of mutations on splicing regulation and the design of potential therapeutics to alter this ratio.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T-47D</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HTB-133</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Epithelial cells from ductal carcinoma of breast</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SH-SY5Y</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-2266</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neuroblastoma cells from bone marrow</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wildtype splicing reporter plasmid for <italic>MAPT</italic> exon 10 – intron 10 junction</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tan et al., 2019</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Exon10Intron10-Fwd</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AACGTCCAGTCCAAGTGTGG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Exon10Intron10-Rev</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">CATTCACCCAGAGGTCGCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3 R/4R-Fwd</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGTGGTCCGTACTCCAC</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">3 R/4R-Rev</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PCR primers</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">TGATGGATGTTGCCTAATGAGC</named-content></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Analyses of <italic>MAPT</italic> sequencing data for GTEx tissue types</title><p>Aligned BAM files of individual samples from the GTEx v8 project for tissue types with <italic>MAPT</italic> TPM greater than 10 were accessed in the AnVIL/Terra environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumar, 2020a</xref>).

id="s4-24"><title>Clustering of changes in structural and SRE features</title><p>For each feature, non-zero values greater than the 95th percentile value were set to the 95th percentile or, if less than the 5th percentile value, were set to the 5th percentile for visualization, after which all values were normalized to the maximum absolute value. Silencer Δstrength and mean ΔG<sup>‡</sup> of unfolding of ensembles were inverted to follow the visualization such that values closer to 1 would result in greater exon 10 inclusion and values closer to 0 would result in lower exon 10 inclusion. Features were then assigned values 0 or 1 depending on whether the feature changed at all in the presence of the mutation. These digitized features were clustered by hierarchical clustering resulting in six clusters. Each individual cluster was then clustered again by hierarchical clustering using the normalized feature values instead of values of 0 and 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Splicing assays</title><p>HEK-293 cells (ATCC CRL-1573) were grown at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Omega Scientific) and 0.5% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). The WT splicing reporter plasmid was generously provided by the Roca lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tan et al., 2019</xref>). Single-nucleotide point mutations were generated using a Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (NEB) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing or were custom ordered directly from GenScript. Reporter plasmids (2 μg) were transfected into HEK-293 cells in six-well plates when cells were 60–90% confluent using Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were harvested after 1 day by aspirating the media. Cells were resuspended in 1 mL Trizol reagent (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA was isolated using the PureLink RNA Isolation Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) with on-column DNase treatment, following manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (1 μg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using Superscript VILO reverse transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). Reverse transcriptions were performed by annealing (25°C, 10 min), extension (50°C, 10 min), and inactivation (85°C, 10 min) steps. Heat-inactivated controls were prepared by heating the reaction without RNA at 85°C for 10 min prior to adding RNA, then following the described reaction conditions. The cDNA was PCR amplified with NEB Q5 HotStart polymerase (NEB) using splicing assay primers from IDT (<named-content content-type="sequence">AGACCCAAGCTGGCTAGCGTT</named-content> forward, <named-content content-type="sequence">GAGGCTGATCAGCGGGTTTAAAC</named-content> reverse) with 25 cycles. PCR product was purified and concentrated using the PureLink PCR micro clean up kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) following manufacturer’s instructions. Splicing products were visualized by loading ~200 ng of DNA on a 2% agarose gel in 1× tris-acetate EDTA buffer and staining with ethidium bromide. Gel images were quantified with ImageJ.</p><p>Supplementary files, figure source files, SNRNASMs, and code are available at GitHub repository: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://git.io/JuSW8">https://git.io/JuSW8</ext-link>, copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/swh:1:dir:a4fd114750048d8a0ad80d926ea5c44b57af3f84;origin=https://github.com/JayKu4418/Computational-Experimental-framework-for-predicting-effects-of-variants-on-alternative-splicing;visit=swh:1:snp:c1c3ce7ae4b9f85c83fac0575c0e2bc5ee19bb5a;anchor=swh:1:rev:4cb33b94bb8a864bc63fd5a3c96dae547914b20f">swh:1:rev:4cb33b94bb8a864bc63fd5a3c96dae547914b20f</ext-link>;

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The figure of SSU structure could be improved with clear nucleotide information along with reactivities. The ROC shows that the sequence seems more important than DMS reactivities. It might be better to quantitatively measure how many single-stranded nucleotides have high DMS reactivities. The DMS reactivities for unpaired As and Cs are much higher than those for paired As and Cs. Is it due to protein protection? It seems unreasonable to compare the reactivity profiles between SSU and MARPT isoforms since the profile difference might be only due the different interacted proteins.</p><p>2. It is interesting that 66% of base pairs were contained within exon units. Would the percentage remain similar when performing RNA folding with sliding window? If so, this observation could be explained as co-transcriptional folding.</p><p>3. The intron is more structured than the exon. Rather than RNA structure, is it possible that it is due to the protein protection? Would it remain a similar pattern under deproteinized conditions?</p><p>4. The unfolding free energy is based on the first step of 5'SS recognition (9 nts) for U1 snRNA. It is also possible that the RNA structure only affects U5 snRNA binding? The authors could test unfolding 3nt and see whether it will be similar or no effect. Again, will the clusters remain similar if the folding windows change?</p><p>5. It is not necessary to unfold all the nucleotides at one time. At the different steps during the splicing, the RNA structure might be very dynamic and remodelled in the process.</p><p>6. For the training set, is there any reason for using 20 synonymous and intronic mutations? A detailed clarification is necessary. Why not non-synonymous mutations?</p><p>7. The prediction could be improved by taking into account RBPs. The different DMS reactivity profiles are likely due to RBP binding. See the comment above.</p><p>8. Figure 6E. The first mutation the model predicted as &quot;No change&quot; seems to change; the splicing ratio does change at the leftmost column, although to a lesser extent than in the other columns called as &quot;changed&quot;.</p><p>9. I would encourage the authors to come up with an explanation/hypothesis of why some mutations are more impactful, with respect to disease, than others.</p><p>10. Throughout the text, the authors discuss RNA conformations as being &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; structured and then &quot;structured&quot; or &quot;unstructured.&quot; It would be beneficial to describe what it means to be &quot;structured&quot; versus &quot;non-structured&quot; and if they are truly the extremes or another way of saying more of less structured. It is difficult to follow as the text flips between these four ways to describe the structure, and then incorporates the direct measurement of the energy of splice site unfolding.</p><p>11. It would be good to include &quot;MAPT&quot; in the title considering all data was collected for this gene. If the author wanted to present this framework as a general model for splicing prediction, analysis of a second exon-intron junction would be required.</p><p>12. Results, first subsection: MAPT's PSI variability was analyzed in the context of different individuals and different cell types/tissues. This is followed by a statement that this isoform ratio is consistent. It would be helpful to see some reference to similar stats for other genes commonly studied for alternative splicing to give readers an idea of a &quot;baseline&quot; or at least what one should expect to see for a &quot;random&quot; gene. As someone not too familiar with the splicing literature, the variation in Figure 1A doesn't seem that small but this is likely because I don't know what numbers to expect. I'm also not sure about the relevance of the claim regarding &quot;the likely presence of different levels of RBPs …&quot; since I don't think it's clear which RBPs are involved in MAPT splicing (are these well characterized?, if yes, their levels can be quantified) and perhaps their levels are also fairly consistent across samples.</p><p>13. Results, second subsection: based on a finding that &quot;66% of base pairs spanned less than 50 nucleotides and were contained within the exon units&quot;, the authors suggest that &quot;the mature exons function as their own structural unit&quot;. However, looking at Figure 1B, there seem to be some high-probability, adjacent base-pairing interactions (green arcs, likely a stable helix) between exons 9 and 11 in isoform 3R, and similarly, 2 stable helices between exons 9 and 10 in isoform 4R. I recommend revising this part.</p><p>14. Results, third subsection: similarly to my previous comment, I also noticed strong base-pairing interactions (2 helices) between exon 10 and intron 10 in Figure 2. It would be helpful if the authors clarified this point and why they think that base pairing was &quot;contained within exons, independent of introns.&quot;</p><p>Also, same question as above regarding the statement &quot;despite likely differences in RBP concentrations, …&quot;.</p><p>15. Results, third subsection: it would be good to explicitly quantify (in the main text) the reactivity difference observed between the pre-mRNA and the mature isoform junctions, similarly to how this was done in a previous subsection for SSU vs. the isoforms, as it gives an idea of the degree of these changes and how strongly they suggest/support a higher pre-mRNA structure. That said, the statistical significance of such changes should be assessed/quantified in the context of the baseline (i.e., within-condition) variabilities.</p><p>16. Figure 2B: representative structures are shown for 3 clusters, but to me, it seems like there is a fourth cluster in the middle-right part of the plot (north east of the cluster whose representative structure is depicted at the bottom right). Was this cluster also identified by k-means? If yes, what is the representative structure and how relevant is it to the findings of this study? If this is not a separate cluster, it would help to clarify that the structure shown at the bottom right also corresponds to these points, or is it the structure at the top right corner? The latter option makes more sense based on the density plot (Figure 4C) for 4R mutant, but currently, no dashed line points directly to this region/cluster.</p><p>17. Figure 2C: the gel insets are mentioned briefly in the caption but I found it difficult to understand what these mean and why they are there. A bit more detail would be helpful, or otherwise perhaps move them to Supp. material and add some detail there.</p><p>18. Results, fourth subsection: in the statement about WT &quot;The exon-intron junction of the representative structure for this region …&quot; – does &quot;this region&quot; refer to the cloud in the middle? If yes, it's unclear from the previous sentence, which says WT had &quot;structures distributed across the entire space…&quot;</p><p>19. Results, fourth subsection: the last sentence refers to &quot;the two other representative structures …&quot; and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, where the clustering results are shown more clearly and more than 3 clusters/structures emerge. This is really confusing, and I suggest re-thinking how to present the clustering and representative structures results. I find the supp figure to be clearer than Figure 2, even though more than 3 clusters are depicted. At the least, I think it could be helpful to clarify that more than 3 clusters were found and which structures represent which points/region in the plot.</p><p>20. Results, fifth subsection: the text on the non-synonymous and compensatory mutations isn't very clear. Were these all within exon 10? By compensatory mutations, do you mean double-mutants that recover the PSI?</p><p>21. Results, fifth subsection: did the author try to predict the PSI by using combinations of unfolding free energies (from several stages)?</p><p>22. Figure 3B: from the insets, it looks like the bootstrap variation estimates vary markedly differently for exonic vs. intronic mutations. Any idea why?</p><p>23. Figure 4A: what does &quot;Experimental Label&quot; mean?</p><p>24. Materials and methods, calculating \deltaG^{++} of unfolding of a region of interest: I found it difficult to follow the description of this calculation, so more detail would be appreciated. I'm also not sure what &quot;base pairs within a region of interest were removed&quot; means – do you mean the structure in that region was converted into a single-stranded RNA? Also, my understanding is that the notation \deltaG^{++} is for this particular non-equilibrium energy, however, I don't understand why the two numbers from which it is calculated are also denoted by \deltaG^{++}.</p><p>25. I have the impression that sometimes the authors omitted crucial explanations. For example, it is important to explicitly stated that inclusion of exon 10 results in the 4R isoform and that exclusion results in 3R early in the text to avoid confusions.</p><p>26 In Figure 1A, I suggest that splicing be drawn by having lines go from the 5' splice site of exon 9 to the 3' splice site on exon 10, or to that on exon 11, to show the alternative splicing forms.</p><p>27. Figure supplement 2A-B: space missing in &quot;Invivo&quot;.</p><p>28. The manuscript could benefit from improvements to its writing to clarify and/or better explain a few points/statements and possibly also adjust some statements to better align with the analysis findings. Different subsections of the main text sometimes feel disconnected from the rest. Including the rationale of the authors in performing each analysis together with clear conclusions would go a long way helping the readers understand the various sections. The authors explain that the consistency of the splicing ratio (1:1) across tissues suggests that primary sequences and structure regulate this event, but not RNA binding proteins. It is strange that later on the authors include SRE (and binding of RNA binding proteins) as key regulators in their framework.</p><p>29. Line 51-52, the references for pre-mRNA structure should be Sun et al., 2019 NSMB and Liu et al., 2021, Genome Biology.</p><p>30. Shannon Entropy could be added along with BPP.</p><p>31. The PCR efficiency is normally associated with the size of fragment. The size of 3R is much shorter than that of 4R. Is there any estimations on the effects while comparing the structures of 3R and 4R?</p><p>32. Will the structure and SRE in the intron upstream of exon10 also affect the PSI?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73888.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Nonetheless, the reviewer brings up a good point about the effects of protein protection on DMS modification. To address this, we first extracted RNA from cells and removed the proteins, and then treated them with DMS (cell-free). We found that the increased DMS reactivities for unpaired ribonucleotides compared to paired was maintained in the cell-free condition (Figure 1 —figure supplement 7A) suggesting that the native structure of the RNA is contributing to the reactivity of these ribonucleotides rather than protein protection. This is consistent with previous in-cell vs. cell-free studies of RNAs.</p><p>We also modified the SSU structure in Figure 1 —figure supplement 6 to show clear nucleotide information with respective in-cell DMS reactivities and we thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><p>While we agree that the ROC indicates that sequence is marginally more accurate in predicting the SSU structure compared to just using DMS reactivities, the goal of this analysis was to show that combining the sequence and DMS reactivities yielded the best prediction accuracy of the SSU structure. This is further supported by the ROC generated using cell-free SSU DMS reactivities, consistent with previously published works that show combining experimental and computational models yields the most accurate predictions (Hajdin et al., 2013; Sükösd et al., 2013).</p><p>This new data is now included in the manuscript on page 6, lines 151-167.</p><p>“As an internal control for our probing experiments, we also collected DMS-MaP data for the small subunit ribosomal RNA (SSU) (Figure 1—figure supplement 6), which has a</p><p>well-defined secondary structure (Petrov et al., 2014). As expected, the DMS reactivities of unpaired nucleotides were significantly higher than for paired nucleotides both for RNA probed in cells and for RNA isolated from cells prior to probing (Figure 1–figure supplement 7A). This experiment confirmed that our DMS probing recapitulates native RNA secondary structure regardless of the presence of proteins, consistent with Previous studies (Woods et al., 2017; Lackey et al., 2018). We used the SSU in-cell reactivity data to calibrate the estimation of equilibrium ensembles (Materials and methods), and we confirmed that structure modeling guided by experimental DMS reactivities yielded a more accurate estimation of the SSU structure than the model not informed by chemical probing data (Figure 1—figure supplement 7B).</p><p>The median in-cell DMS reactivity of the mature MAPT isoforms was 0.22, significantly greater than the median in-cell DMS reactivity of the SSU, which was 0.008 (Figure 1– figure supplement 7C). This difference was recapitulated in cell-free samples (Figure 1– figure supplement 7C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is interesting that 66% of base pairs were contained within exon units. Would the percentage remain similar when performing RNA folding with sliding window? If so, this observation could be explained as co-transcriptional folding.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent question that we agree could benefit from further analysis. To model co-transcriptional folding, we first folded Exon 10 and counted the number of base pairs. We then “in silico” transcribed Exon 11 one nucleotide at a time and computed the number of intra-exon base pairs (base pairs just within Exon 10 or base pairs just within Exon 11) for every additional nucleotide. We plotted the percentage of intra-exon base pairs out of the total number of base pairs found for the sequence at each nucleotide of Exon 11 added (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). We found that while the total number of intra-exon base pairs decreased as Exon 11 is transcribed, once Exon 11 is complete 88.9% of all base within exon units once the full length mRNA is folded.</p><p>We also in silico transcribed the pre-cursor mRNA co-transcriptionally by adding Intron 10 one nucleotide at a time to Exon 10 and then calculated the number of intraexon/ intron base pairs as a percentage of the total number of base pairs (Figure 2 – figure supplement 2). There is a large drop in intra exon/intron base pairs 37 nucleotides into intron 10 but ultimately 65.7% of all base pairs are self-contained within an exon or intron.</p><p>It is important to note that the 66% intra-exon pairs initially reported was averaged over all exons probed in this manuscript, we now provide these measurements for specific sequences.</p><p>We have modified the text and figure legends accordingly. For example, on page 6 lines 170-174:</p><p>“In the 4R isoform, approximately 89% of base pairs were contained within the exon units; only 11% of base pairs were between residues from exon 10 with those of exon 11 (Figure 1—figure supplement 8). This result suggests that the mature exons fold as independent structural units.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The intron is more structured than the exon. Rather than RNA structure, is it possible that it is due to the protein protection? Would it remain a similar pattern under deproteinized conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and to address this we now include cell-free analysis of exon 10 – intron 10 junction. Interestingly, we found the cell-free and in-cell DMS reactivities to be highly correlated (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1D). Furthermore, DMS reactivities in the pre-cursor MAPT transcript were lower than the mature MAPT transcripts implying that the pre-cursor mRNA is more structured than the mature mRNA both in-cell and cell-free (Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). Thus, protein protection does not appear to have a large effect on these RNA’s DMS reactivity. This is now discussed on page 9, lines 243-248.</p><p>“However, when we compared DMS reactivities for pre-mRNA and the mature 4R isoform, we found that DMS reactivity in exon 10 was significantly lower for the pre-mRNA (median in-cell DMS reactivity: 0.08) than for the 4R isoform (median in-cell DMS reactivity: 0.22) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This was also the case for RNA probed under cell-free conditions (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). The pre-mRNA is thus apparently more structured than mature mRNA independent of protein protection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The unfolding free energy is based on the first step of 5'SS recognition (9 nts) for U1 snRNA. It is also possible that the RNA structure only affects U5 snRNA binding? The authors could test unfolding 3nt and see whether it will be similar or no effect. Again, will the clusters remain similar if the folding windows change?</p></disp-quote><p>The t-SNE dimensionality reduction and subsequent k-means clustering was performed on the 201-nucleotide region flanking exon 10 – intron 10 junction. No max pairing distance was used to fold the sequence. Each point on the plot represents one of the 1000 suboptimal structures sampled and the point was colored based on the unfolding free energy of the 5’SS (9 nucleotides). Hence, unfolding a different region other than the 5’ SS would change the color of each point but it would not affect the position of the points or the clusters. We think it may get confusing to the reader if we provide in the supplement differently colored versions of this plot based on unfolding energy. However, we do address these questions in Figure 3.</p><p>For our model to predict PSI, we calculated unfolding free energies of regions around the exon-intron junction through different stages of the splicing cycle (Figure 3A). We use cryo-EM structures of these stages to identify unpaired nucleotides in the spliceosome. U5 snRNA arrives in the splicing cycle during the assembly of the Pre-B spliceosomal complex when the 5’SS is transferred from the U1snRNA to the U6 and U5 snRNA (Bertram et al., 2017). Hence, the RNA’s interaction with the U5 snRNA would be captured by the nucleotides unpaired in the pre-B complex. Furthermore, our analysis finds that the model with the best prediction accuracy is when unfolding a much larger region of the exon-intron junction found in the Bact complex (43 nucleotides, 10 exonic, 33 intronic). This suggests that structures distal to the 5’ splice site are impacting Exon 10 splicing (Figure 3B, C), and we discuss this on page 32 of the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. It is not necessary to unfold all the nucleotides at one time. At the different steps during the splicing, the RNA structure might be very dynamic and remodelled in the process.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that all nucleotides are probably not accessible at all times and that RNA structure is dynamic. However, we needed a systematic approach to identify which nucleotides should be unfolded for the structure model during the splicing cycle. Hence, we performed an analysis of Cryo-EM structures of the human spliceosome at various stages of the splicing model to identify the region of the precursor mRNA with no intramolecular contacts at each stage of the splicing cycle (Figure 3A). The best predictive performance observed when we unfolded all 43 nucleotides found associated with the Bact complex (Figure 3B, C) suggesting that the pre-mRNA needs to be unpaired to allow the spliceosome to rearrange the conformation. We now discuss this on page 32, lines 775-781:</p><p>“Our finding corroborates evidence that RNA structure near this exon-intron junction is extensive (Tan et al., 2019). Note that we do not claim that all 43 nucleotides need to remain fully unpaired during the splicing cycle, as the entire cycle is dynamic and likely involves other intermediate structures. Rather, our model argues that mRNA unfolding and accommodation into the Bact complex is a key rate limiting step in splicing, and considering this step is necessary to accurately model splicing outcome for a diverse set of mutations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. For the training set, is there any reason for using 20 synonymous and intronic mutations? A detailed clarification is necessary. Why not non-synonymous mutations?</p></disp-quote><p>Non-synonymous variants are primarily implicated in altering the amino acid sequence of protein translated from the region. Previous studies have shown that synonymous and intronic variants are more likely to affect splicing (Supek et al., 2014; H. Lin et al., 2019a). Additionally, these variants are causative of disease through structural changes as shown by a recent analysis of synonymous cancer mutations (Sharma et al., 2019) as well as an investigation into pathogenic intronic variants (C. L. Lin, Taggart, and Fairbrother 2016). Hence, in order to train a model that only uses structural information and select the region among the four spliceosomal complexes that would best predict MAPT Exon 10 splicing, we used only 20 synonymous and intronic variants to eliminate the possibility of the pathogenicity arising from other effects such as changes in the protein sequence. Ultimately, we do validate our structure model on non-synonymous variants (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A, B).</p><p>We have modified the text accordingly. On page 15, lines 370-375:</p><p>“To identify the spliceosome complex footprint that best predicts splicing outcome, we examined the relationship between unfolding energy and splicing outcome for 20 synonymous or intronic mutations in exon 10 and intron 10 (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A). These mutations are more likely to affect splicing (Supek et al., 2014; H. Lin et al., 2019b) and structure (Sharma et al., 2019; C. L. Lin, Taggart, and Fairbrother 2016) than mutations that alter the protein sequence.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The prediction could be improved by taking into account RBPs. The different DMS reactivity profiles are likely due to RBP binding. See the comment above.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to direct the reviewer to Figure 4 —figure supplement 2 and lines 631-641 in the main text. We used motif strengths of RBPs previously identified as regulating splicing of the MAPT Exon 10 – Intron 10 junction in our β regression framework. This unfortunately resulted in poor prediction accuracy of MAPT Exon 10 PSI with a correlation coefficient of 0.08, hence our use of splicing regulatory elements.</p><p>We now address the issue of DMS reactivity differences due to RBP binding by analyzing the DMS reactivity profiles of the MAPT mature and pre-cursor transcripts in deproteinized conditions (cell-free) as described above in reviewer comment #3 (Figure 1 —figure supplement 7C, Figure 2 —figure supplement 3). We find that DMS reactivity is not specifically affected by RBP binding within cells under our conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Figure 6E. The first mutation the model predicted as “No change” seems to change; the splicing ratio does change at the leftmost column, although to a lesser extent than in the other columns called as “changed”.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the mutation +23U&gt;C predicted as “no change” is lower than the WT splicing ratio. However, when we performed a two-tailed Wilcoxon-Rank Sum test over three replicates, we obtained a p-value of 1 for +23U&gt;C, suggesting that the decrease in ratio is not significant. This was also the case for +26G&gt;A. Hence, we concluded that we had confirmed our prediction that these two mutations resulted in no change to the Exon 10 splicing ratio. We have now added the p-value of 1 for those two “No change” mutations on Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 and modified the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. I would encourage the authors to come up with an explanation/hypothesis of why some mutations are more impactful, with respect to disease, than others.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and one we have struggled with during the drafting of the manuscript. It is quite clear the severity of disease is not always correlated to the 3R/4R ratio. Our data of “healthy” GTeX individuals (Figure 1A) shows variation in this ratio among these healthy individuals. We have added the following text to the discussion in response to this comment on page 34, line 825-833 of the discussion in the main text:</p><p>“Thus, although our model combines both structural and sequence features to achieve quantitative prediction accuracy of the 3R to 4R ratio for a wide range of disease mutations (synonymous, non-synonymous, intronic and exonic), it is not clear that PSI alone is predictive of severity of disease for the broad class of tauopathies (Majounie et al. 2013). Disease severity is compounded by other factors including gene-gene interactions and environmental factors. As such, the value of our model stems more from how it incorporates RNA structure in predicting alternative splicing, rather than as a direct predictor of disease severity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Throughout the text, the authors discuss RNA conformations as being “more” or “less” structured and then “structured” or “unstructured.” It would be beneficial to describe what it means to be “structured” versus “non-structured” and if they are truly the extremes or another way of saying more of less structured. It is difficult to follow as the text flips between these four ways to describe the structure, and then incorporates the direct measurement of the energy of splice site unfolding.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes an excellent point. We were primarily using unstructured versus structured when describing the interpretation of high and low DMS reactivities. To the reviewer’s point, DMS reactivities are more probabilistic in nature and hence we have gone through the text and removed uses of “unstructured” and replaced them with “less structured.”</p><p>For example, in the figure caption of Figure 2A, page 13, lines 295-298:</p><p>“Each value is shown with its standard error and colored by reactivity based on the color scale. High median DMS reactivities correspond to less structured regions, whereas low median DMS reactivities correspond to more structured regions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. It would be good to include “MAPT” in the title considering all data was collected for this gene. If the author wanted to present this framework as a general model for splicing prediction, analysis of a second exon-intron junction would be required.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. We have changed the title of the manuscript to: “Quantitative prediction of variant effects on alternative splicing in MAPT using endogenous pre messenger RNA structure probing”.</p><p>Given the current length and complexity of the manuscript we think extending our</p><p>analysis to other systems falls outside the scope of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Results, first subsection: MAPT’s PSI variability was analyzed in the context of different individuals and different cell types/tissues. This is followed by a statement that this isoform ratio is consistent. It would be helpful to see some reference to similar stats for other genes commonly studied for alternative splicing to give readers an idea of a “baseline” or at least what one should expect to see for a “random” gene. As someone not too familiar with the splicing literature, the variation in Figure 1A doesn’t seem that small but this is likely because I don’t know what numbers to expect. I’m also not sure about the relevance of the claim regarding “the likely presence of different levels of RBPs …” since I don’t think it’s clear which RBPs are involved in MAPT splicing (are these well characterized?, if yes, their levels can be quantified) and perhaps their levels are also fairly consistent across samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent point. Mele et. Al concluded after using linear mixed models to analyze the contribution of tissue and individual differences in transcript isoform variation of GteX RNA-Seq data (Melé et al., 2015) that splice isoform expression has little variation among both individuals and tissues. However, they did not provide a baseline number. To address this point, we calculated and plotted the distribution of PSI of two other exons in MAPT across 15 tissues in Figure 1 – figure supplement 2. Exon 4 is constitutively spliced and always included in every transcript. Exon 2 is alternatively spliced. Our analysis showed that Exon 4 PSI had low variability across different brain tissues with an overall standard deviation of 0.1 while Exon 2 had higher variability with a standard deviation of 0.3. We found that MAPT Exon 10 falls in the middle with a standard deviation of 0.2.</p><p>We have modified the text and figure legends accordingly. For example, on page 5 lines 129-131:</p><p>“Furthermore, exon 10 inclusion variability (0.2) was between the variability for a MAPT constitutively spliced exon (0.1) and another MAPT alternatively spliced exon (0.3) (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Furthermore, we analyzed the overall expression levels of 9 RBPs previously implicated in regulating alternative splicing of MAPT Exon 10 from RNA-Seq data in the GTeX database. As can be seen from the violin plots (Figure 1 —figure supplement 3), there is variability of RBP expression levels among different tissues and individuals. We did attempt to model Exon 10 PSI unsuccessfully using RBP expression levels initially during the development of the manuscript but were unsuccessful in finding any meaningful correlations. This indicated to us that RBP levels alone are not a good predictor of PSI in this case. However, given the complexity and length of the manuscript we did not include details of this negative result in the manuscript.</p><p>We have modified the text and figure legends accordingly. For example, on page 5 lines 131-133:</p><p>“As levels of RBP expression varied considerably across individuals and tissues (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), sequence and structural features of the MAPT pre-mRNA also likely regulate inclusion of exon 10.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Results, second subsection: based on a finding that &quot;66% of base pairs spanned less than 50 nucleotides and were contained within the exon units&quot;, the authors suggest that &quot;the mature exons function as their own structural unit&quot;. However, looking at Figure 1B, there seem to be some high-probability, adjacent base-pairing interactions (green arcs, likely a stable helix) between exons 9 and 11 in isoform 3R, and similarly, 2 stable helices between exons 9 and 10 in isoform 4R. I recommend revising this part.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that while there are a few high probability base pairs between exon 9 and exon 11 as well as exon 9 and exon 10, overall, we found a larger number of intra-exon base pairs compared to inter-exon base pairs. As described in response to reviewer comment #2, we performed co-transcriptional folding to better characterize the intra vs inter exon base-pairs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. Results, third subsection: similarly to my previous comment, I also noticed strong base-pairing interactions (2 helices) between exon 10 and intron 10 in Figure 2.

Please refer to reviewer comment #12 for how we showed that there are differences in RBP concentrations between tissues and individuals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. Results, third subsection: it would be good to explicitly quantify (in the main text) the reactivity difference observed between the pre-mRNA and the mature isoform junctions, similarly to how this was done in a previous subsection for SSU vs. the isoforms, as it gives an idea of the degree of these changes and how strongly they suggest/support a higher pre-mRNA structure. That said, the statistical significance of such changes should be assessed/quantified in the context of the baseline (i.e., within-condition) variabilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the pointing this out to us and we have modified the text as</p><p>follows. On page 9, lines 243-246:</p><p>“However, when we compared DMS reactivities for pre-mRNA and the mature 4R isoform, we found that DMS reactivity in exon 10 was significantly lower for the pre-mRNA (median in-cell DMS reactivity: 0.08) than for the 4R isoform (median in-cell DMS reactivity: 0.22) (Figure 2—figure supplement 3).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16. Figure 2B: representative structures are shown for 3 clusters, but to me, it seems like there is a fourth cluster in the middle-right part of the plot (north east of the cluster whose representative structure is depicted at the bottom right). Was this cluster also identified by k-means? If yes, what is the representative structure and how relevant is it to the findings of this study? If this is not a separate cluster, it would help to clarify that the structure shown at the bottom right also corresponds to these points, or is it the structure at the top right corner? The latter option makes more sense based on the density plot (Figure 4C) for 4R mutant, but currently, no dashed line points directly to this region/cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We have altered Figure 2B to show five clusters very clearly by circling them.

In WT, both 3R (Exon 9 – Exon 11) and 4R (Exon 9 – Exon 10 – Exon 11) isoforms are expressed (two bands). In the presence of the 3R mutation, only the 3R isoform is expressed (one band) whereas for the 4R mutation only the 4R isoform is expressed (one band).

Conversely, greater than 50% of structures in the ensemble of the +15 A&gt;C mutant (Cluster 5), which shifts the isoform balance entirely to 4R (Tan et al. 2019), were characterized by lower DG‡ of unfolding for the splice site region (Figure 2B, C).

Results, fourth subsection: the last sentence refers to &quot;the two other representative structures …&quot; and Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, where the clustering results are shown more clearly and more than 3 clusters/structures emerge. This is really confusing, and I suggest re-thinking how to present the clustering and representative structures results. I find the supp figure to be clearer than Figure 2, even though more than 3 clusters are depicted. At the least, I think it could be helpful to clarify that more than 3 clusters were found and which structures represent which points/region in the plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this figure and the corresponding paragraph in the main text is unclear.

Materials and methods, calculating \deltaG^{++} of unfolding of a region of interest: I found it difficult to follow the description of this calculation, so more detail would be appreciated.

The manuscript could benefit from improvements to its writing to clarify and/or better explain a few points/statements and possibly also adjust some statements to better align with the analysis findings. Different subsections of the main text sometimes feel disconnected from the rest. Including the rationale of the authors in performing each analysis together with clear conclusions would go a long way helping the readers understand the various sections. The authors explain that the consistency of the splicing ratio (1:1) across tissues suggests that primary sequences and structure regulate this event, but not RNA binding proteins.

Additionally, while our structure-only model performs moderately well for 47 mutations (R2=0.74) (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, see Supplementary file 2 for further details about mutations), the structure only model performs particularly poorly for non-synonymous mutations (median bootstrapped R2 = - 0.21, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).
