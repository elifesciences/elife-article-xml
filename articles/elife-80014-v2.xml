pathway. However, while both Ism1 and insulin converge on these common targets, Ism1 has distinct cellular actions suggesting divergence in downstream intracellular signaling pathways. To understand the biological complexity of Ism1 signaling, we performed phosphoproteomic analysis after acute exposure, revealing overlapping and distinct pathways of Ism1 and insulin. We identify a 53% overlap between Ism1 and insulin signaling and Ism1-mediated phosphoproteome-wide alterations in ~450 proteins that are not shared with insulin. Interestingly, we find several unknown phosphorylation sites on proteins related to protein translation, mTOR pathway, and, unexpectedly, muscle function in the Ism1 signaling network. Physiologically, <italic>Ism1</italic> ablation in mice results in altered proteostasis, including lower muscle protein levels under fed and fasted conditions, reduced amino acid incorporation into proteins, and reduced phosphorylation of the key protein synthesis effectors Akt and downstream mTORC1 targets. As metabolic disorders such as diabetes are associated with accelerated loss of skeletal muscle protein content, these studies define a non-canonical mechanism by which this antidiabetic circulating protein controls muscle biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need energy to survive and carry out their role in the body. They do this by breaking down molecules, like sugar, into substances that can fuel the creation of new compounds, like proteins or lipids. This process, known as metabolism, involves a series of interconnecting chemical reactions which are organized into pathways.</p><p>Metabolic pathways contain proteins that catalyze each sequential reaction. Hormones can change the activity of these proteins by adding a chemical group called a phosphate. This reversible modification can majorly impact the metabolism of cells, resulting in changes to the body‚Äôs tissues. The hormone insulin, for instance, alters a well-known metabolic pathway that triggers skeletal muscle cells to produce more proteins, leading to stronger and larger muscles.</p><p>In 2021, a group of scientists discovered a molecule made by fat cells, called Isthmin-1, also activates components in this pathway. Similar to insulin, Isthmin-1 encourages muscle and fat cells to take up sugar. However, it also prevents the liver from accumulating excess fat, suggesting Isthmin-1 may trigger a different cascade of molecules to insulin.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, Zhao et al. ‚Äì including some of the researchers involved in the 2021 study ‚Äì exposed cells grown in the laboratory to Isthmin-1 or insulin and looked for phosphates on all their proteins. This revealed that only 53% of the proteins Isthmin-1 modifies are also altered by insulin. Of the proteins unique to Isthmin-1, several had known roles in making and maintaining proteins in muscle cells.</p><p>To understand more about the role of this newly discovered pathway, Zhao et al. genetically engineered mice to lack the gene that codes for Isthmin-1. This decreased the size and strength of the mice‚Äôs muscle fibers and reduced the signals that normally lead to skeletal muscle growth.</p><p>These findings suggest that Isthmin-1 regulates skeletal muscle size via a metabolic pathway that is slightly different to the one activated by insulin. Many metabolic disorders are associated with muscle loss, like diabetes, and this newly discovered network of proteins could further our understanding of how to prevent and treat these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research

one of the most important post-translational modifications allowing for rapid changes in cellular metabolic states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Humphrey et al., 2015</xref>). Metabolic stressors such as diabetes or fasting can lead to pronounced physiological and cellular adaptations in protein regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Powers et al., 2009</xref>). Consequently, pathological conditions can result in muscle atrophy, a net loss of muscle mass, which is highly associated with morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jackman and Kandarian, 2004</xref>). Muscle strength is reduced in individuals with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Park et al., 2007</xref>), and muscle weakness is even a diagnostic predictor of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peterson et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanisms underlying this association have remained elusive, but it is plausible that factors derived from adipose tissue can contribute to muscle proteostasis. Identifying such molecular triggers of muscle metabolism could facilitate our efforts to develop pharmacological agents that improve muscle function and systemic metabolic health.</p><p>Skeletal muscle is the most abundant tissue in humans, representing up to half of the total mass in normal-weight individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Janssen et al., 2000</xref>). As a major organ for glycogen storage and insulin-mediated glucose uptake, skeletal muscle controls whole-body energy expenditure and nutrient homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deshmukh, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shulman et al., 1990</xref>). Importantly, skeletal muscle also acts as a protein reservoir that is highly responsive to anabolic or catabolic hormonal stimulation, including growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), both of which stimulate muscle fiber size (hypertrophy) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Velloso, 2008</xref>). Muscle mass is balanced by pathways controlling protein synthesis and protein degradation. The most well-described anabolic signaling pathway that promotes protein synthesis requires Akt/mTORC1 signaling, which robustly induces muscle hypertrophy upon stimulation by growth factors or amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Glass, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lai et al., 2004</xref>). In both flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Scanga et al., 2000</xref>) and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Edinger and Thompson, 2002</xref>), the PI3K-Akt pathway controls cell size by increasing protein synthesis at the level of translation initiation. Akt also inhibits the catabolic function of FoxO family members, which upon phosphorylation are no longer able to enter the nucleus and turn on the transcription of atrophy genes, including the E3 ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and atrogin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bodine et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodine and Baehr, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gomes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lecker et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We recently reported that the adipocyte-secreted protein isthmin-1 (Ism1) improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance by phosphorylating Akt<sup>S473</sup>, which mediates increased adipose and skeletal muscle glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Ism1</italic> adipose expression and circulating levels are elevated in mice and humans with obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruiz-Ojeda et al., 2022</xref>), suggesting that the expression is under nutrient-sensing regulatory control. Intriguingly, Ism1 administration to mice simultaneously prevents hepatic lipid accumulation while increasing protein synthesis in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>), demonstrating that Ism1 governs an anabolic pathway that is molecularly and functionally distinct from insulin. In this study, we find that Ism1 induces specific Ism1-regulated phosphoproteome changes enriched for proteins controlling protein translation, mTOR signaling, and muscle function. Furthermore, we show that Ism1 is important to maintain skeletal muscle fiber size under fasting, thereby defining a non-canonical mechanism by which Ism1 controls muscle biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphoproteomics reveals overlapping and distinct pathways of Ism1 and insulin</title><p>The PI3K-Akt pathway is a key pathway of convergence for ligands that activate receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Humphrey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). We recently identified Ism1 as an adipose-secreted protein that increases glucose uptake into fat and muscle by potently activating PI3K-Akt signaling across a range of mouse and human cell types, but unlike insulin, does not induce de novo lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, the extent to which the entire Ism1-signaling network overlaps with insulin or whether other signaling nodes are involved remains to be determined. Therefore, to increase our understanding of the signaling divergence and obtain an unbiased, more complete view of the Ism1-induced signaling network, we performed phosphoproteomics in the Ism1 and insulin-responsive 3T3-F442A cells. To characterize the Ism1-induced phospho-signaling profile after acute treatment in cells, we used phosphopeptide enrichment with TiO<sub>2</sub> followed by LC-MS/MS using Orbitrap Elite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Cells were starved overnight, followed by a 5 min treatment with 100 nM recombinant Ism1, or 100 nM insulin. As a negative control, bovine serum albumin (BSA), a secreted protein in the same size range as Ism1, was used at 100 nM. Although pAkt <sup>S473</sup> induction was more pronounced by insulin, we observed robust activation of pAkt <sup>S473</sup> 5 min post-treatment with Ism1, and therefore selected this time point for our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The proteomic experiments were performed in treatment groups of six biological replicates, after which the pooled cells were divided into two technical replicates for the proteomics analysis. In total, ~7700 raw MS precursor ions (peptides) were acquired, resulting in the identification of unique phosphopeptides on &gt;5000 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

Based on the notion that Ism1 causes alterations in phosphorylation of a subset of proteins, while another subset is shared with insulin, we next used Gene Ontology (GO) analysis to discern cellular signaling pathways associated with Ism1 or insulin. While Ism1 and insulin share the majority of phosphopeptides for detected genes annotated to these GO terms, some phosphorylated residues could only be identified in one condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we analyzed to which extent the phosphorylation patterns overlapped between the Ism1 and insulin for genes belonging to the GO terms ‚ÄòGO:0008286, insulin receptor signaling,‚Äô ‚ÄòGO:0038201, TOR complex,‚Äô and GO terms including the word ‚Äòmuscle‚Äô (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Interestingly, we find that Ism1 exclusively alters the phosphorylation status of proteins involved in the mTOR complex and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These overlapping and distinct signaling nodes may reflect the signaling networks underlying the cell-specific responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phospho-specific mapping identifies an Ism1-induced signature consistent with protein translation and muscle function</title><p>To interrogate the Ism1-specific signal transduction pathway in more detail, we compared the overlapping phosphopeptides clustered by functional GO pathway groups. Expectedly, insulin induces robust phosphorylation of a subset of proteins, including the insulin receptor (IR). This phosphoproteomic mapping shows that Ism1 does not induce the exact same targets in the insulin pathway as insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), which is entirely consistent with our previous study using phospho-tyrosine antibodies for the IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). For example, only insulin phosphorylates the InsR at Y1175/Y1163 while no significant phosphorylation is induced by Ism1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, Ism1 induces phosphorylation of some of the same proteins as insulin, including IR substrates Irs1 and Irs2, but with distinct phosphosite patterns. For example, Irs2 was phosphorylated at T347 by insulin but at S588 by Ism1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, Ism1 and insulin activate overlapping but distinct pathways, which may account for some of the phenotypic and cell type-specific functions of Ism1. Similar clustering for the mTOR and muscle pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>) revealed several proteins regulated only by insulin or only by Ism1. Insulin induces phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 (Rps6), a regulator of protein synthesis downstream of mTOR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>), while Ism1 inhibits Rps6<sup>S236</sup> and Rps6<sup>S240</sup> phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). While the function of these specific phosphosites of Rps6 is understudied, our data suggest a direct regulation of mTOR activity, potentially functionally distinct from insulin. Furthermore, Ism1 induced phosphorylation of several proteins shown to regulate muscle growth and fiber size, such as adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)<sup>S1040</sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parisi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), supervillin (Svil)<sup>S220</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hedberg-Oldfors et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>)<italic>,</italic> and FGF-receptor substrate 2 (Frs2)<sup>S327</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Friesel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Frs2 is also a lipid-anchored adapter protein and downstream mediator of signaling of multiple RTKs supporting the existence of a distinct Ism1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). As protein translation is a critical downstream target of mTOR and functionally controls muscle growth, we next investigated the regulation of ribosomal targets that catalyze protein synthesis. Interestingly, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit A (Eif3), a complex-subunit playing a major role in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2022</xref>), was phosphorylated by insulin but not Ism1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), while 60S ribosomal protein L12 (Rpl13) at S77 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>) and 40S ribosomal protein S13-1 (Rps13a) at S237 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>) and Rps3a at S238 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>) were entirely dephosphorylated by both Ism1 and insulin. Lastly, ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha-5 (Rps6ka5), a known mTOR substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chauvin et al., 2014</xref>). was phosphorylated by both Ism1 and insulin at S375 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N</xref>).

In differentiated C2C12 myotubes, Ism1 induces phosphorylation of Akt<sup>S473</sup> and ribosomal S6<sup>S235/S236</sup> starting at 5 min and remaining up to 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The effect of Ism1 on Akt signaling is robust but lower than that of the skeletal muscle hypertrophy hormone insulin-like growth factor-1 (Igf1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Similarly, undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts are also responsive to Ism1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Notably, Ism1 treatment induced a 2.5-fold increase in protein synthesis as determined by [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine incorporation into proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). As expected, Igf1 treatment resulted in a threefold induction in protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), and the combined Igf1 and Ism1 treatment did not induce protein synthesis further, suggesting that the maximal capacity of protein synthesis has been reached under these conditions. Previous data showed that mTORC1/2 inhibition with rapamycin inhibits Ism1-induced signaling in 3T3-F442A cells, demonstrating that intact mTOR activity is required for the signaling capacity of Ism1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, low-dose rapamycin also inhibits Ism1-induced protein synthesis, establishing that the functional effects are directly linked to the signaling cascade induced by Ism1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These data align with the inhibitory effects of rapamycin on muscle hypertrophy during anabolic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallafacchina et al., 2002</xref>).

However, there is still a need to identify other hormonal and physiological insulin/IGF-1 independent activators of Akt to avoid associated side effects such as hypoglycemia when used therapeutically. We previously identified Ism1 as a secreted protein that activates Akt in multiple cell types, including human skeletal muscle cells. Using radiolabeled glucose, we also showed that Ism1 increases glucose transport into both adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). Several lines of evidence from this study suggest that Ism1 also has an important anabolic role in promoting skeletal muscle growth. Most importantly, Ism1 acts directly on muscle cells to induce protein synthesis. Conversely, <italic>Ism1</italic> ablation leads to lower skeletal muscle fiber size and atrophy associated with lower Akt signaling and protein synthesis. <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice have elevated levels of FoxO1 target genes consistent with increased protein degradation. Therefore, Ism1 appears to be an important protein regulating metabolism during fed and fasted conditions.</p><p>Ism1-induced signaling is not simply an activation of the identical insulin/IGF-1-induced PI3K- Akt pathway. Across multiple cell types, Ism1 and insulin share the pAkt and pS6 network but are seemingly segregated by the more robust activation of pAkt<sup>S473</sup> seen with insulin, whereas Ism1 induces only a subset of shared Akt-induced insulin targets. Interestingly, while Ism1 does not directly phosphorylate the IR/IGFRs, Ism1 does induce phosphorylation of the IR substrate proteins (Irs), a feature that is shared with other endocrine hormones. This phosphospecific regulation by distinct hormones can result in a diverse range of functional outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yenush and White, 1997</xref>). For example, Irs1 phosphorylation at S302, S307, S522, and S636/639 have been linked to insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Um et al., 2004</xref>), but not all hormones that phosphorylate those Irs sites induce insulin resistance, including FGF21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Minard et al., 2016</xref>). These overlapping but distinct pathways may account for the Ism1‚Äôs cell type-specific functional outcomes and downstream transcriptional effects unique to Ism1. Additionally, the phosphoproteomic mapping shows a distinct muscle signature specifically induced by Ism1 and not by insulin. Among Ism1 downstream targets, we find phosphorylation of proteins related to the mTOR pathway, ribosomal and muscle function, targets not previously identified downstream of Ism1.</p><p>In this work, we observe a 60% decrease in pAkt<sup>S473</sup> levels in the muscles of <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice, which leads to an ~10% reduction in muscle protein content. Our data is consistent with previous reports using muscle-specific <italic>Akt</italic>-KO mice that demonstrate a 40% reduction in protein synthesis upon complete ablation of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaiswal et al., 2022</xref>). Furthermore, reduced Akt is associated with skeletal muscle insulin resistance, in line with our previous observation that <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice fed a high-fat diet are more insulin resistant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>). To what extent the insulin resistance in the <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice contributes to muscle function in obesity or during aging is an intriguing question that remains to be answered in future work. Moreover, increasing protein synthesis while suppressing protein degradation is important in a physiological setting, based on the findings that only a combination of FoxO1 inhibition and mTORC1 activation can restore Akt-mediated muscle loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jaiswal et al., 2022</xref>). This suggests that hormonal regulators of Akt activity could have important biological functions because of Akt‚Äôs dual role in regulating mTORC1 and the FoxO genes. Here, we used genetic and pharmacological approaches to determine the role of Ism1 in regulating protein synthesis, but it remains to be explored whether pharmacological Ism1 administration prevents protein degradation in the skeletal muscle. Additionally, upon muscle hypertrophy, activated muscle precursors or satellite cells provide an additional mechanism for muscle expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawke and Garry, 2001</xref>). A limitation of this study is that we did not investigate whether Ism1 affects muscle regeneration. As IGF-1 induces the growth and differentiation of satellite cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Musar√≤ et al., 1999</xref>), and HGF induces activation of cell cycle G<sub>Alert</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rodgers et al., 2017</xref>), it will be interesting to determine whether Ism1 also activates skeletal muscle stem cells. Identifying all physiological mechanisms that distinguish Ism1 from IGF-1 will aid in understanding whether other yet unidentified pathways distinct from Akt and FoxO regulate proteostasis.</p><p>The physiological function of Ism1 in regulating muscle growth is expected given that Ism1 stimulates Akt, but it was somewhat unexpected that the lower muscle protein content and fiber size did not lead to a significant loss of muscle mass. Femur length is a basic biometric parameter used to assess longitudinal growth. Femur length and total body weights did not differ between WT and <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice, suggesting that the decrease in muscle fiber size is likely not due to growth reduction. It remains to be determined what replaces protein mass in the muscle of <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice, including water, glycogen stores, or lipids, which could be regulated by Ism1. Further studies using larger sample sizes are needed to determine whether the effects of Ism1 on muscle proteostasis are specific to fiber types and locations. Notably, <italic>Ism1</italic> itself is not expressed in muscle cells but only in other cells, including adipocytes and immune cells. Circulating levels of human Ism1 using immunoreactive ELISAs have been reported to be in the range of 1‚Äì50 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruiz-Ojeda et al., 2022</xref>), consistent with mass spectrometry peptide analysis that estimates a circulating Ism1 concentration of 17 ng/ml (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Uhl√©n et al., 2019</xref>). The necessary circulating and local Ism1 levels to maintain muscle fiber size or prevent fasting-induced muscle loss remain to be determined. It is plausible that Ism1 levels are altered in response to fasting and feeding, insulin resistance, or aging ‚Äì conditions associated with temporary or chronic muscle loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laurens et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Perry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roubenoff and Castaneda, 2001</xref>). As this study was conducted in male mice only, it is unknown whether Ism1 deficiency results in any muscle phenotype in female mice. Further studies are required to test whether Ism1 regulates muscle proteostasis in a sex-specific manner. A limitation of this study is that fasting but not more severe atrophy conditions were studied. Long-term studies ought to explore whether pharmacological administration of Ism1 systemically or locally into the muscle is sufficient to induce muscle hypertrophy or prevent muscle loss in more severe models of muscle loss. Nevertheless, as aging impairs skeletal muscle protein synthesis and leads to muscle weakness and atrophy, this work has implications for multiple conditions, including diabetes- and age-induced muscle atrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal studies</title><p>Animal experiments were performed per procedures approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Stanford Animal Care and Use Committee (APLAC) protocol number #32982.

Briefly, protein extracts were alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin at a ratio of 1:50 (w/w) trypsin to protein. Tryptic phosphopeptides were enriched by TiO<sub>2</sub>-immobilized metal affinity chromatography, washed with 70% (v/v) EtOH, and equilibrated in 1% NH<sub>4</sub>OH and three times in 1 M glycolic acid in 80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Peptides were eluted and dried in a SpeedVac concentrator. Peptides were resuspended in 3% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and twice in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Dried peptides were dissolved in LC-MS/MS solvent (3% acetonitrile and 0.1% fluoroacetic acid) prior to LC-MS/MS analysis using a dual-pressure linear ion trap (Velos Pro) with a high-field Orbitrap mass analyzer as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yue et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>) using MaxQuant to analyze raw spectrometry data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phosphoproteomic analysis</title><p>Data acquired on the Orbitrap were searched against a UniProt <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein database using TDPortal as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fornelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Annotations were extracted from UniProtKB, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Bioinformatics analyses including hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis, and annotation enrichment were performed with R v4.1.1 using the DEP package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) employing filtering of phosphopeptides identified in less than one-third of samples, variance stabilization for normalization, and maximal reduction of variation between replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huber et al., 2002</xref>) and imputation. Tests for significance were based on limma, which have a higher sensitivity compared to other algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Ooijen et al., 2018</xref>). To achieve a normal distribution, we log2 transformed data after normalization. Missing data, which due to matrix effects are common to proteomics data, were not missing at random; we therefore tested conclusions using the MinProb, man, and QRILC imputation methods appropriate for left censored data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazar et al., 2016</xref>). For all analyses, we used the MinProb algorithm as it yielded the lowest number of significant phosphopeptides while retaining large overlap with the two other methods. Since imputation is non-deterministic, in a minority of cases the IR would not be significantly phosphorylated by insulin. To minimize random effects of imputation, we performed 200 permutations of imputations and testing for significance followed by calculation of the median p-value. Using this algorithm, the IR was consistently found to be phosphorylated by insulin versus BSA, and running the algorithm repeatedly only results in changes to conclusions for 2‚Äì3 phosphosites. Pathway enrichment was analyzed using the TopGO package using the classic Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexa and Rahnenfuhrer, 2010</xref>, topGO: Enrichment Analysis for Gene Ontology. R package version 2.48.0). To calculate the significance between proteomic samples with a sample size of 2, we used the DEP package. The DEP package employs limma for statistical testing. This package uses the <italic>t</italic>-test except that the standard errors have been moderated across genes, that is, shrunk toward a common value, using a simple Bayesian model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Ooijen et al., 2018</xref>). The assumptions for limma are that the data are normally distributed and equal variance between replicates. These assumptions were met after normalization and log2 transformation. For the proteomics analysis, we calculated the significance based on imputed values. Zeros were more abundant for phosphopeptides with an overall low intensity across the samples. Therefore, the choice of imputation method was based on data missing not at random (MNAR). We tested three imputation methods and continued with the one resulting in the lowest number of significant phosphopeptides retaining a relatively large overlap with other imputation methods. In cases where phosphorylation was displayed as zero, the intensity was zero in the raw dataset. We applied semantic similarity analysis between GO terms followed by principal coordinates analysis to cluster and visualize enrichments. Unless otherwise stated, individual comparisons between conditions across phosphopeptides were performed using empirical Bayes statistics followed by adjustment for multiple testing with p-values of *&lt;0.05, **&lt;0.01, and ***&lt;0.001 to be considered significant. The minimum normalized intensity across the dataset was subtracted from each normalized data point, and phosphorylation was calculated as a fraction of the maximum value of all samples for each phosphopeptide. Plotted GO terms have p-values &lt;0.01 calculated using the classic Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov test. The distribution diagram of shared and unique phosphosites was obtained by retrieving the selected GO pathways for peptides detected in at least one sample between treatments. Specific details on the significance of each test are described in the figure legends.

Sections from muscles were fixed using 4% PFA, permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, blocked using 1% BSA in PBS, and incubated with anti-laminin antibody (Millipore, clone A5, Cat# 05-206, 1:200) and then with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (#A11007, Invitrogen, 1:1000). Nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst (#33342, Thermo Fisher, 1:1000). Images were acquired using a confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP8) at 63√ó. For hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining, slides were stained with hematoxylin for 3 min, washed with water and 95% ethanol, and stained with eosin for 30 min. Sections were then washed with ethanol and xylene, and mounted with mounting medium. The tissue slides were observed with a Nikon 80i upright light microscope using a √ó20 objective lens. Digital images were captured with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-Fi1 color camera and NIS-Elements acquisition software. Muscle fiber sizes for the pectoralis, quadriceps, soleus, gastrocnemius, and tibialis muscle tissues were determined by measuring cross-sectional area (Œºm<sup>2</sup>) using the Image J (version 1.53e) software. The muscle fibers were manually outlined to obtain their measurement data. Blind scoring by two independent investigators of the muscle tissues was done to unbiasedly collect data for all categories of mice. The quantification of the average muscle fiber area was performed using n = 3 independent muscle tissues from each genotype, with 2‚Äì4 photos taken from each muscle tissue. Approximately 60‚Äì100 myofibers were quantified per image, and average area values were calculated for each image. Statistically significant differences were determined using two-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Indirect calorimetry, food intake, and physiological measurements</title><p>Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>), RER, movement, and food intake in 8-to-12-week-old WT and <italic>Ism1</italic>-KO mice were measured using the environment-controlled home-cage CLAMS system (Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH) at the Stanford Diabetes Research Center.

which muscle size, strength, and metabolism are regulated. Effects of the protein Ism1, which is released by adipocytes and immune cells, on the phosphoproteome were compared and contrasted to those of insulin revealing overlapping though distinct signaling pathways. Ism1 was also shown to determine skeletal muscle size and strength.

While there is some enthusiasm for this novel mechanism regulating aspects of muscle health and function, there are some concerns addressed below. I hope the authors do not find the following as negative critiques but rather supportive feedback as the underlying mechanism is quite interesting.</p><p>Major limitations</p><p>‚Äì The varying number of animals per study is kind of confusing, as some activity/metabolic cage data have 4 animals (Figure 4A/B), some molecular work has 3 (Figure 5E) or 5 animals (Figure 5G) grip strength has 15 (Figure 4G), but body weight data only has 3 (Figure 4B). It may just be the way the data are worded and presented. Individual data points on the bar charts would clear this up immediately. In Figure 4 for example, n=3/group but then it is reported that the experiment was repeated using two independent cohorts of mice (line 317). So does n=6? Additionally, methods state animal experiments were sex- and age-matched but only used male mice (line 498). If only male mice were used, what is the justification for excluding female mice from these studies?</p><p>‚Äì Having only 3 mice per experiment highlights difficulties in interpreting myofiber data. No change in muscle weight weights but myofiber atrophy of only the quad. However, the gastrocnemius fiber size increases by ~20% while the quadriceps has a substantial reduction in fiber size. I don't think the conclusion in line 302 can be interpreted from this data. Ism1 leads to reductions in quad fiber size, yes, but not other muscles. What is unique about the quad for Ism1? Or upper limb function with reduced grip strength?</p><p>‚Äì Confirming Ism1 doesn't alter canonical IRS phosphorylation sites in your animal model would be very useful. Since Akt S473 is an mTOR target and the cell work shows Ism1-induced protein synthesis is dependent on mTOR, Ism1-KO validation of normal IRS phosphorylation would highlight the distinct nature of Ism1.</p><p>Moderate limitations</p><p>‚Äì While fully understanding the limitations of using cells and the necessity of pooling to get sufficient yield for phosphoproteomics, I have some modest concerns regarding the complete lack of signal in some samples for 2B/E/G. Since phosphorylation state has important biological differences, being completely dephosphorylated in the pooled sample compared to another can have major implications in interpretation. For 2E for example, is TSC2 S1806 completely dephosphorylated by Ism1 or does it have no effect compared to BSA? Regardless of whether this occurred due to the normalization process and is something like a scaling error, some justification for including these and assuming the mean is an appropriate value would be appreciated, even for these early exploratory data.</p><p>‚Äì Figure 4. Myofiber atrophy is a primary way muscles may lose their mass but also global KO of Ism1 may alter myofiber number, which with the effects of Ism1 on myoblasts, suggests potential developmental roles. Lastly, while the quadriceps/TA/GST is perfectly representative muscle groups to study, they are largely fast-twitch, heavily type IIx/b muscles. Investigations into the soleus or other oxidative muscle would provide information regarding fiber type specificity for mechanisms of action.</p><p>‚Äì Line 324 Ism1 causes quad myofiber atrophy, not muscle atrophy. And if the marker is myofiber atrophy in the quad, then a 50% reduction in myofiber size as shown in 4F should be considered severe atrophy, not mild.</p><p>‚Äì Please confirm body mass for 8 wk old animals used for 4B as 30 g would be quite unexpected for an 8 wk old male mouse in my experience.</p><p>‚Äì No catabolic cell signaling was investigated. While gene markers are understandable and perfectly reasonable, protein level examination of Foxo phosphorylation or other marker associated with muscle atrophy would strongly complement the pAkt/mTOR/S6 data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Analysis of Ism1 KO mice revealed a decrease in muscle size (muscle atrophy), but it is unclear whether Ism1 causes muscle hypertrophy. The title and discussion may be overstating somewhat, so I think it is better to reorganize what can be stated from the data.</p><p>Since the KO mice used by the author lack Ism1 systemically from birth, whether the decrease in muscle size results from its action on skeletal muscle is unclear. Is there a possibility of a reduction in growth?</p><p>Quantification of muscle size is one of the most important data in this study. It was difficult to distinguish the muscle size difference between control and Ism1 KO mice in the photo shown in Figure 4D. The muscle size was quantified using 2-4 photographs taken with a 20√ó objective lens, but there is concern about whether this is sufficient for accurate measurement since the muscle size differs depending on the region and muscle fiber type. In addition, it is recommended to stain the periphery of cells with laminin or dystrophin to quantify muscle size.</p><p>I am concerned that the number of samples is small overall. I have never done phosphoproteomics, but I am unsure whether n = 2 is suitable for statistical analysis.</p><p>Line 334-338: Myh 1, 2, 4, and 7 are muscle fiber type markers rather than differentiation markers, so it should be mentioned whether the muscle fiber type has changed.</p><p>Line 381: The word &quot;muscle function&quot; is vague, so I think it would be better to rewrite it as a more specific term such as &quot;muscle strength.&quot;</p><p>Line 381: No data is shown that suggests lsm1 is a &quot;circulating&quot; regulator.</p><p>Line 378-38: The same sentence is duplicated.</p><p>Line 429: &quot;Ism1-induced muscle hypertrophy&quot; is not shown in the data. To state this, it would be necessary to perform experiments in which Ism1 is administered or overexpressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80014.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please rephrase conclusions regarding the effects of the knockout on myofiber size to present a more cautious interpretation of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rephrased the conclusions to describe that Ism1 deficiency causes myofiber atrophy instead of muscle atrophy.

We used the variance stabilization normalization (vsn) of the data, as it has been shown to reduce variation most effectively between technical replicates (https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/19/1/1/2562889). Upon reviewer‚Äôs request, we reevaluated our normalization. We found that normalization using log2 yielded a more linear qqplot, but did not reduce variation between technical replicates. Normalization using vsn followed by transformation using log2 resulted in a more linear qqplot while retaining low variation between technical replicates. Thus, and log2 transformation following normalization resulted in normally distributed data whereas vsn normalization alone deviated from normality. We therefore reanalyzed our data using normalization followed by log2 transformation of the data. Log2 transformation of the data did not change the conclusions relating to barplots in the main manuscript, except for minor changes in significance levels in Figure 2. Also, the number of significant phosphosites increased slightly from 202 to 221 for differences between BSA and ISM1 (see adjusted supplementary table ‚ÄúFigure_1_source_data_1‚Äù). With the exception of Prrc2c<sup>S899</sup>¬†and Trim56<sup>S450</sup>, all phosphopeptides previously identified as significantly different between BSA and ISM1 were retained.</p><p>The documentation for the DEP package suggests filtering the data before testing for significance. We have not been able to find any benchmark for the use of different filters in the literature. Nevertheless, we reviewed the use of a filter for data preprocessing. The filters suggested at the time of data analysis were: (1) keeping peptides identified in all replicates of one condition or (2) keeping peptides identified in two out of three replicates of at least one condition. As we have a sample size of two, as phosphoproteomics is intrinsically sparse, and as the DEP package was made for proteomics and not specifically phosphoproteomics, we considered that filtering would miss valuable information without increasing number of significant peptides. Applying a filter keeping peptides identified in both replicates of one condition only marginally increased the total number of significant proteins. In conjunction with the reevaluation of our data analyses, we revisited the DEP package pipeline and found that it had been updated with less restrictive filters. We tested different filters and found that removing phosphopeptides present in less than 1/3 of samples yielded the highest number of significant differences after adjustment of multiple testing. Comparing BSA to ISM1 we found 297 significant differences in phosphorylation after filtration (see revised supplementary table ‚ÄúFigure_1_source_data_1‚Äù).</p><p>Next, we reevaluated at the GO terms we included for use in figure. We anticipated that including more goterms including the term ‚ÄúTOR‚Äù would yield other phosphosites related to mTOR. We therefore included GO terms including ‚ÄúMTORC1‚Äù and ‚ÄúMTORC2‚Äù besides ‚ÄúTOR‚Äù in the description. This yielded 6 more phosphosites related to mTOR uniquely phosphorylated by ISM (see revised figure 1F) and three new phosphosites with significant differences in phosphorylation between Ism1 and insulin. This included Fnip1<sup>S945</sup>, Rps6<sup>S236 &amp; S240</sup>. We replaced Figure 2E-F with the phosphosites for Rps6 which we find is more in relevant given the increased protein synthesis by Ism1.</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we have adjusted the supplementary tables and figures 1E 2A, 2C and 2D to include the added mTOR GO terms. We have changed figures 2I-P using filtering and log2 transformation before imputation and testing. Figure 2E-H were replaced after including additional mTOR GO terms. We have also inserted references in the methods section and changed the text in order to justify the choice of statistics. Importantly, the new analysis results in the same pathways regulated by Ism1.</p><p>The following additions have been made to the Methods section for phosphoproteomics analysis:</p><p>Line 417 ‚Äì Data acquired on the Orbitrap were searched against a Uniprot <italic>Mus musculus</italic> protein database using TDPortal as previously described (Fornelli et al., 2017; Tyanova et al., 2016). Annotations were extracted from UniProtKB, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Bioinformatics analyses including hierarchical clustering, pathway analysis and annotation enrichment were performed with R v4.1.1 using the DEP package (Zhang et al., 2018) employing filtering of phosphopeptides identified in less than one third of samples, variance stabilization for normalization and maximal reduction of variation between replicates (Huber et al., 2002) and imputation. Tests for significance were based on limma which have a higher sensitivity compared to other algorithms (van Ooijen et al., 2018). To achieve a normal distribution, we log2 transformed data after normalization. Missing data, which due to matrix effects is common to proteomics data were not missing at random, we therefore tested conclusions using the MinProb, man, and QRILC imputation methods appropriate for left censored data (Lazar et al., 2016). For all analyzes, we used the MinProb algorithm as it yielded the lowest number of significant phosphopeptides while retaining large overlap with the two other methods. Since imputation is non-deterministic, in a minority of cases the insulin receptor would not be significantly phosphorylated by insulin. To minimize random effects of imputation we performed 200 permutations of imputations and testing for significance followed by calculation of the median p-value. Using this algorithm, the insulin receptor was consistently found to be phosphorylated by insulin versus BSA, and running the algorithm repeatedly only result in changed to conclusions for 2-3 phosphosites. Pathway enrichment was analyzed using the TopGO package using the classic Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Alexa A, Rahnenfuhrer J (2022). topGO: Enrichment Analysis for Gene Ontology. R package version 2.48.0.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I congratulate the authors for their hard work and innovative study.

Since phosphorylation state has important biological differences, being completely dephosphorylated in the pooled sample compared to another can have major implications in interpretation. For 2E for example, is TSC2 S1806 completely dephosphorylated by Ism1 or does it have no effect compared to BSA? Regardless of whether this occurred due to the normalization process and is something like a scaling error, some justification for including these and assuming the mean is an appropriate value would be appreciated, even for these early exploratory data.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully understand the reviewer‚Äôs concern. Missing values which are common to proteomics data can either mean that a peptide was not identified or that it was masked by other peptides in the search space. Zeros were more abundant for phosphopeptides with a low intensity. Thus, the true biological value is likely to be low. We calculated significance based on imputed values, and this is what the asterisks in the barplots are based upon.¬†In the cases where phosphorylation was displayed as zero (such as for Figure 2B/E/G) the intensity was zero in the raw dataset. MaxQuant which was used to analyze the phosphoproteomics dataset sets a missing value to zero intensity. Therefore, the normalization in the DEP package interprets zero intensity as ¬¥missing¬¥.</p><p>In response to reviewers‚Äô question, we have now better explained the choice of imputation method used for significance testing. We tested algorithms based on the structure of the missing data. Data were not missing at random and left censored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We sought to be somewhat conservative in our estimate of significant phosphopeptides.

To calculate the significance, we have used the DEP package that employs limma. We agree that a sample size of two is small. However, there is no lower limit for sample size when using this type of t-test and a sample size of 2 can therefore technically be used. A previous proteomics report indicates that limma accurately estimates significant peptides even at n=2 (van Ooijen et al., 2018). While a larger sample size would be ideal, we do not believe a higher sample size would have changed the results significantly. In¬†many¬†cases signal was completely missing in both replicates of one condition. In such cases, adding another replicate would likely lead to another missing value. Moreover, the number of significant peptides only saturates at a sample size between nine and fifteen.
