by short stature, skeletal deformities, low bone mass, and motor deficits. A subset of OI patients also present with joint hypermobility; however, the role of tendon dysfunction in OI pathogenesis is largely unknown. Using the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model of severe, recessive OI, we found that mutant Achilles and patellar tendons were thinner and weaker with increased collagen cross-links and reduced collagen fibril size at 1- and 4-months compared to wildtype. Patellar tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also had altered numbers of CD146<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> and CD146<sup>-</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> progenitor-like cells at skeletal maturity. RNA-seq analysis of Achilles and patellar tendons from 1-month <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice revealed dysregulation in matrix and tendon marker gene expression concomitant with predicted alterations in TGF-β, inflammatory, and metabolic signaling. At 4-months, <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed increased αSMA, MMP2, and phospho-NFκB staining in the patellar tendon consistent with excess matrix remodeling and tissue inflammation.

The extracellular matrix of tendons/ligaments is primarily composed of type I collagen as well as smaller quantities of other collagens and proteoglycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kannus, 2000</xref>). During development, the collagen fibrils in tendons and ligaments develop through addition and lengthening before transitioning to the appositional fusion of existing fibers with continued lengthening in postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). The synthesis and assembly of this collagen-rich matrix are influenced by other minor collagens and proteoglycans as well as by the cross-linking chemistry of type I procollagen fibrils, which in turn regulates fibril size and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saito and Marumo, 2010</xref>). Like tendon and ligament, the organic matrix of bone consists largely of type I collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alford et al., 2015</xref>), and disruptions in collagen synthesis and folding are known to negatively impact its biochemical and mechanical properties in connective tissue diseases such as Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2017a</xref>). However, despite evidence of joint mobility phenotypes and motor deficits in OI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arponen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Primorac et al., 2014</xref>), tendon and ligament phenotypes in this disease are relatively understudied.</p><p>OI is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by variable short stature, skeletal deformities, low bone mass, and increased bone fragility. Approximately 80% of OI cases are caused by dominantly inherited mutations in the genes encoding the α1(I) or α2(I) chains of type I collagen. Mutations in genes responsible for the synthesis, post-translational modification, and processing of collagen, such as cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP), lead to severe, recessive forms of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lim et al., 2017a</xref>). In addition to skeletal defects, other connective tissue manifestations, including joint hypermobility and skin hyperlaxity, are observed in a subset of OI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arponen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Primorac et al., 2014</xref>). Our and others’ studies have shown that CRTAP forms a complex with Prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (<italic>P3h1</italic>) and Cyclophilin B (CypB, encoded by <italic>Ppib</italic>) and is required for prolyl 3-hydroxylation of type I procollagen at Pro986 of chain α1(I) and Pro707 of chain α2(I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson and Eyre, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baldridge et al., 2008</xref>). In this regard, loss of either CRTAP or P3H1 leads to loss of this complex and its activity, causing a severe recessive form of OI characterized by short stature and brittle bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabral et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). Collagen isolated from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is characterized by lysine over-modifications and abnormal fibril diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabral et al., 2007</xref>). While a comprehensive analysis of <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice has revealed multiple connective tissue abnormalities, including in bones, lungs, kidneys, and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge et al., 2010;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grafe et al., 2014</xref>), the impact of the loss of CRTAP on tendons and ligaments remains unknown.</p><p>Alterations in collagen fibril size and cross-linking have been noted in a limited number of studies using dominant or recessive mouse models of OI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vranka et al., 2010</xref>); however, whether loss of CRTAP impacts tendon and ligament development and structure remains unknown. In this study, we show that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have weaker and thinner Achilles and patellar tendons at 1 and 4 months-of-age that are hypercellular with a reduction in tendon volume – a phenotype absent at postnatal day 10 (P10). Examining the collagen matrix, we found an increase in stable (irreversible) collagen cross-links at both timepoints, accompanied by alterations in fibril diameter at 4-months compared to wildtype controls. RNA-seq analyses revealed both shared and distinct changes in the transcriptome of the Achilles and patellar tendons of <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to wildtype with a predicted activation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and inflammatory signaling in both tissues. Changes in gene expression assessed by qRT-PCR revealed an upregulation of several tendon markers in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Achilles tendons at 1-month, including scleraxis (<italic>Scx</italic>), type I collagen α1 chain (<italic>Col1a1</italic>), lumican (<italic>Lum</italic>), tenascin-C (<italic>Tnc</italic>), and tenomodulin (<italic>Tnmd</italic>). At the same time, markers of vascularization (i.e., CD31), and collagen extracellular matrix (ECM) (i.e., type I collagen α2 chain (<italic>Col1a2</italic>), type II collagen α1 chain (<italic>Col2a1</italic>), type III collagen α1 chain (<italic>Col3a1</italic>), type IX collagen α2 chain (<italic>Col9a2</italic>)) were not different between groups. Many of these changes were also observed in our RNA-seq experiments. Consistent with the gene expression data at 1-month, 4-month-old <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed increased α smooth muscle actin (αSMA), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2), and phospho-nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) in the patellar tendon consistent with excess matrix remodeling and tissue inflammation. These changes in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons were accompanied by motor deficits and reduced strength at 4 months-of-age. In conclusion, loss of CRTAP in mice causes abnormalities in load-bearing tendons and significant behavioral impairments.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tendon structure, size, and strength are altered in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at 1- and 4-months</title><p>Mice lacking CRTAP present with growth delay, rhizomelia, and severe osteoporosis together with disruption of other connective tissues, including lung and skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge et al., 2010</xref>). To assess abnormalities in the load-bearing tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, we harvested ankle and knee joints at 1 and 4 months-of-age to histologically examine the Achilles and patellar tendons. At 1-month, <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice presented with thinner Achilles and patellar tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>) compared to wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,D</xref>) and heterozygous mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,E</xref>) with increased cell density in both structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>).

Using a more quantitative metric, we examined these mice using the grip strength test and found that while wildtype and heterozygous mice could generate approximately 1.3 N of force, mice lacking CRTAP were weaker with a mean grip strength of 0.62 N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). Thus, <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display significant reductions in strength together with perturbations in motor activity and coordination – behavioral changes that could be related in part to their tendon phenotype.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we examined the histological, ultrastructural, biochemical, and transcriptional characteristics of load-bearing tendons in the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model of severe, recessive OI. We demonstrate that at 1 and 4 months-of-age, <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> have thinner, more cellular Achilles and patellar tendons with a reduction in the CD146<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> cell pool compared to heterozygous and wild-type mice. Importantly, we did observe only slight thinning with no increased cell density in Achilles or patellar tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at P10, suggesting that the phenotype is mostly restricted to deficits in tendon maturation but not development. Examining collagen fibril organization, we found a marked alteration in collagen fibril alignment and the number of small and large fibrils in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to wildtype that varied in severity depending on the tendon being examined. Consistent with our TEM findings, we found that 1-month Achilles tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibited reduced ultimate load and linear stiffness compared to wildtype; however, the reduced structural properties could also be due to a reduction in cross-sectional area of the tendon at this age. Stable, HP cross-links were also elevated at 1- and 4-months in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to wildtype, which indicates an increase in telopeptide lysine hydroxylation and irreversible intermolecular cross-links (see below). RNA-seq analysis revealed alterations in extracellular matrix proteins, growth factor signaling, and metabolic pathways in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons compared to wildtype controls confirmed by qRT-PCR and IHC. Finally, we demonstrate that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit motor impairments concomitant with reductions in grip strength – a phenomenon that may be related to the tendon pathology and possible deficits in other musculoskeletal tissues such as muscle.</p><p>Collagen ultrastructure and cross-linking have been well-documented in the bones of mouse models for both dominant and recessive OI; however, quantitative and histological characterization of tendons in these models has been less studied. In this regard, we demonstrate that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have thinner and weaker Achilles and patellar tendons at 1- and 4-months. Despite the reduction in size and extracellular matrix, tendons from these mice are hypercellular compared to wildtype and heterozygous animals – a phenotype observed in other tissues from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, including bone, lungs, and the glomerular compartment of the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grafe et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, defects in ECM proteins such as type I collagen are correlated with changes in the proliferation and survival of surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hynes, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the pathological changes observed in load-bearing tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were accompanied by a significant reduction in CD146<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> cells. Given that CD146 has been implicated as a marker for tendon progenitor-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), we speculate that the decrease in CD146 at 5-months may indicate that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons are in a state of chronic remodeling/repair (see below). While the alterations in tendon size and cellularity may result from alterations in the collagen extracellular matrix, it could also be associated with alterations in cellular signaling. In this regard, TGF-β signaling is upregulated in bones from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grafe et al., 2014</xref>), and elevated TGF-β signaling has been noted in mouse models with increased tendon cellularity and alterations in collagen fibril distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2017b</xref>). Indeed, our RNA-seq analysis identified TGF-β signaling as an activated upstream regulator of the differential gene expression observed in the tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. We also observed significant metabolic dysregulation in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons. Interestingly, mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) knockout mouse tendons have a similar histological phenotype to those of <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2017b</xref>). These data are consistent with the principle that an altered ECM can alter cellular signaling, as previously shown for vascular tissue in Marfan syndrome and OI bone.</p><p>In addition to type I collagen, other minor collagens together with glycoproteins and SLRPs are present within tendons and regulate type I collagen self-assembly and are expressed most highly during development and repair. In the present study, we demonstrated that <italic>Crtap</italic> is expressed in load-bearing tendons and that its expression is completely ablated in tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Other than a modest reduction in <italic>Col1a1</italic>, there was no significant difference in the expression of <italic>Col3a1</italic>, which is typically increased in the early stages of tendon injury and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Juneja et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). While <italic>Col2a1</italic> and <italic>Col9a2</italic> expression were upregulated in our RNA-seq data from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> Achilles tendon, no differences were observed by qRT-PCR. Despite a lack of changes in the expression of many fibrillar collagens, we observed upregulation in the expression of <italic>Scx</italic> and various glycoproteins and SLRPs, including <italic>Tnc</italic>, <italic>Lum</italic>, <italic>Tnmd</italic>, <italic>Fn1</italic>, and <italic>Thbs3</italic>, in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Many of these markers are upregulated during tendon injury and healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Snedeker and Foolen, 2017</xref>), with <italic>Tnmd</italic> being a positive regulator of tenocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Docheva et al., 2005</xref>), elevated <italic>Fn1</italic> being a precursor for tendon ECM deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kadler et al., 2008</xref>), and <italic>Tnc</italic> expression being elevated under conditions of increased mechanical load (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiquet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiquet-Ehrismann and Tucker, 2004</xref>). Taken together, this would suggest that load-bearing <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons are immature and stuck in a process of perpetual remodeling and repair compared to wildtype controls, reminiscent of the increased remodeling observed in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bones.</p><p>In the present study, we found an increased proportion of small and large collagen fibrils in the FDL, Achilles, and patellar tendons of <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These distributions varied in severity across the three tissues, with the most significant differences observed in the patellar tendon. <italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have been reported to display an increased proportion of small collagen fibrils in tail tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vranka et al., 2010</xref>), indicating that loss of the 3-prolyl hydroxylase complex alters collagen fibrillogenesis. At the same time, the increased number of small fibers was more pronounced in tail tendons from <italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, and there was no evidence of an increased proportion of large fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vranka et al., 2010</xref>) as observed for <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in this study. Like the <italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model, mice lacking CypB also exhibit a pronounced increase in the number of small collagen fibrils within tail tendons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terajima et al., 2016</xref>). Together, this may indicate that despite forming a complex with P3h1 and CypB, loss of Crtap has distinct consequences on collagen fibrillogenesis. At the same time, it is important to note that tail tendons were used for collagen fibril distribution assessments in both <italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Ppib<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Terajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vranka et al., 2010</xref>), whereas load-bearing tendons were examined in our study. The difference in tissue type examined might also explain why we observed unique alterations in collagen fibril distribution in both heterozygous and <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. While the focus of the present study was on load-bearing tendon phenotypes and how these may relate to joint laxity and motor deficits seen in OI patients, future work examining positional tendons of the tail could also be insightful.</p><p>Type I procollagen molecules undergo post-translational modifications within the endoplasmic reticulum, including lysyl-hydroxylation and prolyl-hydroxylation, that are critical for proper collagen synthesis, transport, and stability. Specifically, telopeptide lysine hydroxylation results in mature lysyl-pyridinoline (LP) or hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HP) residues after lysyl oxidase oxidation, which as permanent, irreversible crosslinks play a role in regulating fibril growth and strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyre, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bateman et al., 2009</xref>). Previous literature has demonstrated that loss of the 3-prolyl hydroxylase complex caused by loss of P3H1 (<italic>P3h1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) or CRTAP (<italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic>) prevents prolyl 3-hydroxylation of clade A (type I, II, and III) collagens and can lead to changes in lysine post-translational modifications due to loss of its chaperone function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hudson and Eyre, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morello et al., 2006</xref>). In this study, we found that mature collagen cross-links (HP residues per collagen) are markedly increased in the FDL, Achilles, and patellar tendons of <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice relative to wildtype. This contrasts that seen in bones from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, where there is no change in HP residues per collagen compared to wildtype. Instead, an increase in the ratio of LP/HP is observed along with a complete lack of 3-hydroxylation of Pro 986 in the chains of type I collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grafe et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we observed increased cross-links in the Achilles, but not FDL or patellar tendons of 1-month-old heterozygous mice, indicating a mild haploinsufficient effect of CRTAP on this tendon biochemical property, thereby suggesting a rate-limited contribution of this complex in this function. Outside of the genotype-specific effects, we saw an age-dependent increase in HP residues per collagen in all genotypes. This observation is consistent with a study by Taga and colleagues that reported an increase in 3-hydroxyproline residues in rat tendon collagen (but not bone or skin) that plateaued at 3 months-of-age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Taga et al., 2016</xref>). Together with the TEM analyses, these data suggest that altered collagen cross-linking in tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may adversely affect collagen fibril assembly.</p><p>In addition to skeletal deformities and frequent fractures, severe OI is associated with motor impairments, including gait abnormalities, chronic pain, and reduced muscle strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arponen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Primorac et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garman et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we showed that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice exhibit reduced horizontal and vertical motor activity using the open field assay and reduced motor coordination and endurance using the rotarod and grid foot slip assays. We also observed a reduction in latency to fall on the inverted grid assay mirrored by a dramatic loss of grip strength compared to heterozygous and wildtype mice. These results are consistent with findings reported for the <italic>Col1a1<sup>Jrt/+</sup></italic> mouse model of severe OI and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, Abdelaziz and colleagues found that <italic>Col1a1<sup>Jrt/+</sup></italic> mice displayed reduced motor activity using the open field and running wheel assays – a phenotype they attributed to thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelaziz et al., 2015</xref>). While the reduced vertical activity may indicate a pain or spinal phenotype, changes in motor coordination and grip strength in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice are likely more related to deficits in the muscle-tendon unit. Indeed, muscle dysfunction has been noted in OI patients and various preclinical mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gremminger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Veilleux et al., 2017</xref>). Unfortunately, given only a global <italic>Crtap</italic> knockout mouse line was used here, understanding the contribution of muscle independent of the tendon is complex and needs further study. Despite these limitations, our study describes the most comprehensive characterization of motor and strength deficits in a mouse model of severe, recessive OI to date, providing a useful set of functional outputs with which to evaluate future therapeutics or to interrogate the role of tendon and other musculoskeletal tissues in motor function.</p><p>Taken together, this study provides the first evidence for load-bearing tendon phenotypes in the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model of severe, recessive OI. We also provide compelling evidence for a strong motor activity and coordination phenotype in these mice. As the quality of life is so impacted in patients with OI, a more comprehensive evaluation of behavioral outcomes in future preclinical studies may provide important insights into the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Crtap<sup>tm1Brle</sup></td><td valign="top">B.

Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (TreeStar, OR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Phase-contrast μCT imaging and analysis</title><p>To quantify tendon and articular cartilage volume, knee joints were dissected from mice, stained with contrast agents, and scanned by phase-contrast μCT. The articular cartilage volume and surface were analyzed using TriBON software (RATOC, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nixon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ruan et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruan et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stone et al., 2019</xref>). Using this technique, we quantified the patellar tendon volume by examining knee joints in transverse where the patellar tendon boundary was easily distinguished from the joint capsule. Tendon volume was assessed from its origin within the patella to its insertion at the tibia.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Transmission electron microscopy analysis of collagen fibril size</title><p>Mouse ankle and knee joints were dissected and fixed in fresh 1.5% glutaraldehyde/1.5% PFA (Tousimis) with 0.05% tannic acid (Sigma) in 1 × PBS at 4°C overnight to preserve the native tension on relevant tendons. The next day, flexor digitorum longus (FDL), Achilles, and patellar tendons were dissected out in 1 × PBS, and placed back into fixative. Samples were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide (OsO<sub>4</sub>), rinsed in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), and dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol to 100%. Samples were rinsed in propylene oxide, infiltrated in Spurrs epoxy, and polymerized at 70°C overnight. TEM images were acquired using an FEI G20 TEM at multiple magnifications to visualize transverse and longitudinal sections of collagen fibrils. Collagen fibril diameter was measured using the Fiji release of ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Tendon biomechanical testing</title><p>Biomechanical tests were performed in tension on a universal testing machine (Instron 5848 Microtester) using a 100N load cell. The tests were performed under displacement control, at a rate of 0.1 N/s, until failure. Data was collected at 40 Hz, and stiffness and ultimate loads were calculated from the load-displacement curve. Tendons were fixed in the machine using a modification of the clamping technique proposed by Probst and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Probst et al., 2000</xref>). The calcaneus was wedged into a conical slot created in a smooth plastic block, which was formed using a moldable plastic (InstaMorph) to ensure all edges were smooth and would not touch or damage the tendon. The origin of the tendon was affixed to the testing machine using a similar technique to that proposed by Probst. Testing was not performed in a water bath, but rather the tendons were kept moist with application of saline during each test, which lasted less than 60 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tendon collagen cross-linking analysis</title><p>Collagen hydroxylysyl-pyridinoline (HP) cross-links were quantiﬁed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eyre, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hudson et al., 2018</xref>). In brief, tendons isolated from hindlimbs were hydrolyzed by 6M HCl for 24 hr at 108°C. Dried samples were then dissolved in 1% (v/v) n-heptafluorobutyric acid for quantitation of HP by reverse-phase HPLC with fluorescence monitoring.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>RNA-seq analysis</title><p>At 1 month-of-age, Achilles tendons were excised using scissors proximal to the calcaneal insertion and distal to the tendon-muscular-junction, whereas patellar tendon were removed via scalpel just proximal to the tibial insertion and distal to the patella. Tendons were not cleaned of their paratenon layers in either case. RNA extraction for both tissues was performed with the Fibrous Connective Tissue kit (Qiagen), with columns from the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) employed for the patellar tendon. Quality control, library preparation, sequencing, and differential gene expression analysis including gene ontology analysis was performed by GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ). For the examination of predicted Upstream Regulators, we utilized the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) platform (Qiagen) with an adjusted p-value of 0.05. The expression is shown as Base Means and read counts of genes were normalized per million transcripts (Transcripts Per Million; TPM).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>qRT-PCR analysis</title><p>At 1 month-of-age, Achilles tendons were excised from the calcaneus, immediately distal to the tendon-muscular-junction.

On the day of assessment, mice were transferred to the test room and allowed to acclimate in their home cage for 30 min at 50 Lux of illumination with 60 dB of white noise. Mice were then placed individually into clear 40 cm ×40 cm × 30 cm chambers and allowed to move freely for 30 min. Locomotion parameters and zones were recorded using the VersaMax activity monitoring software.

Five trials were performed per day for two consecutive days (trials 1–10) with a rest time of 5 min between trials. Latency to fall was recorded when the mouse fell from the rotating rod or went for two revolutions without regaining control. The rotarod was cleaned with 30–50% ethanol between mice to remove the scent of previously tested animals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Grid foot slip analysis of motor coordination</title><p>The grid foot slip assay consisted of a wire grid set atop a stand where the movement was recorded by a suspended digital camera.

Biological replicates were defined as an individual mouse for each experiment. Respective tendons from the left and right hindlimbs were combined for TEM, collagen cross-linking, tendon progenitor, and RNA-seq analyses. Data are presented as means ± S.D. or min-to-max box and whisker plots with individual data points. For data whose residuals passed the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, groups of two were compared using unpaired t-tests, and groups of three or more were compared using one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests. For data whose residuals did not have a normal distribution, groups of two were compared using a Mann-Whitney test, and groups of three or more were compared using Kruskal-Wallis followed by Dunn’s post-hoc tests. For the Rotarod assay, where time was a variable, groups were compared using repeated measures two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s post-hoc tests. For all tests reported above, statistical analysis was performed using Prism 9.0.1 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). For all tests, the exact p-value is reported, and a p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

hypotrophic tendon phenotype. This Crtap null mouse model recapitulates many aspects of a rare form for Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a disease associated with increased low/no trauma fractures, increased risk of tendon ruptures and lax joint. As such the data presented in this paper partially explain the decreased muscle strength and the tendon phenotype seen in this complex human disease. The results of this study will be of interest to those studying pathologies affecting connective tissues in general, and in particular to those engaged in tendon biology research.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Tendon and motor phenotypes in the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse model of recessive Osteogenesis Imperfecta&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Andreas Traweger (Reviewer #1); Nathaniel Dyment (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors conduct an in-depth examination of the tendon and ligament phenotype in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, a model of osteogenesis imperfecta. As is seen in patients, these mice present with deficient muscle strength, and you go on to show that this associated with a reduction in tendon size, reduced collagen fibril size and increased collagen cross-linking. In addition, you observed increased tendon cellularity and changes in gene expression in the tendons reflective of increased inflammation. There were many concerns raised in review, specifically about the model. First, this is a global mutant mouse, and it cannot be determined which aspects of the phenotype are due to deficits intrinsic to the tendon and which were secondary to the other musculoskeletal defects. Ideally the phenotype of a conditional knockout should be presented, but if such a model is not available this issue MUST be addressed in detail in the discussion. Second, there was universal concern among the reviewers about the lack of mechanical testing of the tendon tissue as is outlined in greater detail below. Lastly, there was a lively discussion among the reviewers about the perception that these results are preliminary and lack an in-depth investigation. Detailed comments are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Please clarify if <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice also display a phenotype in positional (less load-bearing) tendons, such as tail tendons? If a phenotype is mainly seen in load-bearing tendons, this would imply that the altered ECM triggers different responses due to mechanical load (as is outlined in the Discussion section, lines 408f).</p><p>2. The manuscript lacks an in-depth characterization of tendon and ligament tissue. Are there any differences in collagen fiber alignment, Collagen I to Collagen III ratio, etc.? Is Crtap actually expressed in tendons in wild type animals? You demonstrated a shift to smaller diameter collagen fibrils in these mice--is this consistent with previous results in bone? How about cross-links? Are the changes in tendon consistent with changes in bone?</p><p>3. You performed extensive functional (motor activity, coordination, and strength) and structural (TEM) assays and showed deficits in the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. However, material and structural properties would more directly show alterations in tendon function. As was noted, changes in motor/coordination/strength assays could be due in part to tendon phenotype but may also be due to muscle weakness and pain response. The decreased volume and collagen fibril size with increased cross-links suggests that biomechanical properties will likely be altered but these measures don't always correlate with mechanics. Tendon mechanical tests would be a great addition to the paper (e.g. Young's modulus, max. tensile stress).</p><p>4. Lines 258-59: Although <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice display a clear tendon phenotype, you did not investigate tendon development per se. The data merely implies that tendons do not mature properly, as no late embryonic and early postnatal stages have been investigated. The data provided do not allow for a specific conclusion to be made in this regard.</p><p>5. Lines 260ff: Based on the data provided it remains questionable if loss of Crtap in tendons is mechanistically responsible for the observed changes in cell density. Only very little data on cell characterization is provided, e.g. you do not investigate the expression of tendon-related markers (i.e IF for Tnmd, Scx, Mkx, Egr1) in situ. Further, a more detailed in vitro characterization of tendon stem and progenitor cells (TDSPCs) isolated from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendon tissue would further substantiate this claim (e.g. proliferation rate, trilineage differentiation potential, etc.)</p><p>6. Although the result from RNASeq analysis are interesting, you do not verify any of their findings by independent means. At a minimum, a change in expression of the identified candidate genes should be demonstrated by qPCR and/or Western blot. Further, mechanistic insight for any of biological processes shown to be impacted by the loss of Ctarp-/- should be provided.</p><p>7. You provide results from several behavioral tests clearly demonstrating motor deficits. Surprisingly, none of test performed allow any conclusions to be drawn on the functional consequences of the tendon phenotype observed. Do the animals actually show any change in gait and/or endurance?</p><p>8. There is the claim that the behavioral changes observed can be related to the tendon phenotype. While this is a possibility, did you consider that abnormal muscle forces in part drive the tendon phenotype? Could it be that simply the reduced movement (due to pain) and loading of tendons are (mainly) causative for the observed tendon phenotype? This is actually suggested by the open field test results (Figure 6A/B).</p><p>9. Since collagen assembly and organization are disrupted in this model and with many OI models leading to increased bone remodeling, there is reason to be believe that OI tendons may be in a chronic healing response. The apparent increase in the number of CD31+ and CD45+ cells (Figure 2A-B), differential gene expression, and the extreme elongation of the patellar tendon that could be caused, in part, by microtears in the matrix, help to support this hypothesis. It would be interesting to stain for CD31 to see if there is an increased in vascularity or stain for matrix proteins that are elevated in healing or tendinopathic tissue (e.g., TNC, type III collagen, α SMA). A discussion of this mechanism is warranted.</p><p>10. Resident tendon progenitor populations are not well understood. While CD146 and CD200 may be markers of progenitors, related to my previous point, production of these proteins is likely increased in healing tissues and may not be specifically expressed in a progenitor population. We would caution labeling the CD146+/CD200+ cells as progenitors and the CD146-/CD200+ cells as immature cells without additional functional assays.</p><p>11.

It was noted that articular cartilage volume was not altered but did not present quantitative data. We are surprised to not see changes in articular cartilage given prolyl 3-hydroxylation in type II collagen and the role that Crtap may have in this process.

Your revised article has been evaluated by Mone Zaidi (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The data presented provide evidence that loss of Crtap in mice, which is known to affect multiple connective tissues, results in a hypotrophic tendon phenotype. This Crtap null mouse model recapitulates many aspects of a rare form for Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a disease associated with increased low/no trauma fractures, increased risk of tendon ruptures and lax joint. As such the data presented in this paper partially explain the decreased muscle strength and the tendon phenotype seen in this complex human disease. The results of this study will be of interest to those studying pathologies affecting connective tissues in general, and in particular to those engaged in tendon biology research.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues, particularly in relation to new data, that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1. The authors now include biomechanical data which was very much appreciated by the reviewers. However, the authors reported only structural properties (stiffness and max force) but not material properties (modulus and ultimate stress). As the authors also demonstrated that the Achilles tendon was thinner in the mutant mice (Figure 1), it's conceivable that the reduced structural properties could be due to a reduction in cross-sectional area of the tendon. This is only a minor limitation though given the altered ECM seen by TEM but should still be stated.</p><p>2. The authors now provide data, that a hypoblastic and hypercellular phenotype is not observed in early postnatal stages. This is an interesting and important finding. While the authors provide quantitative data on the cellularity, no quantitation on patellar tendon diameter is included. This would further underscore their findings.</p><p>3. The authors argue that load-bearing tendons in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice undergo increased remodeling reminiscent of a chronic repair state. Unfortunately, they only provide RT-qPCR to support their claims. As it appears that lack of Crtap renders tendons more sensitive to overload-induced (even at physiological loads) catabolic events, it is important to demonstrate an increase in matrix-remodeling enzymes (e.g. MMPs, etc.), inflammatory events (e.g. expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, NfkB activation), and fibrotic markers (e.g. α SMA as previously suggested in the prior review) on the protein level (IHC) driving the hypoblastic phenotype. Also, investigating Tgf-b signaling seems warranted. While RT-qPCR data is sometimes helpful the reviewers felt that for some of these issues, histopathological assessment such as IHC for MMPs and/or α-SMA to help validate the injury/healing response would be more informative.</p><p>4.

Please clarify if Crtap<sup>-/-</sup> mice also display a phenotype in positional (less load-bearing) tendons, such as tail tendons? If a phenotype is mainly seen in load-bearing tendons, this would imply that the altered ECM triggers different responses due to mechanical load (as is outlined in the Discussion section, lines 408f).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this interesting question. As this manuscript's interest was in examining appendicular load-bearing tendons as they may relate to clinical manifestations in OI patients, such as joint laxity, we did not examine tail tendons in our mice. We have highlighted this fact now in the Discussion of our manuscript (Lines 381-388). In the lab, we have observed that <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice develop kinked tails with incomplete penetrance beginning at 1-2 months-of-age. This is a phenotype we are interested in pursuing in future work in addition to creating a conditional knockout model to address the specificity of the tendon phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript lacks an in-depth characterization of tendon and ligament tissue. Are there any differences in collagen fiber alignment, Collagen I to Collagen III ratio, etc.? Is Crtap actually expressed in tendons in wild type animals? You demonstrated a shift to smaller diameter collagen fibrils in these mice--is this consistent with previous results in bone? How about cross-links? Are the changes in tendon consistent with changes in bone?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. We have added several new analyses and experiments to address these points.</p><p>Concerning collagen fibril alignment, we have added longitudinal TEM images to Figure 4 (see Figure 4M-R) that clearly show the irregular organization of collagen fibrils in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice compared to wildtype (Lines 188-193).</p><p>We have also performed qRT-PCR to confirm our RNA-seq data and more closely examine alterations in tendon-specific gene expression in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons compared to wildtype. These results highlight that Crtap is expressed in tendon and is absent in tissue from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (Figure 7, Lines 261-276) – a finding that confirms the RNA-seq data in Figure 6.</p><p>As part of this new qRT-PCR analysis, we examined the expression of various fibrillar collagens, glycoproteins, SLRPs, tendon transcription factors, and CD31 (as a marker of vascularization). We demonstrate that while a modest reduction in <italic>Col1a1</italic> expression is observed with no alteration in <italic>Col3a1</italic> expression, there is increased expression of <italic>Scx</italic>, <italic>Tnc</italic>, <italic>Lum</italic>, <italic>Tnmd</italic>, <italic>Fn1</italic>, and <italic>Thbs3</italic>. As the reviewers pointed out below, this increase in tendon marker expression likely indicates that the tendon ECM is undergoing increased remodeling reminiscent of a chronic repair state. This new data is highlighted in Figure 7 and described on Lines 261-276. We discuss these results in the context of the existing literature on tendon maturation and repair on Lines 351-366 of the Discussion.</p><p>In the original submission, we discussed how the shift in collagen fibril diameters seen in FDL, Achilles, and patellar tendons from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice is consistent with mouse models lacking the other two components of the 3-prolyl hydroxylase complex, namely P3h1 and CypB. At the same time, the reviewers bring up an important point regarding whether similarities exist between tendon and bone. To address this, we discuss that while we see increases in HP residues per collagen in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons, HP is not drastically changed in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> bones; instead, it is a decrease in LP and resulting increase in HP/LP that is seen in bones from <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, there is a complete loss of 3-prolyl hydroxylation at Pro 986 in the chains of type I collagen (see Lines 397-403). Beyond collagen cross-linking, the reductions in ECM and increased cellularity are consistent with that seen in bones, lungs, and glomeruli of these mice (see Lines 328-333).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. You performed extensive functional (motor activity, coordination, and strength) and structural (TEM) assays and showed deficits in the Crtap<sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, material and structural properties would more directly show alterations in tendon function. As was noted, changes in motor/coordination/strength assays could be due in part to tendon phenotype but may also be due to muscle weakness and pain response. The decreased volume and collagen fibril size with increased cross-links suggests that biomechanical properties will likely be altered but these measures don't always correlate with mechanics. Tendon mechanical tests would be a great addition to the paper (e.g. Young's modulus, max. tensile stress).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for highlighting this point. We have added results from biomechanical testing of Achilles tendons from 1-month-old wildtype, heterozygous, and <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice in the revised manuscript. As is now shown in Figure 1T-U, we observed a significant decrease in the ultimate load and maximum stiffness in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> tendons compared to the other two genotypes (see Lines 128-136).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Lines 258-59: Although Crtap<sup>-/-</sup> mice display a clear tendon phenotype, you did not investigate tendon development per se. The data merely implies that tendons do not mature properly, as no late embryonic and early postnatal stages have been investigated. The data provided do not allow for a specific conclusion to be made in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important point. In the revised manuscript, we have added a new Figure (see Figure 2) examining the tendon phenotype in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice at postnatal day 10 (P10). We still observed a slight thinning of the Achilles and patellar tendons at this earlier time point, but there was no increase in cell density in either tendon compared to wildtype. Based on this new data, we conclude that <italic>Crtap</italic> is required for tendon maturation and postnatal homeostasis but is not likely to be required for their initial formation and development (see Lines 137-142).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Lines 260ff: Based on the data provided it remains questionable if loss of Crtap in tendons is mechanistically responsible for the observed changes in cell density. Only very little data on cell characterization is provided, e.g. you do not investigate the expression of tendon-related markers (i.e IF for Tnmd, Scx, Mkx, Egr1) in situ. Further, a more detailed in vitro characterization of tendon stem and progenitor cells (TDSPCs) isolated from Crtap<sup>-/-</sup> tendon tissue would further substantiate this claim (e.g. proliferation rate, trilineage differentiation potential, etc.)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. As described above for Comment 2, we addressed the concerns regarding tendon-related marker expression by performing qRT-PCR for several of these markers (see Figure 7, Lines 261-276).</p><p>In terms of the tendon progenitor cells, the new qRT-PCR data does indeed suggest that changes in CD146<sup>+</sup> cells could simply be indicative of a tendon in a chronic but pathologic state of repair. As such, we have de-emphasized the progenitor discussion in the revised manuscript and focused more on the repair hypothesis put forth by the reviewers. That being said, we agree that an interesting avenue for future research would be to examine the properties of the CD146<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> cells identified in Figure 3 to verify if they at all represent a true progenitor population, and to examine how the decrease in CD146<sup>+</sup>CD200<sup>+</sup> population in <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice may (or may not) contribute to the tendon phenotype. We now highlight this important future direction in the Discussion (see Lines 333-337).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Although the result from RNASeq analysis are interesting, you do not verify any of their findings by independent means. At a minimum, a change in expression of the identified candidate genes should be demonstrated by qPCR and/or Western blot. Further, mechanistic insight for any of biological processes shown to be impacted by the loss of Ctarp-/- should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this important suggestion. As described above for Comment 2, we addressed the concerns regarding tendon-related marker expression by performing qRT-PCR for several of these markers (see Figure 7, Lines 261-276).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. You provide results from several behavioral tests clearly demonstrating motor deficits. Surprisingly, none of test performed allow any conclusions to be drawn on the functional consequences of the tendon phenotype observed. Do the animals actually show any change in gait and/or endurance?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point. We have tried to clarify in the text what each behavioral test measures. We note that the rotarod assay is an established measure of both motor coordination and endurance. Unfortunately, we did not perform any gait analyses on these mice.</p><p>A significant issue in identifying the tendon's contribution to these behavioral metrics is the use of the whole-body <italic>Crtap</italic> knockout mouse model. In the Discussion of the revised manuscript, we acknowledge that muscle and other tissues may contribute to the phenotype in the <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (see Lines 422-434). Future work employing a tissue-specific <italic>Crtap</italic> mouse model will be needed to interrogate this question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. There is the claim that the behavioral changes observed can be related to the tendon phenotype. While this is a possibility, did you consider that abnormal muscle forces in part drive the tendon phenotype? Could it be that simply the reduced movement (due to pain) and loading of tendons are (mainly) causative for the observed tendon phenotype? This is actually suggested by the open field test results (Figure 6A/B).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this point and have added a section to the Discussion acknowledging that other tissues, namely muscle, could be contributing to behavioral metrics, including grid foot slip and grip strength (see Lines 422-434). We also discuss that to address such concerns, studies in a tissue-specific model will be required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Since collagen assembly and organization are disrupted in this model and with many OI models leading to increased bone remodeling, there is reason to be believe that OI tendons may be in a chronic healing response. The apparent increase in the number of CD31+ and CD45+ cells (Figure 2A-B), differential gene expression, and the extreme elongation of the patellar tendon that could be caused, in part, by microtears in the matrix, help to support this hypothesis. It would be interesting to stain for CD31 to see if there is an increased in vascularity or stain for matrix proteins that are elevated in healing or tendinopathic tissue (e.g., TNC, type III collagen, α SMA). A discussion of this mechanism is warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point made by the reviewers. We have performed qRT-PCR analysis of Achilles tendons from 1-month-old wildtype and <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to address this. In addition to the upregulation of many tendon-specific genes (see the explanation for Comment 2), we examined the expression of CD31 at this timepoint and saw no difference between wildtype and <italic>Crtap<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. In our tissue sections, we also did not observe any gross vascular infiltration into the tendon body. We agree with the reviewers that the upregulation of tendon markers combined with the changes seen in the ECM organization might indicate that the OI tendons are in a state of chronic healing. We highlight this point now in the Discussion (Lines 331-337, 351-366).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Resident tendon progenitor populations are not well understood. While CD146 and CD200 may be markers of progenitors, related to my previous point, production of these proteins is likely increased in healing tissues and may not be specifically expressed in a progenitor population.
