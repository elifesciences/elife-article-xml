Extensive human genetic studies have identified risk loci in such diseases, including in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and inflammatory bowel diseases. The genes associated with these loci have not fully been determined, and functional characterization of such genes requires extensive studies in model organisms. Here, we report the results of a screen in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> that allowed for rapid identification, validation, and prioritization of COPD risk genes that were selected based on risk loci identified in human genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using intestinal barrier dysfunction in flies as a readout, our results validate the impact of candidate gene perturbations on epithelial barrier function in 56% of the cases, resulting in a prioritized target gene list. We further report the functional characterization in flies of one family of these genes, encoding for nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) subunits. We find that nAchR signaling in enterocytes of the fly gut promotes epithelial barrier function and epithelial homeostasis by regulating the production of the peritrophic matrix. Our findings identify COPD-associated genes critical for epithelial barrier maintenance, and provide insight into the role of epithelial nAchR signaling for homeostasis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intestinal barrier</kwd><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>184.034.014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Klumperman</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Signaling through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors in enterocytes impacts barrier integrity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine by regulating formation of the peritrophic matrix.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Barrier epithelia such as the skin, linings of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts, and the airways play a critical role in maintaining a strict separation of external and internal environments, yet also enable the exchange of gases, water, nutrients, and immune mediators. They serve as a first layer of defense against external insults and possess remarkable regenerative capacity that declines with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jasper, 2020</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, loss of intestinal barrier function is accompanied by commensal dysbiosis and inflammation and reliably predicts impending organismal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rera et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, increased barrier permeability and changes in microbiome composition and abundance have been reported in various human diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raftery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>COPD is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality and is characterized by an obstructed airflow resulting in shortness of breath upon exertion. At the tissue level, lungs of COPD patients display chronic inflammation, extensive cellular remodeling, and barrier dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aghapour et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlier et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While smoking or exposure to environmental air pollutants remain major risk factors, many COPD patients are non-smokers, suggesting a genetic component contributing to disease susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aghapour et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnes, 2019</xref>). Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed in which risk loci for incidence of COPD have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobbs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sakornsakolpat et al., 2019</xref>). One of the most well-known risk loci is located near the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR) CHRNA3/5 genes and has also been associated with increased nicotine dependence and smoking behavior, and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amos et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cui et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobbs et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pillai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilk et al., 2012</xref>). Recent work has demonstrated a role for CHRNA5 in the formation of COPD-like lesions in the respiratory epithelium independently of cigarette smoke, suggesting a direct involvement of nAchRs in shaping epithelial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Routhier et al., 2021</xref>). The endogenous ligand of nAchR, acetylcholine (Ach), is a classic neurotransmitter synthesized by choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in cholinergic neurons, as well as in immune cells and epithelial cells, such as brush/tuft cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kummer and Krasteva-Christ, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wessler and Kirkpatrick, 2008</xref>). Such cells orchestrate type 2 inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sell et al., 2021</xref>), mucociliary clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perniss et al., 2020</xref>), and limit biliary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">O’Leary et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Leary et al., 2019</xref>). How Ach influences homeostasis of barrier epithelia and how disease-associated nAchR variants perturb epithelial function remain mostly unclear.</p><p>Overall, experimental evidence for the involvement of specific genes associated with the COPD risk loci identified in these studies is mostly lacking, and will be essential for the development of therapeutic strategies targeting novel pathways. The use of genetically accessible model systems with enough physiological complexity to model cell and tissue interactions in barrier epithelia may help accelerate the evaluation of potential disease-causing genes identified in COPD GWAS. To test this idea, we have here used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> midgut as a genetically accessible model for epithelial barrier homeostasis to interrogate genes predicted to be involved in COPD based on GWAS. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine is lined by a pseudostratified epithelium consisting of enterocytes (ECs) and enteroendocrine cells (EEs) that are regenerated from a basal population of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Miguel-Aliaga et al., 2018</xref>). In its structure, cell composition and molecular regulation of regenerative processes, the fly intestinal epithelium resembles mammalian airway epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Under stress conditions, in response to enteropathogen infection, as well as during normal aging, the fly intestinal epithelium loses its barrier function and exhibits stem cell hyperplasia and commensal dysbiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jasper, 2020</xref>). These phenotypes recapitulate changes observed in airway epithelia of COPD patients and can thus be used as a model for pathophysiological changes occurring in this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Carlier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Raftery et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of candidate genes associated with risk alleles in COPD GWAS in the maintenance of barrier epithelia integrity, we performed an RNA interference (RNAi) screen perturbing their <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs systemically and quantifying the impact of these perturbations on intestinal barrier function. Several of the candidate genes identified in this screen as required for barrier integrity encode for subunits of the nAchR.</p><p>In the fly intestine, we find that ChAT is expressed by a subset of EEs and that EC-specific expression of nAchR is required for barrier integrity by stimulating chitin release and ensuring maintenance of the peritrophic matrix (PM), a chitinous structure protecting the epithelium from luminal insults. In ECs, Ach is required for the expression of Syt4, a critical regulator of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshihara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) which is required for the maintenance of PM structure and epithelial barrier function. Our data illustrate the usefulness of <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model for prioritization of potential disease genes identified in GWAS, and identify nAchR signaling as a critical mediator of epithelial homeostasis in barrier epithelia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A genetic screen assessing the role of COPD candidate genes in barrier function</title><p>To obtain a curated candidate gene list for COPD, we assigned candidate genes to COPD risk loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobbs et al., 2017</xref>) using a combination of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), coding annotation, and distance-based metrics (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs were identified with the DRSC integrative ortholog prediction tool (DIOPT, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2011</xref>) and corresponding hits with the highest DIOPT score were selected, resulting in a total of 33 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes screened initially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A <italic>Drosophila</italic> screen for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-associated candidate genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) List of human candidate genes for genetic loci associated with COPD risk and their <italic>Drosophila</italic> orthologs.

In this approach flies are fed food containing a non-absorbable blue food dye. If the intestinal epithelial barrier is compromised, the dye leaks into the open circulatory system and gives the fly a blue appearance reminiscent of the popular blue cartoon characters. Where available, a minimum of two different RNAi lines per gene were included (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Female flies carrying the da-GS driver and RNAi construct were allowed to mature and mate for 10–12 days before being placed on blue food with RU486 to induce knockdown for 24 hr. Since COPD is strongly associated with environmental stress, we then challenged flies with Paraquat (<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>’-dimethyl-4,4’-bipyridinium dichloride), a herbicide known to inflict oxidative stress and damage to the fly gut comparable to the effects of cigarette smoke on the lung epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Biteau et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caliri et al., 2021</xref>). After 16 hr Paraquat challenge the flies were moved back to blue food containing RU486 and smurf numbers were recorded over the span of about a week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We generated a ‘barrier dysfunction index’ for every RNAi line by calculating the natural logarithm (ln) of the ratio of peak smurf percentage between RNAi line and control knockdown and plotted individual RNAi lines accordingly. A positive index implies an enhancement of barrier dysfunction after depletion, while a negative index suggests rescue of barrier integrity after depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Based on the outcomes of individual RNAi knockdowns, we assigned an overall rating for each candidate gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We found that disruption of 17 genes (~52%) resulted in enhancement (e.g. these genes were necessary for barrier integrity), while disruption of 4 genes (12%) resulted in suppression of the barrier dysfunction. The remaining 12 genes did not display any effect on barrier function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Modulation of total organismal Ach levels by RNAi-mediated silencing of ChAT under control of da-GS also resulted in increased barrier dysfunction after Paraquat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), further supporting the role of Ach/nAChR signaling in maintaining intestinal epithelial homeostasis.</p><p>To investigate a possible direct intestinal role for nAchR, and to identify the requirement for individual subunits, we used the drivers NP1-Gal4 and 5966-GS to separately deplete nAchR subunits.

While 5966-GS is inducible using RU486, we combined NP1-Gal4 with tubG80<sup>ts</sup> (NP1<sup>ts</sup>) to allow for temperature-mediated induction (TARGET system; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">McGuire et al., 2004</xref>) before subjecting the flies to Paraquat. Knockdown of nAchR α4 or β3 with both drivers increased the numbers of smurf flies, indicating a defective epithelial barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>).</p><p>Knockdown of nAchR in ECs resulted in various hallmarks of epithelial stress. These include induction of ISC proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), presumably due to stress signals released by ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Biteau et al., 2011</xref>), as well as activation of JAK/STAT signaling (measured using the 2xSTAT::GFP reporter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bach et al., 2007</xref>) and ER stress signaling (measured using an Xbp1-eGFP reporter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). Interestingly, organization of epithelial junctions in ECs remained mostly unaltered, as visualized by staining for the septate junction marker Dlg and Coracle as well as localization of arm-GFP, suggesting that barrier dysfunction may be caused by a separate mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm and characterize the role for nAchR subunits in epithelial homeostasis, we specifically depleted nAchR subunits in stem cells using esg-Gal4, UAS-2xEYFP; Su(H)GBE-Gal80, tub-Gal80<sup>ts</sup> (ISC<sup>ts</sup>). Individual knockdown of nAchR α2, α4, β1, or β3 resulted in increased barrier dysfunction after Paraquat challenge as well as decreased survival after <italic>P. entomophila</italic> (PE) infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). When challenged with PE, stem cells depleted for various nAchR subunits underwent mitosis at a similar rate as their control counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that barrier dysfunction is not caused by an inability of stem cells to regenerate the epithelium. We generated MARCM mutant clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lee and Luo, 2001</xref>) lacking <italic>nAChRα2</italic> using the null allele <italic>nAChRα2<sup>attP</sup></italic> generated by CRISPR/Cas9-based homologous recombination resulting in the introduction of an attP site, 3xP3-RFP, and a loxP site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2022</xref>).

Consistent with the results of the ISC-specific knockdown, <italic>nAChR α2<sup>attP</sup></italic> clones grew to similar cell numbers as their control counterparts. Interestingly, however, they failed to produce normal numbers of EEs, as only 32% of <italic>nAChR α2</italic> clones contained at least 1 EE compared to 72% of clones in the control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>).

In addition to a broader role for <italic>nAchR</italic> in maintaining barrier integrity, <italic>nAchR</italic> may thus also be required for the proper differentiation of EEs. We also knocked down additional subunits, generating clones depleted for these subunits via RNAi using the esgF/O approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>). Depletion of nAchR α4 and β3 slightly reduced overall size of the clones compared to control, and we detected a non-significant trend toward fewer EEs after nAchR depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref>, the weak phenotypes observed in these RNAi experiments may be a consequence of incomplete knockdown efficiency).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Ach promotes barrier function</title><p>We sought to identify the source of Ach activating these receptors in the gut epithelium next.

Gut compartmentalization can be visualized by feeding flies the pH indicator Bromophenol blue, which labels the acidic copper cell region in yellow, while the rest of gut remains blue, indicative of a more basic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Reduction of nAchR levels lead to an increase of disturbed acidity patterns, ranging from completely blue guts to samples with weak staining and white patches, which has been attributed to expansion of acid-producing commensals like <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> along the whole gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>Dysbiosis can be a consequence of IMD pathway disruption, but at the same time triggers chronic IMD pathway activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buchon et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2014</xref>).

The response of these mutants to Paraquat stress was less robust: Syt4 mutant animals were slightly (but not significantly) more sensitive to Paraquat than wildtype controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Accordingly, RNAi-mediated knockdown of Syt4 in ECs resulted in overall mild and experimentally inconsistent increases in barrier dysfunction after Paraquat treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the localization of Syt4 in the gut epithelium, we utilized a 3xFLAG-mCherry-labeled protein trap line under UAS control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Singari et al., 2014</xref>).

In particular, our results provide a role for nAchR signaling in maintaining intestinal barrier function. Since depletion of several nAchR subunits in ECs, or of ChAT in neurons and EEs leads to loss of barrier integrity and decreased survival after chemical or bacterial challenge, we propose that Ach-mediated crosstalk between cholinergic neurons and/or EEs with ECs is critical to maintain intestinal epithelial homeostasis. This role of nAchR signaling is mediated by transcriptional regulation of Syt4 in ECs, which in turn maintains secretion of chitin vesicles to maintain the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).</p><p>The exact source of Ach in this regulation remains unclear due to the lack of specific drivers that would allow separating cholinergic neurons and EEs. Recent work suggests a vital role of neuronally derived Ach during regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Petsakou et al., 2023</xref>). While neuronal Ach seems to be the main driver regulating return to homeostasis after injury, it is possible that Ach secreted by both cell types may contribute to the maintenance of the epithelium under homeostatic conditions and it will be of interest to explore these contributions in future studies.</p><p>Of further interest for future studies is to assess the regulation of nAchR signaling activity in the context of stress and infection. Our transcriptome analysis, which shows that nAchR β3 is induced and Ace is repressed after PE infection, is in line with previous findings and suggests that the pathway is dynamically regulated in response to enteropathogen infection. In addition to regulating tissue recovery, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ECs may also strengthen PM integrity through promoting Syt4-mediated vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang and Chapman, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Our data using nAChR subunit loss of function clones suggest that nAchR signaling only mildly impacts regenerative processes, influencing the balance between EEs and ECs in newly formed cell populations. It is possible that perturbing other subunits may have a stronger impact on ISC proliferation and/or differentiation and an exhaustive loss of function study evaluating the role of specific subunits will be of interest. We do observe a strong proliferative response of ISCs to nAchR subunit knockdown in ECs, on the other hand, and this response is consistent with previously described proliferative responses of ISCs to EC stress and damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A role for Ach signaling in human barrier epithelia is supported by previous studies: muscarinic Ach receptors have been successfully targeted in the clinic to relieve bronchoconstriction and mucus hypersecretion in COPD and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Calzetta et al., 2021</xref>), although nicotinic AchRs remain more elusive from a therapeutic perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hollenhorst and Krasteva-Christ, 2021</xref>). While Ach is a classic neurotransmitter, a growing body of work has uncovered an important role of Ach beyond the context of the nervous system: various non-neuronal cell types express the machinery for Ach synthesis and secretion, ranging from diverse immune cells to epithelial cells, such as brush/tuft cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kummer and Krasteva-Christ, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wessler and Kirkpatrick, 2008</xref>). Airway tuft cells have been implicated in orchestrating type 2 inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sell et al., 2021</xref>) and mucociliary clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perniss et al., 2020</xref>), whereas their intestinal counterparts participate in defense against helminths and protists and limit biliary inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O’Leary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2019</xref>). With a wide range of cell types able to produce or sense Ach, non-neuronal Ach serves as a versatile signaling molecule eliciting complex intercellular crosstalk with diverse outcomes; depending on the context, Ach may promote inflammation or conversely exert anti-inflammatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hollenhorst and Krasteva-Christ, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kummer and Krasteva-Christ, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sell et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, it was recently reported that expression of a COPD risk allele of CHRNA5 in epithelial cells leads to airway remodeling in vivo, increased proliferation and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through decreased calcium entry and increased adenylyl-cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Routhier et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has further shown a downregulation of junctional proteins such as ZO-1 and p120 after depletion of CHRNA5 in A549 lung cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krais et al., 2011</xref>). While we observed a mildly disorganized pattern of junctional markers such as Dlg after nAchR subunit knockdown in the fly intestinal epithelium, junctional architecture appeared normal when analyzed by electron microscopy. Furthermore, transcriptome analysis revealed little to no changes in the expression of proteins involved in polarity or cellular junction formation, suggesting that nAchR signaling regulates barrier function through other mechanisms. A role for the Syt4-mediated secretion of PM protein components and chitin in maintaining barrier integrity is supported by the observation that mCherry-tagged Syt4 partially overlaps with chitin-binding WGA staining.</p><p>While the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PM is thought to be produced mostly in the anterior most portion of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hegedus et al., 2019</xref>), the existence of WGA-positive vesicles throughout the entire midgut suggests continuous remodeling along the length of the tissue. This finding is consistent with the previously reported expression of PM-related transcripts in the R4 compartment of the midgut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buchon et al., 2013</xref>). PM integrity can be modulated by enteric neurons, although a role for cholinergic signaling was not tested in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kenmoku et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our study highlights the evolutionary conservation of mechanisms maintaining epithelial barrier function. The PM is functionally analogous to mucus and surfactant layers in mammalian airways, and it remains to be explored whether COPD risk alleles in nAchR subunits also cause a dysfunction in the secretion of such barrier components. The elevated inflammation and airway remodeling in mice expressing the CHRNA5 risk allele suggest that such a mechanism may be conserved as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Routhier et al., 2021</xref>). It is critical to note that the epithelial dysfunction observed in these animals, as well as part of the association of COPD risk with specific CHRNA loci, emerges independently of cigarette smoke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Routhier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Siedlinski et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that nAchR signaling is critical to maintain homeostasis not only in the context of oxidative stress, but under homeostatic conditions. Supporting this view, our data show that knockdown of nAchR subunits in fly ECs also results in epithelial stress signaling in the absence of Paraquat exposure.</p><p>These consistencies further validate the approach of prioritizing candidate genes associated with COPD risk loci using the <italic>Drosophila</italic> intestine as a model system. Characterization of the epithelial role of other identified candidate orthologs from our screen will likely provide further insight into the biology and pathophysiology of barrier dysfunction and epithelial homeostasis.

Forty-eight candidate genes were assigned to the 22 loci reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobbs et al., 2017</xref>, based upon eQTL, coding variation level support, or physical distance if a gene could not be assigned via the former criteria. First, candidate genes were assigned to loci if the index variant was an eQTL in any tissue for any gene within 250 kilobases of the variant in GTEx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Battle et al., 2017</xref>) (V6p). We further applied colocalization (via the coloc package in R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Giambartolomei et al., 2014</xref>) to estimate the probability the eQTL and COPD risk association signal share a casual variant. Of the 40 genes with eQTL support, 24 had a colocalization probability &gt;0.6. Candidate genes were also assigned to loci if the index variant was in linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r<sup>2</sup> &gt; 0.6) with coding variants for the gene. LD was estimated using individuals of European ancestry from 1000 Genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auton et al., 2015</xref>).

Crosses were raised at 25°C and brooded every 2–3 days. Progeny were collected and females were sorted after mating for 2–3 days (discarding males). This yielded about 200 females per genotype depending on the RNAi line. Sorted females were aged in standard medium at 25°C for 10–12 days. Aged females (~25 per vial; exact number recorded per vial for assay readout) were then exposed to standard medium prepared with 200 mM Mifepristone (RU486) from Sigma-Aldrich (cat# 856177) and 2.5% wt/vol FD&amp;C Blue Dye no 1 from Spectrum (cat# FD110) for 24 hr at 25°C or 29°C. Prior to Paraquat exposure, flies were dry starved for 2–3 hr at the experimental temperature. 25 mM Paraquat solution (5% sucrose and 2.5% wt/vol FD&amp;C Blue Dye in sterile water) or mock solution (sucrose and blue dye only) was freshly prepared for each experiment. Starved flies were placed in empty vials with a Whatman filter paper (VWR, 89013-946) on top of a foam biopsy pad (Neta Sciences, BPLS-6110) and 1.25 ml of Paraquat or mock solution for 16 hr at 25°C or 29°C and then shifted back to medium with 200 mM Mifepristone (RU486) and 2.5% wt/vol FD&amp;C Blue Dye no 1.

About 8–12 candidate RNAi lines were tested in sets with Luciferase RNAi always included as a control.</p><p>The average proportion of smurf flies across technical replicates per time point were calculated and graphed. The natural log (LN) ratio was calculated for each candidate RNAi by dividing the candidate RNAi proportion average from the final time point by the Luciferase RNAi proportion average for the same time point (=LN(Candidate RNAi/Luciferase RNAi)). Candidate RNAi results were ranked by establishing a scale with arbitrary LN ratio ranges to define: strong enhancers (≥1), enhancers (≥0.43 to ≤0.99), weak enhancers (≥0.20 to ≤0.42), no effect (≥–0.30 to ≤0.19), weak suppressors (≥–0.70 to ≤–0.31), suppressors (≥–1.10 to ≤–0.71), and strong suppressors (≤–1.11).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Paraquat feeding</title><p>20–25 flies per vial were kept on food containing FD&amp;C blue for 1–3 days and dry starved in empty vials for 2–3 hr prior to Paraquat exposure.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and David James as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rongwen Xi (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and find that the manuscript has many merits but still some weaknesses. They ask you to revise the manuscript. The Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The source of the ligand (Acetylcholine) should better elucidate. Is it produced in enteric neurons and/or EE cells?</p><p>The effect on epithelial barrier function resulting from reducing ChaT levels in 'EEs' (prosepro-gal4) versus cholinergic neurons and EEs (ChaT-gal4) is different. The impact is clearly much stronger when the prospero-gal4 driver is used.</p><p>Prospero-gal4 would target brain and VNC cells in addition to EE cells. As such, the effects observed under Pros-gal4 driven Ach knockdown may be a consequence of impairing broader ligand action. This needs to be considered and tested experimentally, for example, by targeting neuronally produced Ach while sparing EE cells and seeing how this compares to the effect caused by Prospero-gal4. Alternatively, using a tool to target ChaT from EE cells, while spearing ChaT+ve neurons.</p><p>On the other hand, the ChaT-gal4 used may not target all Ach-producing cells. Details of ChAT expression pattern in EEs using antibody staining should be included, by staining ChaT&gt;reporter guts with ChaT antibody. This would also be important considering previous work by Buchon et al. (2013 Cell Rep) showing the ChaT-Gal4 (Bloomington #6793) was expressed in small-nucleated cells in R3. This contrasts with the observation here that ChAT is expressed in EEs in R4-R5 regions indicated by ChAT[MI04508-TG4.0].</p><p>2. Is the Ach/AchR pathway regulated upon intestinal damage?</p><p>While the data clearly show the constitute role of AchR signaling in the maintenance of intestinal homeostasis (as per the data in Figure 2E-H) and epithelial barrier function following damage exposure (rest of the paper), it is unclear whether pathway activity is regulated by damage.</p><p>For instance: is the production of Acetylcholine by EE cells or nerve cells regulated upon intestinal damage? Is AchR activity/signaling in the intestinal epithelium regulated by similar stimuli?</p><p>3. Is the effect of AchR knockdown on EE cell differentiation a reflection of an intrinsic role of the signalling in ISCs? Or part of its EC function?</p><p>The intestinal cell types that express nAchR genes are not shown. Are they expressed in all intestinal cells including intestinal progenitors (ISC, EB(NotcH<sup>+</sup>), and EMC/EEP), and differentiated EC/EE? Reduced production of EE in nAchRa2 mutant clones suggests a requirement of nAchR at least in the stem cell lineage that produces EE. Following this, do nAchR genes have any role in ISCs for their division and differentiation? Such data are important for assessing the roles of Ach/nAchR axis in regulating intestinal homeostasis.</p><p>Do you see defective EE differentiation upon EC-specific knockdown of AChR?</p><p>What happens to epithelial barrier function, ISC proliferation, and EE differentiation if AChR is knockdown in stem cells specifically (e.g. using ISC-gal4 drivers or ISC-gene switch system)? These experiments would be important to distinguish potential cell-specific roles of the receptor and likely clarify whether EE cell differentiation and epithelial barrier function are part of the same process and linked to the functional role of the receptor in ECs or not.</p><p>Figure 2H (MARM clones): Would you not expect to see bigger clones upon AchR depletion given that its targeted knockdown in ECs by RNAi results in large increase in ISC proliferation reported in (Figure 2E)?</p><p>4. The author should better support the functional connection of Ach/AchR signalling and Syt4.</p><p>While the data provided shows that the downregulation of Syt4 mimics that of AchR signaling, it does not demonstrate that they are functionally linked. Validation of syt4 expression by qPCR should be performed and assessment of Syt4 protein levels and cellular localization following AchR knockdown. Genetic interaction experiments should be done to confirm that AchR/Syt4 work in the same pathway to regulate PM/barrier integrity. The authors should also test if EC-specific Syt4 depletion and Syt4 mutants show increased susceptibility to paraquat-induced damage as well, although they did show that these flies were less resistant to P.e. infection. Paraquat challenge and P.e. infection likely induce epithelial damage through very different mechanisms. Testing if PM integrity has a role in protecting flies from various stress/damages helps extend the current view of the PM function.</p><p>More generally, the paper technically shifted from Smurf assay upon paraquat challenge to survival analysis upon P.e. infection after coming to the PM. Since the susceptibility to Pe infection does not necessarily indicate barrier dysfunction, Smurf assay data should be still included along with the survival curve upon Pe infection. This will not only allow a better assessment of the significance of Ach/nAchR/Syt4 axis in safeguarding epithelial barrier under various conditions (oxidative stress, bacterial infection…) but also keeps the whole paper technically consistent.</p><p>5. More careful controls for genetic background and readout of epithelial integrity.</p><p>a) About reduced EE generation in alpha2 clones: only one allele was studied, does the RNAi clone or clone mutant for other subunits display a similar phenotype?</p><p>b) The authors should also analyze the intercellular junctions that are critical in creating the epithelial barrier function. This should help justify the rationale of their experimental design, even though this paper finally uncovered that nAchR signaling does not seem to regulate barrier function via a junctional mechanism.</p><p>c) Several points exist regarding the control used for experiments.</p><p>(1) The use of &gt;mCherry-RNAi (at attP2 site) as a control for all RNAi experiments is not appropriate, as this study used many RNAi lines of different genetic backgrounds, including lines from VDRC and also some TRiP lines that may not be inserted in attP2 site.</p><p>(2) The new Syt4 crispr mutant should be ideally isogenized to <italic>w1118</italic> which was used as a control in the paper.</p><p>Alternatively, a deficiency spanning the syt4 gene can be used to rule out potential background effects associated with the crispr mutant.</p><p>(3) For experiments using GeneSwitch, it is ideal to use GS&gt;RNAi flies without RU486 supplementation as control, to make the full potential of the GS system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86381.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have now performed additional studies as requested (summarized below), but unfortunately have not been able to definitively separate neuronal from enteroendocrine Ach sources due to a lack of specific drivers that only affect one cell type. We are including additional driver characterizations in the manuscript (see below) and have also edited the discussion to reflect the current uncertainty about the most relevant source of the ligand. At this point, the most reasonable interpretation of our data is that Ach derived from both EEs and cholinergic neurons (as reflected by ChAT and Pros expression patterns) can act through Ach receptors on epithelial cells to promote barrier function.</p><p>Specifically, we have performed the following additional analyses:</p><p>– We are including images showing that pros-Gal4 is also expressed in enteric neurons (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1D), and that the main difference between pros-gal4 and ChAT-Gal4 is that pros-Gal4 expresses in all EEs, while Chat is only expressed in a subset of EEs. It is thus expected that pros-Gal results in a stronger effect when used to manipulate Ach levels.</p><p>– As requested, we have now performed antibody staining against ChAT in the ChAT-Gal4&gt;GFP background and found that the antibody labels the ChAT-Gal4+ EEs, as well as additional EEs in R4, suggesting that the driver does not capture all ChAT-expressing cells (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>– ChAT-Gal4 BL6793 is based on a 7.4kb BamHI 5' flanking fragment from the &quot;cholinergic&quot; locus (which encodes both ChAT and VAChT) that regulates expression of Gal4 (Salvaterra and Kitamoto, 2001) The ChAT-Gal4 BL60317 driver (w[*]; Mi{Trojan-GAL4.0}ChAT[MI04508-TG4.0]CG7715[MI04508-TG4.0-X]/TM6B, Tb[1]) in turn, is based on a MIMIC insertion into the ChAT gene. The two drivers were compared (Diao et al., 2015) and it was reported that ChAT-Gal4 7.4 doesn’t label all putative cholinergic pCC interneurons (Figure 1C in that paper), while UAS-ChAT rescues the hatching deficits of a ChaMI04508-Gal4/ChaL13 mutants (table 2). These data suggest that ChAT-Gal4 7.4 does not capture all regulatory sequences, while the MIMIC line, which is inserted into the actual genomic locus, more accurately reflects endogenous gene expression. To further corroborate this, we used BL84618 (TI{2A-GAL4}ChAT[2A-GAL4]/TM3, Sb[1]), which was established independently in a CRISPR KO line followed by phiC31 mediated knock-in of ChAT fused to a T2A-Gal4 sequence inserted at or near the 3' end of ChAT, resulting in expression of Gal4 as a separate protein under the control of ChAT regulation ((Deng et al., 2019),Figure 1B and 1C). This line shows the same pattern as BL60317 (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1A, both drivers label EEs in R2 and R4+R5, but not in R3), suggesting that the R3 expression seen with the artificial promoter construct in ChAT-Gal4 BL6793 is likely not a reflection of endogenous ChAT expression.</p><p>– We tested previously reported drivers associated with EE expression, such as BL84614 (w* TI{2A-GAL4}CG325472A-GAL4/FM7a, (Guo et al., 2019)), which also shows expression in enteric neurons (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2A) and BL25373 (dimm-Gal4,(Beebe et al., 2015)), which displayed broad epithelial expression (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B). Furthermore, we selected candidate drivers from a list of neuropeptides (Chen et al., 2016) with low expression in the brain based on scRNAseq data (Davie et al., 2018), but all tested drivers were either not specific to EEs, expressed in other epithelial cells or showed neuronal expression (CCAP-Gal4, Burs-Gal4, Dsk-Gal4, Nplp4-Gal4, Figure 3 —figure supplement 2B).</p><p>– We used Fly Cell Atlas scRNAseq data (Li et al., 2022) to identify additional EE drivers with low neuronal expression. Out of 3 candidate genes, only one had a Gal4 driver available (BL92253, y1 w*; TI{CRIMIC.TG4.1}OrcokininCR02407-TG4.1, Orcokinin-Gal4). While displaying low enteric neuron expression, Orcokinin-Gal4 is unfortunately not entirely EE-specific and labels ECs as well, which led us to not consider this driver further (Figure 3 —figure supplement 2A).</p><p>– We pursued a split-gal4 approach using a EE-reference driver (BL91402, w[*]; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=R57F07-p65.AD.A}attP40; P{y[+t7.7] w[+mC]=UAS-DSCP-6XEGFP}attP2) tested by (Holsopple et al., 2022) and crossed it to a small set of DBD split gal4 drivers (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3). First, we crossed the reference driver to its own DBD counterpart (BL91403), which led to neuronal expression (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3A). We then identified two DBD drivers (BL68537 and BL69158) that were expressed in all gut compartments but not in the brain, using the table available at https://bdsc.indiana.edu/stocks/gal4/midgut_EEs.html. While the BL91402/Bl68537 pair was expressed in enteric neurons, the BL91402/BL69158 combination showed no expression in neurons, but only labeled a very small subset of EEs (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3B). When crossed to a ChAT-DBD driver, we were unable to detect any GFP expression in the epithelium (Figure 3 —figure supplement 3C). Additional characterization of split Gal4 combinations may be a potential avenue to separate expression in EEs and neurons, but extensive screening work will have to be performed. We believe that this would be beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We believe that properly establishing such techniques and performing such studies would constitute a very interesting but exhaustive follow-up study that is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

These experiments would be important to distinguish potential cell-specific roles of the receptor and likely clarify whether EE cell differentiation and epithelial barrier function are part of the same process and linked to the functional role of the receptor in ECs or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very interesting question, and we have now performed various additional studies to explore the role of nAchR signaling in ISC to EE differentiation:</p><p>– To confirm our nAchR α2 MARCM data, we utilized the esgF/O strategy (Jiang et al., 2009) to knock down the expression of other subunits in clones via RNAi and observed a mild trend towards fewer EEs in α2 and α4 knockdowns (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2F). We also made use of a null allele for the α1 subunit of nAchR to generate MARCM clones and once more observed a trend towards fewer EEs per clone (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2E). Since the effects of these perturbations on EE numbers were mild, we have edited our description of the impact of nAchR signaling on EE differentiation. Our data suggest that there is no absolute requirement for nAchR signaling in EE differentiation, but that the robustness of lineage decisions are impacted by Ach.</p><p>– Consistent with the limited impact on clone sizes in the MARCM or F/O experiments, knockdown of various nAchR subunits with an intestinal stem cell (ISC) specific-driver (esg-Gal4, UAS-2xEYFP; Su(H)GBE-Gal80, tubGal80ts) for 72h did not impact ISC proliferation after PE infection (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2D), while still increasing barrier dysfunction and causing reduced survival after challenge with either paraquat or <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> entomophila (PE) (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2B,C). Together, these observations suggest that the barrier dysfunction and mortality may be caused by changes in ISC daughter cells rather than by changes in ISC proliferative capacity. It should be noted that the increase in pH3+ cells we report after EB/EC knockdown of nAchR subunits in Figure 2E is the expected proliferation response of ISCs to stressed ECs that secrete Upd cytokines (Jiang et al., 2009) and is thus uncoupled from the effects of nAchR knockdown in ISCs selectively. We have edited the discussion to clarify this point.</p><p>– Interestingly, when nAchR subunits were knocked down specifically in EBs and ECs for 8 days, we observed no effect on the number of EEs (Figure 3 —figure supplement 1C), suggesting that nAchR may be influencing the lineage commitment of ISCs to the EE fate prior to EB formation.</p><p>– To determine the cell-specific expression pattern of nAchR signaling components across the gut, we referenced scRNAseq data recently reported by us in the Aging Fly Cell Atlas ((Lu et al., 2023), Figure 4 —figure supplement 2). Overall, all nAchR subunits as well as the Ach-producing enzyme ChAT are lowly expressed in the gut epithelium of 5 day old animals, with α4 showing the highest expression levels across all cell types. All subunits are expressed in ECs and EEs, while expression in ISCs and EBs is more variable. Subunit α5 shows an enrichment in EEs. ChAT is preferentially expressed in EEs, but also shows some residual EC expression. The Ach-degrading enzyme Ace on the other hand is more widely expressed and shows an enrichment in ECs, potentially suggesting a local modulation of Ach levels in the gut epithelium. We are now discussing these observations in the manuscript (Figure 4 —figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2H (MARM clones): Would you not expect to see bigger clones upon AchR depletion given that its targeted knockdown in ECs by RNAi results in large increase in ISC proliferation reported in (Figure 2E)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we were a bit surprised by this phenotype, but we believe that it is a reflection of cell-autonomous vs non-autonomous effects of nAchR perturbations as discussed above. In the MARCM experiments only newly formed ECs (and not existing ECs) will be deficient in nAchR, and thus the majority of EC secreted factors (including the peritrophic matrix) will still be intact. When we knock down nAchR in all ECs at once, the perturbation will affect the whole gut and thus result in stress-induced ISC proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The author should better support the functional connection of Ach/AchR signalling and Syt4.</p><p>While the data provided shows that the downregulation of Syt4 mimics that of AchR signaling, it does not demonstrate that they are functionally linked. Validation of syt4 expression by qPCR should be performed and assessment of Syt4 protein levels and cellular localization following AchR knockdown. Genetic interaction experiments should be done to confirm that AchR/Syt4 work in the same pathway to regulate PM/barrier integrity. The authors should also test if EC-specific Syt4 depletion and Syt4 mutants show increased susceptibility to paraquat-induced damage as well, although they did show that these flies were less resistant to P.e. infection. Paraquat challenge and P.e. infection likely induce epithelial damage through very different mechanisms. Testing if PM integrity has a role in protecting flies from various stress/damages helps extend the current view of the PM function</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the need to further explore these interactions, and have now performed additional studies to shed light on the role of Syt4:</p><p>– We confirmed a reduction of Syt4 transcript levels with RT-qPCR after nAchR knockdown in ECs (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1B).</p><p>– We performed genetic interaction experiments as suggested: Combined knockdown of nAchR α4 and Syt4 did not worsen sensitivity to PE infection (Figure S9E) compared to individual knockdown of both genes, indicating that they act in the same pathway. While overexpression of 3xFLAG-mCherry-Syt4 was protective against PE infection (Figure 6E), we were unable to rescue PE infection sensitivity when knocking down AchR and overexpressing Syt4 concomitantly, suggesting that Syt4 expression is required but not sufficient for epithelial integrity downstream of nAchR signaling (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1I,I’,I’’).</p><p>– We have also performed the proposed studies to explore the effect of Paraquat on barrier dysfunction in the Syt4 loss of function conditions. Flies lacking Syt4 are more sensitive to PE infection and display barrier dysfunction (Figure 6C, Figure 6 —figure supplement 1F), but do not display an enhanced sensitivity to paraquat (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1G). Knockdown of Syt4 in ECs leads to inconclusive sensitivity to Paraquat, with some experiments showing elevated sensitivity, and other showing very limited effects (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1H). This surprising observation is in line with findings reported by Kuraishi and colleagues (Kuraishi et al., 2011): Dcy-deficient flies show PM defects and are very sensitive to bacterial infection, but do not succumb to Paraquat challenge, which is attributed to a role for the PM in protecting the animal against bacterial toxins. This further supports our interpretation that maintenance of PM integrity is an important aspect contributing to barrier integrity downstream of nAchR signaling.</p><p>– For localization studies, we tested 2 commercial antibodies against human Syt4 (HPA010574 (Σ) and PA5-52709 (Invitrogen)), but with both antibodies we did not obtain consistent, Syt4-dependent staining. We were unfortunately not able to procure a previously reported antibody against <italic>Drosophila</italic> Syt4 (Adolfsen et al., 2004) or to rapidly make our own antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More generally, the paper technically shifted from Smurf assay upon paraquat challenge to survival analysis upon P.e. infection after coming to the PM. Since the susceptibility to Pe infection does not necessarily indicate barrier dysfunction, Smurf assay data should be still included along with the survival curve upon Pe infection. This will not only allow a better assessment of the significance of Ach/nAchR/Syt4 axis in safeguarding epithelial barrier under various conditions (oxidative stress, bacterial infection…) but also keeps the whole paper technically consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>– To address the reviewer’s concern, we coupled PE infection with the smurf assay by resuspending the bacteria in dye-containing sucrose solution. We observed a clear increase of barrier dysfunction in Syt4-deficient animals compared to <italic>w1118</italic> controls (Figure 6 —figure supplement 1F), pointing to the importance of the PM in protecting the animal against pathogenic virulence factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. More careful controls for genetic background and readout of epithelial integrity.</p><p>a) About reduced EE generation in alpha2 clones: only one allele was studied, does the RNAi clone or clone mutant for other subunits display a similar phenotype?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in our response to point 3, we have performed additional studies knocking down nAchR subunits and inducing MARCM clones using an α1 loss of function mutation (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2E, F). In both cases, there was a weak trend towards reduced EE differentiation. We don’t believe these effects on EE differentiation are critical for other phenotypes, as they only show a partial reduction in EE numbers, and we have now modified the discussion to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors should also analyze the intercellular junctions that are critical in creating the epithelial barrier function. This should help justify the rationale of their experimental design, even though this paper finally uncovered that nAchR signaling does not seem to regulate barrier function via a junctional mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed stainings for the septate junction markers Dlg and coracle, and focused on cross sections of the epithelium to show that the localization of both proteins is mostly unchanged after nAchR knockdown (Figure 2 —figure supplement 2A). Additionally, we assessed the localization of GFP-tagged armadillo protein, which was not affected by nAchR α2 knockdown. (Figure 2I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Several points exist regarding the control used for experiments.</p><p>1) The use of &gt;mCherry-RNAi (at attP2 site) as a control for all RNAi experiments is not appropriate, as this study used many RNAi lines of different genetic backgrounds, including lines from VDRC and also some TRiP lines that may not be inserted in attP2 site.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that choice of appropriate controls is important and have now performed a range of control crosses with NP1-Gal4, tubGal80<sup>ts</sup> to assess the contribution of different backgrounds to barrier dysfunction using the smurf assay (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1A).
