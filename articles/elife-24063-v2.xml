Mated females of the plant bug <italic>Lygus hesperus</italic> are rendered temporarily unattractive by seminal fluids containing myristyl acetate and geranylgeranyl acetate. These antiaphrodisiac pheromones are gradually released from the female’s gonopore, declining until they no longer suppress male courtship. Because starting quantities of these compounds can vary widely, the repellant signal becomes less reliable over time. Evidence was found of a complimentary mechanism that more accurately conveys female mating status. Once inside the female, geranylgeranyl acetate is progressively converted to geranylgeraniol then externalized. Geranylgeraniol counteracts the antiaphrodisiac effect despite having no inherent attractant properties of its own. This is the first evidence for such an anti-antiaphrodisiac pheromone, adding a new element to the communication mechanisms regulating reproductive behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24063.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24063.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24063.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In many animal species, males guard females to prevent rivals from mating so that they can be sure that they fathered the female’s offspring. Some guarding methods work even when the male is not present. For example, the semen of some male insects contains chemicals known as antiaphrodisiacs that repel other males from females who have recently mated. Over the course of several days or weeks, the females expel or degrade the antiaphrodisiacs, making themselves attractive to other mates again. How long it takes to eliminate the antiaphrodisiacs depends on how much of the chemicals were deposited in the first place. Therefore, males could gain an advantage in fertilizing more eggs by depositing excess antiaphrodisiac to make the females unattractive to other mates for a long time.</p><p>The Western tarnished plant bug (<italic>Lygus hesperus</italic>) is an agricultural pest that targets cotton, strawberries and other crops. One antiaphrodisac had already been identified in the semen of male <italic>Lygus</italic> bugs. To investigate whether the males produced any others, Brent et al. tested the molecules emitted by recently mated females. This search identified another potential antiaphrodisiac. However, females are able to convert this second chemical into a third one that neither attracts nor repels males. This “anti-antiaphrodisiac” acts against the males’ two antiaphrodisiacs, and allows the females to more accurately signal when they are ready to mate again, giving them more control over their reproduction.</p><p>Anti-antiaphrodisiacs were not previously known to exist, but now that scientists know where to look, more are likely to be found in other species. A better understanding of how different chemicals interact to influence the mating behavior of insects could also lead to new methods of targeting pests of crops, which are safer for the environment than existing chemical pesticides.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24063.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24063.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>antiaphrodisiac</kwd><kwd>Lygus hesperus</kwd><kwd>passive mate guarding</kwd><kwd>anti-antiaphrodisiac</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>There was no outside funding for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The first evidence is presented of a compound released by mated females that directly counteracts the effects of a seminal anti-aphrodisiac, but has no attractant properties in itself.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical signaling is an essential part of the regulation of mating in many insects, with a combination of pheromonal attractants and repellents indicating the suitability of prospective mates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillott, 2003</xref>). Several species have been shown to rely upon the transfer of an antiaphrodisiac from male to female during mating, the effect of which is to reduce the sexual attractiveness of females concurrent with a post-copulatory ovipositional period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Happ, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilbert, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kukuk, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tompkins and Hall, 1981a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1981b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jallon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Scott, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yew et al., 2009</xref>). The mating male benefits from a reduced risk of sperm competition, while potential successor suitors avoid sperm competition as well as reduce the energetic costs and predation risks associated with courting a female that is unlikely to be receptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillott, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malouines, 2016</xref>). Females benefit from this change in their chemical signature by a reduction in male harassment, which might otherwise negatively impact longevity, ovipositional opportunities, and predation avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forsberg and Wiklund, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Magnhagen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cook et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clutton-Brock and Langley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bateman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">den Hollander and Gwynne, 2009</xref>). This system is particularly useful for species in which females mate only once and for whom a protracted or permanent loss of attractiveness has no negative consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gillott, 2003</xref>). Similarly, mated females can also cease releasing their attractant pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raina, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kingan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ayasse et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eliyahu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fukuyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oku and Yasuda, 2010</xref>), potentially adding to the impact of an antiaphrodisiac. However, in species with females that can or need to mate multiple times over their lives, the antiaphrodisiac might actually fail to accurately convey a female’s reproductive state to conspecific males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malouines, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Often the antiaphrodisiac consists of just one or at most a few chemicals that are repellant to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jallon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zawistowski and Richmond, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krueger et al., 2016</xref>) or that mask a female’s attractants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang and Aldrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). These pheromones are emitted from the female over days or weeks until fully discharged or degraded, at which point the female can attract a new mate. One disadvantage of such a simple signaling system is that the amount of antiaphrodisiac being emitted by a female may not coincide with her readiness to mate again. A male’s maturity, health, or the interval between insemination events can all influence the amount of antiaphrodisiac that he can transfer along with his sperm. There is even evidence that males can intentionally bias the size of their spermatophore in response to female mating history and the local level of intrasexual competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Larsdotter-Mellström et al., 2016</xref>). Such variability in the starting amount can result in a female being ready to mate well before a large load of antiaphrodisiac is sufficiently depleted for her to be attractive again, or being prematurely courted if the male transfers too little. Such signaling uncertainty is potentially costly to the fitness of both females and males, and should create selective pressure to produce a more accurate signaling system that incorporates information beyond the amount of remaining antiaphrodisiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estrada et al., 2011</xref>). To date, the only mechanism shown to allow females to counteract the effect of an antiaphrodisiac is in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which females actively eject mating-transferred cis-vaccenyl acetate from their reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Females of the western tarnished plant bug, <italic>Lygus hesperus</italic> Knight, are polyandrous, mating repeatedly throughout their lives to ensure a steady supply of sperm and to maintain an elevated rate of oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brent and Spurgeon, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brent et al., 2011</xref>). Mating also causes these females to become less attractive than virgins to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent, 2010a</xref>). A sex-pheromone has been identified for this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Byers et al., 2013</xref>), but there is no evidence that the release rate of this chemical blend is affected by the mating status of a female. All evidence suggests that <italic>L. hesperus</italic> female attractiveness is instead modulated by myristyl acetate (MA), a volatile compound transferred during insemination that is released via the female’s vaginal pore, where it is detected by antennating males and acts as an antiaphrodisiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent and Byers, 2011</xref>). Mated females remain unattractive to males for a 4–5 day post-copulatory period during which they also become sexually unreceptive and increase their rate of oviposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent, 2010b</xref>). MA is produced in the male accessory glands and transferred along with other components in the spermatophore during mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent and Byers, 2011</xref>). Some of these other seminal components may also play a role in male assessment of female mating history during courtship. Although females regain their attractiveness to prospective mates over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent, 2010b</xref>), the mechanism by which this is accomplished, either by passive degradation or active countermeasure, had not been determined.</p><p>Here, we undertook a detailed analysis of the composition of <italic>L. hesperus</italic> spermatophores and the compounds emitted by mated females to determine what other volatiles might shape male reproductive behavior and how the compounds change over time. We used gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry coupled with behavioral assays to identify compounds, in addition to MA, that are involved in modulating male responses to potential mates and to monitor their changing concentrations. We obtained the first evidence of a complex sexual communication system that actively counters the male chemical mate-guarding through use of an anti-antiaphrodisiac, to produce an honest indicator of female readiness to mate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Persistence of antiaphrodisiac effect</title><p>Mated females are less likely to be courted by a male than virgin females on the first day after mating (χ<sup>2</sup> = 19.309, df = 1, p&lt;0.001).

We confirmed the presence of the previously identified antiaphrodisiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent and Byers, 2011</xref>) myristyl acetate (MA), and also found two diterpenes, geranylgeranyl acetate (GGA) and geranylgeraniol (GGOH). The first two are found in high concentrations (tens of ng) in the male accessory glands, but GGOH is observed there only in trace quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). When the spermatophore is sampled shortly after mating, the concentration of GGOH begins to increase, peaking two days later and subsequently declining. MA and GGA decline over this same period but the decrease in GGA is much more precipitous, likely as a result of the combined effects of externalization and conversion to GGOH. GC-MS analysis of the headspace of mated females over the same post-mating span indicated that these compounds were externalized in concentrations proportional to the amount found in the spermatophores, although by four days after mating the concentrations were too low to be accurately quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24063.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MSD ion chromatograms on GC column of (<bold>A</bold>) the three standards, and (<bold>B</bold>) a hexane extract of five pooled spermatophores excised from females two days after mating.</title><p>Highlighted by arrows are peaks with matching retention times for myristyl acetate (MA), geranylgeranyl acetate (GGA) and geranylgeraniol (GGOH).

Our previous investigation of this phenomenon led us to conclude that when a male inseminates a female, he transfers an antiaphrodisiac that is slowly released through the female’s gonopore and dissuades other males from courting her, and that the gradual dissipation of this antiaphrodisiac restores the female’s attractiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent and Byers, 2011</xref>). This simple picture was consistent with the conclusions of previous antiaphrodisiac studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schulz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forsberg and Wiklund, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carlson and Langley, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlechter-Helas et al., 2011</xref>), however the results of our current investigation indicate a more complicated signaling system regulating <italic>L. hesperus</italic> reproductive behavior. Three compounds appear to be involved: myristyl acetate, the previously identified antiaphrodisiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brent and Byers, 2011</xref>), geranylgeranyl acetate and geranylgeraniol. The final compound, rather than being transferred directly from the male like the first two, is primarily produced within the female via chemical conversion of the GGA. While MA’s role has been reconfirmed here, GGOH appears to play a counteracting role, diminishing or negating the effect of MA. In no instance did application of GGOH result in courtship rates being elevated above that for solvent controls, indicating that the compound does not act as an attractant or excitatory agent. The only observable effect was to counteract the antiaphrodisiac effect, thus GGOH appears to serve as an anti-antiaphrodisiac.</p><p>The signaling function of GGA is not as easily categorized. When applied by itself, GGA did not significantly affect male courtship rates, although some depression is visible. GGA also did not make females less likely to be courted when combined with MA. Of course the dose of MA used in the mixture may have been sufficient to achieve the maximal level of repellency to males by itself, leaving little room for an additive effect to be observed. However, when added to a mix of MA and GGOH, GGA was able to counteract the anti-antiaphrodisiac effect of GGOH. The resulting reduction in female attractiveness suggests that GGA contributes towards the antiaphrodisiac effect, but only in a context-specific manner. The depletion of GGA over time will diminish this repellant effect, and when combined with the commensurate increase in GGOH, will accelerate the process of the female again becoming attractive.</p><p>Compared to our previously hypothesized single-compound signal communication system of <italic>L. hesperus</italic>, the greater complexity we have found could facilitate much better coordination between male courtship and the cessation of the female refractory period. During this three to seven day span subsequent to insemination, a female refrains from interaction with courting males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent, 2010a</xref>), a behavioral transition largely driven by male seminal products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brent et al., 2016</xref>). Because the female may copulate several times throughout her life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brent et al., 2011</xref>), she cannot afford to have prospective mates repelled by an overly persistent antiaphrodisiac. For a certain period after mating an antiaphrodisiac would be an honest indicator of a female’s receptivity and would help prevent males from engaging in unnecessary sperm competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estrada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malouines, 2016</xref>). However, given that the amount of MA that a male transfers can be highly variable, the signal would not be a reliable indicator of a female’s suitability and readiness to mate over the natural refractory period. Like females of <italic>Pieris napi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2004</xref>), there is no indication that <italic>L. hesperus</italic> females can modulate the rate of antiaphrodisiac release, so they are unlikely to have control over how quickly the supply can be depleted. Thus, if the initial MA concentration in a spermatophore is quite high, such as when contributed by a male that has not mated for a week or more, the female would be rendered unattractive well past when she again becomes reproductively receptive such that both sexes lose out on potential mating opportunities. If the initial MA is quite low, such as when contributed by a male that had already mated within the past day, a still refractory female would be harassed by unwanted suitors.</p><p>By utilizing additional signaling elements in this reproductive communication system, males can more accurately estimate the likelihood that a female is suitable to mate again, an added capability that would have been selectively favored (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arak and Enquist, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estrada et al., 2011</xref>). During the first couple of days after mating when male courtship is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent, 2010b</xref>), the combined emissions of MA and GGA are greater than GGOH. Once there is sufficient GGOH produced to offset the antiaphrodisiac effect, subsequent males will try to court a mated female. The starting concentration of MA and GGA can vary, so long as they are above activation thresholds needed to repel other males. The relative quantities of MA and GGA transferred from a male are consistently similar although absolute amounts can vary between males. The amount of GGOH ultimately produced within the female is intrinsically tied to the starting quantity of GGA. Thus the signaling system is not affected by the variability between males in the quantities of pheromones transferred because only the time-dependent ratios are what matter. A high starting concentration of GGA will eventually produce a commensurately high concentration of GGOH to offset a high starting level of MA. So long as the conversion of GGA to GGOH occurs at a predictable rate, males will be able to accurately determine when a female is ending her refractory period.</p><p>It is likely that a combination of absolute quantities and relative proportions of these chemicals determine female attractiveness. This is suggested by some apparent inconsistency in the data. By the second day after mating, the concentration of GGOH appears comparable to that of MA, and GGA is substantially reduced. Despite these early shifts in proportions, the courtship rates remain suppressed until the fifth day after mating. GGA at this late stage may have fallen to such a low level that it no longer has a synergistic effect with MA to counteract the GGOH. We show here that MA has an activation threshold to be effective, but after that relative amounts of GGA and GGOH may be key modulators. Relative amounts of other, as yet unidentified, minor seminal constituents might also influence female attractiveness. Another consideration is that the threshold concentration identified for MA, and activation concentrations of the other compounds, may be substantially lower than our tests indicate. The external application of the chemical compounds does not fully mimic their normal release from the female gonopore. Applied chemicals can rapidly degrade, volatilize, or bind with chemicals on the cuticle. This would quickly diminish the perceivable amounts of the regulatory pheromones during the course of the bioassay, so that females avoided by males at the start were attractive again by the end. With each compound having different chemical properties, the effects of external application will not necessarily be consistent in these tests. Additional assays are needed to sort out the contributions toward female attractiveness of concentrations and proportions.</p><p>Another noteworthy finding was the variability in the responsiveness of males to these compounds. Even under the highest topical dosages of MA some males did not stop courting. This may be the result of diminished odorant receptor expression in males that cannot detect the antiaphrodisiac. Alternatively, a subgroup of males may employ a different mating strategy from the norm and are willing to tolerate sperm competition by indiscriminately courting every female encountered regardless of indicators of recent mating. This can be periodically rewarding as they are likely to be the first to access a female coming out of her refractory period earlier than her release of MA would otherwise indicate. We have also found a small but consistent subset of females that fail to enter into a refractory period, mating multiple times within a short span. Males willing to mate with one of these promiscuous females may benefit by fertilizing at least a portion of her eggs.</p><p>Although this is the first recorded instance of a pheromone being utilized as an anti-antiaphrodisiac, such compounds may not be rare. Just as it is likely that the occurrence of antiaphrodisiacs is far more widespread than has been reported due to a lack of thorough investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Malouines, 2016</xref>), anti-antiaphrodisiacs may have been overlooked until now because no one knew to search for them. Given the advantages of a two-dimensional chemical signaling system, it is quite likely that this is not the only instance. In fact, the evolution of a controlled antiaphrodisiac expulsion mechanism in <italic>Drosophila</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laturney and Billeter, 2016</xref>), supports the likely occurrence of other such active counter measures to chemical mate guarding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>L. hesperus</italic> were obtained from an established colony at the USDA-ARS Arid Land Agricultural Research Center (Maricopa, AZ, USA).

Adults were produced from groups of mixed-sex nymphs reared in waxed paper containers covered with nylon mesh to ensure adequate ventilation and light exposure.

All males were aged 7–9 days post-eclosion to ensure they were sexually mature and willing to copulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brent, 2010a</xref>). They were isolated from the opposite gender throughout adulthood to prevent their behavior towards prospective mates from being influenced by post-mating refractoriness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent, 2010b</xref>), and to guarantee the males were naïve with regard to the odor associated with mated and unreceptive females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brent, 2010b</xref>). A large cohort of 7d old virgin females were housed with similarly aged virgin males and allowed to mate for six hours. A group of 300 mated females were selected from this pool based on the presence of a visible spermatophore just below the surface of the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cooper, 2012</xref>). The attractiveness of these mated females to males was determined at 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 days after mating. Due to mortality over the test period, daily sample sizes ranged from 47 to 58. Females and males were only used once. During the interval between mating and testing, females were held in isolation in clean 1.5 × 5.0 cm covered glass Petri dishes with a 1 inch section of green bean and two sunflower seeds, which were changed out every other day. To determine post-mating attractiveness, a male was introduced to a female’s dish and the pair was observed for 1 hr during which all instances of courtship were recorded. Courtships were distinguished from incidental approaches by characteristic male behaviors indicating the intent to mate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strong et al., 1970</xref>).

Females were then housed in individual Petri dishes, as described above, then dissected at different intervals to remove the seminal depository and the spermatophore. The initial spermatophore sampling occurred within three hours of mating. Subsequent samples were taken every 22–25 hr thereafter. For each sample, five spermatophores were pooled.

Using the plant bug Lygus hesperus the authors show that females convert a male-derived compound (geranyl geranyl acetate; GGA), that is transferred during mating, into geranylgeraniol (GGOH). Using a combination of behavioral and chemical analysis, the authors conclude that female-produced GGOH counteracts the anti-antiaphrodisiac effects of myristyl acetate (MA), another male-derived compound.</p><p>While the finding is interesting and novel, there are a couple issues of quantification and analysis that need to be cleared up before the study is ready for publication.</p><p>1) The chemical profile measured from mated females does not completely correlate with the loss of female attractiveness.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that mated female attractiveness is still suppressed at 4 days post-mating. However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> reveals that by day 4, MA, GGA, and GGOH from the spermatophore transferred to females are each below 0.5 ng. According to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, MA is no longer effective as an anti-aphrodisiac at 0.5 ng. Also, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, equimolar amounts of GGOH to MA are sufficient to counter the anti-aphrodisiac effects of MA. By Day 2 post-mating, GGOH and MA levels in the spermatophore are approximately equivalent yet female attractiveness is still reduced.</p><p>While MA contributes to the post-mating female loss of attraction, it may not be the only factor. Similarly, the conversion of GGA to GGOH may have anti-antiaphrodisiac effects but this process alone is not sufficient for restoring female attractiveness. Some discussion of the fact that not all the effects can be accounted for is required.</p><p>2) It is interesting that the addition of GGOH is sufficient to counteract mating-induced loss of attractiveness in newly mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, females are treated with 500 ng of GGOH. Yet, only approx. 1-1.5 ng is found in the spermatophores from mated females. The amount used for treatment is excessive and makes it difficult to interpret the results. In order for these experiments to be meaningful, the authors need to show a dose-dependency of GGOH and its anti-antiaphrodisiac effects that is within biologically meaningful levels.</p><p>3) Statistical analysis could be improved: (i) why are authors using 2x2 Khi square, and not nx2 Khi square with post-hoc determination of significance?; (ii) why not compar the temporal evolution of the MA, GGA and GGOH concentrations and correlate them with behavioural data?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24063.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>While the finding is interesting and novel, there are a couple issues of quantification and analysis that need to be cleared up before the study is ready for publication.</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The chemical profile measured from mated females does not completely correlate with the loss of female attractiveness.</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that mated female attractiveness is still suppressed at 4 days post-mating.

Similarly, the conversion of GGA to GGOH may have anti-antiaphrodisiac effects but this process alone is not sufficient for restoring female attractiveness. Some discussion of the fact that not all the effects can be accounted for is required.</italic> </p><p>We agree that what we present may not be the entire mechanism involved in regulating female attractiveness and that our data is not completely consistent. We more fully address these issues within the Discussion. We point out that a large part of the perceived discrepancies are likely due to limitations of the available methodology. While the amounts extracted from females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) are accurate in relative amounts, the measures may underestimate the real amounts present in living females because of possible destruction/isomerization and binding of the three compounds when extracted with other oils/fats and chemicals in insect body tissues. This is a potential problem in all studies of chemical extraction from insects. Additionally, male sensitivity to the pheromones is likely to have been underestimated. Although our results suggest that between 0.5 and 5 ng of MA is needed to cause an anti-aphrodisiac effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the activation concentration might be considerably lower. Application of the putative pheromones to the external body does not fully mimic the natural situation of release from the female’s gonopore. Externally applied chemicals can be rapidly degraded or become bound, leading to an exponential decline in release rate over the span of the bioassay. Further, each chemical will respond differently on the cuticle, causing increasing discrepancies in relative concentrations during the bioassay.</p><p>We agree that MA may not be the only factor in post-mating loss of female attraction, but the preponderance of evidence in this and our previous study point to MA as the primary determining factor. We provide some evidence that GGA may contribute to loss of female attraction, and this may be significant at the natural release rates and ratios which are difficult to replicate in bioassays. The loss of MA and GGA certainly contributes in large part to restoring female attractiveness. The conversion of GGA to GGOH within the female would accelerate the process of removing GGA (contributing to restoring female attractiveness) as well as producing the GGOH that would also contribute to restoring female attractiveness. Other processes in the female that removed MA would also contribute to restoring female attractiveness. These issues are now covered more thoroughly in the Discussion</p><p> <italic>2) It is interesting that the addition of GGOH is sufficient to counteract mating-induced loss of attractiveness in newly mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, females are treated with 500 ng of GGOH. Yet, only approx. 1-1.5 ng is found in the spermatophores from mated females. The amount used for treatment is excessive and makes it difficult to interpret the results. In order for these experiments to be meaningful, the authors need to show a dose-dependency of GGOH and its anti-antiaphrodisiac effects that is within biologically meaningful levels.</italic> </p><p>We agree that a test of dose-dependency of GGOH on its anti-anti-aphrodisiac effects would be useful for a better understanding. The original dosage of 500 ng was chosen because the compounds could be degraded or bound by cuticular chemicals. It is also a typical quantity compared with many other semiochemicals. We merely wanted to be sure to counter the effects of MA and GGA in newly mated females. However to ensure the acceptability of the results, we have repeated this part of the experiment using topical applications of GGOH on newly mated females with the more biologically relevant dosages of 1 and 10 ng. Even at these lower concentrations, the GGOH was still found to be effective at blocking the anti-aphrodisiac properties of the seminal constituents of newly mated females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) Statistical analysis could be improved: (i) why are authors using 2x2 Khi square, and not nx2 Khi square with post-hoc determination of significance?; (ii) why not compar the temporal evolution of the MA, GGA and GGOH concentrations and correlate them with behavioural data?</italic></p><p>We have clarified our Materials and methods to reflect that n x 2 chi-square analyses were performed for data in Figures 5 to7 to first determine whether there were significant effects on the proportions of females being courted. Once significance was indicated, individual 2 x 2 analyses were performed, with post-hoc adjustments (Dunn-Šidák correction) for multiple tests. For the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, each daily test was independent, thus the 2 x 2 chi-square analysis by day was directly applied.</p><p>Direct comparisons of the temporal changes in pheromone concentration and behavior was not done because these kinds of data were collected under very different (essentially incompatible) conditions using different sets of animals. Release of these compound is exceedingly difficult to measure because of their volatility and absorption by SPME or other collection methods. Extraction can determine the ratios and amounts reasonably well (except if there is differential component absorption to tissue components) but the comparison in bioassays is again difficult because of the chemical absorption by the cuticle and the exponential decline in release rate of each component and the widely differing volatilities of MA compared to GGA and GGOH. We do weigh the likely link in the temporal information presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> during the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
