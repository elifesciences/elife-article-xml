conserved and carry out well-defined cellular functions in eukaryotes. However, many lineages like <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals encode divergent non-canonical Arps whose roles remain unknown. To elucidate the function of non-canonical Arps, we focus on <italic>Arp53D</italic>, which is highly expressed in testes and retained throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution. We show that Arp53D localizes to fusomes and actin cones, two germline-specific actin structures critical for sperm maturation, via a unique N-terminal tail. Surprisingly, we find that male fertility is not impaired upon <italic>Arp53D</italic> loss, yet population cage experiments reveal that <italic>Arp53D</italic> is required for optimal fitness in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. To reconcile these findings, we focus on <italic>Arp53D</italic> function in ovaries and embryos where it is only weakly expressed. We find that under heat stress <italic>Arp53D</italic>-knockout (KO) females lay embryos with reduced nuclear integrity and lower viability; these defects are further exacerbated in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO embryos. Thus, despite its relatively recent evolution and primarily testis-specific expression, non-canonical <italic>Arp53D</italic> is required for optimal embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>fertility</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Courtney M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99GM137038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schroeder</surname><given-names>Courtney M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM074108</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malik</surname><given-names>Harmit S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Non-canonical ‘testis-specific’ actin-related protein (Arp), Arp53D, is critical for early embryonic development in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, revealing important roles for lineage-specific, divergent, testis-expressed non-canonical Arps outside the male germline in animals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Actin is an ancient, highly conserved protein that performs many cytoplasmic and nuclear functions vital for eukaryotes, including division, motility, cargo transport, DNA repair, and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schrank et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wei et al., 2020</xref>). Its origin predates eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Hawse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muller et al., 2005</xref>); both bacteria and archaea encode actin-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">van den Ent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Izoré et al., 2016</xref>). Actin forms many protein-protein interactions, including with other actin monomers, to perform its various functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dominguez and Holmes, 2011</xref>). Because of its interactions and functional importance, actin evolves under stringent evolutionary constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Hawse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). For example, despite being separated by 800 million years of evolution, actin proteins from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> are 98% identical. In addition to actin, most eukaryotes encode an expanded repertoire of actin-related proteins (Arps) because of ancient gene duplications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Hawse, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Muller et al., 2005</xref>). These Arps have specialized for a wide range of functions, including regulation of actin (Arps 2/3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mullins et al., 1998</xref>), chromatin remodeling (Arps 4–8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harata et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blessing et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klages-Mundt et al., 2018</xref>), and microtubule-based transport (Arps 1 and 10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Muhua et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lee et al., 2001</xref>). Although all Arps maintain a conserved actin fold, they have specialized for their novel roles via distinct structural insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen and Shen, 2007</xref>). These ‘canonical’ Arps significantly diverged from each other early in eukaryote evolution, but now evolve under stringent evolutionary constraints, like actin.</p><p>Many eukaryotic genomes also encode evolutionarily young, rapidly evolving ‘non-canonical’ Arps. Unlike cytoplasmic actin and canonical Arps, which are ubiquitously expressed, non-canonical Arps appear to be exclusively expressed in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Machesky and May, 2001</xref>). The first described ‘non-canonical’ Arp was <italic>D. melanogaster Arp53D</italic> (named for its cytogenetic location), which was shown to be most highly expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fyrberg et al., 1994</xref>). Its presence only in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and its unusual expression pattern led to <italic>Arp53D</italic> being mostly ignored in studies of cytoskeletal proteins. However, phylogenomic surveys reveal that ‘non-canonical’ Arps are not as rare as previously believed. Recently, we described a 14-million-year-old <italic>Drosophila</italic> clade that independently acquired four non-canonical <italic>Arp</italic> genes that are all expressed primarily in the male germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schroeder et al., 2020</xref>). Mammals also encode at least seven non-canonical Arps that are predominantly expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heid et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boëda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2012</xref>), at least some of which localize to actin structures in sperm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boëda et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, accumulating evidence suggests that non-canonical Arps play fundamentally distinct cytoskeletal functions from canonical Arps, which might explain both their tissue specificity as well as their unusual evolution.</p><p>To gain insight into the functions of non-canonical Arps, we performed evolutionary, genetic, and cytological analyses of <italic>Arp53D</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We showed that <italic>Arp53D</italic> is conserved over 65 million years of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution, suggesting that it performs a critical function. Unlike actin or canonical Arps, we found that <italic>Arp53D</italic> has evolved under positive selection. Our cytological analyses reveal that Arp53D specifically localizes to the fusome and actin cones, two specialized actin structures found in the male germline. We show that Arp53D's unique 40 amino acid N-terminal extension (relative to actin) is necessary and sufficient to recruit it to germline actin structures. Its abundant expression in testes, together with its specialized localization, led us to hypothesize that <italic>Arp53D</italic> loss would lower male fertility. Contrary to this prediction, we found that <italic>Arp53D</italic> knockouts (KO) exhibit increased male fertility. The detrimental effect of <italic>Arp53D</italic> presence on male fertility is at odds with its long-term retention in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Indeed, population cage experiments confirm that wildtype <italic>Arp53D</italic> has a net fitness benefit in populations relative to Arp53D KOs, despite the increased fertility of KO males. Seeking to explain this paradox, we investigated whether <italic>Arp53D</italic> also has functions outside the male germline. Despite its low expression in females and early embryos, we find that loss of <italic>Arp53D</italic> in the female lowers embryonic viability under heat stress. Our study finds that a non-canonical ‘testis-expressed’ Arp is evolutionarily retained throughout <italic>Drosophila</italic> for critical roles outside the male germline.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Arp53D</italic> encodes a rapidly evolving non-canonical Arp that has been retained for over 65 million years</title><p><italic>Arp53D</italic> was first identified as a male-specific Arp gene on chromosome 2 of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fyrberg et al., 1994</xref>). It was subsequently shown to be phylogenetically more closely related to <italic>actin</italic> than to any of the canonical Arps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodson and Hawse, 2002</xref>). A subsequent study proposed that <italic>Arp53D</italic> arose from retroduplication of <italic>Act88F</italic>, which encodes a <italic>Drosophila</italic> muscle actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2007</xref>). However, <italic>Arp53D</italic> is almost equally similar to <italic>Act88F</italic> (59.76%) as <italic>Act5C</italic> (59.2%), which encodes a cytoplasmic actin, at the nucleotide level. <italic>Arp53D</italic> was not found in any other non-insect genomes in a broad survey of eukaryotes, raising the possibility that it only exists in a few <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. To date its evolutionary origin, we investigated <italic>Arp53D</italic> presence in sequenced genomes from <italic>Drosophila</italic> and closely related <italic>Diptera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drosophila 12 Genomes Consortium et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhou and Bachtrog, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Renschler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kurek et al., 1998</xref>). Using phylogeny and shared synteny, we found clear orthologs in species as divergent as <italic>Drosophila lebanonensis</italic> (also known as <italic>Scaptodrosophila lebanonensis</italic>) but not in more divergent Dipteran species such as <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>, <italic>Glossina morsitans,</italic> or <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Like canonical Arps, Arp53D includes an actin fold domain, which consists of four subdomains and a central ATP-binding pocket. However, in contrast to actin, Arp53D has an extended 40-amino acid N-terminal domain that is predicted to be mostly unstructured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). All <italic>Arp53D</italic> orthologs encode this extended N-terminal domain, which is also the most rapidly evolving segment of Arp53D in sequence and length. For example, N-terminal domains from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>S. lebanonensis</italic> Arp53D proteins are only 42% identical, whereas the actin fold domain is 70% identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to Arp53D, actin homologs are 100% identical over a comparable period of evolutionary divergence. We found no homology between the N-terminal region of Arp53D to any coding or non-coding sequence in any <italic>Drosophila</italic> (or other) genome. The ancient evolutionary origin of <italic>Arp53D</italic> does not allow us to determine whether <italic>Arp53D</italic>’s unique N-terminus was acquired from the intergenic DNA sequence upon retroduplication or via subsequent insertions after retroduplication.</p><p>Since actin evolves under extremely strong selective constraint, the higher between-species divergence of <italic>Arp53D</italic> could simply reflect more relaxed selective constraints. Alternatively, it could reflect a faster than expected divergence of <italic>Arp53D</italic> due to diversifying selection. To distinguish between these possibilities, we took advantage of publicly available sequences of hundreds of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lack et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lack et al., 2016</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.popfly.org">http://www.popfly.org</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hervas et al., 2017</xref>) to carry out McDonald–Kreitman (MK) tests for positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">McDonald and Kreitman, 1991</xref>). The MK test compares the ratio of non-synonymous (amino acid replacing, P<sub>N</sub>) to synonymous (P<sub>s</sub>) polymorphisms within a species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>) to fixed differences between species (D<sub>N</sub> and D<sub>S</sub>, <italic>D. melanogaster-D. simulans</italic>); we exclude low-frequency polymorphisms since they have not been as strongly subject to selective scrutiny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fay et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bierne and Eyre-Walker, 2004</xref>). If selective constraints are not significantly different within species versus between species, we expect D<sub>N</sub>:D<sub>S</sub> to be approximately equal to P<sub>N</sub>:P<sub>s</sub>. If D<sub>N</sub>:D<sub>S</sub> is greater than P<sub>N</sub>:P<sub>s</sub>, then we deduce that the gene has evolved under positive selection. Cytoplasmic actin genes have no non-synonymous changes (fixed or polymorphic); thus, they are not rapidly evolving and were not analyzed. We analyzed canonical Arps found in most eukaryotes using the MK test and found no evidence of positive selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, <italic>Arp53D</italic> has evolved under positive selection during <italic>D. melanogaster-D. simulans</italic> divergence (p=0.04, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as D<sub>N</sub>:D<sub>S</sub> (23:29) is much higher than P<sub>N</sub>:P<sub>s</sub> (1:9). When examining the MK results in detail, we noticed that far fewer <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> strain sequences had passed our quality control tests for <italic>Arp53D</italic> than for canonical Arps. Upon further investigation, we identified a common 15 bp (five amino acid) deletion polymorphism in <italic>Arp53D</italic>. This deletion polymorphism could have interesting functional consequences, but also confounded our MK tests as it initially caused many strains to drop out of our analysis because their sequence contained unknown bases in this region. Redoing the MK test for <italic>Arp53D</italic> including all strains yielded an even more significant positive selection result (p=0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The MK results indicate that at least some of the non-synonymous fixed differences between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans Arp53D</italic> are adaptive substitutions, and these changes are distributed throughout the whole gene, including several in Arp53D’s unique N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These findings imply that the higher rate of Arp53D protein evolution is not simply a result of relaxed selective constraints; some of these changes have likely been evolutionarily advantageous.</p><p>These MK results revealed that <italic>Arp53D</italic> evolved under positive selection in recent evolutionary time (since <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic> divergence) but do not pinpoint which residue changes were functionally important. We wondered whether positive selection acted recurrently upon a subset of Arp53D residues over a longer period of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution. We therefore carried out maximum likelihood analyses using the PAML suite’s CODEML algorithm. We found no evidence for recurrent positive selection on any <italic>Arp53D</italic> codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This suggests that the signature of positive selection does not recur in the same subset of residues. Overall, our evolutionary analyses find that <italic>Arp53D</italic> is an evolutionarily young, non-canonical Arp that is subject to long-term retention and atypical selective constraints, consistent with it performing a distinct function from canonical Arps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arp53D localizes to specific actin structures late in sperm development</title><p><italic>Arp53D</italic> was first shown to be expressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fyrberg et al., 1994</xref>).

When actin cones begin to polymerize (indicated by a gradual accumulation of filamentous actin), we find that sfGFP-Arp53D is enriched along the axoneme and slightly overlaps the base of sperm nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The puncta observed along the axoneme are usually observed with immunofluorescence but not live imaging, suggesting that this axonemal staining may be non-specific. Yet the GFP puncta at actin cones are consistently found with both fixed samples and live imaging, suggesting that it is not an immunofluorescence artifact. At this stage, sfGFP-Arp53D localization is very similar to actin at the base of the sperm head. However, when actin cones are fully formed, sfGFP-Arp53D is visible as a highly concentrated structure at the front of the actin cone, distinct from actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, E</xref>). Subsequently, sfGFP-Arp53D remains associated with actin cones as they translocate down the microtubule-based axoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, sfGFP-Arp53D localizes to the leading edge of the actin cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>), which is composed of branched actin networks and is the site of active cytoplasm extrusion. In contrast, the rear of the actin cone is composed of parallel actin bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Noguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Previous studies have shown that an actin-binding molecular motor—myosin VI—also localizes to the leading edge of actin cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rogat and Miller, 2002</xref>). Indeed, we find that a testis-specific myosin VI subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frank et al., 2006</xref>) localizes proximally to Arp53D at the leading edge, though its distribution on the cone extends beyond where Arp53D is most concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wasbrough et al., 2010</xref>) and our cytological analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) do not detect Arp53D in mature sperm. We therefore conclude that Arp53D protein must be degraded in the waste bag along with the rest of the actin cone apparatus.</p><p>Our cytological analyses reveal that Arp53D specifically localizes to two germline-specific actin structures in a dynamic manner. It first localizes to the fusome during meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Once spermatid elongation is complete, Arp53D moves to actin cones as they are being constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and remains associated with actin cones until it is ultimately destroyed along with the rest of the actin cones following the completion of sperm individualization. Notably, for most of spermatogenesis, Arp53D localization is distinct from actin, which localizes more broadly. Thus, Arp53D appears to carry out specialized roles at unique cytoskeletal machineries during spermatogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Arp53D’s unique N-terminal extension is necessary and sufficient for recruitment to germline cytoskeletal structures</title><p>We investigated whether Arp53D’s unique 40-residue N-terminal domain mediates its specialized localization to the fusome and actin cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The sfGFP-△N-term protein may be less stable than full-length Arp53D, yet we believe the actin-like domain is most likely as stable as canonical actin. Based on the cytology, we conclude that the N-terminus is necessary for Arp53D’s localization to these specialized germline actin structures. Since sfGFP-△N-term-Arp53D was not detected at any actin structure in the testis, we further conclude that Arp53D’s actin fold domain is too divergent to co-polymerize with actin in vivo, at least within our detection limits.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>N-terminal domain of Arp53D is necessary and sufficient for localization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two additional transgenic fly lines were generated with the transgene on the third chromosome in the wildtype background.

Furthermore, despite encoding an identical actin fold domain, this chimeric protein does not co-colocalize with actin throughout the developing cysts.

This measure of male ‘fertility’ encapsulates number of sperm produced, their fertilization success, and successful development of sired embryos to adulthood.

Together, these data reveal that lack of <italic>Arp53D</italic> can increase male fertility.</p><p>We hypothesized that although <italic>Arp53D</italic> presence intrinsically decreases male fertility, it might confer a competitive advantage in the presence of other males. To test this possibility, we mated WT females to both WT males and <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males in the same vials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). If WT and <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males had equal probabilities of successful fertilization, then 50% of adult progeny would be fathered by WT or <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). However, we found that <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males sired nearly 70% of the progeny in the presence of WT males, implying that they had a significant fertility advantage even in a competitive situation (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Our experiments show that <italic>Arp53D</italic> presence can be significantly deleterious to male fertility, both in isolation as well as in competition.</p><p>One possible consequence of Arp53D loss in KO males could be gross disruption of the germline actin structures to which it localizes. Contrary to this expectation, we found no gross defects in overall organization or actin intensity of actin cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or the fusome in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E</xref>). We assessed whether <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> flies have increased fertility because they produce more sperm than WT flies by staining for DNA in the seminal vesicle, where mature sperm are deposited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2F</xref>). We did not find a significant difference between <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> and WT males in seminal vesicle size, suggesting that they produced roughly equal amounts of sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2G</xref>). However, when we observed sperm development and compared the number of actin cones in WT versus KO testes, we found that the <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> males had significantly more cysts with actin cones per testis than WT males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that sperm production is accelerated upon loss of <italic>Arp53D</italic>.</p><p>We next sought to determine if the <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic>’s increase in male fertility is specific to the <italic>Arp53D</italic> locus, rather than being due to any off-target CRISPR mutations. When generating the KO flies, we inserted an attP site, which serves as a ‘landing site’ for transgenes into the <italic>Arp53D</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We took advantage of this attP site to reinsert tagless WT <italic>Arp53D</italic> under the control of its endogenous promoter into the <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> fly line that was isogenized in the Oregon-R background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2H</xref>). We found that male fertility only showed a slight decrease upon presence of the <italic>Arp53D</italic> rescue transgene (not statistically significant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). We attribute the lack of a significant fertility rescue to the lower expression of the rescue transgene compared to endogenous <italic>Arp53D</italic> in the Oregon-R background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2I</xref>). This apparent dependence on high expression is consistent with our previous observation that heterozygous males have fertility that is closer to KO males than to WT males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The alternative possibility is that the male fertility effect is independent of <italic>Arp53D</italic>. However, this scenario would require a distinct gain-of-function mutation for male fertility in a gene that is closely linked to the <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO to have survived repeated backcrossing. Although we cannot formally rule out this latter possibility due to lack of a robust effect of the <italic>Arp53D</italic> rescue transgene on male fertility, we find it very unlikely. In either case, we can unambiguously conclude that loss of <italic>Arp53D</italic> does not impair male fertility, despite testes being the primary tissue of <italic>Arp53D</italic> expression. Our findings thus still leave unanswered the question of why <italic>Arp53D</italic> was largely retained over 65 million years of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Loss of <italic>Arp53D</italic> results in an overall fitness disadvantage</title><p>We found that <italic>Arp53D</italic> loss does not reduce male fertility, yet <italic>Arp53D</italic> has been retained throughout most of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution, suggesting that its presence must have positive consequences. We, therefore, tested whether <italic>Arp53D</italic> loss confers any fitness disadvantage in laboratory populations. For this, we competed KO and WT alleles of <italic>Arp53D</italic> over multiple generations at room temperature using a population cage experiment. This experimental design is more powerful than single-generation mating experiments as it tests for more subtle fitness differences at all lifecycle stages in males and females. In this assay, we used <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO flies that were isogenized in a <italic>w1118</italic> genetic background (six backcrosses). We used <italic>w1118</italic> because it lacks eye pigmentation, making detection of DsRed fluorescence more efficient. Since <italic>w1118</italic> flies were used as the competing ‘WT’ flies, KO and WT strains are isogenic except for the absence of <italic>Arp53D</italic> and presence of eye-expressed <italic>DsRed</italic> in the KO allele at the <italic>Arp53D</italic> locus.</p><p>We began the experiment with three replicate populations consisting of 50 KO females, 25 KO males, and 25 WT (<italic>w1118</italic>) males using an excess of KO flies (75%) to put the <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO allele at a starting advantage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). At each generation, we randomly selected 50 females and 50 males to act as founders for the next generation (without scoring the fluorescent eye marker for the <italic>Arp53D-</italic>KO allele) and quantified the remaining progeny for the presence of the <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). If there were no advantages associated with the WT <italic>Arp53D</italic> genotype, then homozygous WT flies (lacking <italic>DsRed</italic>) should dramatically decrease within 20 generations. In contrast to this expectation, we found a robust and consistent increase in frequency of the homozygous WT genotype across all three replicate populations despite stochastic effects due to genetic drift given the small effective population sizes. The frequency of the homozygous WT genotype reached an average proportion of 67% among the three replicate populations in just 20 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This rise in frequency suggests a strong fitness disadvantage for the KO genotype. To infer the selective coefficients associated with this increased fitness, we modeled three different scenarios that varied the relative fitness of heterozygote genotypes (i.e., equal to homozygous WT, equal to homozygous KO, or intermediate between HOM and WT; see Materials and methods). Based on these models, we find that the rapid, consistent rise of the WT allele in just 20 generations is most consistent with the first scenario, in which the frequency of the heterozygotes is the same as homozygous WT genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, we infer the WT allele of <italic>Arp53D</italic> confers between a 30–40% selective advantage over the KO allele per generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, <italic>Arp53D</italic>-dependent zygotic effects are nearly masked in the presence of maternal <italic>Arp53D</italic> contributions. Overall, our genetic experiments allow us to conclude that maternal contributions of Arp53D are primarily responsible for its contribution to <italic>Drosophila</italic> fitness.

Following fertilization, WT <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos undergo rapid mitotic divisions. Consequently, mitotic fidelity is often sacrificed, leading to damaged nuclei that are allowed to cycle but are removed from the cell cortex and deposited in the embryo’s yolk at a discrete stage of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>). This leads to gaps in an otherwise ordered array of nuclei on the surface of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. This phenotype has been referred to as ‘nuclear fallout,’ which increases due to mitotic errors preceding and during late cortical nuclear cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryogenesis (cycles 11–14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>).

Canonical Arps diversified early in evolution and have been mostly retained for their essential cellular functions since. In contrast to these ancient, conserved Arps, many genomes also encode non-canonical Arps that are often evolutionarily young, rapidly evolving, and predominantly expressed in the male germline. These non-canonical Arps have received much less scientific attention than canonical Arps. In this study, we investigated one of the first-described non-canonical Arps, encoded by <italic>Arp53D</italic> in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Although this Arp is not widely conserved even in animal genomes, we show that it has been retained through 65 million years of <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution and is important for optimal fitness in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Moreover, even though <italic>Arp53D</italic> is predominantly expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes, we find that it exerts its critical function during embryogenesis. Non-canonical Arps like <italic>Arp53D</italic> are found in many animal genomes, including mammals. Our analyses suggest that these non-canonical Arps might encode many important functions that have been previously overlooked.</p><p>The evolutionary invention of Arps allows the deployment of the actin fold to perform new functions without compromising actin’s many essential pre-existing functions within a cell. Compared to canonical Arps, the more recent evolutionary divergence of non-canonical Arps provides a better opportunity to dissect how they diverged from actin to acquire and consolidate their varied cellular functions. For example, Arp53D is distinguished from canonical actin by its divergent actin fold domain and a longer 40 amino acid residue N-terminal domain. Although N-terminal tails in actin proteins are typically much shorter—only three amino acid residues in length—they regulate the binding of many regulatory proteins, such as myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sutoh et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hansen et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, post-translational modifications of the N-terminal domains can affect actin localization, polymerization, and interactions with actin-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varland et al., 2019</xref>). Our analyses show that the unique N-terminal tail is necessary and sufficient to explain Arp53D’s specialization to germline-specific actin structures during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We hypothesize that the longer N-terminal tail of Arp53D may allow it the ability to interact specifically with other cytoskeletal proteins, thereby distinguishing it from canonical actin.</p><p>Many non-canonical Arps show testes-enriched patterns of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schroeder et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heid et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hara et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harata et al., 2001</xref>). It is not unexpected that novel Arps might specialize for spermatogenesis, which requires several novel cytoskeletal functions and complex actin structures. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> exhibits a unique sperm developmental program that deploys two germline-specific actin structures: the fusome and actin cones. Arp53D localizes to both in a developmental stage-specific manner that is distinct from actin. Actin cones are unique to <italic>Drosophila</italic> males flies, whereas the fusome is found in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> females and males, in additional insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>), and in frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kloc et al., 2004</xref>). Although these actin structures are absent in many species’ germ cell developmental programs, the actin-based processes of cytoplasm sharing and sperm separation span many phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Cuevas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Geyer et al., 2009</xref>). The specialized requirement of these actin processes may have led to the independent origin and retention of many non-canonical Arps throughout animal evolution. Indeed, we find that another non-canonical Arp, which independently arose via gene duplication from canonical <italic>Arp2</italic> in the <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> lineage, also specialized to localize to actin cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schroeder et al., 2020</xref>). Their role in reproduction may have also led to their accelerated rate of evolution due to strong selective pressures from sperm competition and sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kleene, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Swanson and Vacquier, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Panhuis et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Against all expectations, however, we find that presence of <italic>Arp53D</italic> may impair rather than enhance male fertility, both in isolation as well as in competition with WT males. This finding is at odds with Arp53D’s predominant expression in male testes across <italic>Drosophila</italic> evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and its localization to specialized actin structures in spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Yet, upon loss of Arp53D, we observe no obvious defects in these actin structures and instead observe an acceleration of sperm production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). It is possible that Arp53D’s absence in sperm leads to increased expression and recruitment of other Arps, such as Arp2/3, or actin regulatory proteins in testes to these germline-specific actin structures. However, this does not explain why <italic>Arp53D</italic> is expressed in testes at all, given that it may be costly to male fertility. One possibility is that <italic>Arp53D</italic> may serve to monitor the quality of sperm produced. Under this model, <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males may produce more sperm, but of an inferior quality, leading to progressively less fit progeny. These impairments could be subtle and require multiple generations to reveal themselves, like in our population cage experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Alternatively, Arp53D may confer a fitness benefit to male fertility in untested conditions like the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Since a predominant testis-specific expression pattern is a hallmark of <italic>Arp53D</italic> and other non-canonical Arps in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian species, we favor the possibility of at least a context-specific beneficial role for <italic>Arp53D</italic> in male fertility.</p><p>Despite its weak expression outside the male germline, we show that <italic>Arp53D</italic> plays an important beneficial role in embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We find that the fitness defects arising from lack of maternal contribution of <italic>Arp53D</italic> synergize with absence of zygotic <italic>Arp53D</italic> expression in the zygote, leading to more severe embryonic inviability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) and reduced number of adult progeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Therefore, we conclude that <italic>Arp53D</italic> is a maternal-zygotic lethal effect gene, in which embryonic lethality is exacerbated when both maternal and zygotic genotypes are <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). We show that lack of <italic>Arp53D</italic> leads to gross nuclear abnormalities and increased nuclear fallout during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–E</xref>). This may be because Arp53D directly acts upon nuclei during this process. However, we favor the alternative hypothesis that nuclear fallout is an indirect consequence of loss of <italic>Arp53D</italic> and its regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Many cytoskeletal proteins are critical in cellularization and nuclear migration during early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sullivan et al., 1993</xref>). These developmental events are also highly sensitive to heat stress. Actin networks are dramatically reorganized in the heat stress response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, leading to decreased embryonic viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Figard et al., 2019</xref>). We speculate that Arp53D may regulate embryonic actin networks in the heat stress response, explaining why embryonic defects upon <italic>Arp53D</italic> loss are strongly exacerbated at high temperature.</p><p>Our studies reveal that, contrary to assumptions based on patterns of highest expression, non-canonical <italic>Arp53D</italic> plays important roles in many aspects of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> biology beyond male fertility. Numerous genes exhibit highest expression in the testis and brain, two tissues that are especially transcriptionally promiscuous, even though their most important function may manifest elsewhere. The ‘out-of-testis’ hypothesis predicts that the male germline provides an initial ‘gene nursery’ for evolutionary innovation, with diversification subsequently broadening its expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Assis and Bachtrog, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vinckenbosch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nyberg and Carthew, 2017</xref>). Recent studies of histone variants, which were originally thought to be ‘testis-specific’ in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, based on RT-PCR data, demonstrated that their expression and function also extends to females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kursel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Molaro, 2020</xref>). Similarly, <italic>Umbrea,</italic> which is highly testis-enriched, is required for chromosome segregation more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ross et al., 2013</xref>). Our findings suggest caution against the practice of using gene expression patterns as a surrogate for function. We conclude that even non-canonical ‘testis-specific’ Arps like <italic>Arp53D</italic> may, in fact, play surprising roles outside the male germline.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Phylogenetics and positive selection tests</title><p>All sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) were obtained from Flybase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thurmond et al., 2019</xref>) and/or NCBI and aligned using MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) in Geneious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kearse et al., 2012</xref>) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010519">SCR_010519</ext-link>).

Female and male virgins were collected for all assays. Females were 1–5 days old, and males were 1–2 days old. Crosses were setup with females in excess (female:male ratios of 5:2 or 10:3, unless noted otherwise), and matings took place for a week at 25°C or 29°C with vials flipped every 2–3 days. Light/dark cycles were maintained consistently. For heat-stress experiments, virgins were maintained at 25°C until crosses were setup and then transferred to 29°C. All adult progeny were quantified on the last possible day before emergence of progeny from the next generation. With day 1 being the time at which crosses were setup, day 15 or 16 was the last day the first generation could be counted at 25°C; day 12 or 13 was the last day for 29°C experiments. For quantification of fluorescence (the <italic>Arp53D-</italic>KO allele) in the Oregon-R background, DsRed fluorescence was visualized in the ocelli because pigmentation obscured fluorescence in the eye. Heterozygous flies were generated by crossing KO females to Oregon-R flies at room temperature. Homozygous <italic>DsRed</italic> flies were denoted by strikingly fluorescent ocelli and dim fluorescence of the body, whereas the ocelli of heterozygous flies were dim and required close observation to differentiate from WT flies.

Our modeling assumes a freely mating population of infinite size. We defined fitness coefficients for each genotype (F<sub>WT</sub>, F<sub>het</sub>, F<sub>KO</sub>) relative to WT homozygous flies (F<sub>WT</sub> = 1). We explored fitness coefficients for KO homozygous flies (F<sub>KO</sub>) that ranged between 0.4 and 1 in increments of 0.001. We explored three possibilities for heterozygote fitness, where fitness matched either WT (F<sub>het</sub> = F<sub>WT</sub>), or KO homozygotes (F<sub>het</sub> = F<sub>KO</sub>), or was exactly intermediate in fitness between WT and KO homozygotes (F<sub>het</sub> = (F<sub>WT</sub> + F<sub>KO</sub>)/2). We seeded all models using the same genotype combinations as the actual experiment (100% KO homozygous females, and a 50:50 mix of WT homozygous and KO homozygous males). At each generation, we calculated the fraction of randomly selected mating pairs that represented each possible genotype combination (P<sub>mat x pat</sub>). For each combination of mating pair genotypes, we used Mendelian segregation to determine the fraction of offspring genotypes (O<sub>WT</sub>, O<sub>het</sub>, O<sub>KO</sub>). To obtain the overall fraction of progeny genotypes from all parental genotype combinations, we summed the product of those frequencies (P×O) for all mating pair combinations. After obtaining initial progeny genotype frequencies in each generation, we applied fitness coefficients, multiplying the genotype frequencies by F<sub>WT</sub>, F<sub>het</sub>, F<sub>KO</sub>, and re-normalizing genotype frequencies to sum to 1. This strategy oversimplifies the true biology as it applies fitness coefficients only to individual genotypes at each generation, regardless of parental genotypes that we know have strong effects. We iterated these steps over 35 generations and recorded genotype frequencies at each generation. In order to determine which model best fit the data, we calculated the mean absolute error (MAE) for each model (by subtracting the modeled value at the corresponding generation from each real datapoint, taking the absolute value, and then calculating the mean) and selected the model that minimized MAE.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Grace Yuh Chwen Lee for help with the initial McDonald-Kreitman analyses and Ching-Ho Chang for help with RNA-seq analysis.

What makes this paper particularly suited for a journal like <italic>eLife</italic> is its universal acclaim of novelty and high significance. The result that a protein highly expressed in the testis has been selected over evolution, not so much because it contributes to sperm function, but because of expression elsewhere, is, to say the least, extremely surprising but has impressed the reviewers. To me, the fact that this protein is an Arp, with binding function to actin makes this finding even more unusual and interesting. The work will generate discussions amongst evolutionary biologists for sure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71279.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We would like to thank the three reviewers for their time and thoughtful comments on the manuscript. We found their constructive feedback extremely helpful and are grateful for the peer review process in clarifying and strengthening our study. In response to their comments and suggestions, we have extensively revised the Discussion section of our manuscript. We have also added four new experiments in our revision. We summarize them here briefly and describe them in more detail in our revised manuscript and in the point-by-point rebuttal.</p><p>– Introduction of <italic>Arp53D</italic> rescue transgene in place of the <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO allele: Although this rescue transgene is not expressed as strongly as the endogenous gene, we find it nonetheless robustly rescues the embryonic viability phenotype, but does not significantly lower male fertility.</p><p>– Extensive population-genetic modeling of our population cage experiments: These analyses revealed that we had grossly underestimated the selective coefficients associated with wildtype <italic>Arp53D</italic> alleles in our previous submission. Instead of a 2-3% effect, we now demonstrate that wildtype alleles have a 30-40% selective advantage over the KO allele.</p><p>– Cytological analysis of the basis of male fertility increases in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO flies: We show that although a static readout of total sperm (via seminal vesicle size) is unchanged, there is an increased number of individualizing cysts in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO flies, suggesting that sperm production is accelerated.</p><p>– Cytological analysis of the basis of embryonic inviability in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO embryos: We show that there is an increased number of disorganized nuclei and a higher propensity of ‘nuclear fallout’ in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO embryos at 29ºC, suggesting that Arp53D plays a key role in helping facilitate early divisions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos under heat stress.</p><p>Some of these additional experiments were carried out by a new colleague, Isabel Mejia Natividad, who is now added as an author in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Reviewer summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors characterize the orphan actin related protein Arp53D, which is conserved in all <italic>Drosophila</italic> species with available full genome sequences but not in other dipterans. Sequence analysis of Arp53D in ~200 D. melanogaster populations and in <italic>D. simulans</italic> suggests that this gene is experiencing positive selection in melanogaster, implying that it contributes positively to fitness in some way. The authors corroborate this observation using a population study, which reveals that the allele frequency of an Arp53D knockout is strongly and reproducibly reduced within 15-20 generations. Because publicly available RNA-seq data show this gene to have highest expression in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> testis, the authors begin by observing protein localization there. Consistent with its close homology to actin, Arp53D localizes to two actin-enriched structures in male germ cells, fusomes and actin cones of the individualization complex, as revealed by a GFP-tagged transgene. Deleting Arp53D's unique N-terminal region prevents this localization, and attaching the N-terminal region to canonical actin drives concentrated localization to these structures, indicating that the N-terminal region is necessary and sufficient for Arp53D's specific localization in the male germline. However, knocking out the gene does not perturb gross fusome or individualization complex structure, and, surprisingly, leads to increased male fertility. Consistently, knockout males apparently have an advantage in a sperm competition assay. Even more surprisingly, given the gene's low expression in females and early embryos, knockout leads to reduced embryonic survival, with both maternal and zygotic contributions to the effect. Altogether, the data show that despite Arp53D's strong expression and specific localization in the testis, it actually is detrimental there; nevertheless, it confers a survival advantage in embryos, with both maternal and zygotic effects, despite minimal maternal expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for a clear summary of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. Locus specificity of the male fertility and embryonic viability phenotypes must be substantiated before the manuscript is ready for publication. The authors should be able to use their stock carrying the Arp53D knockout with the tagged Arp53D transgene to demonstrate rescue of the major knockout phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point, which was also raised by other reviewers. We have now added experiments to confirm the locus specificity of the phenotypes in the Oregon-R <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO strain background used for all genetic experiments. To create the <italic>Arp53D-</italic>KO strain, we had previously knocked in <italic>DsRed</italic> with an attp site, which allows for site-directed transgenesis, followed by repeated backcrossing with Oregon-R flies. In our revision, we took advantage of this attP site to integrate an untagged wild-type (WT) <italic>Arp53D</italic> gene and its upstream endogenous promoter into this genetic location. Our approach is now outlined in the new Figure 5E. This rescue allele robustly rescued the reduction in progeny count seen with the female knockout (new Figure 7C) confirming that the embryonic viability phenotype is a direct result of <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO and not a linked mutation. However, male fertility was only slightly decreased in this transgene rescue without statistical significance (Figure 5F). We attribute this slight decrease in male fertility to dosage of <italic>Arp53D</italic> expression. Indeed, we find that the ‘rescue’ <italic>Arp53D</italic> transgene is expressed less than WT <italic>Arp53D</italic> in Oregon-R (Supplemental Figure S5I), which appears sufficient to rescue embryonic viability but not lower male fertility. These rescue experiments confirm our surprising findings that <italic>Arp53D</italic>’s evolutionary retention is predominantly due to its role in embryonic development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript would be enhanced greatly by highlighting in the discussion how the key finding, that despite Arp53D's strong expression in the testis its positive selection appears to be driven by a somatic function in the embryo, deviates from expectations under the hypothesis that the testis is often a permissive site for gene evolution (see e.g., Kondo et al. 2017, Assis and Bachtrog 2013, Zhao et al. 2014, Kaessmann 2010). It also is worth mentioning that this story provides a cautionary lesson against the practice of using gene expression patterns as proxies for function. Replacing the current conclusion sentences with some discussion along these lines would emphasize the strong impact of the results (see point 13 below).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for giving us the opportunity to clarify these important points. We were indeed surprised by the pertinent phenotype being unrelated to the predominant site of expression of this gene. We have added to the discussion to caution against the practice of using gene expression patterns as proxies for function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. The title is vague and does not highlight the key finding of the paper well.

Arps carry out a wide array of functions, both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, investigations of which have focused mostly on well conserved family members and largely have neglected orphan Arps, which are not readily assigned to sub-families. This manuscript investigates a previously uncharacterized orphan Arp that is highly expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes. The authors find that despite its striking localization to male germline actin structures, it is detrimental to male fertility in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The findings suggest that its apparent positive selection is attributable to embryonic functions, implying a developmental tradeoff between germline and somatic development. The findings are surprising in light of a prominent evolutionary model suggesting that high expression of paralogs and/or new genes in the testis permits evolution of new functions there without compromising preexisting somatic functions of the gene family. This novel investigation into a divergent Arp paralog with strong expression in the testis but an apparent detrimental effect there will likely be of great interest to evolutionary biologists.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this positive and complimentary summary by the reviewer. We also note that our study is the first detailed functional dissection of an ‘orphan’ Arp paralog. Our findings suggest that despite being lineage-specific, such Arps encode very important functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer keywords: <italic>Drosophila,</italic> spermatogenesis, germline actin dynamics</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):Summary:Schroeder et al. investigate the role of a rapidly-evolving actin paralog in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> This gene, Arp53D, is conserved over 65MY in the Drosophila lineage, but is not found outside it. Arp53D's highest expression is in the testis, and the protein is seen to localize with two actin-rich structures, the fusome and the actin cones, though not always exactly with actin. Despite its conservation and localization, Arp53D appears to have a negative effect on male fertility, as its knockout and knockdown males are less fertile than control. However, its activity is needed for optimal fertility because of a maternal effect on survival or development. That effect can be partially rescued by zygotic expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for accurately summarizing our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>Is the study convincing, are the experiments replicated, statistics adequate, is there enough information to reproduce?:</p><p>Yes.

I believe these are straightforward and realistic to do.</p><p>1. Does the sfGFP-Arp53D rescue the defects of Arp53D knockout? Otherwise, it is not completely certain that its localization reflects where the endogenous protein is, or is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point. We chose to tag Arp53D with sfGFP at the N-terminus because actin proteins can only be tagged at the N-terminus in <italic>Drosophila</italic>; a C-terminal tag disrupts protein polymerization (Brault <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999). However, we believe it is unlikely that this tag alters or dictates localization because actin’s function is not altered with an N-terminal tag. Moreover, we see that actin localizes only to cones and the fusome upon addition of Arp53D’s N-terminus (Figure 4), similar to tagged full-length Arp53D.</p><p>We did not attempt to rescue with the sfGFP-Arp53D line because the genetic background is different from the <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KOs that were used in all our genetic experiments. Since fertility levels can vary strain to strain, it is important to have a WT control that is closest in genetic background, which we lack for the sfGFP-Arp53D line. This transgenic fly line has a mix of the <italic>w1118</italic> background and the background of the original injected fly line (see Table 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Sperm counts would provide an easy way to determine whether the mutant’s problem is in sperm production, mating/transfer, or in function of the sperm themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valuable suggestion. In our revisions, we include additional cytological analyses to assess the basis of male fertility differences. We now report that <italic>Arp53D-KO</italic> testes have more cysts with actin cones than WT in the Oregon-R background, suggesting accelerated sperm production. However, we do not see significant evidence for increased size of the seminal vesicle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interpretation suggestion:</p><p>1. Although the “gene nursery” model might imply that Arp53D was selected on for a testis function, I wonder whether it might actually been selected for its beneficial embryo function, and later acquired testis expression. Its testis function might be a tolerated level of competition between it and a different Arp that localizes to fusomes or actin cones. In this latter scenario, if you get rid of all or some of Arp53D from the testis, that might allow the other Arp to do its job unimpeded, thereby improving male fertility.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for suggesting this excellent interpretation. We do believe Arp53D has been evolutionarily retained for the beneficial embryo function in the long term. Since Arp53D does not appear to negatively impact male fertility, we also now suggest the possibility that another Arp, such as Arp2/3 or a different actin regulatory protein, may in fact be playing a role that masks a defect in Arp53D’s absence. Together with a recommendation made to further comment on the gene nursery model by Reviewer 1 (major comment #2), we have revised our Discussion extensively to incorporate these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments, easily addressable:</p><p>Prior studies are referenced and considered.</p><p>Overall text, and figures, are clear and accurate, but there are some wording imprecisions that would be good to correct (by line number):</p><p>2: Arp53D is not “(an) actin”.

The gene is highly conserved and expresses at a relatively higher level in the male gonad. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that the gene enveloped relatively late during the specification of Drosophila genus. The authors show that Arp53D knock-out is homozygous viable and mutant males have enhanced fertility. Although the protein localizes at the fusome and investment cone during sperm development, it appeared to be totally redundant for spermatogenesis. Therefore, to understand the reason for its conservation, the authors estimated the maternal and zygotic roles of Arp53D during embryonic development. Arp53D mRNA is enriched in the early stage embryos and the viability of the flies lacking the maternal supply of the protein are susceptible to heat stress at 29C during embryonic development. Thus, the authors conclude that maternal Arp53D is essential to safeguard gastrulation under heat stress, which is the reason for its conservation. The data presentation is top class, experiments are rigorously performed with all appropriate controls, and the reagents are fully characterized. Overall, it is a solid piece of work which raised several intriguing questions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments about our work and its impact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comment:</p><p>1) The manuscript lacks focus. It appeared to address two totally disconnected question -a) what is the role of Arp53D in sperm development and b) why it is conserved in <italic>Drosophila?</italic> It provides and extensive cell biology characterization of Arp53D localization during spermatid development and a rigorous genetic analysis of the fertility and survival phenotype. However, the causal link between these two data sets are rather tenuous. Hence, the first part of the manuscript is disconnected form the second part. The cause of the enhanced fertility of Arp53D-KO males remained unclear. Similarly, the reason behind reduced survival under heat stress and maternal input of Arp53D has not been investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern. Although it would appear that this seems like a two-part story, in fact it accurately portrays the logical progression in our functional dissection of Arp53D. For example, its high testis-specific expression logically led us to cytological characterization in the testes, while our unexpected finding that genetic ablation leads to increased male fertility eventually led to our discovery of a maternal-zygotic role for this protein in embryonic viability and development. Furthermore, our cytological characterization in the testes also allowed us to identify the importance of Arp53D’s unusual N-terminal tail in functional diversification.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewer’s criticism that the nature of enhanced fertility and reduced survival was not fully elucidated in the previous version. We have now added substantial new experiments for both of these. We show that the increased male fertility of <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO males may be due to accelerated sperm production (Figure 5C-D), whereas the decreased embryonic survival of Arp53D-KO embryos upon heat stress is correlated with an increase in nuclear abnormalities and a ‘nuclear fallout phenotype,’ in which more damaged nuclei are removed from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelium in <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO than in WT embryos (Figure 9B-E). The molecular dissection of these traits is of high interest to us, but beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Arp53D protein is absent from the ovary and the mRNA is present in early embryo. Its unclear why the author did not look for the presence of Arp53D mRNA in ovary and the protein in the embryo. The RT-PCR data of the whole fly could be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with these comments. In our revision, we now include RT-PCR analyses on dissected ovaries to show unambiguous expression of <italic>Arp53D</italic> in ovaries (Supplementary Figure S7B), consistent with published RNA-seq data. Our efforts at characterizing sfGFP-Arp53D in early embryos have been stymied due to high levels of autofluorescence and current lack of information about the developmental stage at which Arp53D protein is expressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What is the underlying cause of enhanced fertility – increased sperm production of fertilization efficiency? An in depth analysis of the Arp53D-KO phenotype in the testis in terms of the progression of investment cones or the number of intact nuclei bundle at the base of the testis could help to highlight the role of Arp53D in spermatogenesis. Similarly, sperm motility/total sperm estimate in spermatheca may help to suggest whether the mutant sperm has higher fidelity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have now performed further cytological analyses of the <italic>Arp53D</italic>-KO testis. We found that <italic>Arp53D</italic> KOs do not appear to have significantly more sperm in the seminal vesicle than WT flies, inferred by measuring the size of the seminal vesicle (Supplementary Figure S5F-G). However, KO testes exhibit more cysts that are undergoing individualization than WT testes, suggesting KO sperm production is accelerated (Figure 5C-D) and likely increases male fertility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The role of maternal and zygotic Arp53D in embryonic development needs to be investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>For our revision, we have conducted a cytological analysis of the KO embryos to identify an increased degree of nuclear damage. A full mechanistic understanding of these defects will require new tools and will be a substantial undertaking. We hope the reviewer agrees this is beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Transgenic rescue of the phenotypes described in Figure 5 and 6 is essential. How do the author rule out loss of neighboring gene functions in the KO flies? Arp53D coding region is close to the SOD2 5' and an insertion/deletion of this region may disrupt SOD2 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment and have made substantial efforts to demonstrate transgenic rescue; see response to Reviewer 1 major point 1. We note that <italic>SOD2</italic> expression is not disrupted upon deletion of the <italic>Arp53D</italic> locus (see Supplemental Figure S4D). Moreover, SOD2 is not required for embryonic development but only for adult survival (Mukherjee <italic>et al.</italic>, 2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comment:</p><p>1) The fusome on elongated spermatids morphs into a spectrin cap and promotes membrane extension.
