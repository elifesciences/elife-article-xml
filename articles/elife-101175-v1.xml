However, it is difficult to evaluate such physical actions genetically, simply because they are nonspecific and can be caused by any molecule. Therefore, we investigated a method to compare this nonspecific action among cells with diverse membrane protein profiles. We found that a wide range of glycoproteins individually had a strong inhibitory effect on infection, while on the other hand, the total amount of glycans was negatively correlated with the infection level in each cell. Thus, the infection-inhibitory effect of glycoproteins was molecularly nonspecific but was additively enhanced according to the amount of glycans on the cell surface. In this correlation, glycans function as a fundamental factor. Further investigating the mechanism by which glycans function as a factor in infection control, we conclude that the repulsion between proteins created by branched glycans forms a kinetic energy barrier against packing the virus into the region of protein interstitial space. As a result, the formation of the adhesive interface between the virus and the cell membrane, which is necessary for infection, is inhibited. This study attempted to link the cell’s nonspecific physical properties with intracellular biochemicals. A similar approach may be applied to quantify other nonspecific biological phenomena.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>whole genome glycocalyx prediction</kwd><kwd>polymer brush theory</kwd><kwd>membrane protein</kwd><kwd>superresolution</kwd><kwd>cell virus interface</kwd><kwd>glass supported lipid bilayers</kwd><kwd>membrane glycoprotein reconstitution</kwd><kwd>FLIM-FRET</kwd><kwd>protein Flory radius</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Intermolecular steric repulsion generated by glycans on the cell membrane inhibits viral infection by preventing the formation of a virus-cell interface, regardless of the identity of molecules for glycan modification.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous types of physical and mechanical factors of cells, both intrinsic mechanical properties such as stiffness and external mechanical stimuli such as osmotic pressure, have been reported as regulators of important biological events at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado and Cabernard, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Du et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enyedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jalihal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Saraswathibhatla et al., 2023</xref>). Some of these events are regulated by a few important genes, while others are controlled by multiple factors and are considered gene-nonspecific events. As one such physical event, we are studying steric inhibition of viral infection by bulky membrane proteins. Studies in the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted the fact that, as has long been recognized in other infectious diseases, even infection by the same viral strain can have highly variable consequences for host disease progression. To analyze such diverse host-side responses in Covid-19, intensive high-throughput studies have been conducted, accumulating vast amounts of data at the cellular, organ, or individual patient level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahern et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biering et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delorey et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ellinghaus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grant et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hadjadj et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meckiff et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ravindra et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yoshida et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ziegler et al., 2021</xref>). As a result, various host-side factors have been proposed. Particularly, innate immune molecules such as various cytokines have received significant attention, but several others have also been reported. Mucin-related glycoproteins are among the latter group, as suggested by cellular CRISPR screens as well as by genome-wide association studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biering et al., 2022</xref>). There have also been many studies at the molecular, cellular, or animal level on the function of these highly glycosylated proteins in viral infection, including not only mucin but also other proteins including PSGL1 and CD43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chatterjee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaveris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Linden et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McAuley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wardzala et al., 2022</xref>). While there are known examples of glycans that function as viral receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Thompson et al., 2019</xref>), these results demonstrate that a variety of glycoproteins negatively regulate viral infection in a wide range of systems. These glycoprotein groups have no common amino acid sequences or domains. The glycans modified by these proteins include both N-glycans conjugated with asparagine and O-glycans conjugated with serine and threonine. N- and O-glycans are each composed of many types of monosaccharides and form complex Glycome as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dworkin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rademacher et al., 1988</xref>). The association of specific glycan structures with various diseases has been studied, but there have been no reports of such specificity with regard to the inhibition of viral infection. All of these results suggest that bulky membrane glycoproteins nonspecifically inhibit viral infection.</p><p>If the protein size is comparable to the size of the virus and the protein density is high, it is conceivable that the bulky glycoproteins could act as a physical barrier to viral uptake on the cell membrane. However, it is not easy to estimate and compare the steric inhibitory effects of these membrane proteins on different cells with very diverse expression profiles. If glycoproteins affect viral infection in a nonspecific manner, and if this is due to steric inhibition as suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaveris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>) then polymers without glycans could have the same function. Indeed, synthetic polymers that bind to cell membranes have been shown to modulate viral infection in a manner dependent on molecular size and molecular density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaizuka and Machida, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pyrć et al., 2021</xref>). Inferring from this fact, it is possible that viral infection in cells is regulated by the expression profile and density of all membrane proteins.</p><p>Here, we attempt to biochemically describe this nonspecific steric effect on the cell surface. For this purpose, we combine biochemical dissection for individual molecules with physical analyses. With physical modeling alone, the phenomenon might be described by a small number of parameters, but these parameters cannot be easily associated with genes. On the other hand, it is not straightforward to estimate the steric effects of an entire cell by measuring and summing all the effects of individual genes. To combine these two approaches, we attempted to find biochemical factors that relate steric effects across the cell surface to information of biochemical components in the cell. Such factors could link the physical quantity of steric effects with genomic or transcriptomic data of the cell. Previous studies showing steric effects of glycoproteins suggested that glycans may be a fundamental biochemical factor regulating such an overall phenomenon.</p><p>To confirm that glycans are a general chemical factor of steric repulsion, an extensive list of glycoproteins on the cell membrane surface would be useful. The wider the range of proteins to be measured, the better. Therefore, we collect information on glycoproteins on the genome and compile them into a list that is easy to use for various purposes. Then, by analyzing sample molecules selected from this list, it may be possible to infer the effect of the entire glycoprotein population on the steric inhibition of virus infection, despite the complexity and diversity of the Glycome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dworkin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moremen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rademacher et al., 1988</xref>). Elucidation of the mechanism of how glycans regulate steric repulsion will also be useful to quantitatively discuss the relationship between steric repulsion and intracellular molecular composition. For this purpose, we apply the theories of polymer physics and interface chemistry.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>List of membrane glycoproteins in human genome and their inhibitory effect on virus infection</title><p>To test the hypothesis that glycans contribute to steric repulsion at the cell surface, we first generate a list of glycoproteins in the human genome and then measure the glycan content and inhibitory effect on viral infection of test proteins selected from the list (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To compile the list of glycoproteins, we first selected all human membrane proteins in the database (UniProt) based on the presence of a transmembrane domain or membrane anchor domain and found that 81.5% (2515 molecules) of these membrane proteins had previously been reported or predicted to be glycosylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2023</xref>). We then used two machine learning-based software packages (NetNGlyc/NetOGlyc and GlycoEP) to determine whether amino acid residues in the ectodomain of all 2515 molecules are glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chauhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gupta and Brunak, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steentoft et al., 2013</xref>). Both software packages predicted one or more O- or N-glycosylation in 2441 and 2290 proteins, respectively, of which 2226 molecules (88.5% of the total) were predicted by both software packages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The number of highly glycosylated molecules for which more than 15% of the amino acids in the extracellular domain were predicted to be glycosylated was 67 and 75, respectively, of which 45 were common to both software packages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted glycosylation rates of all molecules calculated by each software was 0.656 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the predictions of the two software programs were in relatively good agreement, with relatively few molecules predicted to be highly glycosylated throughout the human genome. Both software programs also detected three times as many sequences predicted to undergo O-type glycosylation as those predicted to undergo N-type glycosylation (3.08 and 3.00 times more, respectively), and this trend was particularly pronounced for highly glycosylated molecules. Overall, many of the listed highly glycosylated molecules are consistent with molecules already known to be glycosylated, suggesting the consistency of our prediction strategy. It is also likely that some of the protein sequences analyzed in this study may be identical to the sequences used in machine learning during software development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>List of glycoproteins in the human genome: predictions and measurement of glycosylation, and virus infection inhibition assays using sample proteins from the list.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of inhibition of virus infection by membrane glycoproteins.

These sample molecules include MUC1 and its truncation mutants, other types of highly glycosylated molecules, and receptor and ligand molecules involved in cell-cell interactions. Using HEK293T cell lines exogenously expressing genes of these proteins tagged with fluorescent markers, their glycosylation was measured by binding of a lectin from Arachis hypogaea (PNA), and the number of these proteins in the cells was measured simultaneously. PNA was used for the measurement because it has a wider dynamic range than other lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that GalNAc recognized by PNA is predominantly present on glycans of HEK293T cells, especially on the termini of glycans that are amenable to lectin binding, compared to other saccharides. Flow cytometry measurements showed a nearly linear relationship between the signals of bound lectins and membrane protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This relationship can be explained by a first-order reaction model of lectin binding to populations of cells with diverse protein expression levels (see Methods). The model also predicted that, when the slope PNA/mol obtained from this linear regression is compared among proteins, it should have a linear relationship with the level of glycosylation of each protein. We assumed that the total glycosylation level per molecule should reflect the number of glycosylation sites that were predicted by the software. Then, we evaluated the correlation between the experimentally determined PNA/mol and the predicted number of glycosylation sites for each protein and found that the two were indeed in a linear relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, we can conclude that within these sample molecules, the number of potential glycosylation sites predicted by the software correlates well with the actual amount of glycans for each molecule.</p><p>Although our experiments were performed only in a specific cell type, the measured amount of glycans per molecule correlated well with the number of predicted amino acid sites to be glycosylated. Especially for highly glycosylated proteins, the agreement was good. On the other hand, the measured values for low glycosylation molecules were more strongly influenced by the background glycans of endogenous proteins. This robustness in prediction may result from the sequence diversity of glycosylation sites. When the total amount of glycosylation in each protein is compared as in our case, molecules with a wider spectrum of predicted amino acid sequences should have a greater probability of being glycosylated, even if there is a bias in sequences to be glycosylated in each cellular system. Therefore, we propose that our software-based method generated a list of glycoproteins useful for estimating the total glycan content of each protein in various cell types.</p><p>We then examined whether these membrane glycoproteins can inhibit viral infection, and whether their inhibitory effects depend on the degree of protein glycosylation. We measured the infection of SARS-CoV2 pseudoparticle virus based on Lentivirus (SARS-CoV2-PP) consisting of the Spike molecule of SARS-CoV2 (Wuhan-Hu-1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ke et al., 2020</xref>). Cell surface densities of the viral receptor ACE2 and the membrane glycoprotein to be studied were measured prior to viral infection, and the infection was measured after 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, G</xref>). The results showed that all highly glycosylated proteins, with the exception of GYPC, which has the shortest ectodomain, had an inhibitory effect on infection. These proteins include those previously reported (MUC1, CD43) as well as those not yet reported (CD44, SDC1, CD164, F174B, CD24, PODXL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaveris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, other molecules (VCAM-1, EPHB1, TMEM123, etc.) showed little inhibitory effect on infection within the density range we used. Infection of other types of viruses was similarly inhibited by glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Previous results showed that membrane-bound synthetic polyethyleneglycols (PEGs) inhibit SARS-CoV-2-PP infection at surface density above 2000 μm<sup>–2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaizuka and Machida, 2023</xref>). In contrast, the range of mean densities at which highly glycosylated molecules could inhibit infection was an order of magnitude lower, ~100 μm<sup>–2</sup>. This result suggests that glycosylation of membrane proteins has a significant impact on the inhibition of virus infection.</p><p>To quantitatively compare the infection inhibitory effects of all glycoproteins in a unified manner, a hierarchical Bayesian model was constructed and data from all molecules were regressed on this unified model at once (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>). This approach was based on the assumption that each glycoprotein inhibits viral infection by a common mechanism, but the degree of inhibition depends on the protein-specific parameter. As a model for regression, a standard sigmoidal inhibition function was used with the density of glycoproteins as a variable. The parameter IC50 (surface density to achieve 50% inhibition of infection) of the membrane proteins was estimated from the posterior predictive distribution obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for this Bayesian model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). We found that IC50 was inversely correlated with the amount of glycosylation of each molecule (Pearson correlation coefficient, –0.29; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>); IC50 was similarly correlated with the molecular weight including glycans, but was not significantly correlated with amino acid length (correlation coefficient of –0.39 and 0.11, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). These results indicate that the total amount of glycans has a significant effect on the inhibition of viral infection.</p><p>One advantage of using such a hierarchical model is that one can easily obtain the overall trend without making many measurements on all molecules as in ordinary statistics. Thus, it is an effective approach to reduce batch effects in experiments such as ours where many different items need to be compared. Note that due to the nature of Bayesian statistics, the results may differ slightly depending on the prior distribution, and that while the amount of data we had is sufficient for hierarchical inference for all molecules, there may not be enough data for each molecule in analyzing individually in the manner of ordinary statistics.</p><p>The molecular weights of the glycans in those proteins were estimated from the data of glycan mass in purified MUC1 ectodomain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Molecular weight for other proteins was estimated by applying the data for lectin binding assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). From these data, we can estimate that a typical glycoprotein in our system is glycosylated at ~50% of the predicted sites by assuming the average size of O-glycans as decasaccharides with a molecular weight of ~2000. These results indicate that in our experimental system, glycosylation of proteins increases their molecular weight by only a few folds at most. However, even glycoproteins shorter than 200 amino acids had a significant inhibitory effect on virus infection, while some of longer but low-glycosylated proteins didn’t.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cellular glyco-populations and infection control</title><p>Since a wide range of glycoproteins inhibit viral infection, it is possible that all types of glycoproteins have an additive effect for this function. To test this hypothesis, we infected a monolayer of epithelial cells endogenously expressing highly heterogeneous populations of glycoproteins with SARS-CoV-2-PP and measured viral infection from cell to cell visually by microscope imaging. We found that highly infected cells were spatially exclusive with highly glycan-expressing cells, indicating that there was a clear inverse correlation between the amount of virus infection and the amount of surface-bound lectins in the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AB</xref>). In this cell line, this inverse correlation was most pronounced when quantifying N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5AC, recognized by lectins SSA and MAL) compared to the various types of glycans, while some other glycans also showed weak correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results showed that the amount of virus infection in cell anti-correlated with the amount of total glycans on the cell surface.

To confirm this, we also measured the correlation between the density of each glycoprotein and viral infection. CD44, which was shown to account for about 10% of all cell surface glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wyler et al., 2021</xref>), showed a weak inverse correlation with viral infection; even such a weak correlation was not observed with other proteins, including ERBB2, which is approximately four-fold more highly expressed than CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>). Furthermore, the amount of glycans on the cells did not correlate with the expression of CD44 alone or any other specific protein, suggesting that all the different glycoproteins contributed to the total glycan content in an additive manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Intracellular glycosylation levels are further regulated by complicated pathways including various types of glycosyltransferases, which are likely confounding factors in the causal relationship between glycoprotein expression and infection inhibition. Proteins that showed very minor correlations might also be present somewhere in the network of confounding factors. Our results demonstrate that total glycan content is a superior indicator than individual glycoprotein expression for assessing infection inhibition effect generated by cell membrane glycocalyx. These results are consistent with our hypothesis regarding the additive nature of the nonspecific inhibitory effects of each glycoprotein.</p><p>Pearson correlation is effective for comparing samples with varying scales of data because it normalizes the data values by the mean and variance. However, as observed in our experiments, this may not be the case when the distribution of data within a sample varies between samples. In addition, as has already been reported, the distribution of infected cells often deviates significantly from the normal distribution of data that is the premise of Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Russell et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To further analyze data in such nonlinear situations, we applied the threshold overlap score (TOS) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This is one statistical method for analyzing nonlinear correlations and is specialized for colocalization analysis in dual-color images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sheng et al., 2016</xref>). TOS analysis involves segmentation of the data based on signal intensity, as in other nonlinear statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reshef et al., 2011</xref>). The computed TOS matrix indicates whether the number of objects classified in each region is higher or lower than expected for uniformly distributed data, which reflects co-localization or anti-localization in dual-color imaging data. For example, calculated TOS matrices show strong anti-localization for infection and glycosylation when both signals are high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). This confirms that high infection is very unlikely to occur in cells that express high levels of glycans. The TOS analysis also yielded better anti-localization scores for some of the individual membrane proteins, especially those that are heterogeneously distributed across cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This suggests that TOS analysis can highlight the inhibitory function of molecules that are sparsely expressed among cells, reaffirming that high expression of a single type of glycoprotein can create an infection-protective surface in a single cell and that such infection inhibition is not protein-specific. In contrast, for more uniformly distributed proteins such as the viral receptor ACE2, TOS analysis and Pearson correlation showed similar trends, although the two are mathematically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and H</xref>). Because glycoprotein expression levels and virus-derived GFP levels were treated symmetrically in these statistical calculations, the same logic can be applied when considering the heterogeneity of infection levels among cells. Therefore, it is expected that TOS analysis can reasonably compare samples with different virus infection level distributions by focusing on cells with high infection levels in all samples.</p><p>Our findings suggest that membrane glycoproteins nonspecifically inhibit viral infection, and we hypothesize that their inhibitory function is also nonspecific depending on the type of glycan. Our hypothesis is consistent with the observations in the TOS analysis. Although minor saccharide species in the system (such as GlcNAc and GalNAc recognized by DSA, WGA, or PNA) showed anti-colocalization with infection, their scores were much lower than those of major saccharide species. This suggests that all major and minor saccharide species have an infection inhibitory effect, but cells enriched with minor type glycans are only partially present in the system, and the contribution of these cells to virus inhibition is also partial. It is also consistent with the observation that the amount of GalNAc recognized by PNA determines the virus infection inhibition in HEK 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, we believe that our assay using a single type of predominantly expressed lectin is still useful for estimating the total glycan content. Nevertheless, the virus infection rate may show a better correlation with a more accurately estimated total glycan in each cell. For example, the use of multiple lectins with appropriate calibration to integrate multiple signals to simultaneously detect a wider range of saccharide species would allow for more accurate estimation. It should be noted that the amount of bound lectin does not necessarily measure the overall glycan composition but likely reflects the sugar population at the free end of the glycan chain to which the lectin binds most.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Influence of membrane glycoproteins on viral binding or uptake</title><p>Glycans could be one of the biochemical substances that link the intracellular molecular composition and macroscopic steric forces at the cell surface. To clarify this connection, we further investigated the mechanism by which membrane glycoproteins inhibit viral infection. First, we measured viral binding to cells to determine which step of infection is inhibited. We found that a large number of SARS-CoV2-PP can still bind to cells even when cells expressed sufficient amounts of the glycoprotein (mean density ~50 µm<sup>–2</sup>) that could account for the majority of glycans within these cells and inhibit viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, on the two-dimensional culture surface of Calu-3 cells, no negative correlation was observed between the number of viruses bound and the total amount of glycans on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). The slight positive correlation between bound virus and glycans may be due to higher expression levels of viral receptors in glycan-rich cells. These results indicate that glycoproteins do not inhibit virus binding to cells, but rather inhibit the steps required for subsequent virus internalization. When cells form the interface with various types of viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, plasma membranes are invaginated for preparing uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ogando et al., 2020</xref>). At these interfaces, apposed membranes of viruses and cells are tightly adhered to proceed to fusion. Thus, we hypothesize that membrane glycoproteins do not inhibit the initial binding of viruses to cells via point-to-point molecular binding of receptors and ligands, but rather inhibit the formation of stable interface that is required for membrane fusion and viral uptake.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structure of interface between viruses and cell membranes and polymer brush theory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytogram of DID labeled SARS-CoV2-PP binding to HEK293T cells expressing ACE2, TMPRSS2, and/or various truncation mutants of MUC1.

To inhibit all cell-virus receptor-ligand binding, a high density of glycoproteins larger than the size of the receptor-ligand complex is required (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, much smaller amounts of shorter proteins would be sufficient to inhibit the formation of the cell-virus interface. In our measurements, a protein with an extracellular domain of ~200 amino acids (e.g. CD164 [138aa]) at a density of ~100 μm<sup>–2</sup> showed significant inhibition in viral infection. This molecule is shorter than the receptor ACE2 (722 aa), and its density corresponds to only one protein per 100 nm square area, while the diameter of the virus is also ~100 nm. And even under these conditions, binding of the virus to the cell was not inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we investigated how such inhibition of interface formation occurs.</p><p>We also investigated the effect of membrane glycoproteins on membrane trafficking, another process involved in viral infection. Expression of MUC1 with higher number of tandem repeats reduced the dextran transport in the fluid phase, while expression of multiple membrane glycoproteins that have infection inhibitory effects, including truncated MUC1 molecules, showed no effect on fluid phase endocytosis, indicating a molecular weight-dependent effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The molecular weight-dependent inhibition of endocytosis may be due to factors such as steric inhibition of the approach of dextran molecules or a reduction in the transportable volume within the endosome. In any case, it is clear that many low molecular weight glycoproteins inhibit infection by disturbing processes other than endocytosis. Based on the above, we focus on the effect of glycoproteins on the formation of the interface between the virus and the cell membrane.</p><p>We introduced the framework of conventional polymer brush theory to study the structure of virus-cell interfaces containing proteins. This theory provides a general foundation for considering the behavior of polymers at interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Gennes, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milner, 1991</xref>). In this theory, the polymers on the surface are considered to be in either a ‘mushroom’ or ‘brush’ regime, depending on their density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In the mushroom regime, the size of the polymer is estimated to be the mean of the radius of gyration in equilibrium, which is defined as Flory radius (<italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>). When the surface density becomes very high, the polymer forms a brush, which distorts the polymer and reduces its projected size on the plane. Numerous experimental measurements of the formation of polymer brushes have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Overney et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao and Brittain, 2000</xref>). In these measurements, the transition to a brush typically occurs at a density higher than that required to pack a surface with hemispherical polymers of diameter <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>. This is the point at which the energy loss due to repulsive forces between adjacent molecules (<italic>f<sub>int</sub></italic>) exceeds the energy required to stretch the polymer perpendicularly into a brush (<italic>f<sub>el</sub></italic>). Polymer brush theory also applies to cell membrane proteins that diffuse in lipid membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Evans et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hiergeist and Lipowsky, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shurer et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, since glycoproteins have a bottlebrush structure with branched sugar chains on amino acid chains, our system consists of a brush of bottle brushes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van den Steen et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In the framework of polymer brush, cases of approaching particles to the surface containing graft polymers have been studied. These cases can be classified as either ‘invasion’ or ‘compression’ depending on the density of the graft polymer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halperin, 1999</xref>). The case of the virus-cell interface is similar to this previous case but is distinctive because the protein is mobile and the membrane is flexible. Therefore, we further assume that there are two cases: one is ‘trap’, which involves molecular trapping and deformation of the cell membrane, and the other is ‘exclusion’, in which molecular exclusion results in the formation of an adhesive interface. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Invasion without involving any molecular exclusion occurs only when the molecular density is very dilute. Molecular exclusion is enabled by molecular fluidity of the cell membrane, and such exclusion has been observed on a macroscopic scale at the cell-cell interface in the immune system or in the apoptotic blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sibener et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Varma et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Using this framework, we consider the free energy of the virus-cell system. Trapping of membrane proteins at the interface is accompanied by a bending energy penalty or loss of adhesion energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These should depend on the size and number of trapped proteins. The free energy of the polymers can also be considered; in the mean-field approximation based on Flory polymer theory, the free energy of brush polymers can be decomposed into two main components: the interaction energy between polymers <italic>f<sub>int</sub></italic> and the elastic energy <italic>f<sub>el</sub></italic> of individual polymers. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexander, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Gennes, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halperin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milner, 1991</xref>). If the formation of the cell-virus interface involves macroscopic motion of particles, such as molecular exclusion, the process may experience an energy barrier <italic>U*</italic> involved in such transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halperin, 1999</xref>). These arguments about free energy involve several assumptions. For example, it was assumed that when these proteins are trapped at the cell-virus interface, the protein volume and Flory radius are conserved. This is probably because lipid bilayers are flexible and their bending takes less energy than protein compression. This should be supported by a series of previous observations on the structure of proteins at the membrane-membrane interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Paszek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wong and Groves, 2002</xref>).

We then extended this model to a hierarchical Bayesian model with acceptor density as a variable and applied it to FRET data for all molecules that were measured in the same cell type and with the same fluorescent dye pair. By regressing all measured data on the hierarchical model at once, we obtained <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> for each molecule from the estimated posterior predictive distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). The longest estimated <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> that could be resolved was 7.5 nm. Molecules with barely detectable FRET changes (e.g. MUC1 [14TR, 42TR], CD44) were expected to be larger than this maximum measurable distance and were not included in the analysis. Importantly, <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> of some glycoproteins (e.g. CD43) was found to be smaller than the receptor-ligand binding length of ACE2 and Spike (~27 nm), yet they inhibited viral infection. Thus, this result supports the rationale for our interface hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>The measured <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> was compared to the IC50 of infection inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The two parameters showed a good correlation for many molecules, but there was a group of molecules that deviated from this correlation. Outliers showing exceptionally weak inhibition (e.g. VCAM1, EPHB1) were found to be poorly glycosylated. This suggests that even proteins with similar equilibrium size in solution may have different inhibitory effects on infection depending on the amount of glycosylation. In the case of glycoproteins, there is a complex confounding relationship between these parameters because the number of amino acids to be glycosylated increases as the length of amino acids increases. However, it is suggested that glycosylation affects certain molecular properties other than average molecular size to produce the infection inhibitory effect.</p><p>Before examining the direct role of glycans in suppressing infection, the effects of glycans on molecular properties were examined from various perspectives. We found that <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> was strongly correlated with the molecular weight including glycans, but weakly correlated with the number of amino acids (correlation coefficient of 0.87 and 0.58, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous studies showing that Flory radii of branched polymers are determined by the total molecular weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hermans et al., 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreussling and Ullman, 1954</xref>). This suggests that <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> reflects the total chain length of amino acids and glycans, for which the total molecular weight is a better measure. It also suggests that for the same amino acid chain length, a protein with more glycans would have a longer <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>. This hypothesis can be tested by estimating the scaling exponent ν in the Flory model for <italic>R<sub>F</sub>~N<sup>ν</sup></italic>. The chain length <italic>N</italic> is the number of amino acids in this case. We estimated <italic>ν</italic> separately for highly glycosylated molecules (MUC1, CD43, CD164, CD24) and for low glycosylated molecules. The resulting <italic>ν</italic> for the two groups are 0.144 and 0.108, respectively. This shift in <italic>ν</italic> indicates that glycosylation increases the size of the protein at equilibrium, but the change in <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> is slight, for example, a 1.3-fold increase for one of the longest ectodomains with N=4000 when these values of ν are applied. This calculation also gives a rough estimate of the upper limit of the <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> of the extracellular domains of all membrane proteins in the human genome (approximately 10.5 nm). Physically, this change in <italic>ν</italic> by glycosylation may be caused by the increased intramolecular exclusion induced sterically between glycan chains. This estimated <italic>ν</italic> is much smaller than that of 0.6 for polymers in good solvents, possibly due to protein folding or anchoring effects on the membrane. In fact, the <italic>ν</italic> of an intrinsically disordered protein in solution has been reported to be close to 0.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Riback et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tesei et al., 2024</xref>). Overall, these analyses using the Flory model provide information on the size distribution of membrane proteins and the influence of glycans, although the model cannot predict the exact size of each protein due to its specific folding.</p><p>We also analyzed protein conformation. Conformational data for the ectodomain of all 2515 membrane proteins in our list were obtained from the Alpha Fold 2 prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) and the end-to-end distances of the proteins in these conformations were plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). Despite the large variation in this index among all proteins, the predicted Flory radii based on the measured scaling exponent ν were intermediate of all data plots, suggesting that protein sizes measured in our FLIM-FRET assays and the predicted conformations were in some agreement. Among the molecules we tested, the measured <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> were consistent with or smaller than those calculated from the Alpha Fold predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, there were molecules, such as VCAM1 and EPHB1, for which the end-to-end distance in conformation was predicted to be much larger than the Flory radius estimated in our measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). There were many other molecules in the 2515 molecules that were plotted much higher than the predicted Flory radius, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. Many of the molecules in this class are low glycosylated and tend to consist of multiple folded domains connected by flexible linkers, as seen in VCAM1 and EPHB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I</xref>). In contrast, the highly glycosylated proteins such as MUC1 (0TR) were predicted to be more globular and have fewer folded domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-I</xref>).</p><p>This discussion highlights the difference in size from <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> measurements and predicted conformations: the <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> is derived from an ensemble average, while Alpha Fold2 suggests only one representative conformation. Therefore, protein size estimates from highly anisotropic conformations may deviate significantly from the <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>. This is the case for low glycosylated proteins such as EPHB1 and VCAM1, which should have a very broad conformational landscape around its <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). This may suggest that protein glycosylation reduces the diversity of protein conformational space. This may be caused by the intramolecular interactions between amino acids and domain folding being interfered with by the glycans. If protein glycosylation functions to limit conformational dynamics, proteins may lose macroscopic flexibility with this modification. To test this hypothesis, further experimental validation or prediction with next-generation tools that include information on both conformational dynamics and multiresidue glycans would be needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abramson et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tesei et al., 2024</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>In vitro reconstitution of glycoprotein packing on membrane</title><p>The analysis in the previous section suggests that branching structures generated by molecular glycosylation may alter protein properties.

Thus, the saturation binding densities of these proteins reduced significantly by glycosylation. The ectodomain of EPHB1, a low-level glycosylated protein, bound in the intermediate density range. The binding density of non-glycosylated molecules was comparable to the saturation binding density shown for green fluorescent protein (GFP) on planar lipid bilayers (~7000 μm<sup>–2</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nye and Groves, 2008</xref>). Dissociation constants for membrane-bound glycosylated (g-) proteins (0.61 μM and 0.48 μM for CD43 and MUC1, respectively) were similar to or lower than those for bacterial (b-) proteins (3.84 μM and 12.6 μM for CD43 and MUC1, respectively), indicating that differences in molecular affinity for the lipid bilayer are not responsible for the large differences in saturation binding densities. The binding of all tested molecules was well explained by the standard first-order receptor-ligand binding reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and single molecule tracking experiments confirmed that both glycosylated (g-) and non-glycosylated and bacterial (b-) proteins were equally diffusible as individual molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, it is unlikely that there are protein-protein or protein-layer interactions that would allosterically affect protein packing.</p><p>To compare the packing of proteins with different molecular weights and <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>, we introduce the projected coverage area on the membrane as a normalized parameter, assuming that these molecules could be approximated by a hemisphere of <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>, when they are in the mushroom regime (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Halperin, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milner, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Under this assumption, the coverage of highly glycosylated proteins at binding saturation was ~20% for g-MUC1 and ~40% for g-CD43, respectively. These were smaller than the coverage of molecules at hexagonal close packing that is ~90.7%. In contrast, the coverage of b-CD43 and b-MUC1 at saturated binding was estimated to be greater than 100% under this normalization standard, indicating that the mean projected sizes of these molecules in surface direction were smaller than those expected from their <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>. Thus, it is clear that glycosylation reduces the saturation density of membrane proteins, regardless of molecular size.</p><p>Highly glycosylated proteins resisted densification, indicating that some intermolecular repulsion is occurring. In the framework of polymer brush theory, the intermolecular repulsion of densely packed highly glycosylated proteins is due to an increase in either <italic>f<sub>el</sub>, f<sub>int</sub>(d&lt;R<sub>F</sub></italic>), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hansen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). The term of intermolecular interaction, <italic>f<sub>int</sub></italic>, is regulated by intermolecular steric repulsion, which occurs when neighboring molecules cannot approach the excluded volume created by the stochastic configuration of the polymer chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Attili et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faivre et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kreussling and Ullman, 1954</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kuo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paturej et al., 2016</xref>). The magnitude of this steric repulsion depends largely on <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> in dilute solutions, but the molecular structure may also affect it when molecules are densified on a surface. In other words, the glycans protruding between molecules can cause steric inhibition between neighboring proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Such intermolecular repulsion due to branched side chains occurs only when the molecules are in close proximity and sterically interact on a two-dimensional surface, but not in dilute solution, and does not occur in unbranched polymers such as underglycosylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Based on the above, we propose the following model for membrane proteins: Only when the membrane proteins are glycosylated does strong steric repulsion occur between neighboring molecules during the densification process, suppressing densification.</p><p>The molecular structural state of these proteins needs to be further discussed to estimate the contribution of <italic>f<sub>el</sub></italic>, which represents resistance to molecular elongation. Our results suggest that these densely packed nonglycosylated molecules are no longer in a free mushroom state. However, their saturation density was several times lower than previously reported brush transition densities, such as 65,000 µm<sup>–2</sup> for 17 <italic>kDa</italic> polyacrylamide (<italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic> ~15 nm) on a solid surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wu et al., 2002</xref>). To compare our data on fluid bilayers with previously reported data on solid surfaces, we performed additional experiments with lipid bilayers that lost fluidity. No significant changes in protein binding between fluid and nonfluid bilayers were observed for both b-MUC1 and g-MUC1 molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This result suggests that membrane fluidity does not affect the average intermolecular distance or other relevant parameters that control molecular binding in the reconstituted system. Based on these, we speculate that the saturated protein density observed in our experiments is lower than or at most comparable to the actual brush transition density. Thus, although these crowded proteins may be restricted from free random motion, they are not significantly extended as in the condensed brush state, in which the contribution of resistance to molecular extension <italic>f<sub>el</sub></italic> is expected to be small relative to the overall free energy of the system.</p><p>Note that this does not mean that glycoproteins cannot form condensed brush structures: in fact, highly glycosylated molecules (e.g. MUC1) can form brush structures in cells when such proteins are expressed at very high densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shurer et al., 2019</xref>). In these cells, plasma membranes were forced to accommodate these large amounts of membrane proteins with hydrophobic transmembrane domains. In contrast, in our experiment, proteins were soluble in the aqueous phase, and we can analyze intermolecular repulsion in ectodomain independently from the effect of protein compartmentalization. In addition, cells containing brushed glycoproteins also transformed the cell membrane into a shape with an enormous amount of tubular structure. Such membrane deformation results in the increase of total surface area to reduce the density of glycoproteins, indicating that there is strong intermolecular repulsion between glycoproteins. In any case, the free energy of the system is determined by the balance between protein binding and insertion into the membrane, protein deformation, and repulsive forces between proteins, which determine the density of proteins depending on the configuration of the system. Thus, although strong intermolecular repulsions were prominently observed in our simplified system, this may not be the case in other systems. We also note that it has been previously shown that membrane tubules generated upon the insertion of polymers in membranes were neither inhibitory nor activating on viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaizuka and Machida, 2023</xref>). This is simply because these tubular structures are on the ~μm scale, and much larger than viruses, and we assumed that this logic can also be applied to membrane tubules generated by overcrowded glycocalyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shurer et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Super-resolution imaging of virus-cell interface</title><p>Glycosylation of proteins induces intermolecular repulsion, which affects the distribution of molecules on the membrane. Here, we measure the distribution of membrane proteins in situ to determine whether protein glycosylation induces molecular exclusion or trap at the virus-cell interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To address this question, we used dual-color super-resolution microscopy (STORM) imaging to locate each membrane glycoprotein and viral Spike proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rust et al., 2006</xref>). We found that the distribution patterns of these proteins are very diverse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To analyze these diverse results in an unbiased manner, we introduced a cross-correlation function <italic>C(r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). <italic>C(r</italic>) here is the probability distribution of distances between cellular and viral proteins, calculated as a radial normalization of the histogram of the mutual spacing distances <italic>r</italic> between cellular and viral proteins in the image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>). Although the cross-correlation function has often been used to analyze molecular co-localization in super-resolution images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schnitzbauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stone and Veatch, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Veatch et al., 2012</xref>), we intended to apply this function over a longer distance range to analyze protein distributions at the virus-cell interface. Since the localization of Spikes was limited in viruses that were only sparsely distributed throughout the image, <italic>C(r</italic>) in our study can somewhat reflect the average probability distribution of cellular proteins at distance <italic>r</italic> from these viruses in each image.

To solve this inverse problem, the information of relationship between <italic>C(r</italic>) and the interface molecular density is needed. To obtain this relationship, we adopted the approach of using simulated images. We prepared a set of <italic>C(r</italic>) plots calculated from simulated images of various types of virus-cell membrane interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These images were characterized by the parameter <italic>density_(in/out</italic>), which is the ratio of the mean density of membrane proteins inside and outside the virus-cell interface. Thus, this parameter <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) is the measure to know whether proteins at the virus-cell interface are excluded or not.</p><p>Simulated images included those in which the virus is isolated from the cell membrane (‘separation’) and those in which cell membrane molecules are concentrated on the virus and <italic>density_(in/out</italic>)&gt;1 (‘co-localized’). To organize the list of calculated <italic>C(r</italic>) for all simulated images, we introduced the index <italic>C(r)_(out/in</italic>), which is the ratio of the integral of <italic>C(r</italic>) at <italic>r</italic>=100–200 nm to the integral of <italic>C(r</italic>) at <italic>r</italic>=0–100 nm. This boundary <italic>r</italic>~100 nm was set since the size of virus is approximately 100 nm, and we assumed that this index reflects the ratio of the probability distribution of proteins inside and outside the viral–cell interface. Indeed, we found that <italic>C(r)_(out/in</italic>) increased continuously from ~0.2 to~2.0 at protein exclusion interfaces where <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) ranged from 0 to 1 and the densities were in the range of those in typical STORM images. In addition, the <italic>C(r)_(out/in</italic>) for ‘separation’ and ‘co-localization’ were found to be &gt;2.0 and&lt;0.2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Altogether, among these three types of cell–virus interface (co-localization, exclusion, and separation), the parameter <italic>C(r)_(out/in</italic>) increases monotonically along with the value of <italic>density_(in/out</italic>). Therefore, the average <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) for each image can be calibrated from <italic>C(r</italic>) using this relationship.</p><p>Next, images of cells with <italic>C(r)_(out/in)&lt;2.0</italic>, which are not in ‘separation’ and represent about 80% of all cells, were analyzed. As indicated above, the majority of viruses in these images would be expected to form an interface with the cells. <italic>C(r)_(out/in</italic>) and calibrated <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) were compared between molecules. <italic>Density_(in/out</italic>) was found to be similarly low for groups of membrane proteins, and molecules with molecular weights greater than 50 kDa (MUC1, CD44, F174B, VCAM1, EPHB1, all tagged with SNAP) were similarly excluded at the virus-cell interface to an average ~80% reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6GH</xref>). In contrast, much higher <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) was observed for VAMP2, a SNAP-tagged-only control molecule, and LCK10, a control molecule without any ectodomain, respectively, suggesting that only very low amounts of both of these molecules were excluded. The slight decrease in <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) for these control molecules may be an artifact caused by the oversimplification in the simulation of cell images.</p><p>These results showed that membrane proteins above a certain threshold size are excluded from the virus-cell interface, regardless of the degree of glycosylation. Interestingly, the transition from low-exclusion regime to high-exclusion regime occurred nonlinearly and abruptly with protein size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). This may be due to measurement bias in part, since we analyzed only viruses bound to the cell membrane but not ones already internalized in the cell. More viruses may be internalized in cells with smaller proteins, but they are not included in the analysis, and thus the rate of protein exclusion may be overestimated for cells with these smaller proteins. Nevertheless, the overall correlation between Flory radius and <italic>density_(in/out</italic>) can be calculated to be –0.36.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We hypothesize that the energy barrier <italic>U*</italic> required for the virus to form an interface with the cell is increased by glycosylation of membrane proteins in the plasma membrane, thereby suppressing infection. We summarize the mechanism based on our analyses. In the early stages of interface formation, the receptor and ligand form the binding point at the center, and there is a region with a longer interfacial distance around this center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As we have already seen, membrane proteins above a certain size are excluded from this region and an interface is formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The driving force for this molecular exclusion may be the adhesion energy of the interfacial membrane. Since membrane adhesion at the interface is a process that stabilizes the energy level of the system, molecular exclusion should be promoted. In reality, however, there are many viruses that bind to cells but are not taken up due to insufficient molecular exclusion at the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This means that there is an energy barrier that resists molecular exclusion from the interface.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for three distinct cases of virus – cell interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Energy and force involved in molecular exclusion from virus-cell interface.

(D-F) Schematic of virus-cell interface structure and corresponding free energy chart. (D) Virus-cell interface with very small membrane proteins. Due to the low energy penalty in constructing virus-cell interface entrapping these small molecules, the virus can form the interface without excluding proteins and can infect cells. (E-F). Virus-cell interface structure for larger membrane proteins. Interface formation requires protein exclusion. Due to membrane viscosity and inhomogeneous field in adhesive energy, excluded proteins become crowded at proximity of the interface. In the case for highly glycosylated proteins (<bold>F</bold>), intermolecular repulsion between excluded proteins becomes very high at high density regions. Such repulsion generates a high kinetic barrier for molecular exclusion, preventing the process from proceeding to subsequent steps for infection. In contrast, in the case of low glycosylated proteins (<bold>E</bold>), their intermolecular repulsion and energy barrier are lower, and thus these molecules are easier to be excluded from the interface, and virus infection is not strongly inhibited.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101175-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>A possible factor creating an energy barrier to molecular exclusion is the strong viscosity of the plasma membrane, experimentally confirmed to be on the scale of ~1 µm<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In such an environment of strong viscosity, when molecular exclusion from the interface bond center to the periphery proceeds, viscous stress is generated to resist the movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Viscous stress, however, is created in the lipid bilayer and is common to all transmembrane molecules, regardless of protein glycosylation.</p><p>On the other hand, the glycosylation of ectodomain affects the intermolecular repulsion on the plasma membrane when the molecular density increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Are there situations in which this repulsion has an effect on molecular exclusion? We assume that the density of excluded molecules increases at the outer edge of the interface and that intermolecular interaction there is strongly affected by glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Molecular exclusion occurs only in the region inside the viral interface, while molecules outside the interface only diffuse. And the cell membrane is highly viscous. As a result, we speculate that molecules may become locally and instantaneously crowded in the vicinity of the interface. In such a geometry, the interface between the virus and the cell membrane can only be formed if the virus and membrane proteins are all squeezed into that narrow area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). If the density increase is sufficiently large, the glycosylated molecules may experience strong intermolecular repulsion, preventing them from being packed together with the virus. On the other hand, molecules with low glycosylation may be readily distorted and accept crowding by being brushed. We propose that this difference creates an energy barrier that would kinetically inhibit the processes of interface formation and molecular exclusion.</p><p>Based on this model, we can classify the structure of the interface into three types depending on the type of cell membrane protein. The first is the case where the membrane protein is small and thus infection can proceed even if the protein is trapped at the viral cell membrane interface, at least in low-density situations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). For highly glycosylated molecules above a certain size, the glycans interfere with molecular exclusion by generating strong intermolecular repulsion and preventing successful interface formation. As a result, viral infection is inhibited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). For molecules above a certain size but with low glycosylation, intermolecular repulsion is weak and molecular exclusion is easily enabled, resulting in the formation of an interface and progression to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).</p><p>This nonequilibrium model may be mathematically represented by incorporating terms for viscous stress and molecular diffusion. If the entire process can be mathematically modeled, it may be possible to relate the energy barrier <italic>U*</italic> to the average molecular density and <italic>R<sub>F</sub></italic>. If such a model can be successfully incorporated into a hierarchical Bayesian model, it may be possible to relate the IC50 value of each molecule to the number of glycans. This model may explain the sharp decline in infection efficiency that could not be reproduced by the simple Sigmoid model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>When the virus receptor is a glycoprotein or glycan itself, the inhibition of virus infection by glycans becomes more complex because the total amount of glycans is also a function of the receptor density. It is also important to note that the total amount of infection into a cell is the time integral of virus entry. Even if the probability of virus entry is significantly reduced by glycans, the cumulative number of virus entries may increase if high concentrations of virus continue to be supplied from outside the cell for a long period of time. In the case of Adenovirus, which continues to amplify in HEK293T cells after infection, we showed that MUC1 on the cell surface has an inhibitory effect on long-term cumulative infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). However, such an accumulation effect may be case-by-case depending on the virus cell system and may be more pronounced when the cell surface density of virus receptor molecules is high. As a result, if the virus receptor molecule is a glycan or glycoprotein and infection continues for a long period of time, the infection inhibition effect may not be observed despite an apparent increase in the total amount of glycans in the cell. In any case, our results clarified the factor of virus entry inhibition dependent on the total amount of glycans because appropriate conditions were set.</p><p>In this study, we attempted to generalize the surface structure on the cell side, but the surface structure on the virus side may also have an effect. The efficiency of virus adsorption and the efficiency of cell membrane protein exclusion from the interface will change depending on the molecular length of the receptor-ligand, although receptor priming also has an effect. In addition, free ligands of the viral envelope or other coexisting glycoproteins may also have an effect as they are also required for exclusion from the virus-cell interface. In fact, there are reports that expression of CD43 and PSGL-1 on the virus surface reduces virus infection efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Murakami et al., 2020</xref>). Such interface structure may be one of the factors that determine the infection efficiency that differs depending on the virus strain. More generally, modification of the surface structure may be effective for designing materials such as lipid nanoparticles that construct the interface with cells.</p><p>This paper has laid the foundation for a strategy to describe molecular nonspecific functions by means of molecules. The next step, for example, would be to obtain quantitative relationships between the cell transcriptome and the amount of glycans on the cell surface, where machine learning may be useful. Future goals of these kinds of studies would be to treat nonspecific phenomena within the same framework as other molecule- and gene-specific functions. In addition, even with the current advances in machine learning and single-cell data technology, it is still difficult in many areas to predict cellular-level phenotypes from genomics and transcriptomes. Therefore, we believe it is useful to mix such auxiliary methods that utilize a combination of statistics and rule-based physical models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and materials</title><p>All reagents are listed in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, with information of software used in this study.

To meet the 4000 amino acid sequence maximum cutoff in NetNGlyc, part of cytoplasmic sequences in three long proteins (UniProt Entry: Q14517, Q07954, Q9NYQ8) were eliminated in the calculations. Next, we identified the ectodomain regions of these proteins by collecting topological information from UniProt.

These cells that were pre-stained with 5 µM SNAP-Surface 647 (New England Biolabs) for 1 hr at room temperature, if necessary, were stained with 5 µg/mL of Alexa488-labeled lectins (PNA, WGA (Wako Fujifilm) or SSA (J-Chemical)) for 1 hr at room temperature. These labeled lectins were obtained by labeling in-house with Alexa488 NHS ester (Thermo Fisher).

After washout with PBS, cells were subject to flow cytometry assay, using SH800 (Sony).</p><p>The binding of PNA lectins to cells was modeled by making various modifications to the standard ligand-receptor binding. Each sample consists of a test tube of cells expressing one kind of membrane protein. Reaction for each sample is batch-based, with excess PNA ligand of concentration [L] in a tube. The reaction was approximated to be a first-order binding with the receptor, which is an individual sugar chain on a membrane protein. Due to steric hindrance, it was assumed that at most only one lectin binds to one sugar chain. It was also assumed that PNA binding reaction is governed by the same kinetics for glycans branched from all the different membrane proteins. In other words, all glycans of all tubes are equivalent in the reaction kinetic. Glycans in all tubes are assumed to be in equilibrium in the binding to lectin, as [L] is very excess, despite the variance of total number of glycans between tubes. Thus, the only difference between the samples is the number of glycans per one protein molecule.

This calibration method is based on the calibration strategy between intensities of two different dyes using fluorimeter, developed for microscopy imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Galush et al., 2008</xref>). Liposome standards containing fluorescent molecules (0.01–0.75 mol% perylene [Sigma], 0.1–1.25 mol% Bodipy FL [Thermo Fisher], and 0.005–0.1% DiD) as well as DOPC (Avanti polar lipids) were measured in flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Meanwhile, by fluorimeter, fluorescence signals of these liposomes and known concentrations of recombinant mTagBFP2, AcGFP, and TagRFP-657 proteins and SNAP-Surface 488 and Alexa 647 dyes (New England Biolabs) were measured in the same excitation and emission ranges as in flow cytometry assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M</xref>). Ratios between the integral of fluorescent intensities in this range between two dyes of interest are used for converting the signals measured in flow cytometry. Additional information needed for calibration is the size difference between liposomes and cells. The average diameter of liposomes is measured to be 130 nm, and the diameter of HEK 293T cells is estimated to be 13 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Furlan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ushiyama et al., 2015</xref>). From these data, the signal from cells acquired by flow cytometry can be calibrated to molecular surface density. For example, the Alexa 647 signal acquired by flow cytometry can be converted to the signal of the same concentration of DID dye using fluorometer data, but the density of the dye is unknown at this point. This converted DID signal can then be calibrated to the density on liposomes rather than cells using liposome flow cytometry data. Finally, adjusted for the size difference between liposomes and cells, the surface molecular density on cells is determined. By going through one cycle of these procedures, we could obtain a calibration unit, such as 1 flow cytometry signal for a cell in the designated illumination and detection setting = 0.0272 mTagBFP2 µm<sup>–2</sup> on cell surface. All fluorescent proteins were assumed to be matured and fluorescent. For SNAP-tagged proteins, we confirmed that the binding of fluorescent substrate to cells expressing SNAP-tagged membrane proteins was saturated when incubated with 5 µM substrate, and background fluorescent signal of nonspecific binding was minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, we also assumed that most of the SNAP-tagged proteins in cells were fluorescent and all the fluorescent signals from these proteins were detected in our assays. ACE2-TagBFP expressions varied between samples, which affects the infection rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). We checked the ACE density of cells at the time of virus infection, and only cells with ACE2 expressed in the range where infection linearly increases with ACE2 density were chosen for infection assays, and the final results of GFP intensities were adjusted with the mean ACE2 densities measured at the time of infection and the calibration line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Inhibition of infection was evaluated by the average density of target membrane proteins measured at the time of infection, and the infection rate of samples was normalized by the infection rate of control infection samples that did not express inhibitory proteins in the cells.</p><p>For the imaging of virus infections in air-liquid interface culture, after the 10 days of air-liquid interface culturing of Calu-3 cell monolayer in Transwell, SARS-CoV2-PP was administrated at ∼0.015 pg/cell for 3 hr at 37 C, then cells were cultured for 2 days after the washout of residual viruses. Prior to imaging, cells were stained with Hoechst 33342, Alexa647 labeled lectins, primary and secondary antibodies, sequentially. Stacked images in the z axis were maximum projected by Fiji/ImageJ to compare signals in different channels. Pearson correlation and TOS correlation were calculated for maximum projection images and were performed by EzColocalization plugins in Fiji/ImageJ for all pixels without selecting any ROIs for cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stauffer et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, all pixels were classified depending on the intensity of two signals in unbiased manners. Then, expectations for two signals were calculated separately in all these classes, resulting in a computed TOS matrix in which those numbers indicate whether the number of objects classified in each region is higher or lower than expected for uniformly distributed data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Endocytosis assay</title><p>1.0 mg/mL FITC-labeled 10 kDa dextran (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) was incubated with HEK293T cells expressing various membrane proteins at 37 °C for 30 min.

Doubly stained cells were imaged by Leica SP8 equipped with FLIM module, and the lifetime of fluorescence of donor ATTO 488 was measured and imaged in the FLIM mode. The lifetime was estimated as the time constant in the exponential decay in the histogram of time interval between the excitation laser pulse and emitted photons. A histogram was generated from ROI images cropped from cell membranes for each image, thus the measured lifetime reflected photon emissions from all dyes located in the image ROIs.</p><p>We introduced a simple model to analyze the height of protein ectodomain from the membrane, from FLIM-FRET data.

Then, we also approximated that FRET occurred between a single donor and multiple acceptor molecules located in a nearby plane at the distance of z.

In our experiments, we found that SNAP – surface 488 (Atto 488 dye) and PlasMem Bright Red were good FRET pairs, in the context of both FRET efficiency and dye stability in membrane localization. Unfortunately, details of molecular and optical information regarding PlasMem Bright Red are not disclosed, and Ro for this pair of dyes cannot be directly calculated. Therefore, we estimated the Ro for PlasMem Bright Red by comparing two experiments in the same setting with this dye and the other dye with known Ro value, Glow 590. Ro for ATTO488 and MemGlow 590 was determined as 5.68 nm, calculated from optical and spectral information of the two dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu and Brand, 1994</xref>). Then, we went through the above procedure and estimated the effective Ro for ATTO 488 and PlasMem Bright Red to be 6.45 nm. Note that this value is only valid in our experimental setting, since the molecular information for PlasMem Bright Red was unclear and its surface density on cells was not measurable. Due to this uncertainty, upon the estimation and the use of effective Ro value, we needed to set ‘effective surface density’ for PlasmMem Bright Red for FLIM-FRET measurement, which is equal to the actual density of MemGlow 590 in cells stained with designated dye concentrations. Under this assumption, the effective Ro was estimated from the regressions in the plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and this effective value was applied to all other FLIM-FRET analyses. We confirmed by flow cytometry that fluorescence signals of bound PlasMem Bright Red to cells linearly increased as MemGlow 590, when both days were added to cell suspension in staining procedure at the equal molar ratios. Therefore, the actual surface density for PlasMem Bright Red should be linearly varied from these effective values.</p><p>FLIM-FRET data for different molecules were analyzed in a single Bayesian statistical model:<disp-formula id="equ9"><alternatives><mml:math id="m9"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>Y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">_</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">_</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t9">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle Y\_ i =\frac{ \sigma }{ \left ( \sigma + \alpha \_ i\right)}$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ10"><alternatives><mml:math id="m10"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">_</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>6</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">_</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t10">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle \alpha \_ i = \frac{2}{\pi }\frac{1}{Ro^{6}}z\_ i^{4},$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>by setting the acceptor density σ as variable, and inferring α_i for each molecule to calculate z_i, which is the Forster distance for each molecule, while (2/π)/(1/Ro^6) is constant through all molecules. α_i were bound in the half normal distribution whose variance µ were bound in Gaussian prior distribution, and the Gaussian noise <italic>sc</italic> was added to Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The coordinates of the center of the virus were varied among the simulated images. <italic>C(r</italic>) for these simulated images was computed as above; a plot of <italic>C(r</italic>) versus density_(out/in) showed that a polynomial was a reasonable fit, so Bayesian inference was performed with a fifth-order polynomial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All unique/stable reagents generated in this study are available from the corresponding author with a completed materials transfer agreement.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of all reagents and software used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-101175-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>List of 2515List human membrane proteins whose ectodomain amino sequences were used for glycosylation predictions by NetN/O Glyc and GlycoEP.</title><p>Length of amino acid sequences in ectodomains as well as ratio of glycosylation site per amino acid are listed for all molecules.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-101175-supp2-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Glycosylation prediction data for MUC1 truncation mutants and mouse proteins used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-101175-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-101175-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Original code as well as raw and processed data analyzed through the code are available in an online repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ykaizuka/eLife_glycoprotein-virus">https://github.com/ykaizuka/eLife_glycoprotein-virus</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaizuka, 2024</xref>).

Using a suite of biochemical, biophysical, and computational methods in multiple contexts (ex vivo, in vitro, and in silico), the authors collect compelling evidence supporting the notion that (1) a wide range of surface glycoproteins erect an energy barrier for the virus to form stable adhesive interface needed for fusion and uptake and (2) the total amount of glycan, independent of their molecular identity, additively enhanced the suppression.</p><p>As a functional assay the authors focus on viral infection starting from the assumption that a physical boundary modulated by overexpressing a protein-of-interest could prevent viral entry and subsequent infection. Here they find that glycan content (measured using the PNA lectin) of the overexpressed protein and total molecular weight, that includes amino acid weight and the glycan weight, is negatively correlated with viral infection. They continue to demonstrate that it is in effect the total glycan content, using a variety of lectin labelling, that is responsible for reduced infection in cells. Because the authors do not find a loss in virus binding this allows them to hypothesize that the glycan content presents a barrier for the stable membrane-membrane contact between virus and cell. They subsequently set out to determine the effective radius of the proteins at the membrane and demonstrate that on a supported lipid bilayer the glycosylated proteins do not transition from the mushroom to the brush regime at the densities used. Finally, using Super Resolution microscopy they find that above an effective radius of 5 nm proteins are excluded from the virus-cell interface.</p><p>The experimental design does not present major concerns and the results provide insight on a biophysical mechanism according to which, repulsion forces between branched glycan chains of highly glycosylated proteins exert a kinetic energy barrier that limits the formation of a membrane/viral interface required for infection.</p><p>In their revised manuscript and rebuttal, the authors address several general and specific concerns that were raised about their first submission. The revised manuscript now makes the strength of the evidence supporting their claims, compelling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101175.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kaizuka</surname><given-names>Yoshihisa</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Institute for Materials Science Japan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tsukuba Ibaraki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Machida</surname><given-names>Rika</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>National Institute for Materials Science Japan</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tsukuba Ibaraki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Review</bold></p><p>GENERAL QUESTIONS:</p><p>(1) For many enveloped viruses, the attachment factors - paradoxically - are also surface glycoproteins, often complexed with a distinct fusion protein. The authors note here that the glycoportiens do not inhibit the initial binding, but only limit the stability of the adhesive interface needed for subsequent membrane fusion and viral uptake. How these antagonistic tendencies might play out should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>When the surface density of receptor molecules for a virus with glycans increases, the density of free glycans not bound to the virus increases along with the amount of virus adsorbed. However, if the total amount of glycans is considered to be a function of the receptor density, the reaction may become more complicated. This complication may also be affected by the prolonged infection. If the receptor density on the cell surface is high, the infection inhibitory effect of glycans may not be obtained in a system in which a high concentration of virus is supplied from the outside world for a long time. This is because once viruses have entered the cell, they accumulate inside the cell, and viral infection is affected by the total accumulated amount, which is the integration of the number of viruses that have entered over time. This distinction indicates that the virus entry reaction and the total amount of infection in the cell must be considered separately. This is an important point, but it was not clearly mentioned in the original manuscript.</p><p>Our experiments were conducted under conditions that clearly allowed us to detect the virusinhibiting function of glycans without being affected by the above points. In order to clarify these points, we will revise this article as follows, referring to an experiment that is somewhat related to this discussion (the Adenovirus infection experiment into HEK293T cells shown in Figure S1F)..</p><p>(Page-3, Introduction)</p><p>While there are known examples of glycans that function as viral receptors (Thompson et al., 2019), these results demonstrate that a variety of glycoproteins negatively regulate viral infection in a wide range of systems. All of these results suggest that bulky membrane glycoproteins nonspecifically inhibit viral infection.</p><p>(Page 20, Discussion)</p><p>When the virus receptor is a glycoprotein or glycan itself, the inhibition of virus infection by glycans becomes more complex because the total amount of glycans is also a function of the receptor density. It is also important to note that the total amount of infection into a cell is the time integral of virus entry. Even if the probability of virus entry is significantly reduced by glycans, the cumulative number of virus entries may increase if high concentrations of virus continue to be supplied from outside the cell for a long period of time. In the case of Adenovirus, which continues to amplify in HEK293T cells after infection, we showed that MUC1 on the cell surface has an inhibitory effect on long-term cumulative infection (Supplementary Figure 1F). However, such an accumulation effect may be caseby-case depending on the virus cell system, and may be more pronounced when the cell surface density of virus receptor molecules is high. As a result, if the virus receptor molecule is a glycan or glycoprotein and infection continues for a long period of time, the infection inhibition effect may not be observed despite an apparent increase in the total amount of glycans in the cell. In any case, our results clarified the factor of virus entry inhibition dependent on the total amount of glycans because appropriate conditions were set.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Unlike polymers tethered to solid surface undergoing mushroom-to-brush transition in densitydependent manner, the glycoproteins at the cell surface are of course mobile (presumably in a density-dependent manner). They can thus redistribute in spatial patterns, which serve to minimize the free energy. I suggest the authors explicitly address how these considerations influence the in vitro reconstitution assays seeking to assess the glycosylation-dependent protein packing.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed additional experiments using lipid bilayers that had lost fluidity, and found that there is no significant difference in protein binding between fluid and nonfluid bilayers. The redistribution of molecules due to molecular fluidity may play some roles but not in our experimental systems. It suggests that glycoproteins can generate intermolecular repulsion even in fluid conditions such as cell membranes, just as they do on the solid phase. This experiment was also very useful because it allowed us to compare our results in the fluid bilayer with solid-state measurements of saturation molecular density and the brush transition. This comparison gave us confidence that in the reconstituted membrane system, even at saturation density, the membrane proteins are not as stretched as they are in the condensed brush state. We have therefore added a new paragraph and a new figure (Supplementary Fig. 5B) to discuss this issue, as follows:</p><p>The molecular structural state of these proteins needs to be further discussed to estimate the contribution of f<sub>el</sub>, which represents resistance to molecular elongation. Our results suggest that these densely packed nonglycosylated molecules are no longer in a free mushroom state. However, their saturation density was several times lower than previously reported brush transition densities, such as 65000 µm<sup>-2</sup> for 17 kDa polyacrylamide (R<sub>F</sub> ~ 15 nm) on a solid surface (Wu et al., 2002). To compare our data on fluid bilayers with previously reported data on solid surfaces, we performed additional experiments with lipid bilayers that lost fluidity. No significant changes in protein binding between fluid and nonfluid bilayers were observed for both b-MUC1 and g-MUC1 molecules (Supplementary Figure 5B). This result suggests that membrane fluidity does not affect the average intermolecular distance or other relevant parameters that control molecular binding in the reconstituted system. Based on these, we speculate that the saturated protein density observed in our experiments is lower than or at most comparable to the actual brush transition density. Thus, although these crowded proteins may be restricted from free random motion, they are not significantly extended as in the condensed brush state, in which the contribution of resistance to molecular extension f<sub>el</sub> is expected to be small relative to the overall free energy of the system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The discussion of the role of excluded volume in steric repulsion between glycoprotein needs clarification. As presented, it's unclear what the role of &quot;excluded volume&quot; effects is in driving steric repulsion? Do the authors imply depletion forces? Or the volume unavailable due to stochastic configurations of gaussian chains? How does the formalism apply to branched membrane glycoproteins is not immediately obvious.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the excluded volume due to steric repulsion between glycoproteins, we considered the volume that cannot be used by glycans as Gaussian chains branching from the main chain. We would like to expand on this point by adding several papers that make similar arguments. I'm glad you brought this up because we hadn't considered depletion forces - the excluded volume between glycoproteins should generate a depletion force, but in this case we believe this force will not have a significant effect on viruses that are larger than the glycoproteins. We also attempted to clarify the discussion in this section by focusing on intermolecular repulsion, and restructured paragraphs, which are also related to General Question 2 and Specific Question 2. The relevant part has been revised as follows. (page 15~page16)：</p><p>To compare the packing of proteins with different molecular weights and R<sub>F</sub>, These were smaller than the coverage of molecules at hexagonal close packing that is ~90.7%. In contrast, the coverage of b-CD43 and b-MUC1 at saturated binding was estimated to be greater than 100% under this normalization standard, indicating that the mean projected sizes of these molecules in surface direction were smaller than those expected from their R<sub>F</sub> Thus, it is clear that glycosylation reduces the saturation density of membrane proteins, regardless of molecular size.</p><p>Highly glycosylated proteins resisted densification, indicating that some intermolecular repulsion is occurring. In the framework of polymer brush theory, the intermolecular repulsion of densely packed highly glycosylated proteins is due to an increase in either f<sub>el</sub>, f<sub>int</sub> (d&lt;R<sub>F</sub>), or both (Hansen et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2002). The term of intermolecular interaction, f<sub>int</sub>, is regulated by intermolecular steric repulsion, which occurs when neighboring molecules cannot approach the excluded volume created by the stochastic configuration of the polymer chain (Attili et al., 2012; Faivre et al., 2018; Kreussling and Ullman, 1954; Kuo et al., 2018; Paturej et al., 2016). The magnitude of this steric repulsion depends largely on R<sub>F</sub> in dilute solutions, but the molecular structure may also affect it when molecules are densified on a surface. In other words, the glycans protruding between molecules can cause steric inhibition between neighboring proteins (Figure 5D). Such intermolecular repulsion due to branched side chains occurs only when the molecules are in close proximity and sterically interact on a twodimensional surface, but not in dilute solution, and does not occur in unbranched polymers such as underglycosylated proteins (Figure 5D). Based on the above, we propose the following model for membrane proteins: Only when the membrane proteins are glycosylated does strong steric repulsion occur between neighboring molecules during the densification process, suppressing densification.</p><p>The molecular structural state of these proteins needs to be further discussed to estimate the contribution of f<sub>el</sub>, which represents resistance to molecular elongation. Our results suggest that these densely packed nonglycosylated molecules are no longer in a free mushroom state. However, their saturation density was several times lower than previously reported brush transition densities, such as 65000 µm<sup>-2</sup> for 17 kDa polyacrylamide (R<sub>F</sub> ~ 15 nm) on a solid surface (Wu et al., 2002). To compare our data on fluid bilayers with previously reported data on solid surfaces, we performed additional experiments with lipid bilayers that lost fluidity. No significant changes in protein binding between fluid and nonfluid bilayers were observed for both b-MUC1 and g-MUC1 molecules (Supplementary Figure 5B). This result suggests that membrane fluidity does not affect the average intermolecular distance or other relevant parameters that control molecular binding in the reconstituted system. Based on these, we speculate that the saturated protein density observed in our experiments is lower than or at most comparable to the actual brush transition density. Thus, although these crowded proteins may be restricted from free random motion, they are not significantly extended as in the condensed brush state, in which the contribution of resistance to molecular extension f<sub>el</sub>, is expected to be small relative to the overall free energy of the system.</p><p>Note that this does not mean that glycoproteins cannot form condensed brush structures: in fact, highly glycosylated molecules (e.g., MUC1) can form brush structures in cells when such proteins are expressed at very high densities. (Shurer et al., 2019). In these cells, ………. Such membrane deformation results in the increase of total surface area to reduce the density of glycoproteins, indicating that there is strong intermolecular repulsion between glycoproteins. In any case, the free energy of the system is determined by the balance between protein binding and insertion into the membrane, protein deformation, and repulsive forces between proteins, which determine the density of proteins depending on the configuration of the system. Thus, although strong intermolecular repulsions were prominently observed in our simplified system, this may not be the case in other systems. ……</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors showed that glycoprotein expression inversely correlated with viral infection and link viral entry inhibition to steric hindrance caused by the glycoprotein. Alternative explanations would be that the glycoprotein expression (a) reroutes endocytosed viral particles or (b) lowers cellular endocytic rates and via either mechanism reduce viral infection. The authors should provide evidence that these alternatives are not occurring in their system. They could for example experimentally test whether non-specific endocytosis is still operational at similar levels, measured with fluid-phase markers such as 10kDa dextrans.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the experiment suggested by the reviewer are shown in the new Supplementary Figure 3B. (This results in generation of a new Supplementary Figure 3, and previous Supplementary Figures 4-5 are now renumbered as Supplementary Figures 5-6). Endocytosis of 10KDa dextran was attenuated by the expression of several large-sized molecules, but was not affected by the expression of many other glycoproteins that have the ability to inhibit infection. These results were clearly different from the results in which virus infection was inhibited more by the amount of glycan than by molecular weight. Therefore, it was found that many glycoproteins inhibit virus infection through processes other than endocytosis. Based on the above, we have added the following to the manuscript: （p9 New paragraph:）</p><p>We also investigated the effect of membrane glycoproteins on membrane trafficking, another process involved in viral infection. Expression of MUC1 with higher number of tandem repeats reduced the dextran transport in the fluid phase, while expression of multiple membrane glycoproteins that have infection inhibitory effects, including truncated MUC1 molecules, showed no effect on fluid phase endocytosis, indicating a molecular weight-dependent effect (Supplementary Figure 3B). The molecular weight-dependent inhibition of endocytosis may be due to factors such as steric inhibition of the approach of dextran molecules or a reduction in the transportable volume within the endosome. In any case, it is clear that many low molecular weight glycoproteins inhibit infection by disturbing processes other than endocytosis. Based on the above, we focus on the effect of glycoproteins on the formation of the interface between the virus and the cell membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors approach their system with the goal of generalizing the cell membrane (the cumulative effect of all cell membrane molecules on viral entry), but what about the inverse? How does the nature of the molecule seeking entry affect the interface? For example, a lipid nanoparticle vs a virus with a short virus-cell distance vs a virus with a large virus-cell distance?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your interesting comment. If the molecular size of the ligand is large, it should affect virus adsorption and molecular exclusion from the interface. In lipid nanoparticle applications, controlling this parameter may contribute to efficiency. In addition, a related discussion is the influence of virus shell molecules that are not bound to the receptor. I will revise the text based on the above.</p><p>Discussion (as a new paragraph after the paragraph added in Q1):</p><p>In this study, we attempted to generalize the surface structure on the cell side, but the surface structure on the virus side may also have an effect. The efficiency of virus adsorption and the efficiency of cell membrane protein exclusion from the interface will change depending on the molecular length of the receptor-ligand, although receptor priming also has an effect. In addition, free ligands of the viral envelope or other coexisting glycoproteins may also have an effect as they are also required for exclusion from the virus-cell interface. In fact, there are reports that expression of CD43 and PSGL-1 on the virus surface reduces virus infection efficiency (Murakami et al., 2020). Such interface structure may be one of the factors that determine the infection efficiency that differs depending on the virus strain. More generally, modification of the surface structure may be effective for designing materials such as lipid nanoparticles that construct the interface with cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SPECIFIC QUESTIONS:</p><p>(1) The proposed mechanism indicates that glycosylation status does not produce an effect in the &quot;trapping&quot; of virus, but in later stages of the formation of the virus/membrane interface due to the high energetic costs of displacing highly glycosylated molecules at the vicinity of the virus/membrane interface. It is suggested to present a correlation between the levels of glycans in the Calu-3 cell monolayers and the number of viral particles bound to cell surface at different pulse times. Results may be quantified following the same method as shown in Figure 2 for the correlation between glycosylation levels and viral infection (in this case the resulting output could be number of viral particles bound as a function of glycan content).</p></disp-quote><p>The results of this experiment are now shown as Supplementary Figure 2F and 2G. We compared the amount of virus bound after incubation for 10 minutes or for 3 hours as in the infection experiment, but no negative correlation was found between the total amount of glycans on the surface of the Calu3 monolayer and the amount of virus bound. Interestingly, there was a sight positive correlation was detected, which may be due to concentrated virus receptor expressions in glycan-enriched cells. This result shows that glycoproteins do not strongly inhibit virus binding. We will amend the text as follows (see also Q6).</p><p>(Page 10)</p><p>Glycans could be one of the biochemical substances ……We found that a large number of SARS-CoV2-PP can still bind to cells even when cells expressed sufficient amounts of the glycoprotein that could account for the majority of glycans within these cells and inhibit viral infection (Figure 3A). Similarly, on the two-dimensional culture surface of Calu-3 cells, no negative correlation was observed between the number of viruses bound and the total amount of glycans on the cell surface (Supplementary Figure 2F-G). The slight positive correlation between bound virus and glycans may be due to higher expression levels of viral receptors in glycan-rich cells. ….</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The use of the purified glycosylated and non-glycosylated ectodomains of MUC1 and CD-43 to establish a relationship between glycosylation and protein density into lipid bilayers on silica beads is an elegant approach. An assessment of the impact of glycosylation in the structural conformation of both proteins, for instance determining the Flory radius of the glycosylated and non-glycosylated ectodomains by the FRET-FLIM approach used in Figure 4 would serve to further support the hypothesis of the article.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the proposed experiment did not provide a strong enough FRET signal for analysis. This was due in part to the difficulty in constructing a bead-coated bilayer incorporating PlasMem Bright Red, which established a good FRET pair in cell experiments. We also tried other fluorescent molecules, but were unable to obtain a strong and stable FRET signal. Another reason may be that the curvature of the beads is larger than that of the cells, making it difficult to obtain a sufficient cumulative FRET effect from multiple membrane dyes. We plan to improve the experimental system in the future.</p><p>On the other hand, we also found that in this system, the signal changes were very subtle, making it difficult to detect molecular conformational changes using FRET. After reconsidering general questions (2) and (3), we speculated that the molecular density in the experiment, even at saturation binding, was below or at most equivalent to the brush transition point. In other words, proteins on the bead-coated bilayer may not be significantly extended in the vertical direction. Therefore, the conformational changes of these proteins may not be large enough to be detected by the FRET assay. We updated Figure 3C and Figure 5D (model description) to better reflect the above discussion and introduced the following discussion in the manuscript.</p><p>(page11)</p><p>We introduced the framework of conventional polymer brush theory to study the structure of viruscell interfaces containing proteins……. Numerous experimental measurements of the formation of polymer brushes have also been reported (Overney et al., 1996; Wu et al., 2002; Zhao and Brittain, 2000). In these measurements, the transition to a brush typically occurs at a density higher than that required to pack a surface with hemispherical polymers of diameter R<sub>F</sub>. This is the point at which the energy loss due to repulsive forces between adjacent molecules (f<sub>int</sub>) exceeds the energy required to stretch the polymer perpendicularly into a brush (f<sub>el</sub>).</p><p>(page16)</p><p>The molecular structural state of these proteins needs to be further discussed to estimate the contribution of f<sub>el</sub>, which represents resistance to molecular elongation.

On the contrary, in a different experiment shown in Fig2D and Fig2H MUC1 has almost no effect in reducing viral infection. It is not clear how these two findings can be compatible.</p></disp-quote><p>The immunostaining results show that the density of MUC1 molecules is very low in the experimental system in Figure 2 (Figure 2C), which is supported by the SC-RNASeq data (as shown in Supplementary Figure 2A, MUC1 is not listed as a top molecule). In other words, the MUC1 expression level in this experiment is too low to affect virus infection inhibition. On the other hand, the Pearson correlation function represents the strength of the linear relationship between two variables, so it is not the most appropriate indicator for seeing the correlation with the MUC1 expression level, which has little change (Figure 2D, 2F). In fact, even TOS analysis, which can see the correlation by focusing on the cells with the highest expression level, cannot detect the correlation (Figure 2H).Therefore, the MUC1 data in Figure 2DFH will be annotated and corrected in the figure legend.</p><p>Figure2 Legend:</p><p>MUC1 has a small mean expression level and variance, and is more affected by measurement noise than other molecules when calculating the Pearson correlation function (Figure 2C-2F). In addition, the number of cells in which expression can be detected is small, so no significant correlation was detected by TOS analysis (Figure 2H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Why is there a shift in the use of the glycan marker? How does this affect the conclusions? For the infection correlation relating protein expression with glycan content the PNA-lectin was used together with flow cytometry. For imaging the infection and correlating with glycan content the SSA-lectin is used.</p></disp-quote><p>For each cell line, we selected the lectin that could be measured over the widest dynamic range. This lectin is thought to recognize the predominant glycan species in the cell line (Fig. S1C, Fig. 2D). In our model, we believe that viral infection inhibition is not specific to the type of sugar, but is highly dependent on the total amount of glycans. If this hypothesis is correct, the reason we used different lectins in each experiment is simply to select the lectin that recognizes the most predominant glycan species that is most convenient for predicting the total amount of glycans in cells. This hypothesis is consistent with our observations, where the total amount of glycans estimated by different lectins could explain the infection inhibition in a similar way in the experiments in Figures 1 and 2, and the TOS analysis in Figure 2 showed that minor glycans also have an infection inhibitory effect. On the other hand, it is of course possible to predict the total amount of glycans more accurately by obtaining as much information on glycans as possible (related to Q5). Based on the above discussion, the manuscript will be revised as follows.</p><p>Page5</p><p>Using HEK293T cell lines exogenously expressing genes of these proteins tagged with fluorescent markers, their glycosylation was measured by binding of a lectin from Arachis hypogaea (PNA), and the number of these proteins in the cells was measured simultaneously. PNA was used for the measurement because it has a wider dynamic range than other lectins (Supplementary Figure 1C). This suggests that GalNAc recognized by PNA is predominantly present on glycans of HEK293T cells, especially on the termini of glycans that are amenable to lectin binding, compared to other saccharides.. …</p><p>page9</p><p>Our findings suggest that membrane glycoproteins nonspecifically inhibit viral infection, and we hypothesize that their inhibitory function is also nonspecific depending on the type of glycan. Our hypothesis is consistent with the observations in the TOS analysis. Although minor saccharide species in the system (such as GlcNAc and GalNAc recognized by DSA, WGA, or PNA) showed anticolocalization with infection, their scores were much lower than those of major saccharide species. This suggests that all major and minor saccharide species have an infection inhibitory effect, but cells enriched with minor type glycans are only partially present in the system, and the contribution of these cells to virus inhibition is also partial. It is also consistent with the observation that the amount of GalNAc recognized by PNA determines the virus infection inhibition in HEK 293T cells (Figure 1). Therefore, we believe that our assay using a single type of predominantly expressed lectin is still useful for estimating the total glycan content. Nevertheless, the virus infection rate may show a better correlation with a more accurately estimated total glycan in each cell. For example, the use of multiple lectins with appropriate calibration to integrate multiple signals to simultaneously detect a wider range of saccharide species would allow for more accurate estimation. It should be noted that the amount of bound lectin does not necessarily measure the overall glycan composition but likely reflects the sugar population at the free end of the glycan chain to which the lectin binds most.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors in several instances comment on the relevance and importance of the total glycan content. Nevertheless, these conclusions are often drawn when using only one glycan-binding lectin. In fact, the anti-correlation with viral infection is distinct for the various lectins (Fig 2D and Fig 2H). Would it make more sense to use a combination of lectins to get a full glycan spectrum?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the answer to Q4, we believe that we were able to detect the infection-suppressing effect of the total glycan amount by using the measurement value of the major component glycan as an approximation. However, as you pointed out, if we could accurately measure the minor glycan components and add up their values, we believe that we could measure the total glycan amount more accurately. In order to measure multiple glycans simultaneously and with high accuracy, some kind of biochemical calibration may be necessary to compare the measurements of lectin-glycan pairs with different binding constants. We believe that these are very useful techniques, and would like to consider them as a future challenge. The corrections listed in Q4 are shown below.</p><p>(Page 9)</p><p>Nevertheless, the virus infection rate may show a better correlation with a more accurately estimated total glycan in each cell.

Please provide the surface expression of the MUC1 so that the data can be compared to Fig 1F. Nevertheless, it is not clear why the authors used MUC expression as a parameter to assess virus binding. Alternatively, more conclusive data supporting the hypothesis would be the absence of a correlation between total glycan content and virus binding capacity.</p></disp-quote><p>The relationship between the expression level of MUC1 in each cell and the amount of virus binding is shown in Supplementary Figure 3A. There is no correlation between the two. In HEK293T cells, many glycans are modified with MUC1, so MUC1 was used as the indicator for analysis (Supplementary Figure 1C). As you pointed out, it is better to use the amount of glycan as an indicator, so we analyzed the relationship between the amount of bound virus and the amount of glycan on the surface on the Calu-3 monolayer (Supplementary Figure 2F, 2G, introduced in the answer to Specific (Q1)). In any case, no correlation was found between virus binding and surface glycans.

To clarify this connection, we further investigated the mechanism by which membrane glycoproteins inhibit viral infection.

We found that a large number of SARS-CoV2-PP can still bind to cells even when cells expressed sufficient amounts of the glycoprotein that could account for the majority of glycans within these cells and inhibit viral infection (Figure 3A). Similarly, on the two-dimensional culture surface of Calu-3 cells, no correlation was observed between the number of viruses bound and the total amount of glycans on the cell surface (Supplementary Figure 2F-G). These results indicate that glycoproteins do not inhibit virus binding to cells, but rather inhibit the steps required for subsequent virus internalization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) While the use of the Flory model could provide a simplification for a (disordered) flexible structure such as MUC1, where the number of amino acids equals N in the Flory model, this generalisation will not hold for all the proteins. Because folding will dramatically change the effective polypeptide chain-length and reduce available positioning of the amino acids, something the authors clearly measured (Fig 4G), this generalisation is not correct. In fact, the generalisation does not seem to be required because the authors provide an estimation for the effective Flory radius using their FRET approach</p></disp-quote><p>Current theories generalizing the Flory model to proteins are incomplete, and it is certainly not possible to accurately estimate the size of individual molecules undergoing different folding. However, we found such a generalized model to be useful in understanding the overall properties of membrane proteins. In our experiments, we were indeed able to obtain the R<sub>F</sub>s of some individual molecules by FRET measurements. However, this modeling made it possible to estimate the distribution range of the RFs, including for larger proteins that cannot be measured by FRET. For example, from our results, we can estimate that the upper limit of the RFs of the longest membrane proteins is about 10.5 nm, assuming that the proteins follow the Flory model in all respects except for the shortening of the effective length due to folding. These analyses are useful for physical modeling of nonspecific phenomena, as in our case.</p><p>In order to discuss the balance between such theoretical validity and the convenience of practical handling, we revise the manuscript as follows.</p><p>(page 13)</p><p>This shift in ν indicates that glycosylation increases the size of the protein at equilibrium, but the change in R<sub>F</sub> is slight, e.g., a 1.3-fold increase for one of the longest ectodomains with N = 4000 when these values of ν are applied. This calculation also gives a rough estimate of the upper limit of the R<sub>F</sub> of the extracellular domains of all membrane proteins in the human genome (approximately 10.5 nm). Physically, this change in ν by glycosylation may be caused by the increased intramolecular exclusion induced sterically between glycan chains. This estimated ν are much smaller than that of 0.6 for polymers in good solvents, possibly due to protein folding or anchoring effects on the membrane. In fact, the ν of an intrinsically disordered protein in solution has been reported to be close to 0.6 (Riback et al., 2019; Tesei et al., 2024). Overall, these analyses using the Flory model provide information on the size distribution of membrane proteins and the influence of glycans, although the model cannot predict the exact size of each protein due to its specific folding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MINOR COMMENTS/EDITS:</p><p>(1) In Figures 2A and 2C, as well as Supplemental Figure 2C, the fluorescent images indicate that GFP expression differs among the various groups. Ideally, these should be at the same GFP expression level, as the glycan and antibody staining occurred post-viral infection. For instance, ACE2 is a well-known positive control and should enhance SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, based on the findings presented in Supplemental Figure 2C, ACE2 appears to correlate with the lowest infection rate. The relationship between the infection rate and key glycoproteins needs clearer quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We measured the virus inhibition effect specific to each molecule using a cell line expressing low levels of viral receptors and glycoproteins (Fig. 1). On the other hand, the system in Fig. 2 contains diverse viral receptors and glycoproteins and has not been genetically manipulated. (We apologize that there was a typo in our description of experiment, which will be corrected, as shown below). The variation in infection rate between samples was caused by multiple factors but was not related to the molecule for which the correlation was measured. The receptor-based normalization used in the experiment in Fig. 1 cannot be applied in this system in Fig.2 due to the complexity of the gene expression profile. Therefore, instead of such parameter-based normalization, we applied Pearson correlation and TOS analysis. In the calculation of Pearson correlation, intensities are normalized. TOS analysis allows the analysis of colocalization between the groups with the highest fluorescence intensity. Therefore, in both cases of variation in overall infection rate and variation in the distribution of infected populations, samples with large variations can be reasonably compared by Pearson correlation and TOS analysis, respectively. We extend the discussion on statistics and revise the manuscript as follows.</p><p>(page 8-9)</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we infected a monolayer of epithelial cells endogenously expressing highly heterogeneous populations of glycoproteins with SARS-CoV-2-PP, and measured viral infection from cell to cell visually by microscope imaging. …</p><p>Pearson correlation is effective for comparing samples with varying scales of data because it normalizes the data values by the mean and variance. However, as observed in our experiments, this may not be the case when the distribution of data within a sample varies between samples. In addition, as has already been reported, the distribution of infected cells often deviates significantly from the normal distribution of data that is the premise of Pearson correlation (Russell et al., 2018) (Figure 2B). To further analyze data in such nonlinear situations, we applied the threshold overlap score (TOS) analysis (Figure 2G-H, Supplementary Figure 2E). This is one statistical method for analyzing nonlinear correlations, and is specialized for colocalization analysis in dual color images (Sheng et al., 2016). TOS analysis involves segmentation of the data based on signal intensity, as in other nonlinear statistics (Reshef et al., 2011). The computed TOS matrix indicates whether the number of objects classified in each region is higher or lower than expected for uniformly distributed data, which reflects co-localization or anti-localization in dual-color imaging data. For example, calculated TOS matrices show strong anti-localization for infection and glycosylation when both signals are high (Figure 2GH). This confirms that high infection is very unlikely to occur in cells that express high levels of glycans. The TOS analysis also yielded better anti-localization scores for some of the individual membrane proteins, especially those that are heterogeneously distributed across cells (Figure 2H). This suggests that TOS analysis can highlight the inhibitory function of molecules that are sparsely expressed among cells, reaffirming that high expression of a single type of glycoprotein can create an infection-protective surface in a single cell and that such infection inhibition is not protein-specific. In contrast, for more uniformly distributed proteins such as the viral receptor ACE2, TOS analysis and Pearson correlation showed similar trends, although the two are mathematically different (Figure 2D, 2H). Because glycoprotein expression levels and virus-derived GFP levels were treated symmetrically in these statistical calculations, the same logic can be applied when considering the heterogeneity of infection levels among cells. Therefore, it is expected that TOS analysis can reasonably compare samples with different virus infection level distributions by focusing on cells with high infection levels in all samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For clarity, the authors should consider separating introductory and interpretive remarks from the presentation of results.

The glycans modified by these proteins include both the N-type, which binds to asparagine, and the O-type, which binds to serine and threonine. Furthermore, there have been no reports of infection-suppressing effects according to the specific monosaccharide type in the glycan.

Then, by analyzing sample molecules selected from this list, it may be possible to infer the effect of the entire glycoprotein population on the steric inhibition of virus infection, despite the complexity and diversity of the Glycome (Dworkin et al., 2022; Huang et al., 2021; Moremen et al., 2012; Rademacher et al., 1988).

Meanwhile, by fluorimeter, fluorescence signals of these liposomes and known concentrations of recombinant mTagBFP2, AcGFP and TagRFP-657 proteins and SNAP-Surface 488 and Alexa 647 dyes (New England Biolabs) were measured in the same excitation and emission ranges as in flow cytometry assays (Supplementary Figure 1M). Ratios between the integral of fluorescent intensities in this range between two dyes of interest are used for converting the signals measured in flow cytometry. Additional information needed for calibration is the size difference between liposomes and cells. The average diameter of liposomes is measured to be 130 nm, and the diameter of HEK 293T cells is estimated to be 13 µm (Furlan et al., 2014; Kaizuka et al., 2021b; Ushiyama et al., 2015). From these data, the signal from cells acquired by flow cytometry can be calibrated to molecular surface density. For example, the Alexa 647 signal acquired by flow cytometry can be converted to the signal of the same concentration of DID dye using fluorometer data, but the density of the dye is unknown at this point. This converted DID signal can then be calibrated to the density on liposomes rather than cells using liposome flow cytometry data. Finally, adjusted for the size difference between liposomes and cells, the surface molecular density on cells is determined. By going through one cycle of these procedures, we could obtain calibration unit, such as 1 flow cytometry signal for a cell in the designated illumination and detection setting = 0.0272 mTagBFP2 µm<sup>-2</sup> on cell surface.</p><p>(Figure legend, Supporting Figure 1:)</p><p>… L.
