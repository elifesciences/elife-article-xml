cells must integrate physical and chemical signals and translate them into biological meaningful information through complex signaling pathways. By combining lipidomic and proteomic approaches with functional analysis, we have shown that ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1 (UBTD1) plays a crucial role in both the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) self-phosphorylation and its lysosomal degradation. On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of ceramides through N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the ubiquitination of Sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1/p62) by RNF26 and endolysosome positioning, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal. Moreover, we showed that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces cell proliferation emphasizing a hitherto unknown function of UBTD1 in EGFR-driven human cell proliferation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>UBTD1</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-15-IDEX-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clavel</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR18-CE14-0035-01-GILLERON</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gilleron</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004431</institution-id><institution>Fondation de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Torrino</surname><given-names>Stéphanie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE14-0025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bertero</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>UBTD1 coordinates EGFR signaling by modulating ceramides level through ASAH1 ubiquitination and EGFR degradation through SQSTM1/p62 ubiquitination, which together impact cell proliferation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All living organisms perceive variations in their environment and translate them into intracellular signals via signaling pathways. In multicellular organisms, disturbances in this signal transduction mechanism induce inappropriate cell behavior and are associated with a plethora of diseases including cancer.</p><p>Cellular signaling can be viewed as a finely tuned ‘space-time continuum’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Scott and Pawson, 2009</xref>). Receptors activated by their ligands at the plasma membrane are endocytosed, then moved along endocytic compartments to be routed to the lysosomes for final degradation or recycled back to the cell surface. Thus, the signal delivered to the cell is the sum of the signals emitted by the activated receptor at the plasma membrane and during its intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>). The responsiveness of these processes requires fast and accurate control in space and time, which is mainly ensured by post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins. Broadly, several aspects of cell signaling and receptor trafficking are regulated by proteolytic or non-proteolytic ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rape, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haglund and Dikic, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eden et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Protein ubiquitination is a PTM that results in the covalent attachment of one or more ubiquitin to lysine residues of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yau and Rape, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kerscher et al., 2006</xref>). Ubiquitin conjugation occurs in a sequential three-step enzymatic process involving E1 (ubiquitin activation), E2 (ubiquitin conjugation), and E3 (ubiquitin ligation). In this hierarchical framework, there are only two E1s, over 30 E2s and hundreds of E3s in human, illustrating the large spectrum of E2s that contrasts with the high specificity of E3s in the recognition of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schulman and Harper, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>). While the interaction of E3s with their substrates confers specificity to the system, E2s are more versatile and are commonly considered as ‘ubiquitin carriers’ with an auxiliary rather than control role. However, the modulation of the functionality of E2/E3 complexes by scaffold proteins has been poorly investigated and few proteins acting on these complexes have been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Good et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitin domain-containing protein 1 (UBTD1) is an evolutionarily-conserved protein which interacts, both in vitro and in vivo, with some E2 and E3 enzymes of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhler et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, we have shown that UBTD1 controls the degradation of the transcriptional regulator yes-associated protein (YAP) by modulating its ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrino et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, UBTD1 is a component of the ubiquitination complex that allows the E3 ligase beta-transducin repeats-containing proteins (β-TRCP) to interact with YAP. Coherent with this E2/E3 regulatory function, UBTD1 has been reported to stabilize p53 (tumor protein P53) through ubiquitination and further degradation of mouse double minute 2 (MDM2), the E3 enzyme that degrades p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, a decreased expression of UBTD1 is associated with increased cancer aggressiveness and decreased overall patient survival in colorectal, liver, prostate, and lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Based on these evidences, we have previously suggested that UBTD1 may be an E2/E3 scaffolding protein acting as a tumor suppressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrino et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To provide novel insights into UBTD1 functions, we here investigated the effect of its knockdown in a cell model by combining lipidomic, proteomic, and signaling screening. Through this integrated approach, we have uncovered an important role of UBTD1 in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) degradation and signaling. Indeed, we showed that UBTD1 participates in the processing of EGFR-positive vesicles and controls late endosome/lysosome positioning through p62/SQSTM1 (Sequestosome 1) ubiquitination by RNF26. UBTD1 also regulates the ubiquitination of lysosomal ceramidase N-Acylsphingosine Amidohydrolase 1 (ASAH1) and modifies membrane lipid composition to limit EGFR auto-phosphorylation. UBTD1 coordinates in time and space the EGFR signaling pathway to avoid persistent and inappropriate signaling leading to uncontrolled cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>UBTD1 depletion induces EGFR self-phosphorylation by modifying membrane lipid composition through ASAH1 ubiquitination</title><p>In mammals, UBTD1 is expressed in many organs and cell types, however its molecular function is still largely unknown, and its cellular role remains elusive. To provide insights into its cellular functions, we first performed a phospho-kinase array allowing us to observe that UBTD1 depletion increased (&gt;1.5 fold) phosphorylation of JNK1/2/3, GSK3 α/β (S9/21) and EGFR (Y1086) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). EGFR phosphorylation presented the highest difference compared to control cells (&gt;2 fold). Next, we confirmed by western-blot an increase in EGFR phosphorylation (Y1068 and Y1086) at steady state, and we also noticed an increase in the total amount of EGFR in UBTD1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Coherently with an increased EGFR signaling, UBTD1 depletion sharply increases cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These observations led us to repeat the same experiment under EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As compared to EGF-treated-control cells, UBTD1 depletion drastically increased (5 to 20-fold) the phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, β-catenin, GSK3 α/β, CREB, ERK 1/2, and EGFR. In UBTD1 depleted cells, the phosphorylation status of EGFR is the most dramatically changed (15-20-fold), suggesting a close link between UBTD1 and EGFR. We then carefully evaluated, at steady state, the activation of the signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham and Yarden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wells, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 2002</xref>). As expected, UBTD1 depletion increased STAT3 phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and STAT3 target gene expression: Bcl-2, HIF-2, and MMP-2,–9. Likewise, the phosphorylation of ERK (T202/Y204) and Akt (S473/T308) are increased in UBTD1-depleted cells. EGF promotes proliferation of control cells in a dose-dependent manner but does not further increase proliferation induced by UBTD1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), while the addition of Gefitinib, an EGFR inhibitor, totally abolishes the pro-proliferative effect of UBTD1 knockdown, indicating that this effect is EGFR-dependent but EGF-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These converging results indicate that UBTD1 depletion increases EGFR phosphorylation and amplifies signaling cascades downstream of EGFR leading to increased proliferation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling to induce cell proliferation.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) DU145 cells were transfected for 48 hr with the indicated siRNA (siCTRLpool or siUBTD1pool). (<bold>A, D, G</bold>) Heatmap of protein phosphorylation relative quantification from multiple signaling pathways in complete media (<bold>A</bold>), under EGF stimulation (<bold>D</bold>) at 50 ng/ml for 10 min or under serum-starved medium (<bold>G</bold>).

We performed a phospho-kinase array in serum free medium to determine whether some molecules present in the medium could be involved in EGFR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sigismund et al., 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, although no growth factors were present in the medium, the levels of EGFR phosphorylation and its downstream targets (Akt, ERK, CREB, STATs) were still higher in UBTD1-depleted cells than in control cells. Therefore, we then postulated that UBTD1-depleted cells could secrete factors that elicit EGFR phosphorylation. Besides EGF, several other ligands can bind to and activate EGFR, including TGF-α, heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB–EGF), amphiregulin, betacellulin, epigen, and epiregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grant et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, we tested whether the knockdown of UBTD1 increases the mRNA expression and/or the secretion of these EGFR ligands. In UBTD1-depleted cells, neither the expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I,K</xref>) nor the secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J,L</xref>) of the main EGFR ligands was increased. This data led us to consider that UBTD1 depletion induces ligand-independent EGFR phosphorylation.</p><p>Membrane lipid composition surrounding tyrosine kinase receptors can modulate their activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coskun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ferguson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meuillet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lambert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Todeschini et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we isolated cell membranes and performed a lipidomic analysis. UBTD1 depletion induces major changes in membrane lipid composition and, notably, altered the ceramide subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry, which detects the non-lipidic moieties and the identity of the ceramide-backboned lipids, we identified, in UBTD1-depleted cells, a drop in GM2 and GM3 d18:1/16:0 gangliosides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). The GM3 ganglioside inhibits spontaneous EGFR autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coskun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meuillet et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bremer et al., 1986</xref>). To test whether EGFR phosphorylation induced by UBTD1 depletion was caused by a decrease in GM3 content, we added GM3 to the culture medium. In UBTD1-depleted cells, addition of GM3 restores, in a dose-dependent manner, the level of EGFR phosphorylation observed in control cells and completely abolishes cell proliferation induced by UBTD1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>), suggesting that the increase in EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation was due to a drop in GM3. To gain insight on how UBTD1 may alter ganglioside level, we performed an immunoprecipitation experiment using endogenous UBTD1 as a bait. Next, by mass spectrometry we identify UBTD1 partners and associated proteins. Using a mild stringency buffer (NP40) to preserve weak protein interactions, we identified a set of 463 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) distributed in different cell compartments including plasma membrane, endolysosome, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then, we generated a UBTD1 interactome and performed an unsupervised cluster analysis to define 14 protein clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). By assigning to these clusters their top biological functions, we identify a functional sub-network composed of seven proteins and associated with the ceramide metabolic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Within this cluster, we found two proteins directly involved either in the synthesis (ceramide synthase 2, CerS2) or in the degradation (lysosomal ceramidase, ASAH1) of ceramides. Although the protein level of CerS2 was unaffected by UBTD1 invalidation, the level of ASAH1 protein was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). ASAH1 degradation was found to be controlled by the proteasome in a prostate cancer cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizutani et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether UBTD1 regulates the degradation of ASAH1, we blocked protein synthesis with cycloheximide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In the UBTD1-depleted cells, we observed a substantial increase in ASAH1 protein lifetime compared to control cells. Next, we performed a ubiquitination assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). UBTD1 knockdown drastically reduced ASAH1 ubiquitination, supporting that UBTD1 participates in ASAH1 degradation. Finally, to demonstrate that the increase of EGFR phosphorylation induced by UBTD1 depletion occurs through a defect of ASAH1 degradation, we knock down ASAH1 in UBTD1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The depletion of ASAH1 does not modify the phosphorylation of EGFR or its signaling as reflected by STAT3 phosphorylation. However, in UBTD1-depleted cells, the knockdown of ASAH1 severely decreases the phosphorylation of EGFR and STAT3 induced by UBTD1 depletion. Collectively, we here provided compelling evidence showing that UBTD1 depletion induces EGFR phosphorylation by decreasing GM3 level through impairment of ASAH1 ubiquitin-dependent degradation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>UBTD1 depletion induces EGFR self-phosphorylation by modifying membrane lipid composition.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) DU145 cells were transfected for 48 hr with the indicated siRNA (siCTRLpool or siUBTD1pool).

Interestingly, we identified an extensive protein cluster functionally related to vesicle mediated transport and endocytosis, which includes EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This data provides an important clue to understand how UBTD1 can affect EGFR turnover. Indeed, the internalization of EGFR relies on its ubiquitination and we previously demonstrated that UBTD1 interacts with E2/E3 of the UPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhler et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caldieri et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we next hypothesized that UBTD1 depletion may impair EGFR ubiquitination. To test this possibility, we monitored by proximity ligation assay (PLA) the interaction between ubiquitin and EGFR with or without EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, in control cells, EGF treatment increased EGFR ubiquitination estimated by protein proximity. In UBTD1 knockdown cells, the amount of ubiquitinated EGFR increased similarly to control cells, demonstrating that UBTD1 depletion does not severely impair EGFR ubiquitination. Since the ubiquitination of the EGFR was not modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>), we then hypothesized that the intracellular trafficking of EGFR may be impaired. We first determined the amount of EGFR at the cell surface. Using an EGF binding assay, we did not detect any difference between control and UBTD1-depleted cells treated or not with EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we performed a time-course of EGF/EGFR endocytosis up to their lysosomal degradation in a pulse-chase experiment using a fluorescent-labeled EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Cells were stimulated with a fluorescent-labeled EGF, and after washing to remove excess labeled EGF in the medium, the fluorescence detected in the cell corresponds to the EGF endocytosed through its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanafusa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Futter et al., 1996</xref>). The amount of internalized EGF remained constant during the first 30 min in both control and UBTD1 knockdown cells, suggesting that the internalization remains similar. In control cells, the amount of EGF started to decay at 120 min, whereas in UBTD1-depleted cells degradation was delayed by at least one hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To determine in which compartment the EGF/EGFR complex was delayed, we combined a pulse-chase of labeled EGF with immuno-localization of early endosomes (EEA1) or late endosome/lysosome (LAMP1) markers. The arrival and departure of EGF in EEA1-positive compartments was similar in UBTD1-depleted and control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), confirming that UBTD1 depletion does not alter endocytosis and the first steps of EGFR intracellular trafficking. However, the extent of co-localization between EGF and LAMP1 strongly increased from the 120 min time point in cells depleted for UBTD1 and remained significantly higher for the last two time-points compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). These results underlined that UBTD1 depletion delays the delivery of EGF/EGFR to the degradative lysosomal compartment or impairs the degradative functions of lysosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>UBTD1 depletion slows down EGFR degradation without affecting the overall endolysosomal kinetics</title><p>Endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes is controlled at multiple stages which makes it virtually impossible to check one by one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>). In our proteomic analysis, we identify many endocytosis-associated proteins as potential UBTD1 interactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Therefore, we further considered endocytosis as a global functional flux to evaluate the effect of UBTD1 depletion on its functioning. We first postulate that the delay in EGFR degradation we found in UBTD1-depleted cells can reflect a failure of the whole endolysosomal degradation route. To tackle this possibility, we analysed the impact of UBTD1 knockdown on the different endolysosomal compartment’s morphology. During the pulse-chase of EGF, the size and number of EEA1- and LAMP1-positive vesicles was unchanged between control and UBTD1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). Consistent with this, the number and morphology of the early endosomes, late endosomes, and lysosomes were similar at the ultrastructural level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). Although the endocytic compartments were present and morphologically normal, the flux of cargoes along these compartments could be altered. To test it, we loaded the cells with quantum dots coupled to BSA (DQ-BSA), a fluid phase cargo that fluoresces when reaching the lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marwaha and Sharma, 2017</xref>). Both the number of DQ-BSA positive vesicles and the total DQ-BSA intensity were unchanged between control and UBTD1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I–K</xref>). Because the lysosomes were accessible to internalized cargoes and were functional (DQ-BSA fluoresces when lysosomes are functional), it is thus likely that the defect in EGFR degradation observed in UBTD1-depleted cells is not due to a general disruption of the endolysosomal degradation pathway, but is rather restricted to a subset of proteins including EGFR. To test whether this effect can be extended to other tyrosine kinase receptors, we performed pulse-chase experiments with a fluorescent-labeled HGF to monitor the temporal kinetics of its degradation in the lysosome. As for the EGF, in UBTD1-depleted cells, we observe a delay in the extinction of the intracellular fluorescent-HGF signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Next, we tested the effect of UBTD1 knockdown on the ubiquitination of c-Met. As with EGFR, we found that UBTD1 depletion does not alter c-Met ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). Lastly, we wanted to know if, as for the EGFR, the depletion of UBTD1 affects the total amount of c-Met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Indeed, in UBTD1-depleted cells, we observe an increase in the level of c-Met and TGF-β R without any change in their mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, this mechanism seems to be restricted to tyrosine kinase receptors since we do not observe any change in the amount of IL2 or Transferrin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Collectively, this set of data shows that UBTD1 depletion alters degradation of some tyrosine kinase receptors including EGFR without interfering with the morphology or the functionality of the endolysosomal machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>UBTD1 controls p62/SQSTM1 ubiquitination and endolysosomal vesicle positioning</title><p>Because the defect in EGFR degradation observed in UBTD1-depleted cells is specific to EGFR rather than a general defect in endocytic trafficking, and because we identify EGFR as a potential UBTD1 partner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), we decided to focus on UBTD1 and EGFR common interactors. Thus, we re-examined our proteomic data, generated a new protein-protein network centered around EGFR, and applied cell compartment filters to refine the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Using this approach, we identified a minimal interaction network between EGFR and p62/SQSTM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Strikingly, p62/SQSTM1 was shown to be involved in the positioning of EGFR-positive endolysosome at the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>), which is critical for lysosomal function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pu et al., 2016</xref>). We first confirmed that p62/SQSTM1 co-immunoprecipitated with UBTD1, demonstrating that these two proteins interact or, at least, are in the same protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Because interactions between endolysosome and the ER rule the spatial positioning of the endolysosomal vesicles, we analysed the pattern distribution of the early endosome (EEA1) and the late endosome/lysosome (LAMP1) vesicles in control and UBTD1-depleted cells. UBTD1 depletion does not affect the distribution of EEA1-positive vesicles nor their co-localization with the ER marker calreticulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, UBTD1 depletion scatters LAMP1-positive vesicles and decreases the co-localization between LAMP1 and calreticulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with this, in cells stably overexpressing GFP-tagged UBTD1, the LAMP1-positive vesicles, but not the EEA1-positive vesicles, were more clustered in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). To validate this result further, we reproduced this experiment in a human epithelial cell line (RWPE1). Again, UBTD1 over-expression lead to a massive clustering of LAMP1-positive vesicles in the perinuclear region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Taken together, both over- and down-expression experiments support a role for UBTD1 in controlling the positioning of the late endolysosomal degradative compartment.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>UBTD1 interacts with p62/SQSTM1 and controls endolysosomal vesicle positioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UBTD1 protein interactome in DU145 cell line centered on EGFR (first neighbors). Node color scale (from blue to red) illustrates the degree (number of interactors).

(<bold>E</bold>) A proposed model for UBTD1 coordination of EGFR signaling and cell proliferation. EGF binding induces phosphorylation of EGFR and causes internalization of the EGF/EGFR complex. The complex is then transported by the endocytic system to be either recycled to the membrane or degraded by the lysosome. EGFR auto-phosphorylation is prevented by ganglioside 3 (GM3) (left). UBTD1 depletion decreases the ubiquitination of the ASAH1 leading to a decline of GM3. Decrease of GM3 induce EGFR self-phosphorylation and signaling. Depletion of UBTD1 also alters endolysosomal positioning and decreases p62/SQSTM1 ubiquitination leading to the inhibition of EGFR degradation. A decrease in EGFR degradation combined with an increase in auto-phosphorylation exacerbates EGFR signaling pathway and induces an EGFR-dependent cell proliferation (right).

Despite an increase in autophagy in the UBTD1-depleted cell, we found that the general autophagic flow is not blocked and the accumulation kinetics of LC3II and P62/SQSTM1 are similar to control cells, confirming that UBTD1 acts on P62/SQSTM1 ubiquitination specifically via RNF26.

On the one hand, by modulating the cellular level of GM3 through ASAH1 ubiquitination, UBTD1 controls the ligand-independent phosphorylation of EGFR. On the other hand, UBTD1, via the ubiquitination of SQSTM1/p62 by RNF26 and positioning of late endosome/lysosome, participates in the lysosomal degradation of EGFR. The coordination of these two ubiquitin-dependent processes contributes to the control of the duration of the EGFR signal and cell proliferation. In conclusion, we have highlighted a yet unsuspected role of UBTD1 on receptor signaling which could be of major importance in certain human pathologies. Moreover, our data lead us to propose that UBTD1 may represent a multistrata coordinator orchestrating EGFR signaling in space and time.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ubiquitination process works in a hierarchical framework with few E2 enzymes allowing the ubiquitination of many substrates by association with multiple E3 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ye and Rape, 2009</xref>). Previously, we found that UBTD1 interacts with a subset of E2s to form stable stoichiometric complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhler et al., 2014</xref>). Based on these biochemical results, it seems very likely that UBTD1, through its interaction with some E2s, can modify the ubiquitination of many proteins. Illustrating this assumption, we previously demonstrated that UBTD1 controls the ubiquitination of yes associated protein (YAP) and similar findings have been reported for MDM2 (mouse double minute two homolog) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Torrino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). However, these two specific examples presumably reflect only a small portion of the UBTD1 target proteins and, more importantly, of the cellular processes regulated by UBTD1. By using a holistic approach, we here provide evidence that UBTD1 coordinates the EGFR signaling pathway by controlling two distinct ubiquitin-mediated mechanisms. First, UBTD1 limits the self-phosphorylation of EGFR by modulating the ceramide (GM3) balance through the ubiquitin-dependent degradation of the acid ceramidase ASAH1. Additionally, UBTD1 controls the lysosomal degradation of EGFR by adjusting the spatial patterning of late endosome/lysosomes through RNF26-dependent ubiquitination of p62/SQSTM1. Together, the deregulation of these two molecular checkpoints causes EGFR self-phosphorylation and increases intracellular EGFR lifetime which leads to the persistence of its signaling and induces cell proliferation.</p><p>In UBTD1-depleted cells, the membrane lipid composition was altered by a decrease in ASAH1 ubiquitination. ASAH1 is synthesized in the ER as an inactive proenzyme and must be activated through autocleavage to become active in the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brannigan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gebai et al., 2018</xref>). This process is fundamental since ASAH1 is prominently involved in a genetic lysosomal storage disorder in human (Farber’s disease) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schuchman, 2016</xref>). However, the regulatory mechanism remains unclear. Interestingly, it has been reported that ASAH1 is regulated by the proteasome and that the deubiquitinase USP2 modulates protein half-life, clearly suggesting that, ASAH1 is controlled by a ubiquitination-mediated process before reaching the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mizutani et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings reinforce this proposal by showing that UBTD1 acts on the ubiquitination of ASAH1. Furthermore, ASAH1 has been described by others as potentially interacting with the E3 ligase HERC2, which we also identified in our proteomic screen as a putative UBTD1 partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galligan et al., 2015</xref>). These data lead us to speculate that the lysosomal content of ASAH1 could be regulated by a ubiquitination process mediated by UBTD1 and HERC2. This hypothesis, although interesting, is still speculative and needs to be further explored in the future. Interestingly, Simmons' group nicely demonstrated that the ceramide GM3 prevents EGFR self-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coskun et al., 2011</xref>). In accordance with this work, we observed that UBTD1 depletion, by decreasing cellular GM3 content, increases EGFR self-phosphorylation. In a broader view, we propose that UBTD1 regulates EGFR self-phosphorylation by controlling GM3 content through ASAH1 ubiquitination.</p><p>In a genome-wide screen analysis performed to identify endocytic trafficking master regulators, it has been reported that UBTD1 knockdown increases total EGF vesicle intensity, without major changes in vesicle number, elongation, area, or distance to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collinet et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this finding, we here demonstrate that UBTD1 depletion drastically increases intracellular fluorescent-labeled EGF lifetime without altering the morphology or the distribution of the early endocytic vesicles. To discriminate at which stage EGF trafficking is corrupted, we analysed EGF kinetics throughout its endolysosomal trafficking. These functional experiments clearly emphasize that UBTD1 depletion only affects the late endosome/lysosome step of EGF transport while totally preserving the upstream EGF flux. As elegantly demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>, SQSTM1/P62 is necessary to control EGFR-positive vesicle spatial positioning. Briefly, ubiquitinated p62/SQSTM1 captures specific endolysosomal vesicle adaptors to permit transient ER/endolysosomal contacts which are required for trafficking of some cargoes including EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>). This sophisticated process is orchestrated by the ubiquitination of p62/SQSTM1 by the ER-resident-E3 ligase, RNF26, and requires spatial and temporal coordination. Hence, we propose that UBTD1 impairs EGFR-positive vesicle positioning through a p62/SQSTM1-RNF26 mechanism close to the one described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>. Importantly, this process is presumably not restricted to EGFR since we observe, as anticipated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jongsma et al., 2016</xref>, similar effects of UBTD1 depletion on other signaling receptors that use the same intracellular routing as EGFR such as c-Met or TGF-β R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Park and Richardson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen, 2009</xref>). Although UBTD1 depletion affects p62/SQSTM1 ubiquitination by RNF26, it has a relatively minor impact on P62/SQSTM1-dependent autophagy demonstrating a high specificity toward some E3s rather than for the substrate in the ubiquitination process. We also noticed this E3-specificity of UBTD1 for the ubiquitination EGFR. Once the canonical clathrin-dependent EGFR endocytosis is saturated by an excess of EGF, EGFR is rapidly routed toward lysosomal degradation through clathrin-independent endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakker et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Todeschini et al., 2008</xref>). This critical switch is controlled by the ubiquitination of EGFR by the E3 ligase c-Cbl and the E2 enzyme UBE2D3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brannigan et al., 1995</xref>). The depletion of UBTD1 had no effect either on the ubiquitination of EGFR or, indeed, on overall EGFR internalization suggesting that UBTD1 is not mandatory for UBE2D3-c-Cbl-mediated EGFR ubiquitination. Although UBTD1 is a molecular partner of some E2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhler et al., 2014</xref>), it is likely that its function is specific to some E3s or context-dependent.</p><p>From the few works that have been published on UBTD1 and despite still incomplete knowledge about its cellular functions, it seems that a global picture is emerging. Although still largely speculative, we propose that UBTD1 is a rather stable partner of some E2s and its function could be to foster, in certain circumstances, the association between E2 and E3 within the ubiquitination complex. This scaffolding function, controlled by a still unknown mechanism, allows to finely control the ubiquitination of some substrates like P62/SQSTM1 or ASAH1.</p><p>EGFR plays a major role in cell proliferation and is frequently overexpressed or hyperactivated in many epithelial cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yarden and Pines, 2012</xref>). Considering the dual role of UBTD1 on EGFR autophosphorylation and lysosomal degradation, it is not surprising that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces an EGFR-dependent cellular proliferation. This last finding underlines the importance of UBTD1 in EGFR-driven cell proliferation and may be further investigated in an EGFR hyper-activated state such as cancer. Collectively, we here demonstrated that UBTD1 acts as a coordinator of EGFR signaling, illustrating that the regulation of E2/E3 enzymes of the ubiquitination system by scaffold proteins may represents a critical but still underestimated control layer for coordination of some signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>EGF (50 ng/ml, AF-100–15) or 10 ng/ml (cell proliferation assay) and HGF (40 ng/ml, 100–39H) were purchased from PeproTech.

In this study, the product search mode was used, and the identification was based on the accurate mass of precursor ions and the MS2 spectral pattern. Mass tolerance for precursors and fragments was set to 5 ppm and eight ppm respectively. The m-score threshold was selected at five and the ID quality filter was fixed at grades A, B, and C. [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, and [M + NH4]+ adducts were searched.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Mass spectrometric analysis for ganglioside</title><p>Ganglioside extraction was performed as described with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The aqueous upper layers from two extractions (with a mixture of water–methanol–chloroform, W:M:C = 2:2:1) were collected. Two volumes of water were added to precipitate polyglycoceramides. The dried pellet was resuspended with methanol/water (M:W = 1:1) and analysed in reflector-positive and -negative modes on MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer Ultraflex III (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) from 700 to 2500 Da. External calibration was performed by spotting peptide calibration standard II (BrukerDaltonics). Each sample was spotted in triplicate and mixed with DHB matrix on a steel target plate. All mass spectra were generated by summing 1000 laser shots for reflectron ion mode, and 1000 laser shots for the parent mass. Laser power was adjusted between 15% and 30% of its maximal intensity, using a 200 Hz smartbeam laser. MS spectra were acquired in the reflectron ion mode within a mass range from 500 to 2500 Da. Reflectron ion mode was chosen to obtain high detection sensitivity and resolution. FlexAnalysis version 3.0 and updated 3.4 provided by the manufacturer were applied for data processing. The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB 4.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hmdb.ca/">https://hmdb.ca/</ext-link>) was used for peak identifications. Heat map and differential intensity analysis with Limma were done using Phantasus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/phantasus/">https://artyomovlab.wustl.edu/phantasus/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All analyses were performed using Prism 6.0 software (GraphPad Inc). A two-tailed t-test was used if comparing only two conditions. For comparing more than two conditions, one-way ANOVA was used with: Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test or Dunnett’s multiple comparison test (if comparing all conditions to the control condition). Significance of mean comparison is marked on the graphs by asterisks. Error bars denote SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by INSERM, the Côte d’Azur University, and by grants from the French National Research Agency (ANR) through the Investments for the program UCA JEDI to SC (ANR-15-IDEX-01), the Young Investigator Program to JG (ANR18-CE14-0035-01-GILLERON) and the ITMO, Plan Cancer.

Two mechanisms mediate the effects of UBTD1: (a) control of endolysosomal positioning and consequently EGFR degradation; and (b) control of ganglioside-mediated inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. These findings advance our understanding of EGFR receptor function.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled ‘UBTD1 regulates ceramide balance and endolysosomal positioning to coordinate EGFR signaling’ for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. While the reviewers found your study of the role of UBTD1 in the regulation of EGFR trafficking and tyrosine phosphorylation to be interesting, several aspects of your study require clarification and new experimentation to fully establish the proposed conclusions. The required changes are quite extensive and will take some time to address. We are therefore returning the manuscript to you at this time. Nevertheless, we would welcome the submission of a new manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review. We note that the reviewers are convinced that UBTD1 plays an important role in EGFR biology, but feel that the data supporting the proposed mechanism need improvement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1. The analysis of UBTD1 and ASAH1 is largely based on the use of single SMARTPool siRNAs and Control siRNAs. It is important that key observations are replicated in studies using different siRNA (either a different SMARTPool or using more than one single siRNA).</p><p>2. The phosphorylation data presented in Figure 1 would be improved by the inclusion of additional immunoblot analysis of proteins related to EGF signaling—for example, AKT &amp; ERK. I do note that STAT3 phosphorylation is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B/C, but it is not stated which site is examined; moreover, the increased phosphorylation detected in the immunoblot appears not to have been detected in the dot blot (Figure 1A/D).</p><p>3. Figure 1B does show immunoblot of the EGFR and EGFR pY1068 (note the dot blot shows a different site, EGFR Y-1086). Both EGFR and pEGFR are increased. These data should be quantitated (as was done for STAT3 in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C).</p><p>4. The EGF dependence of the changes in EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. The conclusion presented is that it is EGF dependent. However, the dot blot (Figure 1 A) and the proliferation assay (Figure 1E) shows increases in the absence of EGF (therefore EGF-independent). In contrast to what is stated in the text of the manuscript, the EGFR inhibitor study (Figure 1G) provides no insight into the EGF-dependence of the observation.</p><p>5. The conclusion that UBTD1 regulates EGFR degradation is supported by the data presented. However, the mechanism is unclear. Data showing that SQSTM1/RNF26 and ubiquitination are altered by UBDT1, but is unclear whether this is mechanistically relevant to the observed changes in EGFR degradation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper by Torrino et al., describes the effects of UBTD1, which interacts with both E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases, on EGFR phosphorylation, expression and trafficking. Overall, the effects shown appear to be robust and convincing. There are potential concerns about interpretation of specific data, and a general concern of question if the effects observed here are truly specific to EGFR. Detailed comments follow below.</p><p>1. Given that UBTD1 interacts with both E2 and E3 enzymes, and given the role reported here of UBTD1 in regulating membrane lipid composition, it seems likely that UBTD1 could be more broadly affecting the regulation of other receptor tyrosine kinases. Yet, the R&amp;D phosphokinase array kit that was used by the investigators had a single receptor analyte within it. The authors should consider probing more broadly for effects on other receptors as such effects could also underlie differences in cellular proliferation rates such as those reported in Figure 1.</p><p>2. The PLA experiments shown in Figure 3B need appropriate controls, for example, with single antibodies.</p><p>3. The authors interpret their PLA results in Figure 3 as providing evidence of EGFR ubiquitination. PLA seems like an indirect way of showing that. Why have the authors not instead done an IP western blot, with pulldown for EGFR and blotting for ubiquitin?</p><p>4. In Figure 3D, the authors should show the baseline (t = 0 min) staining of the cells. It would be interesting to know, for example, if the elevated baseline phosphorylation is causing clustering and potential endocytosis even without EGF.</p><p>5. The authors refer to Figure 3D as showing evidence of internalization, but of course, on its own, clustering is not good evidence of endocytosis. The colocalization images shown in panels E and F are better for that purpose, and the authors should consider refining the text surround Figure 3D.</p><p>6. Given that the authors are looking in some cases at fairly long time points in their measurements, can they rule out other potential trafficking effects such as alterations in receptor recycling?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study provides evidence for a dual role of UBTD1 is regulating EGFR signalling, firstly in regulating autophosphorylation of the receptor via modulating ceramide levels and secondly via lysosomal degradation of the receptor.</p><p>UBTD1 is largely uncharacterised but has been postulated to scaffold ubiquitination complexes and have a tumour suppressor role. The current study supports this and identifies EGFR signalling as a novel target of UBTD1 complexes. Interestingly, it appears that distinct UBTD1 complexes act on different aspects of EGFR signalling. The role of UBTD1 in lysosome localisation is well characterised but the role in EGFR autophosphorylation less so.</p><p>1. UBTD1 knock-down does not increase cell proliferation in the presence of EGF (Figure 1E). However, EGFR (Tyr1086) phosphorylation is significantly increased after UBTD1 knock-down in the presence of EGF compared to cells treated with EGF and siRNA control (Figure 1D). Therefore, the increased phosphorylation of markers of EGFR activity as measured in the array in Figure 1D don't correlate with an increase in cell proliferation. Is there an explanation for this? It would maybe be clearer if immunoblots of EGFR, AKT, and STAT3 phosphorylation were included to support the array data (although STAT3 phospho-Tyr705 is not increased by EGF upon UBTD1 knock-down based on the array).</p><p>2. I don't follow the conclusion on pg5 based on Figure 1F that the pro-proliferative effect of UBTD1 knock-down is EGF-dependent. Gefitinib is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR so will inhibit its activity and downstream signalling irrespective of the mechanism by which EGFR is activated and whether this is EGF-dependent or EGF-independent. Also, the stated conclusion on pg14 is that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces EGF-dependent cellular proliferation. Based on Figure 1E shouldn't this be EGF-independent cellular proliferation?</p><p>3. A number of studies have shown that GM3 can suppress EGFR autophosphorylation and cell proliferation. From Figure 2E it seems that the addition of GM3 only supresses phospho-EGFR once UBTD1 is knocked-down (there seems to be a small increase in EGFR phosphorylation when GM3 is added to the siControl cells—why is this?).</p><p>(i) Does addition of GM3 suppress the increased proliferation induced by UBTD1 knock-down in the absence of EGF? As GM3 addition does not rescue EGFR protein levels, this might provide a guide to the relative importance of the two UBTD1 mechanisms in contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation.</p><p>(ii) There are also two Hsp90 immunoblots in this figure, one of which shows that Hsp90 levels decrease upon addition of GM3 after UBTD1 knock-down?</p><p>4. The authors propose that the decrease in GM3 levels upon UBTD1 knock-down is caused by an increase in the expression of the ceramidase ASAH1.</p><p>(i) It would be helpful to show that GM3 levels are increased upon siASAH1 in the DU145 cells.</p><p>(ii) It is unclear why p-EGFR levels increase upon knock-down of ASAH1 when UBTD1 is not knocked-down (Figure 2H). This could be explained by the siASAH1 also decreasing UBTD1 levels as indicated in the UBTD1 immunoblot, but it is unclear why ASAH1 knock-down will affect UBTD1 levels.</p><p>5. The evidence that UBTD1 knock-down increases p62 levels is weak. Supplementary Figure 4C suggests a slight increase but this is not really evident in Figure 4J or Supplementary Figure 4D. Do EGFR levels change upon RNF26 knock-down?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.68348.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

New figures 3B, 3D, 6B, 6C, 6D, 6F, and Figure supplement 1B, 1E, 3A show that ‘single siRNA’ displays the same effect than the ‘siRNA pool’ on UBTD1 depletion associated effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The conclusion that UBTD1 regulates EGFR degradation is supported by the data presented. However, the mechanism is unclear. Data showing that SQSTM1/RNF26 and ubiquitination are altered by UBDT1, but is unclear whether this is mechanistically relevant to the observed changes in EGFR degradation.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is particularly relevant and is an essential part of our study. Thus, to reinforce our previous data, we performed a new experiment. As shown in Figure 6A-D, UBTD1 depletion inhibits p62 degradation (C), decreases p62 ubiquitination (A), and decreases the interactions between p62/RNF26 (D). To show that this process is causally responsible for the increase of EGFR level, we have invalidated RNF26 by siRNA. As shown in Figure 6E, we observe that RNF26 depletion increases the amount of p62 and EGFR. Interestingly, in UBTD1-depleted cells, RNF26 depletion does not have an additive effect on EGFR and p62 level, suggesting that UBTD1 and RNF26 act on the same molecular mechanism. From this new data, we added an extra paragraph in the text (page 10).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper by Torrino et al., describes the effects of UBTD1, which interacts with both E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases, on EGFR phosphorylation, expression and trafficking.

To answer this legitimate question, we added a new supplemental figure (Figure supplement 4) and discussed the data in the text (page 9).</p><p>Briefly, we performed pulse-chase experiments with a fluorescently-labelled-HGF (ligand of c-Met receptor) to monitor the temporal kinetics of its degradation in the lysosome. As for the EGF, in UBTD1-depleted cells, we observe a delay in the extinction of the intracellular fluorescent-HGF signal (Figure supplement 4A). Next, we tested the effect of UBTD1 knock-down on the ubiquitination of c-Met. As with EGFR, we found that UBTD1 depletion does not alter c-Met ubiquitination (Figure supplement 4B-C). Lastly, we wanted to know if, as for the EGFR, the depletion of UBTD1 affects the total amount of c-Met (Figure supplement 4D). Indeed, in UBTD1-depleted cells, we observe an increase in the level of c-Met and TGF-β R without any change in their mRNA expression (Figure supplement 4E). Nevertheless, this mechanism seems to be restricted to tyrosine kinase receptors since we do not observe any change in the amount of IL2 or Transferrin receptors (Figure supplement 4D).</p><p>We also modified the discussion accordingly: ‘Importantly, this process is presumably not restricted to EGFR since we observe, as anticipated by Jongsma et al. [33], similar effects of UBTD1 depletion on other signaling receptors that use the same intracellular routing as EGFR such as c-Met or TGF-β R [40, 41]’ (page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should consider probing more broadly for effects on other receptors as such effects could also underlie differences in cellular proliferation rates such as those reported in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Although, as proposed by the reviewer, it is clear that UBTD1 depletion does not only affect EGFR degradation but also others tyrosine kinase receptors, the effect of UBTD1 depletion on cell proliferation is strictly related to EGFR. Indeed, the use of Gefinitib totally abrogates the proproliferative effects induced by UBTD1 depletion (Figure 1F). Moreover, as we have shown previously (Torrino S. et al., 2019)<sup>2</sup> and described earlier by others (Miura H. et al., 2001)<sup>3</sup>, cMet/HGF does not affect proliferation in DU145 cells (prostate cancer cell line) and TGFβ-R is known to inhibit proliferation (Wilding G. et al., 1989)<sup>4</sup>.</p><p><sup>2</sup>Torrino S, Roustan FR, Kaminski L, Bertero T, Pisano S, Ambrosetti D, Dufies M, Uhler JP, Lemichez E, Mettouchi A, Gesson M, Laurent K, Gaggioli C, Michiels JF, Lamaze C, Bost F, Clavel S.

Therefore contribution of newly internalised EGFR/ ‘unlabelled EGF’ after the time=0 due to a potential change in EGFR recycling may be excluded. Moreover, a dramatic change in EGFR recycling will undoubtly change the quantity of EGF receptor at the cell surface, which we did not observe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) confirming pulse-chase (Figure 4D) and Flow-cytometry experiments (Figure 4C).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Staining of surface EGFR using an antibody against the extracellular region of EGFR bound at 4°C in unpermeabilised.</title><p>Control and UBTD1-depleted cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-68348-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>However, the reviewer is correct that a change in recycling of EGFR bound to its ligand back to the plasma membrane may also change the load of EGF-alexa647, similarly to what is well known and often tested for the transferrin receptor.

The effect of UBTD1 depletion on cell proliferation is strictly related to EGFR since the use of Gefinitib totally abrogates this effect (Figure 1F).</p><p>The two experiments to which the reviewer refers are hardly comparable (Figures 1E and 1D). Indeed, in the ‘proliferation experiment’ (Figure 1E), the cells were cultivated with EGF for 48h to ‘see the effect’ of EGF on cell proliferation. On the contrary, in the ‘signaling experiment’ (Figure 1D), the cells were acutely treated with EGF (10 min, 50 ng/ml), to get a maximal signal response and to avoid inhibitory feedback and receptor degradation that take place over time (h).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would maybe be clearer if immunoblots of EGFR, AKT and STAT3 phosphorylation were included to support the array data (although STAT3 phospho-Tyr705 is not increased by EGF upon UBTD1 knock-down based on the array).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer 1 (question 2) and 3 and provided additional immunoblot analysis as recommended. Please refer to response elements in the reply to reviewer 1 (question 2) for a complete list of modified figures.</p><p>– Following the suggestion of the reviewer, we added, in complement to Figure 1 (Figure supplement 1D-E), western-blots that allow the reader to estimate the activation of the main signaling pathways downstream of the EGFR (Akt and ERK).

Indeed, we observed a slight increase in STAT3 phosphorylation in the dot blot/Heatmap (&lt; 1fold increase relative to the control) (Figure 1A). ‘Light blue’ (color code indicated on the scalebar) for p-STAT3 indicates an increase below 1-fold relative to the control. consistent with this observation, there is an increase in p-STAT3 close to 50% (0.5-fold increase relative to the control) in the western blot (Figure supplement 1D) which we confirmed using single SiRNAs against UBTD1 (Figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I don't follow the conclusion on pg5 based on Figure 1F that the pro-proliferative effect of UBTD1 knock-down is EGF-dependent. Gefitinib is an ATP-competitive inhibitor of EGFR so will inhibit its activity and downstream signalling irrespective of the mechanism by which EGFR is activated and whether this is EGF-dependent or EGF-independent. Also, the stated conclusion on pg14 is that UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces EGF-dependent cellular proliferation. Based on Figure 1E shouldn't this be EGF-independent cellular proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>We definitely agree with the reviewer's comment and apologise for the mistake. In the revised manuscript we have modified the text accordingly: ‘indicating that this effect is EGFR-dependent but EGF-independent’ (page 5) and ‘UBTD1 depletion exacerbates EGFR signaling and induces an EGFR-dependent cellular proliferation’ (page 15).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A number of studies have shown that GM3 can suppress EGFR autophosphorylation and cell proliferation. From Figure 2E it seems that the addition of GM3 only supresses phospho-EGFR once UBTD1 is knocked-down (there seems to be a small increase in EGFR phosphorylation when GM3 is added to the siControl cells—why is this?).</p></disp-quote><p>To verify our previous result, we performed western-blot and quantification for both Y1068 and Y1086 phosphorylation sites of EGFR. As depicted and quantified in the new Figure 2E, GM3 does not increase EGFR phosphorylation (siControl) while GM3 treatment decrease EGFR phosphorylation (Y1068/Y1086) in UBTD1-depleted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(i) Does addition of GM3 suppress the increased proliferation induced by UBTD1 knock-down in the absence of EGF? As GM3 addition does not rescue EGFR protein levels, this might provide a guide to the relative importance of the two UBTD1 mechanisms in contributing to the regulation of cell proliferation.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we carried out a new proliferation experiment in the presence of GM3 (Figure 2F). As anticipated by the reviewer, the experiment gives a particularly clear result. Indeed, GM3 treatment inhibits the increased proliferation induced by UBTD1 knock-down. As mentioned by the reviewer, it is an important clue to explain the mechanism by which UBTD1 controls proliferation. We modify the text accordingly: ‘In UBTD1-depleted cells, addition of GM3 restores, in a dose dependent manner, the level of EGFR phosphorylation observed in control cells and completely abolishes cell proliferation induced by UBTD1 knock-down (Figure 2E, F), suggesting that the increase in EGFR phosphorylation and cell proliferation was due to a drop in GM3’ (page 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) There are also two Hsp90 immunoblots in this figure, one of which shows that Hsp90 levels decrease upon addition of GM3 after UBTD1 knock-down?</p></disp-quote><p>We re-performed the western-blot and quantified it in the new Figure 2E, Hsp90 levels did not decrease upon addition of GM3 after UBTD1 knock-down</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In addition, we performed a new set of experiment with siRNA against UBTD1 (siRNA single1, siRNA single2), control (siRNA single1), ASAH1 (siRNA single1, siRNA single2) (Figure 3D). As shown in Figure 3D and Figure supplement 2E, ASAH1 knock-down (siRNA pool or singles) does not modify neither EGFR phosphorylation (Y1068/Y1086) nor UBTD1 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The evidence that UBTD1 knock-down increases p62 levels is weak.

As clearly shown in Figure 6E, the answer is ‘yes’. We observe that RNF26 depletion increases the amount of p62 and EGFR. Interestingly, in UBTD1-depleted cells, RNF26 depletion does not have an additive effect on EGFR and p62 level, suggesting that UBTD1 and RNF26 act on the same molecular mechanism. From this new data, we added an extra paragraph in the text (page 10).</p></body></sub-article></article>
