To begin to reconcile these perspectives, we studied how the evolutionary conservation of genes associated with social behavior depends on regulatory context, and whether genes associated with social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts. We identified modules of co-expressed genes associated with age-based division of labor between nurses and foragers in the ant <italic>Monomorium pharaonis</italic>, and we studied the relationship between molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression. Highly connected and expressed genes were more evolutionarily conserved, as expected. However, compared to the rest of the genome, forager-upregulated genes were much more highly connected and conserved, while nurse-upregulated genes were less connected and more evolutionarily labile. Our results indicate that the genetic architecture of social behavior includes both highly connected and conserved components as well as loosely connected and evolutionarily labile components.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04775.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04775.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04775.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Animal species vary widely in their degree of social behavior. Some species live solitarily, and others, such as ants and humans, form large societies. Many researchers have tried to understand the genetic changes underlying the evolution of social behavior. Some researchers suggest that it involves recycling existing genes that also have other conserved functions. Others propose that the evolution of social behavior involves completely new genes that are not found in related but solitary species.</p><p>Ants are one of the best-studied social animals. An established colony can contain many 1000s of individuals that live and work together and perform different roles. The queen's job is to lay eggs, while the worker ants do everything else, including collecting food, caring for the young, and protecting the colony. In some species of ant—including the pharaoh ant—a worker's role changes as it ages. Younger workers tend to stay in the nest and nurse the brood, while older workers tend to leave the nest and forage for food.</p><p>Mikheyev and Linksvayer asked: which genes are responsible for this age-based division of labor? And how did this aspect of social behavior evolve? First, after observing pharaoh ants from two colonies set up in the laboratory, they confirmed that workers nursing the brood were on average almost a week younger than those seen collecting food. Next Mikheyev and Linksvayer identified which genes were expressed in ants of different ages, or ants engaged in different tasks. Specific sets of genes were expressed more (or ‘up-regulated’) in nurse workers, while others were up-regulated in foraging workers.</p><p>Mikheyev and Linksvayer then investigated how rapidly these genes had evolved by comparing them to related genes found in other social insects (fire ants and honey bees). They also determined the ‘connectivity’ of these genes by asking how many other genes showed similar expression patterns. In many organisms, how rapidly a gene evolves depends on how tightly connected its expression is to the expression of other genes; highly connected genes evolve more slowly.</p><p>The genes that were expressed more in the older foraging workers were both more highly connected and more evolutionarily conserved in the other social insects. Genes that were up-regulated in the younger nurse workers were more loosely connected and rapidly evolving.</p><p>Mikheyev and Linksvayer's findings show that the evolution of social behavior in animals involves both new genes, which tend to be loosely connected, and conserved genes, which tend to be more highly connected.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04775.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04775.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>social evolution</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>age polyethism</kwd><kwd>eusociality</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006920</institution-id><institution>University of Pennsylvania</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>University Research Foundation grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Linksvayer</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genes associated with age-based division of labor in ants exist in distinct regulatory and evolutionary contexts; genes up-regulated in young nurses are loosely connected and rapidly evolving while genes up-regulated in old foragers are highly connected and conserved.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The main conclusion of a decade of sociogenomic research with a range of solitary and social animal species is that highly conserved genes underpinning core physiological processes can also influence behavioral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amdam et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth and Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toth et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodard et al., 2014</xref>). For example, the insulin signaling pathway, which mediates an organism's response to its internal nutritional state, also influences its behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ament et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>genetic toolkit hypothesis</italic> and related hypotheses propose that a conserved set of genes and gene pathways involved in core physiological processes such as metabolism and reproduction has been repeatedly used in the evolution of complex social behavior in diverse lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">West-Eberhard, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amdam et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth and Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Toth et al., 2007</xref>). This hypothesis stems from findings in Evolutionary Developmental Biology that morphological innovation in disparate lineages often involves the convergent use of a conserved set of genes (e.g., Hox genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Toth and Robinson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkins, 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, social behavior and other social traits are commonly viewed as having unique genetic features and evolutionary dynamics, including especially rapid evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nonacs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey and Moore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van Dyken and Wade, 2012</xref>). Could the molecular mechanisms underlying social interactions (e.g., social signal production and response) and social behavior, together with the process of social evolution result in distinct genetic architectures for social traits compared with other traits? Recent comparative transcriptomic and genomic studies find low overlap in genes associated with social behavior in different highly social animals and instead highlight the importance of novel genes and rapid evolution of social traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Tsutsui, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wissler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sumner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jasper et al., 2015</xref>), in accordance with recent studies emphasizing the ubiquity of taxonomically restricted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khalturin et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tautz and Domazet-Loso, 2011</xref>). Perhaps social evolution does not consistently use sets of highly conserved genes to the same degree as morphological evolution? The <italic>novel social genes hypothesis</italic> proposes that genes underlying social behavior are often novel socially acting genes or are genes with novel social functions not present in solitary ancestors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Tsutsui, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sumner, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Research supporting the genetic toolkit hypothesis has stressed the significant signal of highly conserved genes affecting core physiological processes in transcriptomic data sets for social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toth et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodard et al., 2011</xref>, 2014; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toth et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, research supporting the novel social genes hypothesis has stressed the overall low proportional overlap of genes underlying social behavior in divergent lineages as well as the apparently general low degree of transcriptomic and genomic conservation in divergent lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson and Tsutsui, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simola et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wissler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jasper et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sumner, 2014</xref>).</p><p>We sought to build on these previous results by examining how transcriptional regulatory context influences evolutionary conservation for genes associated with ant social behavior, and further whether genes associated with ant social behavior exist in distinct regulatory and selective contexts compared to the rest of the genome. Research in a range of model organisms demonstrates that the degree of a gene's connectivity to the rest of the regulatory network and its level of expression is often negatively correlated with its rate of molecular evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krylov et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hahn and Kern, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jovelin and Phillips, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ramsay et al., 2009</xref>). For example, highly connected ‘hub’ genes are often highly expressed and evolutionarily conserved. Previous research has compared rates of molecular evolution for genes associated with reproductive division of labor in social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunt et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpur et al., 2014</xref>), as well as other conditionally expressed phenotypes in other organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brisson and Nuzhdin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leichty et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Purandare et al., 2014</xref>), indicating that genes associated with the expression of worker traits experience elevated rates of molecular evolution. However, the relationships among molecular evolution, connectivity, and expression have been little explored in social insects and are generally little understood for genes associated with social behavior. As a result, it is unclear if observed differences in rates of molecular evolution are caused by differences in regulatory architecture, expression, or perhaps result from distinct evolutionary mechanisms such as kin selection, which may operate differentially on genes associated with social behavior relative to the rest of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linksvayer and Wade, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall and Goodisman, 2012</xref>). We further sought to identify modules of co-expressed genes that may be composed of both conserved and novel genes and may contribute to the expression and evolution of social complexity.</p><p>We studied the genetic basis and evolution of a fundamental aspect of social insect behavior, age-based division of labor (age polyethism). Age polyethism involves the progression of workers from in-nest tasks such as nursing to outside-nest tasks such as foraging. Because age polyethism is a trait expressed by the functionally sterile worker caste, it is expected to be shaped primarily through kin selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton, 1964</xref>). While age polyethism plays a central role in the functioning of many eusocial systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölldobler and Wilson, 2009</xref>), the molecular underpinnings have only been well studied in the honey bee <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Whitfield et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ament et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chandrasekaran et al., 2011</xref>), so that the genetic and evolutionary basis of age polyethism is not generally understood outside of honey bees. We identified transcriptional modules of co-regulated genes associated with worker age polyethism in the pharaoh ant <italic>Monomorium pharaonis</italic>; we identified the degree that these genes overlap with genes involved in age polyethism in two other social insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alaux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manfredini et al., 2014</xref>); and we studied the relationship between expression level, connectivity and rates of molecular evolution at these genes compared to the rest of the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>We tracked cohorts of age-marked workers and recorded their behavior and location inside and outside the nest.

In concordance with the expected pattern of age polyethism, the average age of workers observed in the different locations increased as distance from the brood area increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of the 15 behaviors observed more than 15 total times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the likelihood of observing workers performing the behaviors ‘nurse’, ‘groom’, ‘rest’, ‘trophallaxis’, ‘walk’, and ‘forage’ depended on worker age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; glm with binomial errors and logit link, all nominal p &lt; 0.0002, α = 0.003, controlling for multiple testing).

We found significant but seemingly low (&lt;4%) overlap in lists of differentially expressed genes and the correlation in genome-wide expression profiles (r = 0.14) when comparing gene expression in nurse and forager samples between the pharaoh ant and fire ant, <italic>S. invicta</italic>. Such low overlap seems surprising, given that these two ants are in closely related ant genera, having diverged on the order of 50 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ward et al., 2014</xref>). However, the comparison is not perfect, given substantial differences between the two studies in methodology used to characterize the behaviors, and in the technology used to measure gene expression (i.e., microarray vs RNA sequencing) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manfredini et al., 2014</xref>). We did not find significant overlap between lists of honey bee and pharaoh ant genes associated with age polyethism, consistent with results reported by the earlier fire ant study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Manfredini et al., 2014</xref>). While we expected decreased overlap given that honey bees and ants diverged longer ago, ∼170 Mya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ronquist et al., 2012</xref>), and represent independent origins of eusociality, the ant-honey bee comparison is also more problematic because the honey bee data are based on brain gene expression profiles whereas the fire ant and pharaoh ant data are based on whole body gene expression profiles.</p><p>Past studies have often interpreted significant but similarly low overlap in lists of genes associated with social behavior from different lineages as supporting the genetic toolkit hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toth et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodard et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, other authors have recently interpreted low overlap as being consistent with the novel social genes hypothesis, which emphasizes the importance of taxonomically restricted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sumner, 2014</xref>). The contrasting emphasis of authors on either conserved or novel genes begs the question: what degree of conservation in gene lists is necessary for confirmation or rejection of these two hypotheses? For example, the fact that nurse-upregulated genes in <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> are more rapidly evolving than the rest of the genome and that 50% of nurse-upregulated genes do not have identifiable fire ant or honey bee orthologs suggests that novel genes may have important nurse-specific functions. At the same time, the significant overlap of fire ant and pharaoh ant gene lists and the strong enrichment of nurse-upregulated genes for gene ontology terms associated with metabolism and development suggests that conserved genes involved in core physiological processes also play important roles in nurse function and the evolution of division of labor. Thus, our results are generally consistent with both hypotheses. We suggest that neither of these two hypotheses has yet been formulated in a way that is readily tested, in part because it is unclear what precise genes are expected to be included or excluded from a genetic toolkit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkins, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, these hypotheses are not mutually exclusive, since both conserved and novel genes likely play roles in the evolution of all new traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson and Linksvayer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Woodard et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that shifting the focus, from lists of genes to modules of co-expressed genes in the context of genome-wide transcriptional and evolutionary patterns, can help to elucidate how social evolution has produced social complexity. In this way, one question we can ask is whether we see any simple molecular signature of social evolution, for example due to kin selection? As <italic>Monomorium</italic> ant workers are obligately sterile, all worker traits are expected to be shaped exclusively by indirect selection (i.e., kin selection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton, 1964</xref>). All-else-equal, such indirect selection is weaker than direct selection, proportional to relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hamilton, 1964</xref>), and a priori is expected to produce relaxed selective constraint and elevated rates of molecular evolution for all genes associated with worker traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Linksvayer and Wade, 2009</xref>). Past studies have found different rates of molecular evolution for worker-biased and queen-biased genes, with most studies finding that worker-biased genes are more rapidly evolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpur et al., 2014</xref>; but see; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunt et al., 2010</xref>). Some researchers have interpreted different patterns between lineages as being consistent with simple kin selection predictions based on differences in within-colony relatedness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hall and Goodisman, 2012</xref>), but most studies have emphasized the association between conditional expression and relaxed selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hunt et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">2013</xref>), as well as genes associated with worker traits simply experiencing stronger positive selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hunt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ferreira et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmeyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpur et al., 2014</xref>). We observed weakly elevated rates of molecular evolution at nurse-upregulated genes compared to the rest of the genome, but much more notable was the distinct connectivity and corresponding differences in gene conservation for forager-upregulated genes relative to nurse-upregulated and non-differentially expressed genes. These results suggest that social evolution does not just have simple genome-wide effects such as relaxed effective selection associated with kin selection, but instead shapes complex social traits while acting within general systems-level constraints imposed by regulatory architecture.</p><p>The common perception that social evolution often involves rapid evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">West-Eberhard, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tanaka, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moore et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolf et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nonacs, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey and Moore, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Van Dyken and Wade, 2012</xref>) may result from the fact that genes influencing many key social traits are not only conditionally expressed, but are also located peripherally within regulatory networks, and so are relatively unconstrained. For example, we expect that traits associated with social signal production (e.g., pheromone and glandular secretions) are often located peripherally within regulatory networks and as a result may be evolutionarily labile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jasper et al., 2015</xref>), as is the case more generally with secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Julenius and Pedersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nogueira et al., 2012</xref>). More core and conserved components are also certain to be important to the expression of these traits, but their contribution to trait evolution may be minimized by virtue of the fact that they are highly connected. These arguments suggest how both conserved, toolkit genes, as well as rapidly evolving and taxonomically restricted novel genes, likely play important roles in the evolution of social novelty, with novel genes being added peripherally to regulatory networks. Our results are consistent with this interpretation, because <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> age-based division of labor seems to have a complex genetic basis with some components that are highly connected and conserved, and other components that are more loosely connected and evolutionarily labile.</p><p>Our findings that nurse-upregulated genes are more rapidly evolving and less conserved among social insect lineages relative to forager-upregulated genes suggest that nurse traits have been a major focus of evolutionary innovation between social insect lineages. This result seems surprising given that foragers of different lineages experience diverse environments outside the nest compared to the relatively constant within-nest environment experienced by nurses and could be expected to experience more diverse selective pressures. One explanation is that the physiological mechanisms associated with metabolically costly foraging activities and older adult life (<italic>M. pharaonis</italic> workers usually only live several weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peacock and Baxter, 1950</xref>], so that foragers which start right before their second week of age may already be senescing) may be relatively conserved and simple. Nursing behavior, occurring during very early adult life, may involve more diverse physiological and developmental processes, and nursing itself may also involve more diverse behaviors and physiological processes, such as food processing and the synthesis of glandular secretions that are fed to larvae. Perhaps the relatively more complex genetic architecture (less tightly connected, involving more modules, and diverse processes) has served as less of a constraint and facilitated more evolutionary change for nurse-related genes. If so, we predict that nurse-specific functions and functions for early adult life may be generally more evolutionarily labile as well as more physiologically and behaviorally labile within and across lineages than forager-specific functions. Note that this prediction is opposite the typical expectation that genes acting early in development have more pleiotropic effects and are thus especially constrained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Roux and Robinson-Rechavi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Piasecka et al., 2013</xref>), but obligate sterility may, in part, release workers from these constraints on the evolution of genes acting early in worker development.</p><p>We identified two discrete sets of genes with distinct genetic architecture associated with age-based division of labor. The majority of forager-upregulated genes were contained within a single gene module (module 14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) that was significantly positively associated with age. Another module with expression negatively associated with age contained the largest number of nurse genes, but nurse genes were also broadly spread out across a number of other modules with complex expression patterns across age and behavioral groups. Interestingly, the modules differed in the proportion of constituent genes which had identifiable <italic>S. invicta</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic> orthologs, indicating that modules vary in the degree to which they are composed of conserved genes and gene networks vs rapidly evolving genes with unknown function. That said, the modules were enriched for various gene ontology terms, providing some insight into their putative functional importance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>By explicitly studying regulatory architecture and inferring modules of tightly connected genes in other species as well as <italic>M. pharaonis</italic>, it will be possible to further identify what network components contribute to the expression of social traits, how rapidly these components are evolving within populations, and how they have contributed to phenotypic differences between divergent lineages. Building on the genetic toolkit conceptual framework, it will be possible to ask to what degree diverse lineages repeatedly use the same modules, and importantly approaches already exist for quantifying module overlap in the absence of functional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oldham et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Langfelder et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, after finding non-significant overlap in lists of genes associated with queen- and worker-caste development in paper wasps and honey bees, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berens et al. (2014)</xref> recently invoked a ‘looser’ version of the genetic toolkit hypothesis by examining the overlap of inferred functional enrichment of gene lists (i.e., via gene ontology analysis). Focus on co-expressed modules may actually improve the feasibility of inferring the function of co-expressed genes based on observed expression patterns together with standard functional information inferred from the subset of conserved annotated genes with identifiable orthologs from model systems. It will also be possible to determine the relative contribution of conserved vs taxonomically restricted genes to co-expression modules.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Colony setup</title><p>Two replicate <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> observation colonies were established, each with 10 queens, approximately 4000 workers, and 1000 brood, representing a random subsample of a larger source colony. Each colony was established from a separate source colony, which came from a stock of approximately 40 colonies that have been repeatedly mixed across generations so that they are genetically similar. Observation nests were constructed of two pieces of 5 × 15 cm glass separated by 1.5 mm thick plastic sheeting. Colonies were given water in cotton-plugged test tubes, 50% honey solution, beef liver, egg yolk, and mealworms <italic>ad libitum</italic>, replaced twice a week. Colonies were maintained at 27 C and 65% relative humidity in climate controlled rooms at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><p>Every 3 days, 600 newly eclosed callow workers, which were inferred to be approximately 0–1 days old, were collected from 8–10 stock colonies. These callow workers were briefly anesthetized with CO<sub>2</sub> and individually paint marked on the gaster with a unique age cohort color dot using a Sharpie extra fine oil based paint pen, and then 300 were added to each of the observation colonies. Five uniquely marked age cohorts were thus added to the colonies on days 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 of the study. Nestmate recognition is at most weak and transient in <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>), and callows in particular are readily accepted. We also set up a camera to automatically take images of the nest areas of each colony once every 20 min for the entire period of the study, although we do not further discuss these images.</p><p>Previous literature indicates that <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> workers are expected to live 9–10 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peacock and Baxter, 1950</xref>), but our preliminary trials with our setup indicated that workers tend to die or lose their paint marks after several weeks. We ran the study for 1 month, expecting to capture the major age-based transitions in worker behavior (e.g., the nursing to foraging transition observed in other species), but it is possible that we missed late behavioral transitions that occurred towards the end of workers' lives. In practice, such late transitions are difficult to detect as sample size necessarily declines as increasing numbers of workers die.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral analyses</title><p>A behavioral scan of each colony was completed once each day for the duration of the month-long study by recording the instantaneous behavior and location observed for every visible paint-marked worker. Each behavioral scan was performed at 20× magnification with a Nikon SMZ800 stereomicroscope. We recorded 30 distinct behaviors, but only 15 were observed more than 15 total times during the study period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We defined an individual as foraging if it was observed on a food or water source or actually carrying food (i.e., foraging included the behaviors ‘on honey’, ‘on liver’, ‘on water’, or ‘carrying food’; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Each experimental colony contained four identifiable locations that were redefined prior to each behavioral scan: brood area, brood periphery, remaining nest area, and foraging area. The brood area was defined as the central area within the nest containing all brood and queens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards, 1991</xref>). The nest periphery was defined as the region directly adjacent to the brood area, where workers were dense in aggregation but not in contact with any of the brood. The nest area was defined as the sparsely occupied remainder of the space within the nest, not including the brood area and nest periphery. The foraging area included all areas outside of the nest. Analyses of behavioral data were conducted in R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/">www.r-project.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Worker sampling, genomic DNA sequencing, mRNA amplification, and RNA library preparation</title><p>Every 3 days, whole bodies of five individuals from each available uniquely paint marked age cohort were collected, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C. This sampling scheme resulted in seven groups of individuals of known age (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18+ days old). 20 individuals of each of these age category were pooled for whole body RNA extraction for each of the two replicate observation colonies. In addition, for each of the two replicate observation colonies, we collected and pooled 20 non-paint marked workers in the act of the following five behaviors: nursing larvae, grooming larvae, engaged in trophallaxis with other workers, foraging for protein (collecting egg, mealworm, or liver), and foraging for carbohydrates (collecting honey solution). RNA was extracted from pools of worker samples of known age or observed behavior using Qiagen RNeasy kits with standard protocols. RNA sequencing libraries were constructed at the University of Arizona Genetics Core (UAGC) with RNA TruSeq library construction kits following standard protocols. In total there were 24 libraries: 2 colony replicates × (7 age groups + 5 behavioral groups). RNA sequencing was conducted at the University of Arizona Genetics Core on an Illumina HiSeq2000 with 100 bp paired ends reads, with six samples multiplexed per lane, randomly distributed across four lanes.

Differential gene expression analysis was carried out in edgeR, using a GLM fit to the count data and identifying differentially expressed genes using planned linear contrasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>). In order to infer co-expression modules and gain an insight into network structure of gene interactions, we performed a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the count data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>). WGCNA was conducted on the entire transcript set, after filtering out the low-abundance transcripts. This analysis relies on patterns of gene co-expression, but has been shown to reconstruct protein–protein interaction networks with reasonable accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2012</xref>). We used total connectivity as a measure of gene interaction strength, because it is not as sensitive to module assignments, and most likely reflects the overall selective pressures acting on the gene, beyond those imposed by its role in age polyethism. As with most gene expression analysis, WGCNA provides better estimates for highly abundant genes, and in particular for genes showing variation in their expression levels. Consequently, low-abundance and invariant genes will show lower connectivity.</p><p>GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the R package GOstats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Falcon and Gentleman, 2007</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>While all three reviewers are enthusiastic about the study, several important concerns were voiced by all of them. All reviewers pointed out that this paper does not provide the necessary statistical details to be able to assess the quality of the work. This is certainly the most important concern, as hypothesis acceptance/rejection—which is the central message of the study—fully depends on gene expression analysis and its interpretation. The respective comments are combined below and it will be necessary to address them before a final decision about acceptance can be reached.</p><p>More specifically:</p><p>The authors investigate the “novel social genes” vs the “gene toolkit” hypotheses. This is certainly interesting and worthwhile. However, one general issue I have with this (and most other) studies on the topic is that it is not clear what “exactly” constitutes evidence for one hypothesis or the other.</p><p>For example, the authors here state that the percentage of genes differentially expressed in the same context in the two ants is small (∼3%). However, the overlap is marginally significant (fifth paragraph of the Results section). So the question is, what percent overlap exactly would constitute support for the toolkit hypothesis? 50%? 25%? 10% 5%?</p><p>The point is that it isn't clear how and when authors reject or fail to reject the toolkit/novel hypotheses because there is never an explicit significance or overlap threshold provided. The authors are not alone in having to deal with this issue, and so I don't want to lay this completely at their feet, but it would be nice if they stated explicitly what exactly would constitute evidence, or lack thereof, for the toolkit hypothesis somewhere before they get to the results.</p><p>Related to this issue, I wanted more detail about the analyses comparing expression patterns between taxa. Did the authors just ask if the same genes were differentially expressed between behavioral types in the two taxa to be viewed as 'consistent' with the toolkit model? Or did a particular gene have to be differentially expressed in the same direction in both taxa? (The latter, I think, although this wasn't clear.) And did a gene need to be significantly differentially expressed to be counted? Or was it sufficient that it show the same directionality in expression, regardless of significance? Directionality without significance is as important as significance, given that the studies in the taxa had different power, used different methods, etc. These are not trivial issues and they may affect the outcome and interpretation of the results. I urge the authors to look into this more closely.</p><p>In the third paragraph: The authors state they are interested in the “molecular mechanisms of social interactions (e.g. social signal production, reception and response)”. They refer to genes related to social behavior throughout the manuscript. But are their expression profiles indeed reflecting social information producing/processing skills? Or morphological changes related to other functions, such as exposure to exterior environments? They do not state they used whole ants or just ant heads for transcriptome profiling, which is highly crucial for interpreting the results (especially given that some other studies have used the animal head).</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Results section: “Of these contrasts, only foragers and nurses had significantly different gene expression patterns.” This is not well explained. Four categories are compared and 2 of these are said to have different expression. What is the reference here; are the other two categories (grooming and trophallaxis) not different from these two? Or perhaps I am missing something?</p><p>This can be partly followed in the Supplementary Material, but should be referred in the main text, e.g. it seems as if all samples were grouped together in the DE analysis. The foragers and nurses were most different as they represent the youngest and oldest. I would have stated this explicitly.</p><p>I am also concerned somewhat about the PCA in the Supplementary Material: There seems to be two groups emerging, but this is likely technical (I would guess sample processing dates). It might be difficult to control for this, but if possible, could improve DE analysis significantly.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Results section: “There were 1217 forager- and 1247 nurse-upregulated genes”. What was the p-value cutoff? How did the authors control for multiple-testing? (This can also be followed in the Supplementary Material, but should be referred in the main text.)</p><p>In the fourth paragraph of the Results section: “(…) it separated workers into two distinct classes based on age”. If I understand what was done, I think the authors might be overinterpreting: the algorithm will separate the profiles into 2 classes if k=2, and n classes if k=n. Thus, without additional analysis I think one cannot decide on the existence of distinct classes. The authors could consider applying some other test; e.g. check the slope of the expression-age curve.</p><p>In the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the Results section: In the gene expression conservation analysis, we are given no information how many genes are used in the comparisons (i.e, the number of genes showing DE in both this and the other datasets, as well as background genes). If the numbers are low, they could instead check the effect size of orthologous genes identified as DE for honeybee, for example. Was the honeybee data generated by Manfredini et al., 2014? If not, the authors should state that.</p><p>Most importantly, if the honeybee data was generated from the brain (as done by quite a few studies) and the data in this study from the whole body, this could also be a reason for finding limited overlap.</p><p>In comparisons with the Fisher's exact test, it would be useful to state what the background is (non-DE genes, genes up-regulated in the other category, or both?).</p><p>The expression “whether genes differentially expressed in these categories of workers were more likely conserved” is a bit confusing, as it also implies sequence conservation, but I think the authors mean conservation with respect to correlated changes.</p><p>In the seventh paragraph of the Results section: Connectivity—this could be more explicitly defined, such as emphasizing that the prediction comes from transcription data correlations (e.g. not protein-protein interaction data), and that it depends on how the modules are defined. I think the authors could also discuss potential biases here. Depending on the signal/noise ratio of a gene and the module size, how would connectivity be affected? One would want to make sure that these factors are not influential on the reported result.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Would it not be informative to add a violin plot (similar to A and B) for dN/dS? Especially so, as lower conservation among up-regulated genes is one of the paper's main points. But no information is given regarding the magnitude of the effect. The authors could also plot expression versus connectivity.</p><p>In the sixth paragraph of the Results section: There is little discussion on the GO analysis. Does the UV response pathway have to do with sudden exposure to the sun? At least would one not expect to see the same pathway up-regulated in foragers of other taxa?</p><p>Please indicate the p-value cutoffs for the GO analysis. This is also found in the Supplementary Material, but should be in the main text or Methods.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors addressed the following:</p><p>What is the estimated genome size? What was the CEGMA assembly score for the de novo genome assembly? What was the average coverage per sample for the genomic and transcriptomic data?</p><p>The main conclusion that “genes unregulated in foragers and nurses were on average less connected and more rapidly evolving” (ninth paragraph of the Results section) relies heavily on the assumption that they are working with a high-quality transcriptome and that their orthology assignments are correct.</p><p>How did they evaluate this? A table with summary statistics would be very useful. How many transcripts had homology to the fire ant and/or the honey bee? How was the paralog problem dealt with, particularly with respect to the molecular evolution analyses?</p><p>Similarly, for the network analyses: Were these co-expression networks calculated only on significant transcripts or on all transcripts? How was a significant “network” determined? Two of the modules had &gt; 8000 transcripts in each of them. Does that mean all 8000 transcripts show tightly-correlated expression levels?</p><p>Finally, why didn't the authors include <italic>Polistes</italic> in their comparative analyses? There are at least 2 studies on <italic>Polistes</italic>, both of which are already cited in this manuscript. This seems like it would be another independent data point worth discussing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04775.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>While all three reviewers are enthusiastic about the study, several important concerns were voiced by all of them.

We struggled to come up with a satisfying approach to quantitatively test these hypotheses, but finally came to the conclusion that, as currently described in the literature, both the “genetic toolkit” and “novel social genes” hypotheses are somewhat ambiguous, such that it is not currently possible to really test these hypotheses. Similarly, a recent book chapter by Adam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wilkins (2013)</xref> points out that the concept of a developmental genetic toolkit is widely accepted, but it is also very unclear what actually makes up the genetic toolkit, so that the hypothesis is very difficult to actually test. Because these two hypotheses are entrenched in the literature—and the idea of a genetic toolkit underlying social behavior is frequently cited as <italic>the</italic> major finding of sociogenomic research—we describe them in the Introduction to motivate our work. In the Discussion, we explain how our results fit with these two hypotheses, but then we move on to our main, and we believe, most exciting point: the genes we identified as being associated with ant division of labor show different patterns of connectivity and evolutionary conservation, and thus the genetic architecture of ant division of labor includes both highly connected and conserved genes as well as more loosely-connected and evolutionarily labile genes.</p><p><italic>Related to this issue, I wanted more detail about the analyses comparing expression patterns between taxa. Did the authors just ask if the same genes were differentially expressed between behavioral types in the two taxa to be viewed as 'consistent' with the toolkit model? Or did a particular gene have to be differentially expressed in the same direction in both taxa? (The latter, I think, although this wasn't clear.) And did a gene need to be significantly differentially expressed to be counted? Or was it sufficient that it show the same directionality in expression, regardless of significance? Directionality without significance is as important as significance, given that the studies in the taxa had different power, used different methods, etc. These are not trivial issues and they may affect the outcome and interpretation of the results. I urge the authors to look into this more closely</italic>.</p><p>Following this suggestion we conducted the suggested analysis using the fire ant data. When we look at just the direction of expression, or the fold-change in expression across the genome, we find results very similar to those obtained when we only consider differentially expressed genes. Whereas we previously found a 3.2-3.8 percent overlap in differentially expressed genes between the fire ant and pharaoh ant data set, the analysis based on the correlation of log fold change between nurse and forager samples in the two species involves thousands of genes, but explains only 2% of the variance. So, the results of the two analyses are consistent. This significant but seemingly low overlap is also consistent with previous studies interpreted as supporting the genetic toolkit hypothesis. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodard et al. (2014)</xref> found 18 brain-expressed genes associated with feeding behavior in both the bumblebee <italic>Bombus terrestris</italic> and the paper wasp <italic>Polistes metricus</italic>, which was more than expected by chance. Considering only genes with identifiable homologs between the two study species and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, this corresponds to an overlap of 7.5% (18/239), but considering all 2,563 identified <italic>B. terrestris</italic> feeding-associated genes, this corresponds to an overlap of only 0.7% (18/2563).</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph: The authors state they are interested in the “molecular mechanisms of social interactions (e.g. social signal production, reception and response)”. They refer to genes related to social behavior throughout the manuscript. But are their expression profiles indeed reflecting social information producing/processing skills? Or morphological changes related to other functions, such as exposure to exterior environments? They do not state they used whole ants or just ant heads for transcriptome profiling, which is highly crucial for interpreting the results (especially given that some other studies have used the animal head)</italic>.</p><p>We agree that these are very important points. We used whole ant bodies and we emphasize this point more in the revised text. We also agree that the differentially expressed genes we observed may be related to a wide range of physiological and behavioral processes, and not just social signal production and response. The underlying physiological processes are particularly intermeshed because by definition, age-based division of labor in social insects means that the individuals are aging as they transition from nursing to foraging tasks. We have clarified these issues in the revised text.</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the Results section: “Of these contrasts, only foragers and nurses had significantly different gene expression patterns.” This is not well explained. Four categories are compared and 2 of these are said to have different expression. What is the reference here; are the other two categories (grooming and trophallaxis) not different from these two?

The foragers and nurses were most different as they represent the youngest and oldest. I would have stated this explicitly</italic>.</p><p>There were four behavioral categories: foragers, nurses, and workers engaged in trophallaxis and grooming. We wished to see which of the categories were transcriptionally distinct from the others, and made comparisons of the focal category vs all of the others. This section was indeed unclear and we re-wrote it with extra detail.</p><p><italic>I am also concerned somewhat about the PCA in the Supplementary Material: There seems to be two groups emerging, but this is likely technical (I would guess sample processing dates). It might be difficult to control for this, but if possible, could improve DE analysis significantly</italic>.</p><p>All the samples were processed simultaneously and in the same facility. We cross-checked the samples, and the two groups don’t correspond to sequencing lanes or to any other discernable categories. The within-sample replicates, except for the loosely defined behavioral category ‘trophallaixis’ are close to each other, suggesting that the biological signal is strong in the data. Most importantly, the separation between the clusters does not correlate with any biological signal detected in the data. Finally, worker samples on the first day of eclosion (age 0) are an outlier on this plot. As these workers are just beginning their transition to adult life, with numerous physiological changes, such as cuticle hardening, it is logical to expect that they would be separate from the others. If we discount these points, there is far less evidence for the existence of separate groups in the scatter.</p><p><italic>In the third paragraph of the Results section: “There were 1217 forager- and 1247 nurse-upregulated genes”. What was the p-value cutoff? How did the authors control for multiple-testing? (This can also be followed in the Supplementary Material, but should be referred in the main text</italic>.<italic>)</italic></p><p>We followed the standard practice of 0.05 cutoff after using FDR to adjust for multiple comparisons. We now specify this in the new Statistical Analysis section of the Methods.</p><p><italic>In the fourth paragraph of the Results section: “(…) it separated workers into two distinct classes based on age” If I understand what was done, I think the authors might be overinterpreting: the algorithm will separate the profiles into 2 classes if k=2, and n classes if k=n. Thus, without additional analysis I think one cannot decide on the existence of distinct classes. The authors could consider applying some other test; e.g. check the slope of the expression-age curve</italic>.</p><p>We were interested in testing whether our temporal data could be classified into two groups, corresponding to nurses and foragers, and, if so, where would the transition point be. In the analysis, k=2 refers not to the number of classes, but to the number of nearest neighbors considered by the k-nearest neighbor classifier to make the distinction. We obtain basically the same result with k=2 and k=3, which is within the range of the rule-of-thumb recommendations (references listed in KNN section of the complete analysis). We also include a simple cluster diagram as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, to show that the there is indeed a breakpoint before day 12. We have also clarified the logic behind this analysis in the text.</p><p><italic>In the fifth and sixth paragraphs of the Results section: In the gene expression conservation analysis, we are given no information how many genes are used in the comparisons (i.e, the number of genes showing DE in both this and the other datasets, as well as background genes). If the numbers are low, they could instead check the effect size of orthologous genes identified as DE for honeybee, for example. Was the honeybee data generated by Manfredini et al., 2014? If not, the authors should state that</italic>.</p><p>We added the numbers of genes, which were indeed low, and a parallel analysis using effect sizes (log fold expression change) for fire ants, which produced the same result. Unfortunately, for the honey bee study, only the list of differentially expressed genes is publicly available, so that we could not perform a similar analysis for the honey bee data set. The unavailability of previous data sets is one reason that we have strived to make our full analysis available and completely transparent, as well as making all of the data available.</p><p><italic>Most importantly, if the honeybee data was generated from the brain (as done by quite a few studies) and the data in this study from the whole body, this could also be a reason for finding limited overlap</italic>.</p><p><italic>In comparisons with the Fisher's exact test, it would be useful to state what the background is (non-DE genes, genes up-regulated in the other category, or both?)</italic>.</p><p><italic>The expression “whether genes differentially expressed in these categories of workers were more likely conserved” is a bit confusing, as it also implies sequence conservation, but I think the authors mean conservation with respect to correlated changes</italic>.</p><p>The honeybee data was indeed generated from the brain, and this is certainly a plausible reason for the low observed overlap. We have added this very important point to our discussion, qualifying our conclusions in this light. In the revised manuscript we focus much less on the proportional overlap of the pharaoh ant and fire ant/honey bee data sets, because of these methodological limitations of the comparisons, and as discussed above, it is difficult to interpret what exactly these overlaps mean.</p><p><italic>In the seventh paragraph of the Results section: Connectivity—this could be more explicitly defined, such as emphasizing that the prediction comes from transcription data correlations (e.g. not protein-protein interaction data), and that it depends on how the modules are defined. I think the authors could also discuss potential biases here. Depending on the signal/noise ratio of a gene and the module size, how would connectivity be affected? One would want to make sure that these factors are not influential on the reported result</italic>.</p><p>We added a more detailed description of WGCNA to the Methods section, including citations to studies evaluating WGCNA performance. For our measure of connectivity, we used the total connectivity of a gene, which is less sensitive to how modules are defined, and most likely reflect the overall role of the gene, beyond the modules we detect in our data set. Although the authors of the WGCNA package suggest that the method can run on normalized count data, in the course of considering potential biases, we found the gene lengths varied somewhat among behavioral categories. We then re-ran the analysis using FPKM data, which are length-standardized. This analysis also captured major network effects, but had a much better fit to the data. In particular, we had to use a smaller soft thresholding level before an approximately scale-free topology of the network was observed (a WGCNA requirement). We were also able to detect many more modules at the same cutoff levels, suggesting greater network resolution.</p><p>The most obvious remaining bias from this sort of analysis is that genes with low expression and low variability will not be detected as differentially expressed. Indeed, this effect can clearly be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, with the average expression level of non-differentially expressed genes is lower. However, contrary to what you would expect if the pattern was driven by this bias, the nurse-upregulated genes show lower connectivity than non-differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We also explicitly control for expression level by including expression level in our GLM analyses.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>: Would it not be informative to add a violin plot (similar to A and B) for dN/dS?

We do not dwell on GO terms since approximately 50% of all genes in our analysis do not even have identifiable orthologs, so we cannot generally be confident about inferring function of differentially-expressed genes or gene modules.</p><p><italic>It would be helpful if the authors addressed the following</italic>:</p><p><italic>What is the estimated genome size? What was the CEGMA assembly score for the de novo genome assembly? What was the average coverage per sample for the genomic and transcriptomic data?</italic></p><p>As we mention in response to Reviewer 1, a genome project was not the goal of this study. That being said, as the quality of the reference genome assembly is important to this study, we now include quality control statistics in the Results, such as coverage statistics and CEGMA, as requested. Unfortunately, there is no independently estimated size of the <italic>M. pharaonis</italic> genome.</p><p><italic>The main conclusion that “genes unregulated in foragers and nurses were on average less connected and more rapidly evolving” (ninth paragraph of the Results section) relies heavily on the assumption that they are working with a high-quality transcriptome and that their orthology assignments are correct</italic>.</p><p><italic>How did they evaluate this? A table with summary statistics would be very useful. How many transcripts had homology to the fire ant and/or the honey bee? How was the paralog problem dealt with, particularly with respect to the molecular evolution analyses?</italic></p><p>As with all studies involving gene orthology, particularly with-non models species, there is no genome-wide gold standard that allows the performance of a method to be evaluated. Because the data set is based on transcriptomic data, there will necessarily be false negatives associated with poorly expressed transcripts. That being said, our choice of reciprocal best hit is well justified, based on comparisons of various available methods, as it has high specificity, though at the cost of sensitivity, as it ignores paralogous relationships for genes that have been duplicated in one of the lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Another important consideration is that we used an independently assembled genome to estimate evolutionary rates. Consequently, our measurements of nucleotide-level changes were not dependent on the quality of the transcriptome, except that some regions of the gene may be missing due to poor transcript coverage. So, transcript quality should not bias the evolutionary rate estimates.</p><p><italic>Similarly, for the network analyses: Were these co-expression networks calculated only on significant transcripts or on all transcripts? How was a significant “network” determined? Two of the modules had &gt; 8000 transcripts in each of them</italic>. <italic>Does that mean all 8000 transcripts show tightly-correlated expression levels?</italic></p><p>The networks were calculated using all transcripts and all samples. There are no measures of module significance per se, and the actual module structure may change if different cutoffs are chosen in the analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary File 2</xref>). Indeed, in the current analysis, the number of modules is greater than the original analysis. The effect of cutoff on the number of modules can be seen in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary File 2</xref>. As described above, we use WGNA to estimate total network connectivity (i.e. “kTotal” in WGCNA) for each node (i.e. gene), and present the module trait correlation heat map as a low-dimensional visualization of the underlying transcriptional changes.</p><p>As we discuss in the manuscript, the true measure of a module’s validity may be its repeatability across different studies within and between lineages. Thus, it will be important to cross-check the modules found in our data with future studies conducted using comparable methodology. This is another reason we are including the complete data with our analysis.</p><p><italic>Finally, why didn't the authors include</italic> Polistes <italic>in their comparative analyses? There are at least 2 studies on</italic> Polistes<italic>, both of which are already cited in this manuscript.
