differentiation are still poorly understood. Here, we uncovered a mechanism of progenitor cell allocation that stems from an incomplete process of epithelial delamination that allows progenitors to coordinate their movement with adjacent extra-embryonic tissues. Progenitors of the zebrafish laterality organ originate from the superficial epithelial enveloping layer by an apical constriction process of cell delamination. During this process, progenitors retain long-lasting apical contacts that enable the epithelial layer to pull a subset of progenitors on their way to the vegetal pole. The remaining delaminated cells follow the movement of apically attached progenitors by a protrusion-dependent cell-cell contact mechanism, avoiding sequestration by the adjacent endoderm, ensuring their collective fate and allocation at the site of differentiation. Thus, we reveal that incomplete delamination serves as a cellular platform for coordinated tissue movements during development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During embryo development, naïve cell lineages undergo concurrent processes of fate specification and morphogenesis as critical steps towards the generation of differentiated tissues and organs. These early progenitor cells often travel long distances from their induction site to the site of terminal differentiation, making them vulnerable to environmental cues and movement of neighbouring tissues. When faced with these environmental hazards, progenitors may deviate from their correct pathway or change their potential, leading to a reduction in the pool of progenitors available for later stages of differentiation. The success of this journey is critical when the number of progenitors in a tissue or organ is limited. In these cases, small reductions in the number of progenitors can lead to developmental abnormalities resulting in a dysfunctional organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno-Ayala et al., 2020</xref>). Several embryonic tissues and organs originate from small sets of progenitor cells. These include the primordial germ cells that give rise to gametes in vertebrate and invertebrate gonads, the posterior lateral line primordium that give rise to neuromasts along the trunk and tail of fish and amphibians, and the progenitors of the laterality organ involved in left-right pattern formation in various vertebrates (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dalle Nogare and Chitnis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Matsui and Bessho, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Richardson and Lehmann, 2010</xref>). Despite the importance of the developmental pathways followed by these small groups of progenitor cells and their impact on the physiology of the organism, we still know little about the set of developmental strategies that progenitor cells deploy in vivo to overcome the challenges imposed by the environment as they travel to the site of terminal differentiation. Here, we examine this question during the early stages of morphogenesis of the embryonic laterality organ, the first organ to form during vertebrate development, using the zebrafish as a model organism.</p><p>The zebrafish laterality organ or left-right organiser is a transient embryonic structure of epithelial nature known as Kupffer’s vesicle that contains motile cilia necessary for left-right axis determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper and D’Amico, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Essner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kramer-Zucker et al., 2005</xref>). This organ-like epithelial structure originates from a small group of 20–30 progenitors, known as dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs), which arise at the dorsal margin of the late blastula by a process of cell ingression that converts the superficial epithelial cells of the extra-embryonic enveloping layer (EVL) into deep mesenchymal-type DFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). After ingression, DFCs move as a cell collective from their place of origin at the equator of the embryo towards the vegetal pole, reaching the terminal location for organ differentiation at the posterior tip of the notochord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooper and D’Amico, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). On their journey, DFCs are positioned ahead of the margin of the deep cell layer (DCL), where specification signals and massive internalisation movements transform the marginal epiblast into the mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pinheiro and Heisenberg, 2020</xref>). Despite the proximity to the DCL margin and the fact that DFCs share critical determinants with the mesendoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander and Stainier, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Warga and Kane, 2018</xref>), the movement and fate of DFCs do not appear to be affected by specification signals or <italic>mass</italic> internalisation movements of the mesendoderm, remaining separate from this cellular domain during their vegetal movement. Notably, DFCs follow the same vegetal ward direction of movement as the overlying EVL during epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce and Heisenberg, 2020</xref>) and appear to be physically connected to this extra-embryonic epithelial tissue, as revealed by the presence of puncta enriched in the tight junction (TJ)-associated zonula occludens one protein (ZO-1) at the DFC-EVL interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablooglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). This observation raises the question of whether the putative DFC-EVL connections play a role in the movement of DFCs to the site of organ differentiation. This hypothesis has not yet been tested experimentally.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) delaminate by apical constriction and retain apical attachments with the enveloping layer (EVL) and yolk syncytial layer (YSL).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal views of confocal z-stack maximum projections showing the collective vegetal movement of DFCs between shield stage and 100% epiboly in a representative Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) embryo injected with <italic>gap43-RFP</italic> mRNA.

We found that DFCs arise from the EVL by an apical constriction process of cell delamination. During this process, DFCs retain long-term physical connections with the EVL and yolk syncytial layer (YSL) through TJ-enriched apical attachments, at the time both extra-embryonic tissues spread to the vegetal pole in the movement of epiboly. We demonstrated that extra-embryonic tissue spreading is transmitted to DFCs through the apical attachments to drag their vegetal movements. As DFCs detach from the extra-embryonic cellular domains after completing delamination or undergoing division, long polarised protrusions and E-cadherin (E-cad)-mediated adhesion integrate detached cells to the vegetal movement of attached DFCs, avoiding sequestration by the endoderm and ensuring the vegetal motion of all progenitors as a group. Thus, we unveil a drag-mediated guidance mechanism of progenitor cell morphogenesis that relies on the concerted activities of the epithelial delamination process underlying progenitor cell specification and the directed spreading of adjacent extra-embryonic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DFCs ingress by cell delamination through an apical constriction process that provides long-term apical attachments with extra-embryonic tissues</title><p>The previous observation of puncta enriched in the TJ adaptor protein ZO-1 at the interface between a subset of DFCs and the overlying epithelial EVL during late epiboly stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablooglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>) suggests that DFCs establish contacts that attach them to the extra-embryonic surface epithelium. To investigate this possibility, we started by studying the spatial distribution of these enriched ZO-1 regions. Double immunolabelling for ZO-1 and phalloidin at 75% epiboly confirmed that ZO-1 puncta marked discrete areas, also enriched in F-actin, where DFCs contacted the EVL at cell-cell junctions near the margin of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – left; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Also, we observed the punctuated co-accumulation of ZO-1 and F-actin at the epithelial margin where DFCs contacted the YSL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> – right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Indeed, the latter population of marginal DFCs was more abundant than submarginal DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref>). We then asked how these contacts arise by examining the temporal progression of ZO-1 from early to late epiboly stages throughout DFC formation. Previous work has shown that DFCs originate from dorsal EVL cells through ingression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>) although the underlying mechanism is currently unknown. We found that at early epiboly stages EVL cells fated to become DFCs accumulated ZO-1 along their apical junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Later, as epiboly progressed, the apical face of these cells gradually reduced in area to leave punctuated apical domains enriched in ZO-1 and F-actin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that DFCs arise from dorsal EVL cells by a mechanism of epithelial cell delamination mediated by apical constriction. Remarkably, this process leaves discrete apical attachments connecting delaminating DFC progenitors with the extra-embryonic tissues.</p><p>To investigate the dynamics of apical constriction leading to the formation of apical attachments, we performed in vivo imaging from late blastula to epiboly stages using a GFP-tagged version of ZO-1. We found that EVL cells fated to become DFCs gradually shrunk their apical area while moving beneath the epithelial sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>), a behaviour that was specific as neighbouring dorsal EVL cells exhibited the opposite behaviour, increasing their apical area as epiboly progressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Interestingly, the kinetics of apical area reduction varied among cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and resulted in discrete apical attachments that connected these cells with the YSL and EVL for extended periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that DFC progenitors retain long-term apical attachments with the extra-embryonic YSL and EVL as a consequence of the apical constriction process of cell delamination that gives rise to the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cell delamination is concurrent with the vegetal movement of DFCs and extra-embryonic tissues</title><p>The presence of apical attachments connecting delaminating DFCs with the YSL and EVL opens the possibility that extra-embryonic tissues guide the vegetal movement of these cells. However, previous studies have hypothesised that the vegetal movement of DFCs relies on polarised protrusive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablooglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). To discriminate between these two guidance mechanisms, we first examined the organisation of polarised protrusions in DFCs. Using in vivo imaging in an actin transgenic reporter line, we found that DFCs formed dynamic membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablooglu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). However, protrusions were enriched at the rear (lateral and animal) edges and not at the leading (vegetal) edge of the DFC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>) arguing against a primary role of polarised cell protrusions in directing the vegetal movement of DFCs. To further support this idea, we inhibited the formation of actin-based cell protrusions through the expression of a dominant negative form of Rac (Rac1-T17N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bakkers et al., 2004</xref>). DFCs expressing Rac1-T17N did not form lamellar nor filopodial-like protrusions as in controls but instead showed extensive membrane blebbing with no directional bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Nevertheless, they still retained a persistent collective movement towards the vegetal pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I and K</xref>) as in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Vegetally directed polarised protrusions are not required for dorsal forerunner cell (DFC) vegetal movement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the DFC cluster showing how cell protrusions extending from the vegetal (orange), lateral (purple), and animal (light blue) edges of the cluster were quantified in Tg(<italic>actb1::lifeactin-RFP</italic>) embryos to build the plots of (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>).

For this, we first determined the extent to which the vegetal movement of DFCs temporally matched the process of delamination using confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We observed that DFCs travelled over 350 µm towards the vegetal pole from the time in which the first cell started the process of apical constriction at around dome stage until the last cells delaminated after detachment from the extra-embryonic tissues at around 90% epiboly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> – horizontal axes). In agreement with the variable kinetics of apical constriction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), the onset of apical constriction and the time of detachment leading to delamination were also highly variable in the DFC population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref> – red and blue circles, respectively). Together, the absence of vegetal ward polarised cell protrusions in DFCs and the close concurrency of cell delamination with the vegetal movement of DFCs suggest that apical attachments with the YSL and EVL integrate delaminating DFCs to the vegetalward movements of the extra-embryonic tissues during epiboly. In support of this idea, the simultaneous tracking of DFCs and EVL cells revealed that the speed, direction, and extent of DFC vegetal movement tightly matched the vegetal spreading of the EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). Furthermore, DFCs and overlying EVL cells shared the same bias in the orientation of the elongation axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a morphogenetic coupling between the two tissues. Collectively, these results suggest that apical attachments derived from the process of cell delamination work as tissue-tissue connectors that couple delaminating DFCs with the vegetal spreading of the extra-embryonic YSL and EVL, guiding their vegetal movement during epiboly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dorsal forerunner cell (DFC) delamination is asynchronous and coexists with the vegetal movement of DFCs and the enveloping layer (EVL).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing the origin of DFCs from the EVL through cell delamination.

We observed that apical attachments recoiled towards the animal pole after ablation, triggering a fast retraction of the DFC body, indicating that both apical attachments and DFCs were under vegetally directed tension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Subsequently, the constricted cortical zone induced by wound repair pulled apical attachments towards the vegetal pole, restoring the vegetal directionality of DFC movement, further indicating that apical attachments are able to transmit motion information from the EVL to DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—video 2</xref>). Finally, we took advantage of the particular spatial configuration that DFCs adopt in some wild-type embryos, in which subsets of cells developed as individuals isolated from the core group of DFCs, to test the requirement of apical attachments for DFC directed vegetal movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In these ‘natural’ experiments, we observed that isolated individual DFCs devoid of apical attachments (hereafter referred to as ‘detached DFCs’) moved without persistence and directionality, even towards the animal pole in the opposite direction to the vegetal movement of the YSL/EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). In contrast, isolated individual DFCs connected with the extra-embryonic tissues by apical attachments (hereafter referred to as ‘attached DFCs’) showed a persistent and directed movement toward the vegetal pole, mimicking the movement of extra-embryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>). Importantly, the persistence and speed of movement of DFCs correlated with the persistence and speed of movement of apical attachments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G and H</xref>), and this close spatial and temporal relationship between apical attachments and DFC movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–I</xref>) was only lost upon detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video3">Figure 4—video 3</xref>), indicating the requirement of physical attachment to extra-embryonic tissues for the persistent directed vegetal movement of DFCs. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that apical attachments are required to transmit vegetal spreading from extra-embryonic tissues to attached DFCs, guiding their vegetal movement during epiboly.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Apical attachments promote a persistent vegetal movement of attached dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram showing single isolated DFCs transiting the process of delamination far from the main DFC cluster (green).

Importantly, this behaviour was also present in a subset of detached cells initially located close to or inside the central cluster of DFCs during epiboly. We observed that in 55% of embryos, often one or two, and up to five detached DFCs per embryo left the cluster as single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These cells moved mainly in direction to the animal pole, being sequestered by the internalisation movement of the DCL and incorporating into this embryonic cell layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>). Remarkably, this group of DFCs mimicked the morphology and movement behaviour of endodermal cells and at later stages differentiated in endodermal tissue derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, DFCs transplanted into the paraxial region of host embryos, where endodermal and mesodermal progenitors develop, also followed endodermal cell fate and form endodermal tissue derivatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, detached DFCs are prone to leave the cell cluster being sequestered by the DCL, and in this new environment integrate into the endodermal cell layer, losing their primal fate. However, this behaviour was barely seen in normal development. Indeed, detached DFCs following the endodermal path were observed in only 55% of all analysed embryos and represented a small fraction of the complete pool of detached DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, the number of detached DFCs increased steadily during epiboly as cells completed the process of delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These findings prompted us to investigate how the detached DFC population integrates into the collective movement of attached DFCs, which is guided by the extra-embryonic tissues. To address this issue, we first analysed how the detached DFC population evolves in number during their collective vegetal movement. Immunostaining for ZO-1 and F-actin revealed that at the onset of epiboly the entire population of DFCs were transiting the process of delamination and thus were all attached to the YSL and EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, as epiboly progressed, detached DFCs steadily increased to outnumber the attached DFC population from around 75% epiboly, and by 90% epiboly they became the predominant pool of DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Through time-lapse microscopy, we found that the progressive increase of detached cells was not only due to DFCs completing the process of delamination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but detached DFCs also emerged from events of cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). As previously noted, despite the continuous increase in the number of detached DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the entire population of DFCs still moved in direction to the vegetal pole in coordination with the vegetal spreading of extra-embryonic tissues until advanced stages of epiboly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Only around 85–90% of epiboly, when the percentage of detached cells reached 80%, the DFC cluster detached from the EVL and significantly lowered its vegetal movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). Taken together, these results reveal that the DFC cluster retains a collective vegetal motion during a prolonged period of epiboly, regardless of the progressive expansion of the detached DFC population, raising the question of how detached DFCs move towards the vegetal pole.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) move to the vegetal pole as a collective despite the increase of detached cells.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Individual detached DFCs can leave the main cluster towards the deep cell layer (DCL) during normal development.

During epiboly, DFCs change from being a collection of dispersed progenitors to a tightly packed cellular cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). Quantitative assessment of collective cell behaviour revealed that DFC clustering was achieved by progressively decreasing the distance between progenitors and increasing the contact with the surrounding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). During this process, DFCs express <italic>e-cadherin</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kane et al., 2005</xref>) and also localise E-cad at the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), and previous reports have shown that functional abrogation of this adhesion molecule affects the cluster cohesion of DFCs leading to a scattered organisation of DFCs at 90% of epiboly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oteiza et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, E-cad-mediated DFC-DFC adhesion could play a role of integrating detached DFCs into the vegetal movement of attached DFCs. Therefore, we tested by time-lapse microscopy whether the directed vegetal movement of detached DFCs requires E-cad-mediated contact interactions. We found that E-cad knockdown disrupted cluster cohesion, leading to multiple racemes of DFCs that moved in the vegetal direction guided by their apical attachments with the YSL and EVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Remarkably, the number of detached cells exiting the DFC group towards the DCL increased significantly in these embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G and H</xref>). These results indicate that E-cad-mediated DFC-DFC adhesion is necessary for the recruitment of detached DFCs into the vegetal motion of attached DFCs, avoiding cell escape and promoting the formation of a tight cellular cluster.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Dorsal forerunner cells (DFCs) increase cell-cell contact and cluster compaction during vegetal movement.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dorsal view of a 3D cell reconstruction of a single DFC cluster from a <italic>Tg(β-actin::HRAS-EGFP</italic>) embryo at different time points of collective movement.

However, in the remaining 43% of embryos, DFCs initially formed two (28%) or three (15%) small cell clusters separated by an average distance of 50 µm, which only at later stages of epiboly coalesced to form a single cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). Thus, it remained unknown how cells located far apart in the initially dispersed small DFC clusters approached to each other to establish adhesive contacts. To address this question, we followed the movement of DFCs by in vivo microscopy. Our time-lapse image analysis revealed that DFCs located at the edges of distant cell clusters initiated adhesive contacts by sending out long polarised protrusions that resulted in the establishment of long-term adhesion between cells, allowing DFC clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>). The protrusions involved in this process differed from other protrusions formed by DFCs not only by their longer length, but also by their increased lifetime and alignment between clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–I</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that long-range cell-cell contact interactions mediated by polarised protrusions function as seeds for the establishment of stable adhesion between DFCs. Remarkably, using transgenic embryos expressing a fluorescent biosensor for F-actin only in DFCs, we observed a temporal connection between the formation of protrusion-mediated adhesive contacts and the loss of apical attachments. Subsets of small clusters of DFCs that contained several cells with apical attachments began to detach from extra-embryonic tissues only after initiating protrusion-mediated adhesive contacts with the central cluster of attached DFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8J</xref> – 0–16 min; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video2">Figure 8—video 2</xref>).

When DFCs are formed, the EVL epithelium spreads from the equator to the embryo’s vegetal pole during the movement of epiboly in conjunction with the YSL, an extra-embryonic syncytium to which the vegetal margin of the EVL is tied. Remarkably, the apical constriction process underlying the delamination of DFC progenitors follows a temporal progression that allows these cells to retain long-term apical attachments with the EVL and YSL as they spread towards the vegetal pole during epiboly. Apical attachments work as tissue connectors that couple DFCs with the vegetal spreading of extra-embryonic tissues, guiding their motion towards the site of differentiation at the vegetal pole. In contrast with previous hypotheses indicating that autonomous motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablooglu et al., 2010</xref>) and contact-mediated repulsive interactions with the marginal DCL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) drive DFC vegetal movement, we show that mechanical drag by extra-embryonic tissue movement provides the critical guidance cues for DFC directed locomotion. Remarkably, this guidance mechanism is mediated by apical attachments that stem from an incomplete process of delamination, allowing DFCs to coordinate their movement with the adjacent extra-embryonic tissues. Epithelial delamination is a conserved mechanism to generate new mesenchymal cell types in various developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shook and Keller, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Thiery et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we show that besides this canonical function, incomplete delamination serves as a generic mechanism for coordinated tissue movement during development, driving the allocation of newly formed mesenchymal cell groups.</p><p>Apical attachments guiding DFC movement arise from a process of apical constriction that is asynchronous among DFCs. We show that such asynchrony generates two distinct populations of progenitors, one holding apical attachments and being pulled by the vegetal movement of extra-embryonic tissues, and a second population of detached delaminated DFCs that follows the vegetal movement of apically attached DFCs through DFC-DFC contact mechanisms. In the context of these evolving two populations, having an asynchronous process of cell delamination potentially increases the chances of maintaining a minimal number of apically attached DFCs able to carry the detached DFC population along their movements, a factor that becomes relevant as epiboly progresses and the ratio of attached/detached DFCs decreases. Furthermore, as apical constriction imposes mechanical stress along the epithelial plane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heer and Martin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin and Goldstein, 2014</xref>), we can speculate that having asynchrony in a collective process of apical constriction promotes the even dissipation of mechanical stress over time and space, protecting the integrity of the epithelium. Future work combining mechanical perturbations/measurements with physical modelling will have to test these hypotheses directly.</p><p>Delaminated DFCs are intrinsically motile and can move towards the DCL, being sequestered by the massive internalisation movements of this embryonic cellular domain during gastrulation. Importantly, when DFCs reach the DCL, either during normal development or after transplantation, they follow the endodermal path revealing that DFCs have a previously unrecognised potential to become endoderm that is expressed if they enter the developmental field of the endoderm. Such potential co-option of DFCs by the endodermal DCL reduces the number of progenitors, and this can have a detrimental impact on left-right asymmetry development, increasing the incidence of embryo laterality defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moreno-Ayala et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we show that DFCs transiting the process of delamination avoid endodermal fate by establishing E-cad-mediated adhesive contacts with the sub-population of attached DFCs before completing the process of delamination. Thus, DFC-DFC contact interactions mediated by E-cad play a dual function, to protect delaminated cells from escaping towards the endoderm and to ensure they move together with the attached DFC population as a collective group. Importantly, DFCs located at long distances establish adhesive contacts by sending long polarised protrusions whose persistence and directionality differ from the other short-lived random protrusions formed by most DFCs. The mechanisms underlying the formation of these directed long protrusions are currently unknown. Notably, recent work shows that migrasomes containing the chemokine ligands Cxcl12a/b become enriched in the extracellular space surrounding DFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>), thus opening the possibility that long polarised protrusions are a manifestation of a chemoattraction mechanism mediated by these guidance molecules. It is also remarkable the observation that small sub-groups of DFCs delaminate only after establishing adhesive contacts with the main DFC cluster suggesting a mechanistic coupling between cell adhesion, cell motility, and the process of delamination. Both emerging possibilities, the guidance of contact-mediated DFC clustering through environmental chemical cues and the coordination of cellular behaviours at a supra-cellular scale, are interesting aspects to explore in future work. Together, these findings provide a novel developmental function for E-cad, mediating the transfer of movement information between two distinct populations of progenitor cells defined by their state in the delamination process: attached (transiting delamination) and detached (delaminated). Remarkably, motion transfer from attached to detached DFCs resembles the leader-to-follower motion transmission observed in events of collective cell locomotion, many of which also require cadherin-dependent cell-cell contact interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Reig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Theveneau and Mayor, 2013</xref>). In the case of DFCs, the role of E-cad in motion transmission complements the previously described function in clusterisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hong and Dawid, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Matsui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oteiza et al., 2010</xref>), and together ensure that progenitors reach the site of terminal differentiation in a sufficient number and organised as a tight collective, a prerequisite to proceed into further stages of organogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oteiza et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). It is worth mentioning that the proposed mechanism of DFC leader-to-follower locomotion works until the percentage of attached cells falls below the 20% limit, around 85–90% of epiboly. After this stage, the DFC cluster loses its physical connections with the YSL and EVL and begins an internal cellular reorganisation process leading to rosette formation and organ differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Oteiza et al., 2008</xref>). During this transition, the DFC cluster continues a vegetal displacement until the end of epiboly but at a slower rate and becomes covered by the DCL. The mechanisms driving this subsequent migratory phase are unknown and could involve contact interactions with the DCL margin.</p><p>Developmental cases of cells being dragged through physical bonds with adjacent tissues have recently begun to be reported. Among them, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> primordial germ cells internalise during gastrulation due to cohesive contacts that these cells establish with the moving ingressing endoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chihara and Nance, 2012</xref>). In annual killifish, the embryonic DCL spreads during epiboly as a result of adhesive contacts with the basal epithelial domain of the expanding EVL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reig et al., 2017</xref>). In zebrafish, the vegetal spreading of the EVL during epiboly follows the autonomous movement of the YSL to which is tightly bonded at its margin by TJ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Betchaku and Trinkaus, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koppen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwayer et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, mechanical drag is an emergent mechanism of cell movement whose extent and impact during embryo morphogenesis needs to be further investigated. Here, we show that drag-mediated locomotion is a crucial driver of organogenesis that emerges at the interface of embryonic and extra-embryonic cellular domains highlighting the essential role of mechanical information from extra-embryonic tissues in driving early embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christodoulou et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

Also, at early stages they are attached to the EVL, show a larger size than endodermal cells, and often organise in one, two, or three clusters (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). In contrast, endodermal cells that express the <italic>sox17::GFP</italic> transgene are located within the DCL margin (or in anterior positions) and show a dispersed scattered organisation. Importantly, DFCs identified according to these criteria could be followed over time after detachment from the EVL/YSL by time-lapse microscopy to faithfully characterised their behaviour and fate, ruling out any possibility that they could be mistaken for native endodermal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Isochronic transplantation</title><p>Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) and Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) embryos injected with 50 pg of <italic>lifeactin-mCherry</italic> mRNA at one-cell stage were used as host and donor embryos, respectively. Host and donor embryos were dechorionated manually at 30% epiboly stage, and cultured in sterile 0.3× Danieau buffer in petri dishes coated with 1% agarose. During transplantation, embryos were arranged over a 1% agarose multi-well camera filled with sterile 1× Danieau buffer to increase the concentration of calcium ions and thus allow the proper sealing of the transplant point. DFCs from donor embryos were removed with a 20-µm-diameter glass capillary between shield and 70% epiboly stage, and then transplanted to the most marginal paraxial region of deep blastoderm of host embryos at equivalent stages. After 15 min, DFC-transplanted host embryos were transferred to a solution of sterile 0.3× Danieau buffer supplemented with penicillin and streptomycin. Later, embryos were fixed in 4% PFA for 2 hr at room temperature and observed in a Leica TCS LSI Confocal microscope with HCS software using a 5× objective and 488/520 (λexc/λem) lasers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>High-resolution confocal imaging</title><p>Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) and Tg(<italic>sox17::utrn-GFP</italic>) embryos were used for high-resolution confocal imaging of cell protrusions. Embryos were imaged from shield stage onwards in a Volocity ViewVox spinning disc (Perkin Elmer) coupled to a Zeiss Axiovert 200 confocal microscope using a Plan-Apochromat 40×/1.2 W lasers 488/520, 568/600, and 647/697 nm (λexc/λem). Processing and analysis of digital images were performed using Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), MATLAB (MATLAB 2014), Volocity (Improvision), and Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Laser ablation</title><p>Mechanical disruption of the actomyosin ring within the YSL was performed as previously described by conducting laser ablation on a UV laser ablation setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrndt et al., 2012</xref>) equipped with a Zeiss 63 × 1.2 NA water immersion lens using Tg(<italic>actb1::myl12.1-eGFP</italic>) embryos. Embryos were mounted at 50% epiboly (5.3 hpf) and the YSL actomyosin cortex close to the EVL margin was repeatedly ablated by applying 10 UV pulses at 1000 Hz on a rectangular ROI. Suboptimal ablation intensity was applied to just disrupt the cortical actomyosin flux and marginal ring, and avoid the activation of a wound response within the yolk cell. The kinetic of EVL cells, DFCs, and YSL marginal actomyosin network adjacent to the disrupted cortex was compared with the kinetic of close neighbouring tissues showing intact regions of the actomyosin network as an internal control. Cortical laser ablation of the EVL was performed parallel to the EVL margin and perpendicular to the EVL actomyosin cortex by applying 25 UV pulses at 1000  Hz along a 10 μm line. Retraction of apical ties and DFCs were quantified from maximum <italic>z</italic>-projections images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell protrusion analysis</title><p>Quantification of cell protrusions was assessed by making volumetric binary masks from 4D confocal images using manual threshold to keep the presence of protrusions and avoid artefacts. Each volume was reduced to a 2D cluster mask by z-projection based on maximum intensity. Manual correction allowed to keep protrusion zones that were occluded due to dimensional reduction. The Fiji tool Local Thickness was used to generate a central mask to describe the cluster central zone without the protrusions. Masks containing just the protrusions zones were obtained by subtracting cluster masks and central masks. Each protrusion was defined with a protrusion axis that connected the base and tip of the protrusion. A long axis connected the cluster centroid and the base of each protrusion. Individual protrusion orientation was described calculating the angle between the long axis and the protrusion axis. For single long protrusion analysis, protrusion were selected by visual inspection in different regions of DFC clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>), protrusion length was calculated as the maximum distance between the centre of cell nucleus and the tip of protrusion. Protrusion timing was calculated by visual identification as the total time spent among protrusion formation and complete retraction. Protrusion alignment was measured as the angle formed among a vector that passes through the two nuclei’s centre of DFC that will generate a contact between two clusters and the vector formed among centre of nucleus a tip of protrusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cell segmentation</title><p>Images obtained from in vivo imaging of <italic>gap43-RFP</italic> or <italic>ZO1-GFP</italic> mRNA injected embryos were segmented manually using Wacom Cintiq Touch Screen tablet (Wacom) and Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). A maximum z-projection using Fiji was first applied to each xyz stack to obtain a 2D sequence and simplify the xy segmentation of cell boundaries. To perform segmentation in the yz plane, z-projections containing the central region of cell volume of marginal and submarginal DFCs were selected and reconstructed using Fiji.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>3D reconstruction of DFCs</title><p>Contours of deconvolved z-stacks time points of DFCs obtained from in vivo imaging of Tg(<italic>β-actin::HRAS-EGFP</italic>) were segmented manually using the Wacom Cintiq/Cintiq-15X Touch Screen tablet and Interactive Pen Display (Wacom). Binary masks of segmented cell were generated with a custom-made macro written for the public domain image analysis software Image-SXM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sdb/imageSXM">http://www.liv.ac.uk/~sdb/imageSXM</ext-link>). Cellular contours in 3D were improved by the application of a modified version of an active surface model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kass et al., 1988</xref>). Briefly, an initial surface mesh was computed from the manually segmented DFCs contours. The active surface model was applied and supervised interactively to set the appropriate combination of elasticity, rigidity, viscosity, external force, and iteration coefficients, to produce a final surface model that assimilates closely the morphology of the cellular contour. Parameters of DFCs interaction inside the cluster configuration were calculated from these surface model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Cell tracking</title><p>Cell movement was tracked by following the cell’s centre in Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) embryos, and the nucleus in <italic>H2B</italic> mRNA injected embryos. YSL tracking was performed by following arbitrary landmarks inside the marginal actomyosin network. Tracking of apical attachments was assessed by following actin-rich zones localised in the apical face of DFCs. Tracking was performed manually in 2D from maximum z-projections using Fiji plugin MTrack J. Speed and persistence (ratio of displacement to trajectory length) of movement was then calculated from tracking data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments were performed at least three times. Unless indicated, plots display the mean and the standard deviation. Statistical inference analysis was conducted initially by a <italic>Shapiro-Wilk</italic> test to assess if the data were normally distributed. Two-sample <italic>F</italic>-test of equality of variance was applied to assess if the samples had the same variance. Significance for two groups with normal distribution was calculated through a two-tail <italic>t</italic>-test and the p-value was selected depending if the dataset had or not equality of variance. For other distributions, non-parametric <italic>Kolmogorov-Smirnov</italic> or Mann-Whitney tests were applied. All statistical analyses were conducted using the Origin 2016 (OriginLab). ns: p &gt; 0.05, *: p ≤ 0.05, **: p ≤ 0.01, and ***: p ≤ 0.001.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Funding acquisition, Methodology, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Methodology, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Fish care and procedures were approved by the Ethical Review Committee and comply with the Animals Scientific Procedures Act 0466 (Protocol CBA#0466 FMUCH).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66483-transrepform1-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analysed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>We found your work of general interest with an important contribution for the fields of cell biology and morphogenesis. Your work highlights a novel mechanism of cell movement where cells pull a second group of cells leading into a coordinated movement. We congratulate you for this nice piece of work.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Apical contacts stemming from incomplete delamination guide progenitor cell allocation through a dragging mechanism&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard White as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>(1) The authors describe how detached DFCs reattach to the main cluster via polarized protrusions (Figure 6). The existence of preferentially polarized protrusions even before cell contact suggests that there are long range cues that help direct cell processes, but no attempt has been made to identify these cues. Even if the authors do not perform extra experiments, could they discuss possible players in their discussion?</p><p>The findings of ECad are not that surprising because ECad is already known to be involved in DFC migration. It seems from Figure 6 that ECad MO doesn't completely stop clustering, suggesting other adhesive proteins are involved and this is not explored further. It would be great to provide some examples and possibly test the implication of these factors.</p><p>(2) It is not clear how the different mechanisms of escaped DFCs finding their way back to joining the main cluster fit together. How many escaped DFCs escape as single cells? How often does 6F occur? Are small clusters found in 6D formed via individual escaped DFCs joining together, or by an event like 6F except delamination happened before the cluster attached itself to the main cluster?</p><p>(3) Figure 1C and D aims to show that ZO1 is accumulated at the junctions between DFC and EVL cells. In order to reach that conclusion they need to show images in which the DFC are easily identifiable (e.g. Tg(Sox17::GFP)) in addition of the ZO1 expression. Unfortunately in Figure 1C they merge the ZO1 and phalloidin channels and in Figure 1D they do not show the Tg(Sox17::GFP).</p><p>(4) The conclusion that apical contraction is mediated by actomyosin dynamic is the weakest aspect of the manuscript, and at the same time the least interesting. First, it is expected that apical contraction is driven by actomyosin dynamic; so, no novelty there. Second, the data here are just corelations and there is no functional experiment that really demonstrates that actomyosin activity is required for apical contraction. Third, the images shown in Figure 3G and corresponding Video 3 are confusing. It is not clear what region of the cell to look at, as the levels of myosin are quite variable across different regions. In addition, Figure 3H shows that the apical area reach almost cero at 7 min, but I cannot see that in the images or video. In conclusion, without stronger evidence we suggest to remove this part, as it does not contribute to the main mechanism explored in this manuscript.</p><p>(5) The authors use the data from Figure 3 and Figure S2 to propose that DFC and EVL movements are linked. The problem with this analysis is that the comparison in the movement of DFC and EVL is done at the cell population level. A better analysis could be achieved by analysing single cells; for example the tracks of single DFCc could be compared with the track of neighbour EVL cells. This could show that the similarities between DFC and EVL cells movement decreases with the distance between these two cell populations, if they are really moving together.</p><p>(6) The observation that detached cells can cluster with the DFC cells via protrusions and E-cadherin is an interesting observation. However further analysis should be performed. Are the detached cells producing protrusions in random orientations and only those growing in the direction of the DFC cluster become larger or more stable? What about the protrusions produced by the DFC cluster, are longer or more stable if directed to detached DFC cells? How does the protrusions dynamics change with the distance between the detached DFC cells and the DFC cluster? Answering these questions could give an idea about the mechanism by which single cells are reintegrated to the DFC cluster.</p><p>(7) The authors conclude that apical constriction of EVL cells depends on actomyosin dynamics. The authors show a compelling correlation between apical constriction and actomyosin accumulation (Figure 2). However, no functional perturbations of actomyosin activity were shown to disrupt apical constriction. Thus, it remains unknown whether apical constriction requires actomyosin activity.</p><p>(8) The evidence presented supports, but does not fully demonstrate, the proposed drag mechanism. Manipulation of the YSL actomyosin ring (by myosin dephosphorylation or laser ablation) shows that both DFC and EVL cells require YSL actomyosin ring contraction for vegetal movement. In addition, DFC and EVL cell velocity and directionality indicates a correlation between the movements of the two cell types. Based on these results, it is proposed that apical attachments between the layers allow the EVL to drag the DFCs. To directly test this hypothesis, the authors turn to laser ablations. If the drag hypothesis is correct, I would predict that severing all (or several) of the attachments would result in the EVL leaving the DFCs behind. This would convincingly demonstrate that EVL cells drag DFCs via attachments. However-potentially due to technical reasons-the authors sever only one of the attachments. The DFCs recoil, but the attachment is almost immediately reconnected, and there is no apparent effect on movement of EVL or DFCs. Therefore, it is unclear whether apical attachments are necessary for DFC movement.</p><p>(9) The data presented clearly show attachments between DFCs and EVL. However, it also appears that leading DFCs are attached to the YSL actomyosin ring. Experimental perturbations indicate that contractility of the actomyosin ring is required for DFC movement, raising the possibility that the YSL actomyosin ring may 'pull' the DFCs vegetally. The authors should comment on this alternative mechanism.</p><p>10) Previous work has also suggested that DFCs have intrinsic motility and respond to chemoattraction (Zhang, et al., 2016. Development; Ablooglu, et al., 2010. Development; Jiang, et al., 2019. Nat Cell Biol). Although the authors characterize protrusive activity of DFCs, no functional evidence is presented to rule out this mechanism. It is also possible that the proposed mechanisms of DFC movement are not mutually exclusive.</p><p>(11) It should be clarified that DFCs detach from the EVL ~8-9 hpf, which is part way through their journey to the site of differentiation and organ formation in the tailbud between 10-11 hpf. It may be useful for the authors to speculate on mechanisms that control the later part of this journey, which may provide foundations for future work.</p><p>(12) Imaging of apical constriction of EVL cells (Figure 1) to form DFCs is convincing. However, there may be some confusion between epithelial EVL cells and mesenchymal DFCs. It should be clarified that EVL cells are polarized epithelial cells, otherwise it may be unclear to the reader how apical surfaces are defined in these cells. In addition, &quot;DFC apical constriction&quot; (as written in the text) may be confusing since DFCs are considered to be mesenchymal-like cells, likely with front-rear polarity rather than apical-basal polarity.</p><p>(13) Since the presented results do not fully 'demonstrate' the proposed drag mechanism, I suggest the authors soften their conclusions.</p><p>(14) It is not clear whether &quot;escaper DFCs&quot; (Figure 5) are DFCs or endoderm cells, since the sox17:GFP transgene is expressed in both cell types. The authors should comment on this in the text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66483.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors describe how detached DFCs reattach to the main cluster via polarized protrusions (Figure 6).

These findings suggest that this type of polarised protrusions could be a manifestation of some type of short- or long-range attraction mechanism. Although addressing the molecular nature of this mechanism is beyond the scope of this article, we provide in the discussion a molecular candidate to be addressed in future work based on a recent publication from the Meng and Yu laboratories (Jian et al., 2009; Nature Cell Biology 21: 966-977). This publication shows that migrasomes containing the chemokine ligands Cxcl12a/b are enriched in the extracellular space surrounding DFCs, making it possible that chemokine signalling can function as a guidance mechanism for directing polarised protrusions and clustering of DFCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The findings of ECad are not that surprising because ECad is already known to be involved in DFC migration. It seems from Figure 6 that ECad MO doesn't completely stop clustering, suggesting other adhesive proteins are involved and this is not explored further. It would be great to provide some examples and possibly test the implication of these factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, previous work from several laboratories have shown that E-cad is required for DFC cluster formation (Hong and Dawid, 2009 PNAS 106:2230-5; Matsui et al., 2011 PNAS 108:9881-6; Oteiza et al., 2010 Development 137:3459-68). These publications and the present work have also shown that cluster formation is not completely abolished after E-cad knockdown. This finding could be in part related to the fact that E-cad MO experiments (and other published experimental conditions) might only induce a partial loss of E-cad function. But it is also possible the existence of compensatory mechanisms (e.g. increase in the expression of other cadherins) or the involvement of other adhesion molecules. To date there is no description of other adhesion proteins participating in DFC clustering. This is an interesting aspect of DFC clusterisation that has not been the focus of our work and should definitively be addressed in the future. A possible avenue of future work is exploring the role of N-cadherin as preliminary data from our lab shows that N-cad is also expressed in DFCs and that knockdown of this adhesion molecule induces the formation of a smaller, misshapen Kupffer's vesicle and, consequent, a left-right asymmetry defect (data not shown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It is not clear how the different mechanisms of escaped DFCs finding their way back to joining the main cluster fit together. How many escaped DFCs escape as single cells?</p></disp-quote><p>All detached DFCs that escape into the DCL do so as single cells. However, the number of escaped cells varies from embryo to embryo. As shown in the new quantification panel of Figure 6A, only 55% of embryos show escaped DFCs. Among them, the most frequent cases are embryos with 1 (18%) or 2 (23%) escaped cells, whereas embryos with 3 (5%) and 4-5 (9%) escaped cells are much less frequent. In the source data section, we have included additional information related to escaped cells, such as the developmental stage of DFC escaped cells and whether or not a cell escape occurs in association with a cell division event.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How often does 6F occur?</p></disp-quote><p>The original Figure 6F (now Figure 8J) showed that a small cluster of DFCs integrated into the central cluster of DFCs before losing their apical attachments to the YSL/EVL. Thus, this figure illustrates a case in which detached DFCs avoid escape by first establishing adhesive contacts with attached DFCs within the small cluster, and then by engaging into the vegetal movement of the central cluster. We provide a new quantification of the frequency of this behaviour in Figure 8. We observed that in the early stages of vegetal movement (shield phase), the population of DFCs was organised as a single cluster of cells in only 57% of embryos. In the remaining 43% of embryos, DFCs initially formed 2 (28%; similar to the configuration shown in Figure 8J) or 3 (15%) small clusters of cells separated by an average distance of 50µm. As shown in Figure 8J (also in Figures 8B-D), the configuration of 2-3 clusters coalesced to form a single cluster only at later stages of epiboly, using the DFC-DFC contact mechanism proposed in the paper (Figures 8B-D,J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are small clusters found in 6D formed via individual escaped DFCs joining together, or by an event like 6F except delamination happened before the cluster attached itself to the main cluster?</p></disp-quote><p>The small cluster seen in original Figure 6D (new Figure 8E) forms similarly to the cluster shown in Figure 8J. In both cases, the small clusters are the result of an early DFC multi-cluster configuration seen in about 43% of embryos, which coalesce into a single cluster only in the late stages of epiboly. The only difference between the small cluster shown in Figure 8E and 8J is the GFP labelling: in 8E the DFCs are labelled with cytoplasmic GFP whereas the GFP in 8J labels the F-actin, which reveals the DFC apical attachments with the EVL and YSL, which are invisible in 8E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 1C and D aims to show that ZO1 is accumulated at the junctions between DFC and EVL cells.

Also, we have incorporated a supplemental figure (Figure 1—figure supplement <italic>1</italic>) where we show a dorsal view of the Tg(<italic>sox17::GFP</italic>) embryo used to take the images shown in panels 1 and 2 of Figure 1C, revealing the punctuated coaccumulation of ZO-1 and F-actin at the DFC-EVL interfaces.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The conclusion that apical contraction is mediated by actomyosin dynamic is the weakest aspect of the manuscript, and at the same time the least interesting.

We have complemented this analysis with a correlation analysis between the movement of the DFC cluster and the movement of the EVL margin (New Figure 3G). Nevertheless, the aim of this analysis was to give a first approximation of the spatio-temporal connection between the movement of DFCs and EVL and we did not intend with this analysis to demonstrate a causal connection between the two processes. To address this point more directly, we have performed a new correlation analysis at the individual cell level between the movement of DFCs and the movement of their apical attachments, which is shown in the new Figure 5E-I. This analysis revealed that the movement of DFCs and their apical attachments are indeed closely correlated, and that this link is lost when the attachments are lost supporting a requirement of this attachments for the directed vegetal movement of DFCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The observation that detached cells can cluster with the DFC cells via protrusions and E-cadherin is an interesting observation. However further analysis should be performed. Are the detached cells producing protrusions in random orientations and only those growing in the direction of the DFC cluster become larger or more stable? What about the protrusions produced by the DFC cluster, are longer or more stable if directed to detached DFC cells? How does the protrusions dynamics change with the distance between the detached DFC cells and the DFC cluster? Answering these questions could give an idea about the mechanism by which single cells are reintegrated to the DFC cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a more in-depth analysis was needed and therefore have performed a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of cell protrusions shown in the new Figure 8 (panels E-I). In the analysis we make a clear distinction between the behaviour of cell protrusions involved in DFC clustering versus the behaviour of protrusions not involved in clustering, which are produced by DFCs both between clusters and on the lateral sides of them. We show that protrusions involved in clustering are longer, show a longer lifetime and also align between clusters, in contrast to the small, short-lived and randomly-oriented nature of the other protrusions. We have incorporated these results into the main text, Figure 8E-I, and mention in the discussion that long polarised protrusions involved in clustering could be a manifestation of a chemo attractive mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) The authors conclude that apical constriction of EVL cells depends on actomyosin dynamics.

Therefore, it is unclear whether apical attachments are necessary for DFC movement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that severing the apical attachments of DFCs would indeed be the ultimate experiment to directly test the requirement of apical attachments for the vegetal movement of DFCs, but, as the reviewers rightly presume, this experiment is not technically possible (laser ablation of the apical attachment inevitably leads to the death of the DFC). However, we argue that the EVL ablation experiments we provide in the article, combined with the “natural” experiments of single isolated DFCs (not mentioned by the reviewers), for which we provide additional analysis to demonstrate the link between the movement of attached DFCs and their apical attachments (Figure 5F-I), strongly support the drag-mediated mechanism. Below we explain in more detail the rationale for these experiments and discuss their results (also included in new version of text).</p><p>(i) EVL ablation experiment (Figure 4C-E). In this experiment we transiently released a subset of DFC apical attachments from the influence of EVL spreading by performing laser ablation of a cortical EVL junction located immediately vegetal to DFC apical attachments. We reasoned that if the EVL carries the DFCs through the apical attachments, they should be under tension and, therefore, cutting an EVL junction in a vegetal position to the attachments should result in a transient recoil towards the animal pole of both the apical attachment and body of the DFC, which is what we observed. We also observed that wound repair after ablation caused an accumulation of actin in the EVL that resulted in a pull of the apical attachments towards vegetal and a resulting movement of the DFC in the same direction, corroborating that the apical attachments are capable of transmitting movement information from the EVL to the DFCs to guide their movement.</p><p>(ii) “Natural” experiment (Figure 5). We took advantage of the particular spatial configuration that DFCs adopt in some wild-type embryos, in which subsets of cells developed as individuals isolated from the core group of DFCs, to test the requirement of apical attachments for DFC directed vegetal movements. In these “natural” experiments, we observed that isolated individual DFCs devoid of apical attachments moved without persistence and directionality, even towards the animal pole in the opposite direction to the vegetal movement of the YSL/EVL. In contrast, isolated individual DFCs connected with the extra-embryonic tissues by apical attachments showed a persistent and directed movement toward the vegetal pole, mimicking the movement of extra-embryonic tissues. Importantly the persistence and speed of movement of DFCs correlated with the persistence and speed of movement of apical attachments, and this close spatial and temporal relationship between apical attachments and DFC movements was only lost upon detachment (Figure 5F-I), indicating the requirement of physical attachment to extra-embryonic tissues for the persistent directed vegetal movement of DFCs.</p><p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate that apical attachments are required to transmit vegetal spreading from extra-embryonic tissues to attached DFCs, guiding their vegetal movement during epiboly. This mechanism appears critical for the guidance of DFC locomotion but we do not claim is the only mechanism, as cell protrusions and contact interactions with the DCL margin may facilitate the guidance and act in coordination with EVL/YSL drag.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The data presented clearly show attachments between DFCs and EVL. However, it also appears that leading DFCs are attached to the YSL actomyosin ring. Experimental perturbations indicate that contractility of the actomyosin ring is required for DFC movement, raising the possibility that the YSL actomyosin ring may 'pull' the DFCs vegetally. The authors should comment on this alternative mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>The combined role of EVL and YSL (to which the marginal DFCs are attached) is indeed a central aspect of our proposal. We mention it in several places but, as is evident from the reviewers' comments, it is not sufficiently clear, so we have made changes to the main text and discussion to make this point even clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Previous work has also suggested that DFCs have intrinsic motility and respond to chemoattraction (Zhang, et al., 2016. Development; Ablooglu, et al., 2010. Development; Jiang, et al., 2019. Nat Cell Biol). Although the authors characterize protrusive activity of DFCs, no functional evidence is presented to rule out this mechanism. It is also possible that the proposed mechanisms of DFC movement are not mutually exclusive.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments to complement the analysis of protrusion formation and to address more directly the role of polarised cell protrusions in DFC vegetal movement, which is now shown in new Figure 2 (panels F-L). To test the requirement of polarised cell protrusions for DFC vegetal movement, we inhibited the formation of actin-based cell protrusions by expressing a dominant negative form of Rac (Rac1-T17N). We showed that DFCs expressing Rac1-T17N did not form lamellar or filopodial protrusions as in controls, but displayed extensive membrane blebbing without directional bias. However, they still retained a persistent collective movement towards the vegetal pole. This result, together with the lack of vegetally-oriented polarised protrusions in the WT, indicates that the primary mechanism of DFC vegetal movement does not require polarised cell protrusions, and that other mechanisms must play a role, in this case, the EVL/YSL drag mechanisms proposed in the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It should be clarified that DFCs detach from the EVL ~8-9 hpf, which is part way through their journey to the site of differentiation and organ formation in the tailbud between 10-11 hpf.

In addition, &quot;DFC apical constriction&quot; (as written in the text) may be confusing since DFCs are considered to be mesenchymal-like cells, likely with front-rear polarity rather than apical-basal polarity.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this concern and to avoid confusion we have clarified when possible in the text the epithelial nature of the EVL cells, the mesenchymal nature of the DFCs, and the dual behaviour of EVL cell transiting delamination (DFC progenitors).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Since the presented results do not fully 'demonstrate' the proposed drag mechanism, I suggest the authors soften their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>See discussion in point 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) It is not clear whether &quot;escaper DFCs&quot; (Figure 5) are DFCs or endoderm cells, since the sox17:GFP transgene is expressed in both cell types. The authors should comment on this in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Although both DFCs and endodermal cells express <italic>sox17::GFP</italic>, DFCs start expressing this transgene slightly earlier than endodermal cells and at higher levels. We took advantage of this feature and identified DFCs at early stages, from around 50% epiboly. These identified DFCs not only expressed <italic>sox17::GFP</italic> but also position themselves ahead of the margin of the deep cell layer (DCL). Also, at early stages they are attached to the EVL, show a larger size than endodermal cells, and often organise in 1, 2 or 3 clusters (see Figure 8A). In contrast, endodermal cells that express the <italic>sox17::GFP</italic> transgene are located within the DCL margin (or in anterior positions) and show a dispersed scattered organisation. Importantly, DFCs identified at early stages according to these criteria could be followed over time after detachment from the EVL/YSL by time-lapse microscopy to faithfully characterised their behaviour and fate, ruling out any possibility that they could be mistaken for native endodermal cells. We have incorporated this information into the Material and Methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
