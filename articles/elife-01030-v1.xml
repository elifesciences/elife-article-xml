In the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), which enables errorless chromosome segregation, phosphorylation promotes recruitment of SAC proteins to tensionless kinetochores. The SAC kinase Mps1 phosphorylates multiple Met-Glu-Leu-Thr (MELT) motifs on the kinetochore subunit Spc105/Knl1. The phosphorylated MELT motifs (MELT<sup>P</sup>) then promote recruitment of downstream signaling components. How MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs are recognized is unclear. In this study, we report that Bub3, a 7-bladed β-propeller, is the MELT<sup>P</sup> reader. It contains an exceptionally well-conserved interface that docks the MELT<sup>P</sup> sequence on the side of the β-propeller in a previously unknown binding mode. Mutations targeting the Bub3 interface prevent kinetochore recruitment of the SAC kinase Bub1. Crucially, they also cause a checkpoint defect, showing that recognition of phosphorylated targets by Bub3 is required for checkpoint signaling. Our data provide the first detailed mechanistic insight into how phosphorylation promotes recruitment of checkpoint proteins to kinetochores.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01030.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01030.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01030.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cell cycle is the process by which a cell divides to produce two near-identical daughter cells. Two crucial parts of the cell cycle are the duplication of the chromosomes in the original cell, and the segregation of these chromosomes between the two daughter cells. These and other parts of the cell cycle are strictly regulated to prevent errors, which can lead to cancer and other diseases.</p><p>After chromosome duplication has taken place, the pairs of identical chromosomes, known as sister chromatids, remain tightly bound to each other. These sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell, with protein filaments called microtubules connecting them to a bipolar structure called the spindle. For the cell to divide correctly, the sister chromatids in each pair must be connected to opposite poles of the spindle. A signalling network known as the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) ensures that the sister chromatids have enough time to line up correctly and to correct possible problems. Once everything is in place, the SAC releases its ‘break’, and the microtubules then pull the sister chromatids away from each other. This way, each daughter cell receives the same complement of chromosomes that was present in the mother cell.</p><p>The microtubules are not directly attached to the sister chromatids but to protein complexes called kinetochores that assemble on each sister chromatid. In particular, each microtubule binds to a very large protein complex called the KMN network. Knl1, which is part of this network, recruits two SAC proteins–Bub1 and Bub3–to the kinetochore. It is known that a phosphate group is added to Knl1 when the SAC is active, and that Knl1 can only recruit Bub1 and Bub3 after it has been phosphorylated. However, the details of the interactions between Knl1, Bub1 and Bub3 are not understood, and it is not clear whether these interactions are essential for the SAC.</p><p>Now Primorac et al. have shown that Bub3 binds directly to Knl1 through a region that contains multiple MELT motifs (where M, E, L and T are all amino acids), and that this interaction only happens if these ‘MELT repeats’ have been phosphorylated. Moreover, once bound to the Knl1, Bub3 then recruits Bub1 to the kinetochore. By showing that the recognition of phosphorylated Knl1 by the Bub1-Bub3 complex has a central role in the spindle assembly checkpoint, these results highlight the importance of phosphorylation as a way of regulating the timing of events during the cell cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01030.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01030.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>spindle assembly checkpoint</kwd><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>Bub3</kwd><kwd>Bub1</kwd><kwd>Mad3</kwd><kwd>Knl1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>233316 (KINCON)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Seventh Framework Programme of the European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Integrating Project MitoSys</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ciliberto</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Umberto Veronesi Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chiroli</surname><given-names>Elena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The spindle assembly protein Bub3 recruits the checkpoint kinase Bub1 to kinetochores by binding to phosphorylated MELT repeats in the kinetochore subunit Knl1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinases are ubiquitous and almost invariably crucial components of cellular signaling networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huse and Kuriyan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ubersax and Ferrell, 2007</xref>). Kinases transfer a high-energy phosphate group from ATP to the side chains of serine, threonine, tyrosine, and more rarely those of other residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hunter, 2012</xref>). The addition of phosphate groups can modify the activity of a target protein directly or indirectly through the modification of its pattern of physical interactions, which in turn might modify the target’s activity, localization, or stability. Phosphorylation is usually a transient state that is reversed by the action of phosphatases. The transient nature of phosphorylation makes it ideally suited for use in signaling networks, where rapid activation and inactivation of defined substrates is important for the networks’ ability to toggle between alternative states.</p><p>Phosphorylation plays a crucial role also in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC), a signaling network required for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). Checkpoint control creates a dependency between the mechanical aspects of cell division—the complex physical interaction of chromosomes with the mitotic spindle–and the timing of cell cycle progression. To prevent premature sister chromatid separation and mitotic exit in cells whose chromosomes have not yet attained bipolar attachment on the mitotic spindle, the SAC targets the cell cycle machinery required for the metaphase-to-anaphase transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Work in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> originally identified several checkpoint components, including Bub1, Bub3, Mad1, Mad2, Mad3/BubR1, and Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoyt et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li and Murray, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>), which were later found to be <italic>de facto</italic> ubiquitous in eukaryotes. Within this group, Bub1 and Mps1 are protein kinases. Together with all additional known checkpoint components, Bub1 and Mps1 become highly enriched at kinetochores between mitotic prophase and early prometaphase. Kinetochores are large protein assemblies, built on chromosomal loci known as centromeres. They bind directly to spindle microtubules to ensure the equational and reductional division of chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</xref>). The dynamic interplay between kinetochore attachment to microtubules and checkpoint control is crucial for life in metazoans, but it remains disappointingly poorly understood.</p><p>Among the targets of the Mps1 kinase activity is a kinetochore protein named Spc105/Knl1 (also known as Spc7, Blinkin, CASC5 in different organisms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>). Spc105/Knl1 is the largest subunit of a 10-subunit assembly, the KMN network, which is believed to provide the main site of attachment of kinetochores to microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Santaguida and Musacchio, 2009</xref>). Within Spc105/Knl1, Mps1 phosphorylates at least a subset of an array of motifs that are generally referred to as ‘MELT’ and that conform to the consensus M-[E/D]-[L/I/V/M]-T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; we indicate as MELT<sup>P</sup> the phosphorylated form of a MELT motif). The presence of multiple MELT repeats is an essentially invariant feature of Spc105/Knl1 in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheeseman et al., 2004</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01030.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of the interaction of Bub1-Bub3 with MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic description of the domain and motif organization of the main players discussed in this paper.

The Bub3-binding domain of Bub1 is necessary for kinetochore recruitment of Bub1. When expressed in isolation in human cells, this region of Bub1 is sufficient to mediate robust kinetochore recruitment of Bub1, albeit at partly reduced levels compared to constructs that also include the N-terminal TPR domain of Bub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Taylor and McKeon, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krenn et al., 2012</xref>). The minimal region of human Bub1, capable of mediating kinetochore targeting, consists of residues 209–270 (equivalent to residues 289–359 of Bub1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>). Additional deletions of this segment prevent kinetochore binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krenn et al., 2012</xref>).

The binding site on Bub3 is essentially bipartite, with a highly hydrophobic ‘south’ interface interacting with the hydrophobic side chains of Met169<sup>MELT</sup> and Met171<sup>MELT</sup>, and a highly positively charged ‘north’ interface contacting the acidic side chains of Glu170<sup>MELT</sup> and P-Thr172<sup>MELT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) Specifically, at the south end, the side chains of Met169<sup>MELT</sup> and of Met171<sup>MELT</sup> are embedded in a deep hydrophobic pocket lined up by the side chains of Phe236<sup>Bub3</sup>, Phe238<sup>Bub3</sup>, Trp278<sup>Bub3</sup>, and by the aliphatic portion of the side chain of Arg283<sup>Bub3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). At the north end, the side chains of Glu170<sup>MELT</sup> and P-Thr172<sup>MELT</sup> face Arg217<sup>Bub3</sup>, Arg239<sup>Bub3</sup>, and Arg242<sup>Bub3</sup>, which are therefore ideally positioned to compensate the negative charge of the phosphopeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>) and are at the core of a complex network of hydrogen bonds that also engages Glu317<sup>Bub1</sup>. Within this array of residues, Arg242<sup>Bub3</sup>, in the βD5-βA6 loop, faces Glu170<sup>MELT</sup> and has additional stabilizing effects on the side chains of Arg217<sup>Bub3</sup> and Arg239<sup>Bub3</sup>, which face P-Thr172<sup>MELT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Taken together, these interactions explain the positive discrimination by Bub1<sup>289–359</sup>–Bub3 for phosphorylated versions of the MELT peptides. Finally, at the ‘west’ end of the binding site, the aromatic side chain of Phe175<sup>MELT2</sup> (+3 position relative to P-Thr) stacks against the side chain of Lys193<sup>Bub3</sup>, which is held in position by the side chain of Tyr194<sup>Bub3</sup> (not shown). Both Bub3 residues are exposed and invariable in evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that they play an important functional role, but there is no strong preference for phenylalanine or other hydrophobic residues in the sequence of MELT repeats at the +3 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). It is also possible that Lys193<sup>Bub3</sup> and Tyr194<sup>Bub3</sup> are required to stabilize the interaction with Bub1, whose Ile309<sup>Bub1</sup>, Ile319<sup>Bub1</sup>, and Phe323<sup>Bub1</sup> are in direct van der Waals contact with the side chain of Tyr194<sup>Bub3</sup> (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mutations on Bub1–Bub3 affect interaction with MELT<sup>P</sup> in vitro</title><p>A plot of sequence conservation on the surface of the Bub1–Bub3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>) shows an extreme concentration of conserved residues at the interface with the Spc105/Knl1 peptide. The level of conservation at this site even exceeds the conservation of Bub1-binding residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, binding to phosphorylated sequences is a crucial property of Bub3. Overall, the pattern of sequence conservation strongly suggests that binding to MELT<sup>P</sup> and Bub1 might be the only two widely conserved functions of Bub3.</p><p>Because the presence of a phosphate on Thr172<sup>Spc105/Knl1</sup> is essential for high-affinity binding of ScBub1<sup>289–359</sup>–Bub3 to MELT<sup>P</sup> peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we concentrated our mutational analysis on two residues that are directly implicated in the recognition of the peptide’s phospho-threonine, Arg217<sup>Bub3</sup> and Arg239<sup>Bub3</sup>. Positively charged residues are invariant at these positions of the Bub3 alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We generated single or double alanine mutants of Arg217<sup>Bub3</sup> and Arg239<sup>Bub3</sup> in the context of ScBub1<sup>289–359</sup>–Bub3 and tested their binding affinity for the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide by ITC. Importantly, the mutant complexes were expressed and purified essentially like the wild type complex and did not suffer obvious losses of stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Replacement of Arg217 or Arg239 with alanine caused a 13- to 25-fold reduction in the binding affinity for the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide, with K<sub>D</sub>s of 2.7 µM and 5 µM for the R217A and R239A mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>), respectively, compared with 200 nM for the wild type interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, neither arginine side chain is completely indispensable for binding, but each is required for high-affinity binding. When the mutations were combined in the Bub3<sup>R217A–R239A</sup> double mutant, no significant residual binding to the MELT<sup>P</sup> peptide was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

However, as already anticipated in the Introduction, several lines of evidence indicate that Bub1 contributes to this interaction (Discussion). To test this possibility formally, we measured the binding of purified Bub3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) to the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide in the absence of Bub1. Remarkably, we observed a 10-fold reduction in the binding affinity of Bub3 for the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide (K<sub>D</sub> = 2 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) compared to the Bub1–Bub3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that Bub1 does indeed positively contribute to the interaction.</p><p>Such function of Bub1 is probably exerted primarily through its structuring effects on the 4-stranded β-sheet ‘roof’ that dominates the peptide-binding region of Bub3 and which restrains the position of the positively charged residues in the ‘north’ area of the MELT<sup>P</sup>-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Additionally, we observe that Arg314<sup>Bub1</sup>, in the β1-β2 loop, contributes to the interaction with the phosphate group of P-Thr172<sup>Spc105/Knl1</sup> (the interaction, however, is only observed in one of the two complexes in the asymmetric unit, and in proximity of a crystal contact) and is therefore directly engaged in the interaction with the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide. In ITC measurements, we observed a ∼fourfold reduction in the binding affinity of the Bub3-Bub1<sup>R314A</sup> mutant for the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide, in agreement with a role of Arg314<sup>Bub1</sup> is in the interaction of the Bub1-Bub3 complex with MELT2<sup>P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Unsynchronized <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells expressing tagged versions of Bub3 and of the kinetochore subunit Mtw1 (Bub3-mCherry and Mtw1-GFP) were imaged in a flow cell by wide-field fluorescence microscopy.

As a consequence, it has been hard to design targeted experiments aiming to dissect the role of specific binding interactions in the regulation of checkpoint proteins. Phosphorylation regulates many interactions at the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lara-Gonzalez and Taylor, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). In a few well-characterized cases, phosphorylation negatively regulates protein interactions at the kinetochore (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeLuca et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meadows et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rosenberg et al., 2011</xref>). The kinase activity of Mps1, on the other hand, has a positive role in the recruitment of other checkpoint proteins to the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lara-Gonzalez and Taylor, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). The recent discovery that MELT<sup>P</sup> motifs are required for the recruitment of the Bub1–Bub3 complex represented an important advancement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we have taken a considerable step forward by identifying Bub3 as the MELT<sup>P</sup> reader and by probing its importance for checkpoint signaling.</p><p>Specifically, ours is the first detailed mechanistic description of how the phosphorylation of a kinetochore subunit promotes recruitment of downstream elements. Our studies identify Bub3 as a new member of a family of protein domains involved in the recognition of phosphorylated sequence motifs, which includes, among others, the SH2, PTB, BRCT, FHA and polo-box domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pawson and Kofler, 2009</xref>). Interestingly, the structure of the complex of the GLEBS motif of the nucleoporin and proto-oncogene Nup98 with the WD40-repeat nuclear transport factor Rae1/Gle2 (PDB ID 3MMY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2010</xref>) is very closely related to that of the Bub3–Bub1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most of the residues involved in MELT<sup>P</sup> binding on Bub3 are perfectly conserved in Rae1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), where they form a hydrophobic-basic bipartite interface that is almost indistinguishable from that in Bub3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ren et al., 2010</xref>). The striking conservation at this interface, and our realization that the interface is implicated in MELT<sup>P</sup> binding, suggests that Rae1, or possibly its complex with Nup98, might also be a receptor for phosphorylated motifs.</p><p>The kinetochore levels of SAC proteins are dynamically regulated during the process of attachment of kinetochores to microtubules, with maximal levels being reached at unattached kinetochores and minimal levels being reached at metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foley and Kapoor, 2013</xref>). It is plausible that such dynamic behavior reflects a requirement for specific steps of activation and inactivation of the checkpoint proteins at kinetochores in response to the status of kinetochore-microtubule attachment. For instance, forced retention of the Mad1-Mad2 ‘template’ complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Antoni et al., 2005</xref>) at kinetochores results in a protracted checkpoint-dependent arrest despite all chromosomes being bipolarly aligned at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gassmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Maldonado and Kapoor, 2011</xref>), indicating that removal of Mad1-Mad2—which is normally mediated by the Dynein-Spindly complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yamamoto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barisic et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gassmann et al., 2010</xref>)—is necessary for the inactivation of the checkpoint signal before anaphase.</p><p>The importance of kinetochore recruitment of Bub1–Bub3 in the spindle checkpoint, on the other hand, has been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vanoosthuyse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Windecker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, however, it was shown that mutation of the phosphorylated Thr residue in the MELT repeats of Spc105/Knl1 prevents kinetochore recruitment of Bub1–Bub3 and results in a checkpoint defect in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">London et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shepperd et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yamagishi et al., 2012</xref>). Formally, checkpoint deficiency in the presence of mutants that prevent the phospohorylation of the MELT motifs might be due to the impaired binding of MELT<sup>P</sup>-binding proteins other than Bub1–Bub3. In this study, we demonstrate that Bub1–Bub3 binds directly to MELT<sup>P</sup> sequences and recapitulate the checkpoint defect by mutating residues within the MELT<sup>P</sup>-binding site of Bub3 that impair its own kinetochore recruitment and that of Bub1.</p><p>Overall, these observations indicate that Bub1 localization to kinetochores is required for checkpoint function. We suspect that the recruitment of Bub1–Bub3 to Spc105/Knl1 unleashes Bub1’s role in the checkpoint. Because the kinase domain of Bub1 is not required for checkpoint signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sharp-Baker and Chen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernius and Hardwick, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ricke et al., 2012</xref>), Bub1’s role in the checkpoint is probably entirely exerted through macromolecular interactions. For instance, Bub1 is required for kinetochore recruitment of Mad1-Mad2 and of Mad3/BubR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Millband and Hardwick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rischitor et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logarinho et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klebig et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).</p><p>Mad3/BubR1 is, like Bub1, constitutively bound to Bub3. Thus, a requirement on Bub1 for kinetochore recruitment of Mad3/BubR1 is unexpected and suggests that when bound to Mad3/BubR1, Bub3 might be unable to perform an equivalent function in kinetochore recruitment to the one it performs when bound to Bub1. Indeed, our studies indicate that when bound to Bub3, Bub1 plays an important positive role in the interaction with MELT<sup>P</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>). Although the presence of a positively charged residue at position 314 is not a conserved feature of Bub1 (not shown), it is plausible that differences in the sequence of the β1-β2-loop in Bub1 and Mad3/BubR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) might account for the different behavior of Bub3 in its respective complexes.</p><p>Multisite phosphorylation is commonly used in signaling networks for its potential to generate non-linear responses to stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kapuy et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Salazar and Höfer, 2009</xref>).

Similar to Bub3, also Cdc4 and Fbw7 are WD40 β-propeller proteins, but the position and organization of the phosphopeptide binding sites in Cdc4 and Fbw7 and in Bub3 are distinct. In Cdc4 and Fbw7 (as well as in β-TrCP, another WD40 β-propeller Ub-ligase that interacts with phosphorylated motifs in target proteins) the phosphopeptide-binding site is located on the top surface of the propeller domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orlicky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2007</xref>).

This suggests that each MELT<sup>P</sup> sequence has the potential to act as a docking site for an individual Bub1–Bub3 complex and that multiple Bub1–Bub3 complexes may bind to Spc105/Knl1 concomitantly if multiple phosphorylated MELT repeats are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Understanding how variations in the levels of phosphorylation of MELT motifs reflect on the strength of the checkpoint response is a crucial question for future studies.</p><p>The high affinity of the Bub1–Bub3 complex for MELT<sup>P</sup> sequences might explain why Bub1 is quite stably bound to kinetochores during checkpoint activation, as shown by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Howell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that additional interactions of the Bub1–Bub3 complex with Spc105/Knl1 or other checkpoint components at the kinetochore further increase the binding affinity of the Bub1–Bub3 complex for kinetochores.

To elute the Bub1–Bub3 complex from beads, GST-PreScission protease (0.02 mg/mg of protein target) was added for 16 hr at 4°C. The eluate was concentrated on Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters MwCO 3000 (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA) and further purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a Superdex 75 16/60 column using GF buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTE). The complex eluted in a single peak with apparently stoichiometric amounts of Bub1<sup>289–359</sup> and Bub3 and was subsequently concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml for crystallization or to 2–4 mg/ml for ITC experiments. The MELT2<sup>P</sup> (sequence DPTSMEM{PTHR}EVFPRSIRQKN), MELT2 (DPTSMEMTEVFPRSIRQKN), MELT4<sup>P</sup> (DTVEGEPIDL{PTHR}EYESKPYVPN), and MELT4 (DTVEGEPIDLTEYESKPYVPN) peptides (95% purity) were custom made by GeneScript (Piscataway, NJ).

In each titration, the Bub1<sup>289–359</sup>–Bub3 in the cell (at a 30 µM concentration) was titrated with thirty-five 2-µl injections (at 90 s intervals) of the indicated synthetic MELT<sup>P</sup> peptides (at a concentration of 400 µM). The injections were continued beyond saturation levels to allow for determination of heats of ligand dilution.

Initial crystals were obtained with the G9 condition of Qiagen (Venlo, The Netherlands) PACT Suite screen (0.2 M K/Na tartrate, 0.1 M Bis Tris propane pH 7.5, 20% PEG 3350) and did not require further optimization. The crystals grew to a typical size of ∼50 µm in each direction. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the PXII–X10SA beamline at the Swiss Light Source (SLS) (Villigen, Switzerland) and processed using XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). Due to anisotropic diffraction, the data were subject to anisotropy correction using the UCLA diffraction anisotropy server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strong et al., 2006</xref>). Model refinement against the corrected data resulted in final maps of significantly better quality compared to maps obtained with uncorrected data. Initial phases were obtained by the molecular replacement method, which was carried out using the program PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) and the structure of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Bub3–Bub1 (PDB ID 2I3S) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Larsen et al., 2007</xref>) as a search model.

The final model contains two Bub3 monomers (including residues 1–223 and 233–340 in chain A and residues 1–223 and 234–340 for chain D), two Bub1 fragments (including residues 302–311 and 314–347 for chain B and residues 309–347 for chain E), and two Spc105/Knl1 MELT<sup>P</sup> peptides (including residues 165–176 in chain C and residues 166–177 in chain F). Simulated annealing composite omit maps were produced using phenix.autobuild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Terwilliger et al., 2008</xref>).

For the segmentation and tracking of yeast cells, we used the program ‘phyloCell’, written by Gilles Charvin (unpublished results). To quantify the localization of proteins, we focused on the brightest pixels within each segmented area (i.e., within each cell). We observed that the area where the brightest pixels are typically localized amounts to roughly 1% of the area of the whole cell. Therefore, to compute an index for localization, we calculated the average of the brightest 1% of pixels. The value of this average depends on properties of the overall intensity distribution. When confronting two Gaussian distributions of pixel intensities, it is expected that the value of the average of the brightest intensity will be higher for the distribution whose mean intensity is higher or alternatively, for distributions with similar mean intensity, for the distribution whose standard deviation is higher. To correct for these factors, we used the following measure to quantify localization:</p><p>Localization index = ((average 1% brightest pixels) − mean)/std</p><p>This definition allows us to distinguish quantitatively between localization and delocalization. In case of perfect delocalization, the overall intensity will adopt a gaussian distribution, and in this case our measure of localization adopts a value of ∼3.7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> for an example of overall intensity distribution when the protein is delocalized and for the corresponding localization index). When the protein is kinetochore-localized (as shown by co-localization with Mtw1), the distribution is skewed-Gaussian, with a more extended right tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref> for an example of overall intensity distribution when the protein is kinetochore localized and for the corresponding localization index). In this case, our measure for localization is larger than ∼3.7. When the localization index assumes values that are significantly higher than ∼3.7, we observed the fluorescent protein to be localized to kinetochores, as confirmed by co-localization with Mtw1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The four plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C–E</xref> report the distribution of maxima (C), minima (D), and standard deviation (E) of the localization index of Bub3<sup>wt</sup>-mCherry or Bub<sup>3R217A-R239A</sup>-mCherry over an entire cell cycle (i.e., the time between two budding events). For Bub3<sup>wt</sup>-mCherry, we measured 55 cycles in 37 cells. For Bub<sup>3R217A–R239A</sup>-mCherry, we measured 45 cycles in 38 cells. The distribution of minima of the localization index is similar for the two Bub3 species, corresponding to delocalization. Wild type and mutant, however, differ clearly for the distribution of maxima, where the wild type only shows localization (i.e., localization index &gt;3.7). The higher amplitude of the localization index in wild types gives rise to a larger standard deviation of the localization index when compared to the wild type (C).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Jonathan Millar, Andrew Murray, Veronica Krenn, Katharina Overlack and Clauda Breit for critical reading of the manuscript and to members of the Musacchio laboratory for helpful discussions.

the approval of the authors). An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elife.elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>).

We have carried out an additional calorimetry experiment with the Bub1<sup>R314A</sup> mutant. In agreement with the hypothesis that this residue contributes to recognition of the phosphorylated MELT peptide, we find that the R314A mutant binds the MELT2<sup>P</sup> peptide with ∼3- to 4-fold reduced affinity. We have included the new ITC data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
