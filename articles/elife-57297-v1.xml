relies on specific tissue microenvironments that nurture hematopoietic precursors and promote their self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The mechanisms driving blood cell homing and their interactions with hematopoietic microenvironments remain poorly understood. Here, we use the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model to reveal a pivotal role for basement membrane composition in the formation of hematopoietic compartments. We demonstrate that by modulating extracellular matrix components, the fly blood cells known as hemocytes can be relocated to tissue surfaces where they function similarly to their natural hematopoietic environment. We establish that the Collagen XV/XVIII ortholog Multiplexin in the tissue-basement membranes and the phagocytosis receptor Eater on the hemocytes physically interact and are necessary and sufficient to induce immune cell-tissue association. These results highlight the cooperation of Multiplexin and Eater as an integral part of a homing mechanism that specifies and maintains hematopoietic sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoietic microenvironment</kwd><kwd>immune cell homing</kwd><kwd>eater</kwd><kwd>cell-matrix interaction</kwd><kwd>ECM</kwd><kwd>multiplexin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UH 243/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhlirova</surname><given-names>Mirka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 2030 - 390661388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uhlirova</surname><given-names>Mirka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The mutual interaction between the basement membrane protein Multiplexin and the phagocytosis receptor Eater expressed by the immune cells drives the formation and maintenance of the hematopoietic tissues in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the animal kingdom, the development and differentiation of immune cells is intimately linked to specific spatial compartments. These sites shelter developing immune precursors from external stimuli while providing signals to orchestrate their self-renewal, proliferation and differentiation. During mammalian embryonic development, the hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) relocate to the fetal liver where they considerably expand in number, before they populate the spleen and the bone marrow in late embryonic stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Postnatally, transplanted HSCs primarily seed the hematopoietic niches within the bone marrow by recognizing specific signals on the endothelial cells of the blood vessels, and undergoing trans-endothelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birbrair and Frenette, 2016</xref>). In the bone marrow, the HSCs attach to endosteal cells, which together form the endosteal HSC niche capable of renewing the entire blood cell pool throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Birbrair and Frenette, 2016</xref>). Apart from various non-hematopoietic cells which guard HSC behavior, the extracellular matrix (ECM) has been recognized as an essential component of hematopoietic stem cell niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klamer and Voermans, 2014</xref>). The ECM provides a structured microenvironment to the niche and connects to HSCs through integrin-mediated adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gattazzo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khurana et al., 2016</xref>). In turn, this mechanosensitive signal feeds back on the stem cells to regulate their proliferative capacity or differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choi and Harley, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2013</xref>). Although mounting evidence points to the requirement for the ECM in the homeostatic maintenance of the HSC population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Klamer and Voermans, 2014</xref>), it remains unexplored if ECM alters the behavior of immune precursors solely by conveying mechanical signals or whether there are receptor-ligand interactions that depend on the recognition of specific ECM components which trigger activation of discrete signaling pathways. Furthermore, it remains to be uncovered whether the presence of particular ECM proteins on niche surfaces alone can provoke the adhesion and expansion of the immune cells.</p><p>In recent years, the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> emerged as an excellent model to study the dynamics of hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>). Similar to mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells, called hemocytes, are present from early embryonic stages, and reside in specific hematopoietic sites during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Martinez-Agosto et al., 2007</xref>). In the larval stages, hemocytes form three hematopoietic tissues: the circulation, the lymph gland and the sessile hematopoietic pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Honti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>). The circulation comprises mostly macrophage-like cells (plasmatocytes) and crystal cells, which participate in the melanization of encapsulated foreign objects (e.g. parasitic wasp eggs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). These capsules are largely formed by a third type of hemocytes, the lamellocytes, which are not present under homeostatic conditions, but rapidly differentiate upon immune challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). Unlike the freely moving cells in the circulation, the lymph gland is a compact multi-lobe hematopoietic organ on the anterior end of the dorsal vessel, where immune cell precursors differentiate into plasmatocytes and crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jung, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krzemien et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the lymph gland-derived hemocytes enter the circulation only during pupariation or upon immune challenge such as parasitic attack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>). The sessile hematopoietic pockets are located segmentally along the length of the larva in lateral and dorsal patches contained within epidermis and muscle tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>). The sessile tissue is primarily composed of plasmatocytes, some of which undergo trans-differentiation into crystal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leitão and Sucena, 2015</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the formation of sessile hematopoietic pockets is orchestrated by sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that not only attract hemocytes but also support their survival and proliferation in situ by secreting Activin-β, a ligand of the TGF-β family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makhijani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, plasmatocytes require the cell-autonomous expression of Eater, a phagocytosis receptor of the Nimrod family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocks et al., 2005</xref>), to maintain their attachment to sessile pockets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melcarne et al., 2019</xref>). The molecular counterpart of Eater on the body wall remains yet unknown. While these mechanisms anchor the immune cells to the epidermis, they do not isolate them, as there is a continuous exchange between circulating and sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, in response to various stress insults sessile hemocytes can be rapidly mobilized and enter circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>), while reestablishing the stereotypical pattern of hematopoietic pockets when the challenge ceases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>), highlighting the dynamic nature of the sessile hematopoietic compartment as well as a requirement for homing cues and adhesive surfaces.</p><p>Since the sessile hematopoietic pockets are formed in gaps between the larval epidermis and the body wall muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>), the immune cells are in intimate contact with the basement membranes covering these surfaces. In fact, hemocytes can relocate to other tissues with pathologically altered ECM composition and/or structure, such as imaginal discs or salivary glands with damaged basement membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Casas-Tintó et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pastor-Pareja et al., 2008</xref>), tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cordero et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kulshammer and Uhlirova, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pérez et al., 2017</xref>) or fibrotic adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zang et al., 2015</xref>). As a mechanism to cope with such insults and to participate in developmental tissue remodeling, hemocytes secrete ECM proteins, such as Laminins or Collagen IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Töpfer et al., 2019</xref>), as well as ECM processing enzymes or assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martinek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nelson et al., 1994</xref>). However, only little is known about the physical interaction between hemocytes and ECM under either pathological or homeostatic conditions.</p><p>Here, we show that the hemocyte-basement membrane interaction is crucial to the formation of the sessile hematopoietic pockets. We demonstrate that the sessile hemocytes require the interaction of the phagocytosis receptor Eater and the Collagen XV/XVIII ortholog Multiplexin in the epidermal basement membrane to maintain their association with the body wall. Importantly, by manipulating the basement membrane composition hemocytes can be redirected to other tissue surfaces, where they function similarly as they do in the sessile pockets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Increased Atf3 levels induce hemocyte attachment to the fat body</title><p>The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain protein, Activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3), has been defined as a stress-response gene pivotal to the maintenance of immune and metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakrabarti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilchrist et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jadhav and Zhang, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rynes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zmuda et al., 2010</xref>), but has also been implicated in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics and vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boespflug et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donohoe et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). We have reported previously that the fat body-specific overexpression of Atf3 under the <italic>C7-GAL4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koyama and Mirth, 2016</xref>) (hereafter abbreviated as <italic>C7&gt;Atf3<sup>WT</sup></italic>) induced a lean phenotype and decreased lipid droplet size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rynes et al., 2012</xref>).

The fat body-associated hemocytes (hereafter referred to as FBAHs) present in <italic>Hml:DsRed, C7&gt;Atf3</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> larvae were densely packed and often formed contiguous monolayers over the entire length of the adipose tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, the characteristic pattern of sessile hematopoietic pockets observed in controls was disrupted in <italic>Hml:DsRed, C7&gt;Atf3<sup>WT</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), while the amount of circulating hemocytes was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Importantly, we found that hemocytes also associated with clones of Atf3 overexpressing adipocytes induced by the heat shock FLPout (hsFLPout) technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that the attachment is an intrinsic property of the fat body cells with excessive Atf3 levels rather than a consequence of the systemic activation of blood cells. In support of this notion, neither the uptake of GFP-positive material originating from the fat body was observed in the hemocytes, nor signs of an encapsulation reaction, such as adhesion of lamellocytes or tissue melanization, were present in the case of <italic>C7&gt;Atf3<sup>WT</sup></italic> fat bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adipose tissue-specific Atf3 overexpression redirects hemocytes to the fat body surface.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Sessile hemocytes present in control larvae as segmental stripes (<bold>A</bold>) are redirected to the surface of the fat body overexpressing Atf3 (<bold>B</bold>).

In this study, we employed the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> model to gain a mechanistic understanding of how hematopoietic microenvironments arise. We show that Atf3 overexpression in adipocytes promotes the formation of a de novo hematopoietic compartment on the adipose tissue surface at the expense of the naturally occurring sessile hematopoietic cell pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). The fat body-associated hemocytes showed round/spherical morphology, and projected short filopodia and lamellipodia, which are characteristic to the sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and hemocytes adhering to Laminin-coated substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sampson and Williams, 2012</xref>), but are distinct from the elongated phenotype of the migratory embryonic macrophages and the pupal hemocytes assisting tissue remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Evans and Wood, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sampson et al., 2013</xref>). The characteristic morphology and the absence of tissue debris-phagocytosis and encapsulation response suggest that FBAHs are in a naïve homeostatic state, not engaged in immune response. Moreover, similar to unchallenged sessile hemocytes, FBAHs proliferate and differentiate in situ on the adipose tissue surface. Although hemocytes also proliferate in the circulation, the division rate of those in the sessile pockets was shown to be higher due to the stimulating effects of Activin-β secreted by peripheral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Makhijani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>). Since the fat body lacks the innervation of the epidermal cells, the proliferation of FBAHs may be part of a hemocyte-autonomous developmental program, which is supported by the physical adhesion to the tissue and cell-cell contacts between attached hemocytes. Such contacts appear instrumental in the trans-differentiation of plasmatocytes to crystal cells in the sessile pockets, which requires Serrate-Notch juxtacrine signaling among the clustered cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leitão and Sucena, 2015</xref>). Similarly, FBAH clusters contained fully and partially differentiated crystal cells intermingled with the hemocytes, which suggests that plasmatocyte-crystal cell trans-differentiation is cluster-dependent and does not require signals secreted by peripheral neurons.</p><p>Importantly, the simultaneous appearance of the FBAHs and a decline of the sessile hemocytes did not significantly impact the amount of circulating blood cells. This may indicate that FBAHs are dynamic, entering and leaving the circulation at a comparable rate to sessile hemocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Honti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Welman et al., 2010</xref>). The dynamic nature of FBAHs is further underlined by the fact that they detached after parasitic wasp infestation, mimicking the described behavior of the sessile population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The analysis of FBAHs provided us with an avenue to explore the mechanistic underpinnings of hemocyte-tissue interactions, and highlighted the importance of basement membrane proteins in the formation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic tissues. We identified Mp, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of Collagens XV/XVIII as a necessary ECM protein for hemocyte attachment to tissue surfaces. We show that Mp loss not only blocked hemocyte attachment to the Atf3 overexpressing fat body, but also restored the integrity of the sessile pockets, while its epidermal knockdown caused sessile tissue disintegration. It is important to note that the formation of FBAHs, but not the sessile hematopoietic pockets, was abolished also by inhibiting Col4a1 and Trol. While these ECM components may directly facilitate hemocyte attachment, it is more likely that they are required to form the general lattice structure of the basement membrane to which Mp anchors. Supporting this argument, when ECM accumulation in the fat body was exacerbated by inhibiting SPARC, simultaneous Mp loss abolished FBAH clusters without restoring the fat body integrity. Thus, unlike the ubiquitously present ECM components Collagen IV, Laminins or Trol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pastor-Pareja and Xu, 2011</xref>) the expression of Mp is restricted to tissues where it locally incorporates into the basement membrane to facilitate cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harpaz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyer and Moussian, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we show that the clonal gain of Mp induced localized FBAH clusters very similar to those found on Atf3-expressing adipocytes, demonstrating that Mp is not only required but also sufficient to promote hemocyte adhesion. Furthermore, Mp expression in the wing pouch also attracted hemocytes to the wing disc surface, which suggests that this phenomenon is not restricted to the adipose tissue. Surprisingly, Mp overexpression in the entire fat body did not attract hemocytes. Instead, it resulted in the complete loss of the sessile population. We propose that the increased Mp levels in the hemolymph compete with the basement membrane-incorporated protein for the binding of its receptor on the hemocytes preventing their association with the epidermal or fat body ECMs. These results also suggest that both the tissue specificity and the levels of endogenous Mp expression are tightly regulated. In the context of the sessile hematopoietic pockets, this could mean that low amounts of Mp in the epidermal basement membrane are sufficient to anchor hemocytes through a specific and strong interaction between Mp and its receptor on the hemocytes.</p><p>The de novo hematopoietic tissue model and the biochemical assay from S2 cells imply that this hemocyte-specific binding partner is the scavenger receptor Eater. Although the phagocytic properties of Eater have been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung and Kocks, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melcarne et al., 2019</xref>), its requirement for the formation of hematopoietic pockets was only recently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bretscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Melcarne et al., 2019</xref>). We find that Eater is not only essential to maintain the sessile hemocytes but also needed for FBAH formation, further underlining the idea of common hemocyte attachment mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the mammalian counterpart of Mp, Collagen XV is restricted to the cardiac and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hägg et al., 1997</xref>) while its other ortholog Collagen XVIII is ubiquitously expressed throughout development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miosge et al., 2003</xref>). Both ColXV and ColXVIII undergo a multitude of posttranslational modifications, which include the addition of chondroitin- or heparan-sulfate side-chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dong et al., 2003</xref>), and extensive protein cleavage which produces Endostatin, an anti-angiogenic peptide that is widely studied because of its link to cell migration, proliferation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">O'Reilly et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Walia et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, Mp was found to be modified by Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, and the overexpression of its N- and C-terminal domains had distinct effects on the motoaxon guidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyer and Moussian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Momota et al., 2011</xref>). The hemocyte-specific counterpart of Mp, Eater, on the other hand, is a member of the Nimrod superfamily of transmembrane phagocytosis receptors that contain multiple EGF-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kocks et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Somogyi et al., 2008</xref>).

Since Mp is extensively processed upon its secretion to the extracellular space, it is tempting to speculate that its interaction with Eater may be due to particular posttranslational modifications, such as chondroitin sulfate addition or proteolytic cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meyer and Moussian, 2009</xref>;

However, the number of fat body cells per one image could be variable depending on the size of the fat body, dissecting methods or imaging and so on. For example, the mean value shown in Figure 1E is different from Figure 2I even though these data represent the same genotype. It will be important to deliberate on the precise quantitation method for the FBAH phenotype as it is one of the most important findings described in the manuscript.</p><p>1.2) The control shown in Figure 1E is identical to the one shown in Figure 2I and Figure 3—figure supplement 2E. It will be essential to ALWAYS repeat relative controls side by side with associating experiments.</p><p>1.3) Figure 2J-K', the number of lamellocytes and the percentage of melanotic capsule formation need to be quantified.</p><p>1.4) In the same vein, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-K' requires proper quantitation with enough biological replicates (n) to draw a conclusion.</p><p>1.5) Figure 1A-B, Figure 3G-H, Figure 4A,G,H, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-F, Figure 5C-D: authors have shown the relocation of sessile hemocytes. Again, it is one of the main phenotypes shown in the paper; however, none of these are quantitated. The patterns of sessile hemocytes are quite variable even amongst controls. Therefore, authors need to quantify the phenotype with their own measure and with enough sample size.</p><p>1.6) In Figure 4D-E': though it has been shown in the previous study that eater is essential for the hemocyte homing and that eater is primarily expressed in hemocytes, C7-gal4, hml-gal4 (dual gal4) is a different genetic background and can cross-react. Therefore, additional controls (C7-gal4, hml-gal4/+, C7-gal4, hml-gal4; eater RNAi) are required at least to be represented as quantitation data.</p><p>2) It is not clear whether the overall hemocyte number (or hemocyte development) is changed upon Atf3_WT or Mp::GFP expression, which may, in turn, modify the circulating or sessile hemocyte population.</p><p>2.1) Figure 2C: To claim whether the epidermal sites are more supportive of the proliferation of hemocytes than those in the fat body, the ratio of mitotic cells needs to be quantified as shown in Makhijani et al., 2017. And without showing the number of total hemocytes, it is hard to understand which site is more prominent in the proliferation and differentiation of hemocytes.</p><p>2.2) The total number of hemocytes together with circulating hemocytes needs to be shown in Atf3_wt or Mp::GFP expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 5E). Moreover, the number of circulating and total hemocytes in Atf3_WT; MpRNAi rescue background should be indicated.</p><p>3) In Figure 2E-E', it is not clear whether crystal cells express high levels of NimC1 in the images as NimC1-positive membranes are anyway juxtaposed. It will be great to have a bleeding of FABH or high mag of crystal cells with better resolution.</p><p>4) Though authors have shown that FBAHs are relocated to the circulation upon wasp parasitism, these data are not sufficient to conclude that the fat body FBAH follows the identical hematopoietic program to sessile blood cells. It is possible that FBAHs relocation is less frequent than regular sessile hemocytes found in the epidermis/neuron due to the tight association. It will be important to show whether FBAHs can be reattached after physical disturbances as shown in Makhijani et al., 2011.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This very well written and interesting manuscript addresses the clinically relevant question of what molecules drive immune cells' interaction with environments that promote their proliferation and differentiation. The authors use the basic system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and provide convincing evidence that an ECM component, Multiplexin, is necessary for the recruitment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells (hemocytes) to the previously identified hematopoietic pockets and for their recruitment to a new position on the fat body where they are can divide and differentiate as they do in the native environment. They define the phagocytosis receptor Eater, which has previously been found to be crucial for hemocyte localization to the hematopoietic pockets, as the partner in mediating hemocyte binding to Multiplexin in both locations. I think this work is exciting and mostly well conducted and deserves to be published in <italic>ELife</italic>, with some alteration of the text to reflect that some of the current conclusions require a modest amount of new data and analysis.</p><p>1) The paper in places implies that Multiplexin is capable of redirecting hemocytes to a new location in which they can function as in the hematopoietic pocket. This finding would be extremely exciting if true. But though the authors show relocalization to the fat body in the experiment in which they induce clones of Mp (Figure 5G-H), they do not assess the division and differentiation capacity of the hemocytes there. Thus Atf3 expression may induce other changes in the adipocytes than just Mp expression to allow Fat Body associated hemocytes (FBAH) to divide and differentiate there (as seen in Figure 2C-F); Mp may thus be required for hemocyte adhesion yet not sufficient to induce all niche dependent functions. To address sufficiency for proliferation the authors could do a pH3 staining upon the induction of clones in strains they already have (those used in Figure 5G-H). To address sufficiency for differentiation, they could put one copy of Bc1 into that background.</p><p>Alternatively they should alter the paper to make clearer that they have not explicitly investigated if or shown that the ECM component, Mp, drives hematopoiesis in the Title, the Abstract, the Introduction, the Discussion section (specifically &quot;indistinguishable&quot;).</p><p>2) They conduct experiments to assess the importance of Mp for attachment to the endogenous sessile niches. Their conclusion (subsection “Similar mechanisms drive sessile hematopoietic pocket formation and FBAH adhesion”) that the knockdown of Mp by RNAi produces a phenotype strikingly resembling that seen in the eater1 mutant (and thus that Mp is required for all attachment to endogenous hematopoetic environments) doesn't seem supported by the comparison of Figure panels 4A' to 4H'. While the dorsal patches seem to be gone in the Mp knockdown, it appears as if there is still a repeated hemocyte pattern on the lateral sides in the larvae shown. Having a close up of the lateral and dorsal niches for these genotypes instead of the GFP channel (whose relevance as a marker of the driver pattern is also not explained in the figure legends) would clarify this issue. It is clear there is a strongly reduced attachment in the absence of Mp, but if this the same in all the different endogenous hematopoetic locations is important to determine. Given that Mp has been reported to be expressed in the heart tube, next to where the dorsal patches are, and not to my knowledge near the PNS, which flanks the lateral ones, would fit with there being a variable effect in the different regions. This Figure has no quantitation, which also weakens this conclusion. If they do not have the data in hand to make the new figure/ do the quantitation, then they should soften the conclusion that this is the same as the eater1 phenotype and address textually that the effect on the lateral patches has not been rigorously assessed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I believe this is a great paper, with exciting science, but I find it unnecessarily difficult to read and to assess critically. I was easily distracted while reading it and I may have missed important points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Conceptually, it would be helpful to give the reasons for choosing to overexpress Atf3 in the fat body. I would also like to see more background information about this transcription factor in the Introduction.</p><p>2) I also miss a discussion about the possible physiological role of the system described here. Is Atf3 also involved in defining hemocyte docking sites elsewhere? Or should I regard Atf3 overexpression as an artificial but useful experimental system for the study of hematopoiesis?</p><p>3) In general, the figure legends give little or no information about the experiments shown. Instead they merely describe what conclusions I am expected draw, something that is anyway already explained in the text. There are many examples:</p><p>a) In Figure 1, the reader has to guess how the different colors are generated. I assume that the green color comes from a UAS-GFP construct, driven by the C7 fat body-specific driver. An Hml:DsRed construct is apparently also involved. It should give red fluorescence to plasmatocytes. Apparently, that this has been converted to the &quot;magenta&quot; color, here labeled &quot;Hemocyte&quot; (I comment the &quot;amber&quot;-colored hemocytes below). Similar difficulties complicate interpretations in other figures too.</p><p>b) The units on y-axes are sometimes unclear. Does &quot;Number of FBAHs&quot; (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) refer to the number per unit area as defined in Figure 1—figure supplement 1? And what is &quot;Circulating hemocytes (F.C.)&quot; in Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5?</p><p>c) If &quot;Hemese&quot; (in Figure 2 and Figure 5) refers to antibody staining, for general visualization of hemocytes, then say so.</p><p>d) What is &quot;myr-RFP&quot; (Figure 3A and B), and what does it signify?</p><p>I will stop giving examples here, but my progress through the manuscript was slowed down dramatically by the fact that I constantly had to make guesses about what I could see in the figures.</p><p>4) How was the &quot;amber&quot;-coloring of hemocytes generated in Figure 1B (and elsewhere)? The text in the Materials and methods section seems to indicate that these cells were simply enhanced in this way via Photoshopping. That does give a striking effect, but is not valid evidence that these cells are attached to the fat body.</p><p>5) On a similar note, the intracellular vacuoles in Figure 3F are colored &quot;cyan&quot;, presumably by Photoshop, to generate the impression that they are contiguous with the similarly colored &quot;pericellular&quot; space under the basement membrane. This is a potentially dangerous way to fool the eye. Do the authors have evidence that these systems are contiguous, or that they are related in other ways? Is there evidence that the associated electron-dense material consists of extracellular matrix proteins?</p><p>6) As shown here, several extracellular matrix proteins are enriched over Atf3-expressing cells. Does that mean that the basement membrane is thickened? Zooming in on Figure 3F I get an impression that this may be the case.</p><p>7) I find no information about how the Atf3 clones were generated for Figure 1F, and very rudimentary information about the clones in Figure 3 and Figure 5.</p><p>8) The magnification and resolution is not sufficient to show the filopodia and lamellipodia in Figure 2A, 2B, Figure 5G and 5H, even when I print out these figures over entire pages. They are even difficult to see when I zoom them in on the computer.</p><p>9) Has the C7 driver ever been described? The authors refer to a previous article from the same lab (Rynes et al., 2012), where I only find a reference back to a paper by Grönke et al., (2003). However, C7 is not mentioned there. How specific is the C7 driver, and why is it used?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Eater cooperates with Multiplexin to drive the formation of hematopoietic compartments&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The manuscript provides evidence on a key role of Multiplexin in the formation of these clusters, which, as this manuscript and previous work shows, are important sites for hemocyte proliferation and probably also differentiation. The reviewers in the first round of assessment have pointed out valid concerns regarding the manuscript and, in my opinion, the authors have done a good job addressing these concerns. I have only few remaining points/questions for the authors.</p><p>On some occasions, the number of animals tested seem quite low, especially when <italic>Drosophila</italic> material is not exactly scarce. However, I don't see this as a decisive problem in this study, one reason being that differences between controls and experimental crosses are in general quite clear. Also, multiple experiments conducted back each other up. However, could authors provide more detailed information on how experiments were replicated? Specifically, were the animals studied from the progeny of one cross/the same patch of crosses or were experiments replicated temporally? This could be clarified in the Materials and methods section since it helps in assessing the reproducibility of the results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57297.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Uhlirova and colleagues have reported a critical role for basement membrane proteins in the recruitment of hemocytes in the fat body.

The area of the fat body assessed throughout the study and across the different genotypes was specifically selected because of its flat surface and absence of additional tissues that can associate with this organ (such as salivary gland in the anterior part or the gonads or tracheae at the posterior end). Furthermore, while structural variances could indeed be observed in response to manipulating various genes, such as <italic>SPARC</italic> or <italic>vkg</italic>, the overall size of the adipose tissue was not noticeably affected by co-expression of additional transgenes with <italic>UAS-Atf3WT</italic>.</p><p>Regarding the differences in FBAHs numbers in Figure 1E and Figure 2I, we consider different food composition as an important and likely source of variability in the number of FBAHs between the two datasets mentioned.

Therefore, additional controls (C7-gal4, hml-gal4/+, C7-gal4, hml-gal4; eater RNAi) are required at least to be represented as quantitation data.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed quantifications comparing <italic>C7&gt;Hml&gt;Atf3WT</italic> and <italic>C7&gt;Hml&gt;Atf3WTeaterRNAi</italic> and included the results in the manuscript and in Figure 4H-J.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is not clear whether the overall hemocyte number (or hemocyte development) is changed upon Atf3_WT or Mp::GFP expression, which may, in turn, modify the circulating or sessile hemocyte population.</p><p>2.1) Figure 2C: To claim whether the epidermal sites are more supportive of the proliferation of hemocytes than those in the fat body, the ratio of mitotic cells needs to be quantified as shown in Makhijani et al., 2017.

Our intention was to determine the behavior of hemocytes on the fat body surface, and the phenomena of hemocyte proliferation and plasmatocyte-crystal cell trans-differentiation are indicative of an unchallenged, homeostatic hemocyte developmental program.</p><p>Furthermore, we indicate in the Discussion section that differences likely exist between FBAHs and sessile hemocytes, but the mechanistic basis of their attachment is conserved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) The total number of hemocytes together with circulating hemocytes needs to be shown in Atf3_wt or Mp::GFP expression (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, Figure 5E). Moreover, the number of circulating and total hemocytes in Atf3_WT; MpRNAi rescue background should be indicated.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments combining <italic>Atf3WT</italic> and <italic>MpRNAi</italic> expression in the fat body were aimed to show that on one hand the hemocyte attachment to the fat body is dependent on Mp, and on the other hand, when hemocytes cannot attach to the adipose tissue the pattern of the sessile hematopoietic compartment is restored, for which we now include additional data in Figure 3L-O. We would also like to note that the comparison of total hemocyte numbers using the methods from Petraki et al., 2015 may not reflect the accurate values, as those are optimized for circulating and sessile cells, and not hemocytes attached to the internal organs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 2E-E', it is not clear whether crystal cells express high levels of NimC1 in the images as NimC1-positive membranes are anyway juxtaposed.

It is possible that FBAHs relocation is less frequent than regular sessile hemocytes found in the epidermis/neuron due to the tight association. It will be important to show whether FBAHs can be reattached after physical disturbances as shown in Makhijani et al., 2011.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to suggest that FBAHs and sessile hemocytes behave “identically”, rather that tissue/fat bodyattached hemocytes seem to behave in a similar fashion. To reflect this more accurately, we changed the wording of the manuscript. On a second note, similarly to Essential revisions 2.2, the physical mobilization assay described in Makhijani et al., 2011 was specifically created to release sessile hemocytes which adhere to the epidermis and are sensitive to external force (e.g. brush strokes, vortexing). FBAHs on the other hand are on the surface of the adipose tissue, which is floating in the hemolymph, and are therefore much less prone to these insults.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This very well written and interesting manuscript addresses the clinically relevant question of what molecules drive immune cells' interaction with environments that promote their proliferation and differentiation. The authors use the basic system of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and provide convincing evidence that an ECM component, Multiplexin, is necessary for the recruitment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells (hemocytes) to the previously identified hematopoietic pockets and for their recruitment to a new position on the fat body where they are can divide and differentiate as they do in the native environment. They define the phagocytosis receptor Eater, which has previously been found to be crucial for hemocyte localization to the hematopoietic pockets, as the partner in mediating hemocyte binding to Multiplexin in both locations. I think this work is exciting and mostly well conducted and deserves to be published in ELife, with some alteration of the text to reflect that some of the current conclusions require a modest amount of new data and analysis.</p><p>1) The paper in places implies that Multiplexin is capable of redirecting hemocytes to a new location in which they can function as in the hematopoietic pocket. This finding would be extremely exciting if true. But though the authors show relocalization to the fat body in the experiment in which they induce clones of Mp (Figure 5G-H), they do not assess the division and differentiation capacity of the hemocytes there. Thus Atf3 expression may induce other changes in the adipocytes than just Mp expression to allow Fat Body associated hemocytes (FBAH) to divide and differentiate there (as seen in Figure 2C-F); Mp may thus be required for hemocyte adhesion yet not sufficient to induce all niche dependent functions. To address sufficiency for proliferation the authors could do a pH3 staining upon the induction of clones in strains they already have (those used in Figure 5G-H). To address sufficiency for differentiation, they could put one copy of Bc1 into that background.</p><p>Alternatively they should alter the paper to make clearer that they have not explicitly investigated if or shown that the ECM component, Mp, drives hematopoiesis in the Title, the Abstract, the Introduction, the Discussion section (specifically &quot;indistinguishable&quot;).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include experiments demonstrating the cell proliferation as well the presence of crystal cells among hemocytes attached to Mp::GFP overexpressing fat body clones (Figure 6C-E). We would like to add that while hemocyte division does take place in the clusters attached to the Mp::GFP clonal cells, the amount of attached hemocytes and the size of the clones vary among experimental replicates making the quantification of these phenomena problematic.</p><p>Furthermore, we include new data showing that Mp::GFP overexpression in the wing imaginal disc, also causes the specific attachment of hemocytes, further strengthening the evidence for the crucial role of Mp to facilitate hemocyte-tissue association (Figure 6F-G). Additionally, we reworded the cited conclusions to more appropriately describe the phenotypes observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They conduct experiments to assess the importance of Mp for attachment to the endogenous sessile niches. Their conclusion (subsection “Similar mechanisms drive sessile hematopoietic pocket formation and FBAH adhesion”) that the knockdown of Mp by RNAi produces a phenotype strikingly resembling that seen in the eater1 mutant (and thus that Mp is required for all attachment to endogenous hematopoetic environments) doesn't seem supported by the comparison of Figure panels 4A' to 4H'. While the dorsal patches seem to be gone in the Mp knockdown, it appears as if there is still a repeated hemocyte pattern on the lateral sides in the larvae shown. Having a close up of the lateral and dorsal niches for these genotypes instead of the GFP channel (whose relevance as a marker of the driver pattern is also not explained in the figure legends) would clarify this issue. It is clear there is a strongly reduced attachment in the absence of Mp, but if this the same in all the different endogenous hematopoetic locations is important to determine. Given that Mp has been reported to be expressed in the heart tube, next to where the dorsal patches are, and not to my knowledge near the PNS, which flanks the lateral ones, would fit with there being a variable effect in the different regions. This Figure has no quantitation, which also weakens this conclusion. If they do not have the data in hand to make the new figure/ do the quantitation, then they should soften the conclusion that this is the same as the eater1 phenotype and address textually that the effect on the lateral patches has not been rigorously assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments showing the disruption of the sessile compartment are now complemented with additional images, showing closeups of the dorsal and lateral patches (Figure 4N-O). Additionally, to provide better representation for the sessile tissue pattern, we now include quantifications for the relevant genotypes, and compare the stereotypical sessile tissue pattern with larvae where the compartment is disrupted (Figure 4K-M). We would like to note that on the overview images, it is possible to interpret the hemocytes as “repeated hemocyte pattern”, but in reality, this is due to the immobilization (cooling the larvae) and the settling of the circulating hemocytes. Since the contractions of the dorsal vessel diminish in low temperature, the cells in the circulation can accumulate between the muscle and epidermal layers, creating the impression of a repeated pattern (Figure 4N-O).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I believe this is a great paper, with exciting science, but I find it unnecessarily difficult to read and to assess critically. I was easily distracted while reading it and I may have missed important points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Conceptually, it would be helpful to give the reasons for choosing to overexpress Atf3 in the fat body. I would also like to see more background information about this transcription factor in the Introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>See below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I also miss a discussion about the possible physiological role of the system described here. Is Atf3 also involved in defining hemocyte docking sites elsewhere? Or should I regard Atf3 overexpression as an artificial but useful experimental system for the study of hematopoiesis?</p></disp-quote><p>The use of Atf3 was based on our previous observation of the hemocyte attachment to the fat body. The overexpression of Atf3 in the fat body at high levels is indeed artificial, and our goal was to exploit this as a platform to understand the fundamental mechanisms underlying hemocyte attachment to <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues in an accessible manner. As the reviewer suggested, we now include additional background about Atf3 in the leading paragraph of the Result section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, the figure legends give little or no information about the experiments shown. Instead they merely describe what conclusions I am expected draw, something that is anyway already explained in the text. There are many examples:</p><p>a) In Figure 1, the reader has to guess how the different colors are generated. I assume that the green color comes from a UAS-GFP construct, driven by the C7 fat body-specific driver. An Hml:DsRed construct is apparently also involved. It should give red fluorescence to plasmatocytes. Apparently, that this has been converted to the &quot;magenta&quot; color, here labeled &quot;Hemocyte&quot; (I comment the &quot;amber&quot;-colored hemocytes below). Similar difficulties complicate interpretations in other figures too.</p><p>b) The units on y-axes are sometimes unclear. Does &quot;Number of FBAHs&quot; (Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) refer to the number per unit area as defined in Figure 1—figure supplement 1? And what is &quot;Circulating hemocytes (F.C.)&quot; in Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 5?</p><p>c) If &quot;Hemese&quot; (in Figure 2 and Figure 5) refers to antibody staining, for general visualization of hemocytes, then say so.</p><p>d) What is &quot;myr-RFP&quot; (Figure 3A and B), and what does it signify?</p><p>I will stop giving examples here, but my progress through the manuscript was slowed down dramatically by the fact that I constantly had to make guesses about what I could see in the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the Figure legends and the Materials and methods section considerably to facilitate reading, including the specific suggestions of the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How was the &quot;amber&quot;-coloring of hemocytes generated in Figure 1B (and elsewhere)? The text in the Materials and methods section seems to indicate that these cells were simply enhanced in this way via Photoshopping. That does give a striking effect, but is not valid evidence that these cells are attached to the fat body.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the description to the Materials and methods section. Briefly, larvae were fixed with the injection of 4% paraformaldehyde, immobilized on microscope slides and image with confocal microscope. Each individual confocal section was examined for GFP expression (fat body) and Hml:DsRed expression (hemocyte). The DsRed channel was locally recolored on each section when it was determined to overlap with the GFP signal. The attachment of the hemocytes is also demonstrated throughout the study on dissected fat bodies (e.g. Figure1—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) On a similar note, the intracellular vacuoles in Figure 3F are colored &quot;cyan&quot;, presumably by Photoshop, to generate the impression that they are contiguous with the similarly colored &quot;pericellular&quot; space under the basement membrane. This is a potentially dangerous way to fool the eye. Do the authors have evidence that these systems are contiguous, or that they are related in other ways? Is there evidence that the associated electron-dense material consists of extracellular matrix proteins?</p></disp-quote><p>We based our assessment on two previous publications, which used similar indication for the pericellular spaces, and concluded that the trapped material consists of ECM proteins. The representative Figure from Zang et al., 2015, shows the same type of distinction between pericellular spaces and cytoplasm/organelles, and points out the electron dense material as ECM protein aggregates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As shown here, several extracellular matrix proteins are enriched over Atf3-expressing cells. Does that mean that the basement membrane is thickened? Zooming in on Figure 3F I get an impression that this may be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We include a closeup image <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> to compare the two genotypes. According to our measurements in both genotypes the average thickness of the BM is 65-85 nms, which also corresponds to data published in Dai et al., 2017 (Figure S1B). What can create the impression of thicker BM is the proximity of the cytoplasm in <italic>C7&gt;Atf3WT</italic> fat bodies. In controls the pericellular space between the cell membrane and the BM is considerably wider.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Transmission electron micrographs of control (left) and Atf3 overexpressing (right) adipocytes.</title><p>Transgene and GFP expression was driven by the fat bodyspecific <italic>C7-GAL4</italic> driver.

The authors refer to a previous article from the same lab (Rynes et al., 2012), where I only find a reference back to a paper by Grönke et al., (2003). However, C7 is not mentioned there.
