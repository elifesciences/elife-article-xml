We analyzed Research Project Grant data through the end of Fiscal Year 2020, confirming worsening inequalities beginning at the time of the NIH budget doubling (1998–2003), while finding that trends in recent years have reversed for both investigators and institutions, but only to a modest degree. We also find that career-stage trends have stabilized, with equivalent proportions of early-, mid-, and late-career investigators funded from 2017 to 2020. The fraction of women among funded PIs continues to increase, but they are still not at parity. Analyses of funding inequalities show that inequalities for investigators, and to a lesser degree for institutions, have consistently been greater within groups (i.e. within groups by career stage, gender, race, and degree) than between groups.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>research funding</kwd><kwd>policy</kwd><kwd>workforce</kwd><kwd>inequality</kwd><kwd>government</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauer</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name><name><surname>Roychowdhury</surname><given-names>Deepshikha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Funding inequalities for NIH-supported research project grant investigators and organizations have increased over the past 25 years, but have modestly decreased over the past 3 years.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over the past few years, there has been increasing interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Peifer, 2017</xref>) in how the National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding support is distributed, with concern voiced by some that there may be excess concentration of support given to men and to the most well-funded late-career investigators. In a report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">National Institutes of Health, 2019</xref>) issued by an NIH Working Group to the Advisory Committee to the Director (ACD), it was noted that &quot;In biomedical science, power stems from who has access to awards. The Working Group heard repeatedly that the concentration of funding in a relatively small number of investigators (who are overwhelmingly white, cisgender, straight men) incentivizes universities to protect researchers bringing in high levels of grant funding&quot;.</p><p>Recently published literature has raised concerns regarding how NIH distributes funding support. One report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Katz and Matter, 2020</xref>) which focused on all ‘R’ grants found increasing inequality of funding support over 30 years (1985–2015). A research letter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Oliveira et al., 2019</xref>) found lower levels of support for grants in which women were identified as Principal Investigators. Other reports have documented disproportionate aging of the research workforce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blau and Weinberg, 2017</xref>) and stresses particular to mid-career investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Charette et al., 2016</xref>); these reports are concerning given evidence that there is no correlation between research stage and scientific impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sinatra et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In 2017, the NIH considered imposing a cap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lauer, 2017a</xref>) on individual-investigator research support through use of a ‘Grant Support Index or GSI’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lauer, 2017b</xref>) which classified grants according to mechanism (e.g. R01, P01, U54) rather than according to dollars. The GSI set a value of 7 for R01 grants, with lower values for ‘smaller’ mechanisms like R03 or R21 and greater values for mechanisms like P01 or U54. The proposed cap was set at 21, meaning that on average no investigator could be designated as PI on more than the equivalent of three R01 grants. The proposed cap was highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Kaiser, 2017</xref>) and was dropped in favor of a different approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Lauer et al., 2017</xref>) that targeted funds directly toward early career investigators.</p><p>Here, we present updated data on distribution of NIH support for principal investigators (‘PIs’, keeping in mind that NIH issues awards to institutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Lauer, 2018</xref>], not to individual scientists) with particular attention to career stage, gender, race, and degree. We focus on research project grants (‘RPGs’) as these comprise close to 80% of all NIH extramural research funding; we can also assess patterns that are independent of already well-known disparities for small business and non-RPG research grants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Distribution of funding to RPG PIs over time</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows different measures of funding distribution to RPG PI’s between fiscal years 1985 to 2020. These measures reflect different approaches that economists use to assess income inequality; here we use RPG funding as the analogue of income. We use three different measures:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Proportion of funds going to the top 1%, or centile, as well as to the top 10%, or decile, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Saez and Zucman, 2020</xref>) in contrast to the proportion to the bottom 50% (Panel A) or considered alone (Panel C).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Standard deviation of the log of funding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Hoffmann et al., 2020</xref>), a measure that accounts for the well-documented skewness in funding and that is particularly sensitive to low and intermediate levels of funding (Panel B).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The Theil T index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Conceição and Ferreira, 2000</xref>), a measure that is more sensitive to higher levels of funding (Panel D). Unlike other measures of inequality, the Theil Index is not intuitive. However, it can be used to parse group data, allowing us to parse inequality into <italic>within group</italic> and <italic>between group</italic> components; for example, we can see whether there is a greater degree of inequality between men and women as opposed to within cohorts of men and women.</p></list-item></list><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution of Research Project Grant (RPG) Principal Investigator (PI) Funding, Fiscal Years 1985–2020.</title><p>Panel <bold>A</bold>: Percent of RPG funds distributed to the top centile, top decile, and bottom half of investigators.

The inequalities are more striking among the most highly funded investigators (Panels C and D), where increases are noted with the NIH doubling (1998 to 2003) and in the first few years after the 2013 budget sequestration. The top 1% of investigators received 8% of RPG funds in 1998; in recent years, they received close to 10% of funds. While this may not seem like much, we should keep in mind that a difference of 2% of RPG funds means that a small group of ~300 investigators are receiving in 2020 approximately $420 million (inflation-adjusted) <italic>more</italic> than they would have received by 1998 standards. Given that the average RPG costs about $500,000, this difference is the equivalent of 800 grants. Inequalities among investigators receiving low to intermediate levels of funding followed a somewhat different trajectory, decreasing during the NIH doubling while increasing after 2013.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Characteristics of the most highly funded RPG principal investigators</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> shows characteristics of 34,936 principal investigators funded in fiscal year 2020 according to whether or not they were among the top funded centile.

We focus on income, instead of wealth, since income for most people comes from remuneration for work and therefore would be analogous to RPG funding awarded in anticipation of scientific work. At all times, income inequality has been greater in the United States. Changes in inequality have also been greater in the United States. From 1995 to 2019, the proportion of income going to the top centile of the United States population has increased from 14.3% to 18.7%, a relative increase of 31%.

Over the past few years, a time of substantial and sustained budget increases for NIH and a time of focus on early career investigators, there has been a decrease in the degree of inequality, but not quite back to the level of 2013. The RPG funding inequalities primarily reflect changes ‘at the top,’ meaning among the most highly funded investigators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Panels C and D). The top 1%’s share of RPG funding has increased from 8% before the doubling to nearly 10% now (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Panel C); this difference translates into ~$400 million, or the equivalent of 800 RPG awards. Since sequestration, the top 1% has received an increased share of funding, while the bottom 50% has received less. During the NIH doubling, both the top centile and the lower half saw increases in the proportion of funding they received (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Panels A and B).</p><p>The composition of the RPG PI workforce has evolved over time, with greater proportions of investigators who are late career, women, and Asian, and lesser proportions of MD-only degree holders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Despite steady increases in the proportion of women investigators, they are still well below parity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, Panel B). Among the groups studied, more funding goes to late career investigators, as well as to men, whites, and holders of MD degrees. Nonetheless, there is greater inequality within groups than between groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). One might argue that it may be reasonable for researchers to receive more funding at later career stages as they may have larger networks and are more experienced at posing research questions. Thus, some inequality may be considered ‘acceptable.’ But there is not funding parity for gender or race for researchers in the workforce, which are unacceptable inequalities.

responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This article by Lauer et al. provides new insights into the important problem of inequalities in grant distribution in awards from the NIH. The article highlights that differences in funding rates within a group in the areas of race and gender persist, despite active efforts over the last several years to close these gaps. It is critical to address these inequalities if there is to be continued growth in the pace of scientific discovery.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inequalities in the Distribution of National Institutes of Health Research Project Grant Funding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Deputy Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mark Peifer (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Senior Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Revised wording/clarifications to make sure conclusions better match the data.</p><p>a. Abstract. First, stating the trend toward reversing inequality has &quot;reversed&quot;, while technically accurate, implies return to the start of the analysis. In fact, there has been only a modest reversal, and inequality remains very strong. This sentence should be more nuanced, as should the following statement about career stages. Second the statement about women is very confusing. They state &quot;Women continue to constitute a greater proportion of funded principal investigators, though not at parity.&quot; When I first read this, I was thinking – no chance that women are &quot;a greater proportion&quot;, i.e., a majority of funded PIs. It would be clearer to state: &quot;The fraction of women among funded PIs continues to increase, but they are still not at parity&quot;.</p><p>b. Figure 1 should have the Y-axis go to zero, to make it clearer just how much funding is held by the top 1%.</p><p>c. P. 4. The authors should note that the age range of ALL NIH funded investigators is skewing older over time – this has been analyzed by others but is worth a mention.</p><p>d. The data in Figure 2 is very interesting, and deserves a more complete description, especially as it brings these analyses up to the current date.</p><p>e. P 10, Figure 3, the choice of data presentation and the way it was discussed significantly minimized the differences by career stage, race and gender. I imagine the majority of investigators in all groups are funded by a single grant at or near the modular level, and this is leveling differences – the mean/median difference supports this. I suspect that, and the authors have data to explore whether, the most highly funded individuals are very different between groups. What would the top decile look like for each group – their mean values suggest substantial differences? I'd like to see more in-depth analysis here. I think the authors have dug deeper, as they state &quot;Women were younger, more likely to hold a PhD degree, and less likely to be principal investigators of more than the equivalent of 4 R01 grants.&quot;, but how one would assess this last factor from the data presented is not clear.</p><p>f. The analysis of different institutions was stunning (Figures 6 and 7), and deserves some mention in the abstract and some more text talking about the nuances. I also wondered if the authors have analyzed by region of the country, as this is also an area that has attracted attention (e.g. analyses of Walls)?</p><p>2. Additional analyses</p><p>a. The analysis in Figure 1 was exceptionally interesting. A similar comparison of the top 10% to the bottom 50% is worth adding. Also, in discussing the &quot;bottom 50%&quot;, they should begin by noting the fraction of NIH-funded PIs who have a single grant (my memory suggests ~75%) and that this combined with the modular budget means most in the bottom half are quite similar in funding levels.</p><p>3. A clearer and more extensive description of some of the methods used</p><p>a. Figure 1. The authors should provide a clearer explanation of the nature of the data in panels B and D, and how to interpret it. This is true when they use the same measures later.</p><p>b. Table 1. Make clear that for most measures the parenthetical values are percentages. Then explain what the parenthetical values represent in Age and Funding – are they ranges? Define IQR.</p><p>c. Table 2. Same Adjustments as in Table 1. Additionally, are the funding levels in some sort of inflation adjusted dollars – otherwise they seem very odd.</p><p>4. The fact that there is much greater inequality within groups than between groups is interesting and some explicit discussion of what this means would be helpful. It seems that researchers receiving more funding at later career stages may be reasonable as they on average (with speculation) may have larger networks and know the research questions that could be asked better. Thus, some inequality here may be considered acceptable. But there is not funding parity for gender or race for researchers in the workforce, which are unacceptable inequalities, although these may not be as striking as the composition of the workforce and distribution of funds to the most funded investigators. How do you interpret these results collectively – which inequalities require the highest priority to address?</p><p>5. Page 13: Regarding the graphs of income inequality overall in the US and Europe: this context was appreciated, but additional interpretation in the discussion would be useful. Funding doesn't accumulate exactly like wealth can from investments, so why do you think inequalities in income and research funding are so closely associated? Could it be a coincidence?</p><p>6. Per the authors' statement, data and code should be publicly deposited upon acceptance or earlier.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71712.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Professor Tufte wrote, “In general, in a time-series, use a baseline that shows the data not the zero point. If the zero point reasonably occurs in plotting the data, fine. But don't spend a lot of empty vertical space trying to reach down to the zero point at the cost of hiding what is going on in the data line itself. (The book, How to Lie with Statistics, is wrong on this point.) For examples, all over the place, of absent zero points in time-series, take a look at any major scientific research publication. The scientists want to show their data, not zero. The urge to contextualize the data is a good one, but context does not come from empty vertical space reaching down to zero, a number which does not even occur in a good many data sets. Instead, for context, show more data horizontally!” (See https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=00003q).</p><p>Nonetheless, we did revise Figure 1, Panel A according to the reviewer’s recommendation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c.

What would the top decile look like for each group – their mean values suggest substantial differences? I'd like to see more in-depth analysis here. I think the authors have dug deeper, as they state &quot;Women were younger, more likely to hold a PhD degree, and less likely to be principal investigators of more than the equivalent of 4 R01 grants.&quot;, but how one would assess this last factor from the data presented is not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added analyses of number of RPG’s per investigator (see Tables 1-5, lines 88-90 and 105-111).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f. The analysis of different institutions was stunning (Figures 6 and 7), and deserves some mention in the abstract and some more text talking about the nuances. I also wondered if the authors have analyzed by region of the country, as this is also an area that has attracted attention (e.g. analyses of Walls)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added new Figures 8 (for region) and 9 (for states).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Additional analyses</p><p>a. The analysis in Figure 1 was exceptionally interesting. A similar comparison of the top 10% to the bottom 50% is worth adding. Also, in discussing the &quot;bottom 50%&quot;, they should begin by noting the fraction of NIH-funded PIs who have a single grant (my memory suggests ~75%) and that this combined with the modular budget means most in the bottom half are quite similar in funding levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We added data on the top decile in Figure 1, Panel A, and on the number of grants per investigator in Tables 1-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A clearer and more extensive description of some of the methods used</p><p>a. Figure 1. The authors should provide a clearer explanation of the nature of the data in panels B and D, and how to interpret it. This is true when they use the same measures later.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. We have added text (lines 58-61, 72-73).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. Table 1. Make clear that for most measures the parenthetical values are percentages. Then explain what the parenthetical values represent in Age and Funding – are they ranges? Define IQR.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and made these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. Table 2. Same Adjustments as in Table 1. Additionally, are the funding levels in some sort of inflation adjusted dollars – otherwise they seem very odd.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and made these changes. We note that dollar figures are inflation-adjusted. (See also lines 187-188).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The fact that there is much greater inequality within groups than between groups is interesting and some explicit discussion of what this means would be helpful. It seems that researchers receiving more funding at later career stages may be reasonable as they on average (with speculation) may have larger networks and know the research questions that could be asked better. Thus, some inequality here may be considered acceptable. But there is not funding parity for gender or race for researchers in the workforce, which are unacceptable inequalities, although these may not be as striking as the composition of the workforce and distribution of funds to the most funded investigators. How do you interpret these results collectively – which inequalities require the highest priority to address?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. Without wading into policy pronouncements (which would be inappropriate for this venue), we add some discussion (lines 171-177).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Page 13: Regarding the graphs of income inequality overall in the US and Europe: this context was appreciated, but additional interpretation in the discussion would be useful. Funding doesn't accumulate exactly like wealth can from investments, so why do you think inequalities in income and research funding are so closely associated? Could it be a coincidence?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added appropriate text (lines 142-144).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Per the authors' statement, data and code should be publicly deposited upon acceptance or earlier.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer.
