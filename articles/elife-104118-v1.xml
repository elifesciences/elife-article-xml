the same time. How these pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding complex natural behaviours. We investigated this question in the visually guided flight of the hummingbird hawkmoth <italic>Macroglossum stellatarum</italic>. These insects were recently shown to partition their visual field, using ventrolateral optic flow cues to guide their flight like most insects, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a novel directional response. Using behavioural experiments which set the two pathways into conflict, we tested whether and how the ventrolateral and dorsal pathway integrate to guide hawkmoth flight. Combined with environmental imaging, we demonstrate that the partitioning of the visual field followed the prevalence of visual cues in the hawkmoths’ natural habitats, while the integration hierarchy of the two pathways matched the relevance of these cues for the animals’ flight safety, rather than their magnitude in the experimental setup or in natural habitats. These results provide new mechanistic insights into the vision-based flight control of insects and link these to their natural context. We anticipate our findings to be the starting point for comparative investigations into parallel pathways for flight guidance in insects from differently structured natural habitats.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vision</kwd><kwd>natural scenes</kwd><kwd>insects</kwd><kwd>flight</kwd><kwd>optic flow</kwd><kwd>parallel processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>STO 1255 2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stöckl</surname><given-names>Anna Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>University of Konstanz</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Young Scholar Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stöckl</surname><given-names>Anna Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vision-based flight control of hummingbird hawkmoths, the visual field partitions by natural cue prevalence into an optic flow and dorsal directional pathway, which integrate according to their relevance for flight safety.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An animal’s behaviour is rarely guided just by one neural pathway or sensory modality. More often, parallel input from multiple sensory modalities supports various control systems at any given time: an insect might be following an odour plume, for example, while guiding its flight safely using visual and mechanosensory cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duistermars and Frye, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vickers and Baker, 1994</xref>). Even within the same modality, multiple pathways might act in parallel to shape the same behavioural output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fox and Frye, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frighetto and Frye, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>). How these parallel pathways are integrated, particularly when their individual outputs are in conflict, is key to understanding the complex natural behaviour of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doudlah et al., 2022</xref>). This question can be particularly well investigated in a context where the same visual stimuli evoke different responses in different parts of the visual field. Such visual field partitioning is widespread among animals and likely shaped by the frequency at which these stimuli occur in the natural habitats of the animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Insect flight control is a behaviour that strongly depends on visual information sampled across a wide receptive field. It utilises translational optic flow, the perceived relative motion of the environment generated by the animals’ own motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koenderink, 1986</xref>), to regulate the distance to the surrounding environment, and the flight speed across a wide range of insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baird et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">David, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willis and Card, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyhr and Higgins, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kennedy and Marsh, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kern et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirchner and Srinivasan, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuenen and Baker, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Portelli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grittner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stöckl et al., 2019</xref>). This regulation is thought to be achieved by keeping the perceived rate of translational optic flow at a constant level across both eyes and over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2007</xref>). In consequence, when insects encounter features that change contrast in the direction of travel, and thus generate translational optic flow, such as an array of trees or a vertically patterned wall in a flight tunnel, they slow down and keep a greater distance. Thereby, they reduce the perceived magnitude of translational optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collett, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Egelhaaf, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Srinivasan et al., 1999</xref>). Optic flow cues are also used to guide flight straightness, particularly when presented in the ventral visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Linander et al., 2017</xref>). It is thought that insects measure optic flow across their entire visual field and respond to the area with the highest magnitude of translational optic flow within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linander et al., 2015</xref>). While this assumption has rarely been tested with dorsal optic flow cues, in honeybees and fruit flies, dorsal optic flow responses similar to the ventrolateral ones have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mazo and Theobald, 2014</xref>). While fruit flies weigh ventral translational optic flow stronger than dorsal optic flow, the most extreme partitioning of the visual field in terms of optic flow-based flight control has been observed in hawkmoths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We recently described a unique example of functional visual field partitioning in the hummingbird hawkmoth <italic>Macroglossum stellatarum</italic>. This insect uses translational optic flow only in their ventral and lateral visual field for flight guidance, while the same stimuli in the dorsal visual field evoke a directional response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In this directional response, the hawkmoths orient their flight along the main axis of different types of patterns, which is reminiscent of the dorsal orientation responses of ants under tree canopies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hölldobler, 1980</xref>). Yet, the nature of the dorsal response in hawkmoths remains largely elusive, lacking a comprehensive comparison of its features with the well-described translational optic flow response.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optic flow and directional responses partition the visual field for flight control in the hummingbird hawkmoth.</title><p>Flight control in most insects is strongly based on optic flow, the apparent movement of the environment across the visual field, induced by the animals’ own movement. Ventrolateral translational optic flow supports straight flight, compared to featureless environments. Most insects keep the magnitude of translational optic flow constant across their eyes by adjusting their speed and perpendicular distance to optic flow-inducing textures. In hawkmoths, optic flow cues presented in the dorsal visual field induce directional responses, which align the hawkmoths’ flight with the main direction of the visual cue. Moreover, hawkmoths avoid any structures in the dorsal, but not the ventral, visual field, even if they generate only weak translational optic flow.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-104118-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The behavioural partitioning of the visual field matches the prevalence of translational optic flow and contrast cues across the different regions of the visual field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calow and Lappe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zanker and Zeil, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike other examples of visual field partitioning, such as landing and predator avoidance to looming stimuli in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tammero and Dickinson, 2002</xref>), the hawkmoth flight responses to dorsal and ventrolateral visual cues are not functionally exclusive, suggesting these processes might act in parallel. This poses the question whether the integration of the two systems also corresponds with the natural cue statistics when both systems are active at the same time.</p><p>To address these questions, we characterised the unique directional response of the hummingbird hawkmoth to compare it to translational optic flow-based flight responses using behavioural investigations in flight tunnels. To dissect the integration of the dorsal response and ventrolateral optic flow-based flight control, we applied cue conflict experiments, as are commonly used in multisensory integration studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dacke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stöckl et al., 2016</xref>). We set these results into context with natural visual scene statistics to understand the ecological relevance of the integration hierarchies of the parallel pathways for flight guidance in the hummingbird hawkmoth.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We monitored the hawkmoths’ behaviour in flight tunnels, which they traversed on their way between two cages with hidden feeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To generate visual stimulation, we used semi-transparent red plastic sheets, through which the animals could be filmed and tracked (see ‘Materials and methods’, for an overview of all conditions and condition identifiers, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). From the tracked and digitised flight paths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we extracted features of their flight responses: the average frame-by-frame flight speed, the position relative to the midline, the relative proportion of movement along the long versus short axis of the tunnel, and the cross-index (difference in lateral position at the exit versus entrance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We measured the magnitude of translational optic flow and contrast cues generated by the visual stimuli we used to evaluate the behavioural responses of the animals with respect to the external stimulus strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). Due to the transparency of the tunnel floor and ceiling, and the lighting from above, the magnitude of translational optic flow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and contrast cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) was not exactly the same for the four sides of the tunnel, despite using the same set of stimuli.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Optic flow-based flight control and dorsal directional responses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hawkmoth flight behaviour was tested in a 100 cm long, 30-by-30 cm wide and high tunnel, in which visual patterns could be presented on any side to generate translational optic flow and directional cues.

(<bold>C</bold>) From the flight paths, we quantified the median position off the midline, the average frame-by-frame speed, the proportion of lateral movement (as the ratio of frame-by-frame movement perpendicular and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the tunnel), and the cross-index; the difference in lateral position in the first and last third of the tunnel.

We indirectly measured the relative vertical position of the hawkmoths in the tunnels, and thereby their distance to dorsal and ventral patterns, by the size of the moths’ image in the videos (see ‘Materials and methods’). While this indirect measure must be treated with caution, the general trends are indicative of optic flow responses: hawkmoths flew higher, and thus further away from ventral perpendicular gratings compared to flights without patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, G4 versus N). This was also the case when the perpendicular gratings only extended over one side of the ventral tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>, H1 and H2). Moreover, hawkmoths flew at a similar height with longitudinal ventral gratings (which generated little optic flow when the moths flew along the tunnel’s major axis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, L1) as without patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, N), and significantly lower than with perpendicular ventral gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, G10).

The magnitude of lateral movement varied significantly with the spatial frequency of the ventral patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, G4, G8–G9), and the speed with the finest spatial gratings was numerically larger, though not significantly different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, G8 versus G4, G9), suggesting that like for lateral patterns, the optic flow-based response to ventral stimuli could be spatial frequency dependent.</p><p>Directional responses were characterised by a much stronger reduction in flight speed than observed for lateral or ventral optic flow cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, G5) and highly increased lateral movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, G4). This increased lateral movement was caused by an alignment of the hawkmoths’ flight direction with the main axis of the dorsal cue. It was most clearly observable with a stimulus that crossed from one side of the tunnel to the other, which resulted in an according change in the hawkmoths’ lateral position across the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, S3 and S4). This directional flight behaviour was never observed with ventral switch stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To rule out that the dorsal directional behaviour was an avoidance response of the dorsal coverage generated by the stripe and was indeed a true alignment with the stripe’s direction, we presented a grating of switching lines, which uniformly covered the entire tunnel ceiling. It elicited qualitatively the same switching response as single stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, S5 and S6). Moreover, with dorsal gratings of different spatial frequencies, hawkmoths showed a proportional change in lateral movement, consistent with following the stripes’ directional information, more so for higher spatial frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, G5–G7). For ventral gratings, the proportion of lateral movement and flight speed did not show a consistent variation with stripe frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, G4, G8–G9).</p><p>Together with increasing lateral movement, hawkmoths reduced their flight speed moderately even for a single dorsal line stimulus, which covered only a small portion of the dorsal visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, S1–S2) and drastically for all dorsal contrast patterns that covered at least half the tunnel ceiling, even if they did not generate strong optic flow cues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A , B and I</xref> , S3–S6, H3–H8, G5–G7). If possible, hawkmoths strictly avoided flying under dorsal coverage of the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,</xref> H3–H8). They avoided cues that contrasted strongly against the flight direction more than those with little contrast changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, H4 and H7 versus H3 and H6). This also became evident when directly comparing gratings aligned perpendicular and parallel to the flight direction as hawkmoths changed their median flight position in the tunnel to avoid the gratings perpendicular to the flight direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, H5 and H8). On the other hand, hawkmoths did neither avoid nor seek out flying over contrasting structures in the ventral visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> , H1–H2). Interestingly, unlike for lateral and ventral gratings, hawkmoths did not keep a greater perpendicular distance to dorsal gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and G</xref> , S3C, G5–G7, H3–H8). On the contrary, they flew closer to the tunnel ceiling in these conditions than in tunnels without patterns, and mostly at a similar height than with ventral patterns. In tunnels with dorsal gratings covering one side, in which the moths flew exclusively on the free side, they remained at a similar height than in tunnels without patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>, , N versus H4 and H7).</p><p>Taken together, these observations suggest that the hummingbird hawkmoths’ directional responses to contrast patterns in the dorsal visual field did not bear hallmarks of optic flow-based flight response, as in the ventrolateral visual field. This strongly suggests that a different visuomotor pathway underlies this flight behaviour. We therefore asked next, whether the responses to dorsal versus ventrolateral stimuli resulted from independent control systems, which act in parallel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cue conflict: Lateral optic flow and dorsal directional cues</title><p>To test whether and how optic flow-based avoidance and dorsal direction-following combine to guide the flight position of hawkmoths, we generated a direct conflict by combining a dorsal directional and lateral optic flow cue, which both induce hawkmoths to fly to the same side of the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). For the optic flow cue, we presented vertical red stripes on one tunnel side, which the animals increased their distance to, when presented on their own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, G1 and G2). The dorsal directional cue was a red stripe, which switched tunnel sides towards the optic flow cue in the travel direction of the animals. On its own, this cue induced a cross-over in median tunnel position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, S1 and S2). When both cues were presented in combination, we observed mixed responses: the hawkmoths kept their distance to the optic-flow tunnel side with the same magnitude as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, SG1 and SG2). Simultaneously, in the now more limited lateral space of half the tunnel width, they performed the switching behaviour, resulting in as high a cross-index as with only the dorsal directional cue alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, SG1 and SG2). This is remarkable because it shows the animals were not simply following the red stripe as they were not flying under it after the switch to the other tunnel side occurred, but they followed the directional information of this stimulus. Thus, hawkmoths performed both optic flow-based distance regulation and dorsal directional manoeuvres at the same time, suggesting that these two control systems act in parallel, with similar weights on the final response. Moreover, these weights did not reflect the magnitude of translational optic flow or contrast edges generated by the two types of cues. The lateral grating presented a much higher amplitude of translational optic flow, as well as a higher magnitude of contrast averaged along the length of the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Cue conflict: lateral optic flow and dorsal directional cues.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Flight tracks of hawkmoths virtually rotated to be shown from above the tunnel, which were presented with a lateral grating inducing translational optic flow indicated on the top in (<bold>A</bold>) and bottom in (<bold>B</bold>), and a dorsal line which switched sides from the first to the last third of the tunnel (the start and end points are indicated with red squares).

We next tested how the animals responded when dorsal and lateral responses were conflicted, so that it was not possible to enact both to their original magnitude simultaneously. To test this, we set the lateral distancing and dorsal avoidance responses in conflict by presenting a grating of vertical red stripes on one tunnel wall, which induced the animals to fly on the opposite side of the tunnel, coupled with a grating of the same type on one half of the tunnel’s ceiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>).

Similarly, animals avoided the lateral tunnel side that presented a grating in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, G1 and G2). When combined, we observed a clear hierarchy in responses: the vast majority of animals flew on the side of the tunnel presenting lateral optic flow, thus avoiding the dorsally covered section (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, GG1 and GG2). Yet, the animals’ median position was also significantly different from the dorsal-only condition and shifted closer towards the lateral-only condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, GG1 and GG2). Moreover, not a single animal had their median flight position in the covered tunnel side in the dorsal-only condition, but a subset of animals did in the conflict situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, GG1 and GG2).

High lateral movement and very low speed were highly indicative of the dorsal directional responses and suggest that even in the presence of lateral optic flow in the conflict situation, which supports straight, moderately fast flight, the animals were strongly guided by dorsal cues. Since we previously found that the animals’ flight straightness and speed was guided stronger by ventral than lateral optic flow cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>), we simultaneously presented dorsal and ventral gratings to test whether dorsal cues would also take over flight guidance in combination with ventral cues.

This demonstrates that in the presence of dorsal contrast cues, the optic flow-based control on flight straightness and speed was taken over by dorsal directional guidance, suggesting the latter has a greater weight in the control hierarchy.

In this paradigm, the magnitude of translational optic flow is thought to be kept constant by a reduction of speed and an increase in perpendicular distance to cues generating optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2007</xref>). While the hawkmoths in our experiments slowed down upon perceiving translational optic flow dorsally, they did so much more than for the same stimuli ventrolaterally. Moreover, they aligned with the dominant contrast axis of the stimuli and thus generated a much higher proportion of lateral movement for gratings perpendicular to the tunnel axis. As previously shown in these hawkmoths, high degrees of lateral movement correlate with low flight speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stöckl et al., 2019</xref>), so that the low speed was likely a side effect of the lateral flight, not a response to the optic flow.

What fits the hypothesis is that animals avoided flying under any visual contrast when possible. If this was not possible, they flew under the less-optic flow-inducing portions of the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, H5 and H8). Aligning with the dominant contrast axis could be a strategy to minimise the perceived translational optic flow. However, hawkmoths did not show a perpendicular distance regulation in response to dorsal optic flow cues as they did for ventrolateral ones. If anything, they flew closer to dorsal stimuli than in a tunnel without patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, N versus G5). This suggests that the dorsal response is not an optic flow reduction response, but rather aims at minimising the perceived contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>We therefore hypothesise that the dorsal response might be an adaptation to avoid flying under canopies: both the strong avoidance of any dorsal coverage, whether inducing translational optic flow or not, and the alignment with dominant contrast edges, which could be canopy borders, could help to remain flying in the open. The lack of a distance regulation to dorsal optic flow cues might also be explained by a canopy avoidance strategy: if hawkmoths avoided flying under canopies, they would rarely encounter any dorsal optic flow. All the more so, since the natural habitat of these hawkmoths is described as mostly open and semi-open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pittaway, 1993</xref>). Moreover, even if a hawkmoth was trapped under dorsal coverage, their most common escape strategy is flying upwards towards a bright spot of sky, which would be impaired if the moths had a regulatory mechanism like for ventrolateral optic flow, which kept them at a safe distance from optic flow-inducing structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Integration of the dorsal system with optic flow-based flight control</title><p>For ventrolateral flight responses of hummingbird hawkmoths, we confirmed previous studies, which show typical translational optic-flow-based flight regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grittner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stöckl et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Our series of conflict experiments revealed a response hierarchy between the two systems, which varied for different features of the flight responses even for the same stimulus combination: in terms of flight position, the highest weight was given to the avoidance of dorsal coverage. This behaviour occurred simultaneously with the optic flow-based distance regulation, but reduced the latter’s impact when set in direct conflict. Importantly, the magnitude of dorsal contrast avoidance was also significantly reduced when in conflict with lateral avoidance, yet not to the same degree as lateral distance regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, H7 and H4 versus GG1 and GG2 versus G1 and G2). Moreover, when dorsal avoidance was not possible, the perpendicular distance regulation to ventral cues operated to the same degree as for isolated stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>, G10 versus GG3). Flight speed and path straightness were dominated by the response to dorsal cues as they had the same magnitude as the dorsal cues in isolation for all stimulus combination with dorsal grating stimuli.</p><p>Since the response hierarchy between the systems only occurred when responses to both pathways could not be enacted to their original magnitudes, we would predict that the integration weights vary with the geometry of the moths’ environment and the distribution of the relevant cues, as these will determine how strongly the animals respond to either the dorsal or ventrolateral system.</p><p>Our results also question whether hawkmoths use a combination of flight speed and distance regulation to retain a constant optic flow percept, as has been suggested in other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franceschini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Serres and Ruffier, 2017</xref>). Indeed, the hawkmoths in our experiments kept a similar distance regulation with ventral and lateral optic flow, despite drastically different flight speeds (which were induced by the presence or absence of dorsal cues, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Instead, these results suggest that the animals can measure the distance to optic flow-generating textures in their ventrolateral visual field and subsequently adjust their distance, independently of speed. This could be possible using optic flow divergence, the perceived expansion and contraction caused by flight movements towards and away from a texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergantin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ho et al., 2017</xref>). If hawkmoths measured the distance to objects in their ventrolateral visual field using expansion cues and separately attempted to retain the perceived optic flow constant via adjustments of flight speed, this would explain the two modules having different weights in the control hierarchy and operating separately from each other in the behavioural experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The ecological relevance of the dorsal and ventrolateral flight control systems</title><p>If one interprets the observed flight control hierarchy in terms of ecological function, the highest priority for hummingbird hawkmoths would be to avoid flying into foliage.

Interestingly, the tolerated distance to ventrolateral texture was reduced at the benefit of avoiding dorsal coverage. It remains to be tested if there is a minimum tolerated distance that the animals consider to be safe.</p><p>The dorsal contrast avoidance behaviour has not yet been observed in other insects. It is possible that the lifestyle of the insects tested previously is more tolerant of surrounding foliage than that of hummingbird hawkmoths: honeybees naturally build their nests in trees, while bumblebee nests in the ground might be surrounded by trees or shrubs. The animals thus encounter, and might also use, surrounding foliage, including dorsal coverage, during their daily navigation to and from the nest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Collett and Baron, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ibarra de et al., 2009</xref>). They might therefore be tolerant of dorsal contrast cues; and because they encounter them frequently, use their translational optic flow component to guide flight in the same way across the entire visual field. To understand whether using or avoiding dorsal optic flow is indeed coupled with insect habitat and lifestyle, comparative studies are required, particularly of hawkmoth species that live in forest versus open environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pittaway, 1993</xref>), and of other insects that live in similar open habitats to hummingbird hawkmoths.</p><p>One other explanation for the observation that honeybees keep the perceived translational optic flow constant in either part of their visual field by adjusting distance and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Portelli et al., 2011</xref>) is odometry. Honeybees have been shown to measure the distance of their path to food sources using the translational optic flow integrated during their flight and communicate this information to nestmates to guide them to the same food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Srinivasan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Srinivasan et al., 2000</xref>). In order for this strategy to work, reproducible optic flow on consecutive flights is required – which is not straightforward, since different landscape structures, and flight at different speeds and distances from the surrounding structure, generate different perceived magnitudes of translational optic flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tautz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), resulting in different perceived lengths of path travelled. One way to generate reliable distance measures is to keep perceived translational optic flow constant, which might be a key function for the translational optic flow regulator observed in bees. This hypothesis fits well with the observation that honeybees, when trained to fly close to the one side of a tunnel on the way to a food source (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Serres et al., 2008</xref>), will repeat this strategy when the entrance into the tunnel, or the tunnel shape, changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Portelli et al., 2017</xref>), thus preserving the rate of optic flow they perceived when learning their way to the food source. Thus, in honeybees, keeping the perceived translational optic flow constant across the entire visual field might have less to do with flight guidance or safety, and more with keeping a reliable translational optic flow percept for odometry. This would also explain the differences to hawkmoths, which are not known to path integrate, and demonstrate that retaining safe flight is possible without a constant translational optic flow strategy. Comparing path integrating and non-path integrating insects would reveal whether the optic flow regulator strategy involving speed and distance regulation serves path integration rather than flight control.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>General takeaways for parallel control in sensory systems</title><p>Beyond the mechanisms of flight control in insects, this study also provides fundamental insights into strategies of partitioning the visual field, and how parallel visuomotor pathways are integrated for a robust behavioural response. The benefit of our study system is that the same cues activate different control pathways in different regions of the visual field, so that the resulting behaviour can directly be interpreted in terms of integration weights (unlike for different qualitative types of visual cues, or different sensory modalities, where comparing the perceived magnitude of the different cues is not straightforward). What these experiments show is that the partitioning of the visual field followed the probability with which these cues occur in the animals’ habitat: translational optic flow occurred more frequently and with a higher magnitude in the ventrolateral visual field than in the dorsal one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This was mirrored in the receptive areas of the optic flow-based flight guidance, while canopy avoidance responses occurred exclusively to cues in the dorsal visual field – where contrast cues were the strongest in natural environments with canopies due to the backlighting of the sky (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). It remains to be tested at what elevation the visual field partitions, and whether there is an area of overlap in which either behaviour could be elicited, as is the case for landing and predator avoidance towards looming stimuli in fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tammero and Dickinson, 2002</xref>). Moreover, visual feature distributions should be measured in more diverse natural habitats, and particularly at different elevations, which represent insect flight altitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Degen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Contrary to the visual field partitioning by the stimulus statistics in natural habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hornstein et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turner et al., 2019</xref>), the integration hierarchy did not match the prevalence of natural cues. In the natural habitats of hawkmoths, dorsal coverage was much less frequent than ventrolateral structures generating translational optic flow, yet the hawkmoths responded with a higher weight to the former. Moreover, in our flight tunnel experiments, the animals responded with the same or higher weights to dorsal cues, which had a lower magnitude of translational optic flow and contrast than the same cues in the ventrolateral visual field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). This differs from other sensory integration strategies, which are generally thought to weigh the modality highest which occurs most frequently, and thus has the highest reliability, or the one that provides most information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dacke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stöckl et al., 2016</xref>). The strategy emerging for flight control in the hummingbird hawkmoth is one of reacting to the most immediate ‘danger’ to the animal: the stimuli that carry the biggest potential threat for the animals’ (flight) safety are weighed highest, while in the event of these stimuli, the tolerance for other risks (such as flying closely to lateral structures) is increased. Thus, dorsal contrast cues might not constitute the most frequent input, but the one with the highest priority in terms of the animals’ safety, and therefore are assigned the highest weights in the control hierarchy.</p><p>Thus, to understanding parallel processing strategies, and the integration of parallel information for behavioural guidance, both the prevalence and magnitude of the input statistics are important, as well as the relevance of these stimuli to the particular behaviour of the animals. In the case of flight control in the hummingbird hawkmoth, prevalence shapes the partitioning of the visual field, while relevance determines the integration hierarchy of the parallel pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Optic flow imaging</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Imaging of natural scenes</title><p>To film a 180° frontal visual field panorama, we used the imaging setup designed and described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>. In short, we captured translational optical flow in videos using a full-HD digital camera (USBFHD01M, ELP), equipped with a 185° fisheye lens (1.08 mm focal length, BL-5MP010820MP13IR, Vision Dimension). The camera was attached to the front of a 19 V-powered linear actuator with 70 cm extension (Bewinner) and a movement speed of 12 mm/s. This system was mounted onto a tripod ca. 1 m above ground and captured the visual scenery during 70 cm of horizontal forward movement at a constant distance to the ground. Videos were captured with the open-source software ContaCam 7.9.0 software (Contaware) at a rate of 30 frames per second. To correct undesired rotation in the videos, generated by the linear actuator’s movement, we tracked three horizontally aligned landmarks in outdoor recordings, which were attached to a second tripod and positioned 3 m in front of the camera, to take up only a small portion of the visual field. The landmark positions were used to correct image rotations in MATLAB 2020a (The MathWorks). Any remaining instability in video position was removed with the video stabilisation filter Deshaker 3.1 (Gunnar Thalin; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://guthspot.org/">guthspot.org</ext-link>) in VirtualDub v1.10.4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://virtualdub.org/">virtualdub.org</ext-link>).</p><p>Videos were collected on sunny days (individual clouds were tolerated) in three different types of natural habitats: open, semi-open and closed. Open habitats had no bushes or trees within 20 m of the camera position; semi-open environments had different combinations of shrubs and trees but no complete cover overhead and the closed habitats were filmed under closed tree canopies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We collected videos in three different locations of each habitat type, and within each of the locations, we filmed at three different perspectives to not bias the analysis with a specific view (with the exception of one location in the open habitat type, where only two perspectives were filmed, resulting in N=8 for open habitats, and N=9 for semi-open and closed ones).</p><p>We used the same setup to measure optic flow and contrast edges in the flight tunnel setup to quantify the magnitudes of the stimuli in situ. This was important since the geometry of the lighting and use of semi-transparent materials for lighting and filming on the dorsal and ventral tunnel walls did not provide a perfectly homogeneous stimulation. Moreover, using the same camera and analysis procedures provided comparable optic flow and contrast measures to the outdoor environments. To do so, the camera was positioned centrally with equal distance to all walls and extended from one tunnel entrance 70 cm into the flight tunnel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Analysis of optic flow fields and contrast features</title><p>The dense optical flow in the videos was estimated by the Gunnar Farnebäck method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farnebäck, 2003</xref>), using Open CV with Python 3.7.6, which computed an optic flow vector (angle and magnitude) for every pixel in each frame. In Matlab 2022a, we then used a filter to pass only the optic flow vectors that corresponded to translational optic flow along the camera’s trajectory. In our setup, the viewing axis and the direction of camera travel were the same, thus translational optic flow was represented in vectors with angles radially oriented around the image centre. The mean magnitude of these vectors was then calculated for each pixel of the video. All pixel magnitudes of each video of a scene were averaged and extracted in one of four quadrants (dorsal, ventral, left lateral, right lateral) for subsequent analysis.</p><p>We extracted contrast edges using the MATLAB 2022a inbuilt function ‘edge’, using a Prewitt filter, and variable contrast threshold (0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5). Each extracted edge in each frame of each video was scaled by the highest threshold required to detect it. All contrast edges of each video of a scene were averaged and extracted in one of four quadrants (dorsal, ventral, left lateral, right lateral) for subsequent analysis. For natural visual scenes, the lateral quadrants were averaged and combined, while they were left separate for the analysis of optic flow and contrast in the tunnels, to allow for a detailed assessment of the employed tunnel conditions.</p><p>Statistical analysis of the magnitude of optic flow and contrast edges across habitat types (open, semi, closed) and quadrants of the visual field (ventral, lateral, dorsal) was performed in R 4.3.1 using a linear mixed-effects model (lm4 package) with scenes within conditions as random effects, using the formula<disp-formula id="equ1"><alternatives><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>magnitude</mml:mtext><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mtext>habitat</mml:mtext><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext>quadrant</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>∣</mml:mo><mml:mtext>scene</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t1">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle \text{magnitude} \sim \text{habitat} \times \text{quadrant} + (1 \mid \text{scene})$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>We confirmed that the full model had a lower AIC and deviance than the null model with only random effects, as well as models with either factor only and random effects, before continuing pairwise post hoc tests (emmeans package, default correction: Tukey).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioural experiments</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male and female <italic>Macroglossum stellatarum</italic> (Linnaeus 1758) were raised on their native host plant <italic>Gallium</italic> sp. The eclosed adults (both male and female) were allowed to fly and feed from artificial feeders in flight cages (60 × 60 × 60 cm, length × width × height) on a 14 h:10 h light:dark cycle for at least one day before experiments began.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Flight tunnel setup</title><p>Details of the experimental setup and data analysis have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stöckl et al., 2019</xref>) and will be briefly summarised. Two flight cages (60 × 60 × 60 cm, length × width × height) were connected by a Perspex flight tunnel (100 × 30 × 30 cm, length × width × height, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). The tunnel and cages were illuminated by fluorescent tubes with a daylight-like spectrum (Osram L 18W/965 Biolux Tageslicht G13). A white screen in the middle of the left flight cage (60 cm high, 45 cm wide) obstructed the view into the cage when animals were flying in the tunnel. The feeders were hidden behind this screen. A camera (PlayStation Eye, PS3, Sony) was positioned 1.5 m below the tunnel to film its entire length. It was controlled by ContaCam 7.9.0 beta7 software (Contaware) in motion detection mode at a rate of 50 frames per second and an aspect ratio of 640 × 480 pixels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>To disguise the visual panorama above the tunnel, white felt was placed on top of the tunnel ceiling as a diffuser. Gauze (Gazin Verbandmull 8-fach, Lohmann &amp; Rauscher) was placed on the tunnel floor to avoid light reflections and access to the visual panorama below the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). It allowed the camera mounted below the tunnel to film through it. The tunnel side walls were lined with 5% nominal contrast checkerboard patterns (13.9 mm side length, equivalent to a viewing angle of 5.3° from the centre of the tunnel) for all experimental conditions. This provided sufficient visual feedback to reduce collisions of the animals with the walls, while at the same time minimising the classical hallmarks of translational optic flow flight responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>). For stimulation, we used transparent red plastic sheets (Neewer, #10088988), through which the animals could be filmed and tracked using the red channel of the RGB videos. All patterns were mounted so that they were presented on top of the gauze, diffuser, and 5% checkerboard patterns. We constructed grating patterns out of 3 cm wide stripes of the red sheet, alternating with no stripes. These either spanned the entire 30 cm of one tunnel side, or only 15 cm of the ceiling or floor. Additionally, we also constructed 6 cm and 1.5 cm wide striped gratings to test the reliance of the dorsal and ventral responses on the stripe frequency. In addition to the grating stimuli, we constructed a directional stimulus out of the red sheets, which was 3 cm wide, and consisted of a 33 cm straight section on either tunnel side mounted 5 cm from the edge of the tunnel at opposite sides, and a connecting diagonal in the central 33 cm of the tunnel, as well as a version of this stimulus with repetitions of the stripe every 3 cm.

Briefly, during training, the tunnel side walls were lined with a black and white chequerboard pattern for optimal visual feedback. On the first day, feeders were presented freely visible in the left flight cage, and the animals were moved between the left and right flight cage repeatedly. The following day, the feeders were hidden behind a white screen, and the animals were regularly moved back to the right cage which had no feeders, to encourage the use of the tunnel.</p><p>After familiarisation with the setup, experiments started with feeders in the left flight cage, which were obstructed from view. Animals that were resting in the left cage were moved back to the right cage (without feeders) every 2 h between 9.00 and 17.00. We previously confirmed for this setup that the majority of animals traversed the tunnel within a period of 3 h, suggesting that the recorded flights were generated by a representative proportion of the hawkmoth group in our experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bigge et al., 2021</xref>). The visual stimuli were changed daily or, if too few flights were recorded in that period, every 2 days. Flights through the tunnel were filmed continuously, although the first hour after pattern changes was not analysed to allow hawkmoths to adjust to the new visual scenario. To exclude side biases, we performed all directional experiments with patterns on either side of the tunnel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Video analysis</title><p>As detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stöckl et al., 2019</xref>), not all individuals of <italic>M. stellatarum</italic> traverse the tunnel in a directed fashion. Therefore, we only analysed complete flight tracks from the right to the left flight cage that did not contain landing attempts. Moreover, the tunnel had to be free of other hawkmoths. The flight tracks were then digitised using custom-written software in Matlab R2022a (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stoeckl-lab/Bigge_et_al_2025">https://github.com/stoeckl-lab/Bigge_et_al_2025</ext-link> copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stöckl, 2025</xref>), which detected the animals based on frame-to-frame image differences. The resulting image differences contained the silhouette of the hawkmoths, which was used to extract the area covered by each moth in each frame, using the MATLAB inbuilt function regionprops. The animals’ current position was extracted as the centroid of each detected area. The size of the area was used as a proxy for the animals’ height in the tunnel: the larger the area, the closer the animals flew to the camera, which was positioned under the tunnel; thus, the closer they flew towards the bottom of the tunnel. While this measure did not provide exact flight height in the tunnel (it was sensitive to the animal’s posture, including roll and pitch, and motion blur introduced by their speed), it could be used to analyse trends in the average height the moths’ traversed the tunnel at (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The digitised tracks were analysed in the central 80 cm of the tunnel to exclude the portions of flight where cues from the flight cages could have been visible. We quantified the median of the lateral positions (along the width of the tunnel) of each flight track, the median of the frame-to-frame speed of each flight track, the proportion of lateral movement (as the median of the ratio of movement along the lateral to the longitudinal axis of the tunnel), and a cross-index (by subtracting the lateral position of the animal before exiting – 600–800 mm – from the one after entering the tunnel – 200–400 mm, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>Statistical analysis and presentation</title><p>The median lateral position in the tunnel, lateral movement, cross-position index, and tracking area of individual flights were compared across conditions, using ANOVA with Tukey–Kramer-corrected post hoc comparisons, if the normality of all residuals was confirmed.

If not indicated otherwise, statistical results are shown with a significance level of 5%.

Hawkmoths have been previously shown to rely on translational optic flow information for flight control exclusively in the ventral and lateral parts of their visual field.

They found that the different visuomotor pathways act in parallel, and they identified a 'hierarchy': the avoidance of dorsal patterns had the strongest weight and optic flow-based speed regulation the lowest weight. The authors linked their behavioral results to visual scene statistics in the hawkmoths' natural environment.

A few small notes:</p><p>Figure 2B legend - describe what the orange dashed line represents</p></disp-quote><p>We added a description.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B legend - references Table 1 but I believe this should reference Table S1. There are other places in the manuscript where Table 1 is referenced and it should reference S1</p></disp-quote><p>We changed this for all instances in the main paper and supplement, where the reference was wrong.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1 legend - some figure panel letters are in parentheses while others are not</p></disp-quote><p>We unified the notation to not use parentheses for any of the panel letters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I couldn't find the l, r, d, v indications in Fig. 1a. This was just a suggestion, but since you wrote you added them, I was wondering if this is the old figure version.</p></disp-quote><p>We added them to what is now Fig. 2, which was originally part of Fig. 1. After restructuring, we did indeed not add an additional set to Fig. 1, which we have now adjusted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 2: Adding 'optic flow' and 'edges' to the y-axis in panels E and F, would make it faster for me to parse the figure. Maybe also add the units for the magnitudes? Same for Figure 6B</p></disp-quote><p>We added 'optic flow' and 'edges' to the panels E and F in Fig. 2 and Fig. 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 2: Very minor - could you use the same pictograms in D and E&amp;F (i.e. all circles for example, instead of switching to &quot;tunnels&quot; in EF)?</p></disp-quote><p>We used the tunnel pictograms, because we associated those with the short notations for the different conditions summarised in Table S1. Because we wanted to keep this consistent across the paper, we used the “tunnel” pictograms here too.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the manuscript, you still draw lots of conclusions based on these area measurements (L132-142, L204-209 etc). This does not fully reflect what you wrote in your reply to the reviewers. If you think of these measurements as qualitative rather than quantitative, I would say so in the manuscript and not use quantitative statistics etc. My suggestion would be to be more specific about potential issues that can influence the measurement (you mentioned body size, image contrast, motion blur, pitch across conditions etc) and give that data not the same weight as the rest of the measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We do express explicit caution with this measure in the methods section (l. 657-659) and the results section (l. 135-137). Nevertheless, as the trends in the data are consistent with optic flow responses in the other planes, and with responses reported in the literature, we felt that it is valuable to report the data, as well as the statistics for all readers, who can – given out cautionary statement – assess the data accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The area measurements suggest that moths fly lower with unilateral vertical gratings (Fig. S1, G1 and G2 versus the rest). If you leave the data in can you speculate why that would be? (Sorry if I missed that)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, this seems quite consistent, but we do not have a good explanation for this observation. It would certainly require some additional experiments and variable conditions to understand what causes this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig.4 - is panel B somehow flipped? Shouldn't the flight paths start out further away from the grating and then be moved closer to midline (as in A). That plot shows the opposite.</p></disp-quote><p>Absolutely right, thank you for spotting this, it was indeed an intermediate and not the final figure which was uploaded to the manuscript. It also had outdated letter-number identifiers, which we now updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>L198 - should be &quot;they avoided&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
