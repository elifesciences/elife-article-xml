Laboratory studies into the neural underpinnings of anxiety typically assess innate anxiety through exposure to an ambiguous context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lezak et al., 2017</xref>). While this approach has provided valuable insight into the mechanisms which underlie acute fear and anxiety states, they do not address real-life situations where anxiety develops because actions are learned to be associated with a risk of an aversive outcome. An alternative approach to study this form of anxiety is to utilize uncertain punishment contingencies during action execution, which produce self-reported elevations in anxiety in humans and have been validated with anxiolytic treatment with benzodiazepines in rodents and non-human primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogel et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmitz and Grillon, 2012</xref>). Recent procedures assessing reward and punishment learning simultaneously have further indicated that learning of punishment contingencies may be critical to understanding behavioral and neuronal changes related to anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>), we assessed this mode of learned anxiety by developing a punishment risk task (PRT) in rats where actions executed to obtain reward conflicted with the presence of a low probability of harm (low intensity footshock). We observed that, after PRT training, response time during risky actions became longer and more variable. Consistent with the relevance of PRT to anxiety, treatment with the anxiolytic drug diazepam diminished the impact of footshock probability on response time. To begin to understand the neural mechanisms that support PRT performance, we recorded from the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) over PRT training sessions. The focus on these interconnected regions was because they have been implicated in anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eysenck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmes and Wellman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balderston et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balderston et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roberts, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacobs and Moghaddam, 2021</xref>) and are critical for execution of reward-guided actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balleine and Dickinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ellwood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flores-Dourojeanni et al., 2021</xref>). We found that dmPFC and VTA neurons flexibly, and in coordination, represent the relationship between action and punishment. Here, we sought to address two outstanding questions: (1) Do these brain regions ‘learn’ about punishment contingencies by changing their responses to the punishment or reward during learning? (2) After learning, how are behavioral changes in response to anxiolytic treatment with diazepam represented in these regions?</p><p>We used fiber photometry instead of single unit recording used in the original study to (indirectly) assess the activity of neural population states in the dmPFC and VTA during PRT acquisition so that we could measure changes in the phasic neural response to the punishment (footshock) itself during task learning. After learning, we examined the effect of diazepam on dmPFC and VTA activity in correlation with behavior. We find that initial learning of probabilistic punishment changes neural calcium responses in the VTA and dmPFC during action execution and reward whereas response to the punisher remained unchanged. Moreover, anxiolytic treatment enhanced VTA peri-action activity and promoted correlated activity between the two regions without influencing dmPFC peri-action activity or encoding of the punisher.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male and female Long-Evans (bred in house n=8) and Sprague-Dawley (Charles River n=5) rats were used.

The coexpression of tdTomato allows for a motion artifact control signal to be used to correct GCaMP signals in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babayan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matias et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menegas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus. A small incision on the scalp was performed. The skull was cleaned and two craniotomies over the dmPFC and ipsilateral VTA were performed. A microinfusion syringe (Hamilton) was filled with virus and lowered into the dmPFC (AP +3.0, ML +0.6, DV –3.3 mm from dura) or VTA (AP –5.4, ML +0.6, DV –7.5 from dura) and injected into the brain at a volume of 700 nl at 50 nl/min using a syringe pump (World Instruments). Following infusion, virus was given 12 min to diffuse before the needle was slowly removed. The incision was then closed and covered with triple antibiotic.

Rats were trained to make an instrumental response to receive a 45 mg sugar pellet (BioServe) under fixed ratio one schedule of reinforcement (FR1). The availability of the nosepoke for reinforcement was signaled by a 5 s tone. After at least three FR1 training sessions, PRT sessions began. PRT sessions consisted of three blocks of 30 trials each. The action-reward contingency remained constant, with one nosepoke resulting in one sugar pellet. However, there was a probability of receiving a footshock (300 ms electrical footshock of 0.3 mA) after the FR1 action, which increased over the blocks (0%, 6%, or 10% in blocks 1, 2, and 3, respectively). To minimize generalization of the action-punishment contingency, blocks were organized in an ascending footshock probability with 2 min timeouts between blocks. Punishment trials were pseudo-randomly assigned, with the first footshock occurring within the first five trials. All sessions were terminated if not completed in 180 min.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Diazepam treatment</title><p>Injectable diazepam (Pfizer/Hospira, Lake Forest, IL) at a dose of 2.0 mg/kg or sterile saline (0.9% NaCl) were injected intraperitoneally 5 min before the start of the task.

Recording was accomplished by providing both 470 and 560 nm excitation light through the 400 µm core patchcord to the dmPFC or VTA for GCaMP6s and tdTomato signals, respectively. Data were recorded using bonsai open source software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lopes et al., 2015</xref>) and timestamps of behavioral events were collected by 5 V TTL pulses that were relayed to an Arduino interfaced with bonsai software.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fiber photometry analysis</title><sec id="s2-6-1"><title>Peri-event analysis</title><p>Signals from the 465 (GCaMP6s) and 560 (tdTomato) streams were processed in Python (version 3.7.4) using custom written scripts similar to previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Moghaddam, 2020</xref>). Briefly, 465 and 560 streams were lowpass filtered at 3 Hz using a Butterworth filter and subsequently broken up based on the start and end of a given trial. The 560 signal was fitted to the 465 using a least-squares first-order polynomial and subtracted from 465 signal to yield the change in fluorescent activity (ΔF/F=465 signal − fitted 560 signal/fitted 560 signal). Peri-event z-scores were computed by comparing the ΔF/F after the behavioral action to the 4–2 s baseline ΔF/F prior to a given epoch. To investigate potential different neural calcium responses to receiving the footshock vs. anticipation, punished (i.e. shock) trials and unpunished trials were separated. Trials with a z-score value &gt;40 were excluded. From approximately 3000 trials analyzed, this occurred on &lt;1% of trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-2"><title>AUC analyses</title><p>To represent individual data we calculated the area under the curves (AUCs) for each subject. To quantify peri-cue and peri-action changes we calculated a change or summation score between 1 s before (pre event) and 1 s after (post event) cue onset or action execution. For the reward period we calculated a change score by comparing 2 s after reward delivery to the 1 s prior to reward delivery. For punished trials, response to footshock was calculated as the change from 1 s following footshock delivery compared to the 1 s before footshock. Outliers were removed using GraphPad Prism’s ROUT method (Q=1%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Motulsky and Brown, 2006</xref>) which removed only three data points from analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-3"><title>Time lagged cross-correlation analysis</title><p>Cross-correlation analysis has been used to identify networks from simultaneously measured fiber photometry signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sych et al., 2019</xref>).

This third PRT session corresponds to the session electrophysiology data were collected from. To overlay data from the two techniques, data were lowpass filtered at 3 Hz and photometry data were downsampled to 20 Hz (to match the 50 ms binning). Data from both streams were then min-max normalized between 0 and 1 at the corresponding cue and action+reward epochs.</p><p>To assess the similarity of the two signals, we performed a Pearson correlation analysis between the normalized single unit and fiber photometry data for cue or action+reward epochs at each risk block, as well as between randomly shuffled photometry signals with single unit response as a control. For significant Pearson correlations we performed cross-correlation analysis (see above) to investigate if the photometry signal lagged behind electrophysiology given the slower kinetics of GCAMP6 compared to single unit approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For FR1 training, trial completion was measured as the number of food pellets earned. Data were assessed for the first three to four training sessions.

Action latencies were defined as time from cue onset to action execution. Data were analyzed using a two-way RM ANOVA or mixed effects model. Because there were missing data for non-random reasons (e.g. failure to complete trials in response to punishment risk) we took the average of risk blocks (blocks 2 and 3) and the no risk block (block 1) to permit repeated measures analysis. We used mixed effects model if data were missing for random reasons. Risk and session were used as factors and post hoc tests were performed using the Bonferroni correction where appropriate. When only two groups were compared a paired t-test or Wilcoxon test was performed after checking normality assumption through the Shapiro-Wilk test.</p><p>To assess changes in neural calcium activity, we utilized a permutation-based approach as outlined in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2020</xref> using Python (version 3). An average response for each subject for a given time point in the cue, action, or reward delivery period was compared to either the first PRT or saline session. For each time point a null distribution was generated by shuffling the data, randomly selecting the data into two groups, and calculating the mean difference between groups. This was done 1000 times for each time point and a p-value was obtained by determining the percentage of times a value in the null distribution of mean differences was greater than or equal to the observed difference in the unshuffled data (one-tailed for comparisons to 0% risk and FR1 data, two-tailed for all other comparisons). To control for multiple comparisons we utilized a consecutive threshold approach based on the 3 Hz lowpass filter window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pascoli et al., 2018</xref>), where a p-value &lt;0.05 was required for 14 consecutive samples to be considered significant.</p><p>To assess AUC changes in photometry data, we compared all risk blocks and all sessions using ANOVA with factors risk block and session.

Forty µm brain slices were collected on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems) and preserved in 0.05% phosphate buffered azide. Brain slices were mounted to slides and cover slipped with Vectashield anti-fade mounting medium (Vector Labs). A Zeiss Apotome.2 microscope was used to image brain slices for GFP (Zeiss Filter set 38: 470 nm excitation/525 nm emission) and tdTomato (Zeiss Filter Set 43: 545 nm excitation/605 nm emission) to validate expression of both fluorophores in cells near the fiber tip. Fiber placement was determined by the brain slice demonstrating the most ventral fiber location.</p><p>Immunohistochemistry with a GFP antibody was used if a subject lacked virus expression to confirm the presence or absence of GCaMP6s. Brain slices were permeabilized in 3% BSA, 0.5% Triton-X, and 5% Tween 80 dissolved in PBS + 0.05% sodium azide for 2 hr at room temperature. Slices were then incubated with rabbit antiserum against GFP (Abcam, Catalogue# 6556, 1:500) diluted in PBS + Azide, 3% BSA + 0.1% Triton, and 1% Tween for 48 hr at 4°C.

Fibers were generally placed in the prelimbic region of the mPFC and slightly lateral portion of the VTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Task training was as described before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury et al., 2019</xref>). After rats learned to execute an action to receive a reward, a (varying) risk of shock was introduced contingent on the action (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The risk of footshock increased from 0% to 10% during three 30-trial consecutive blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During the first three sessions of PRT, increases in the latency to execute to the risky action and decreases in trial completion were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref> – left, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In Session 1, punishment risk appeared non-specific because some subjects showed increases in the latency to retrieve reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In block 1 (the safe block) response to all task events remained the same during PRT learning. Session-by-session differences began to emerge in risk blocks. During 6% risk blocks, the initial modest peri-action inhibitory response decreased in both regions suggesting that action-related activity is sensitive to punishment risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). These peri-action responses continued to be neutral or elevated during 10% risk blocks in the dmPFC and VTA, respectively. Comparison of these data to the first (safe) block for each session indicated that there was a significant attenuation of the dmPFC peri-action response in risk blocks in Session 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,E</xref>).

To more directly assess the relationship between the present photometry responses and single unit activity at the corresponding session of PRT, we compared the current data with our single unit recording results (in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>). Both dmPFC and VTA photometry signals were positively correlated with population averaged single unit recordings at a higher level than when photometry data was randomly shuffled, mostly in the action and reward period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

The lack of detection of the faster (&lt;1 s) cue responses by fiber photometry, particularly in some of the VTA data, compared to the more prolonged (&gt;1 s) signal changes in action and reward periods may be related to GCaMP6s’ slower kinetics compared to unit approaches. Inspection of traces suggests that phasic responses were occasionally slower to peak in photometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, see E) and slower to begin to decay; the latter of which could also account for the low correlation seen in some of the faster epochs such as the cue. Overall, these results suggest that fiber photometry captures some aspects of overall population activity seen in these regions during action and reward in the PRT but may be more limited when comparing to faster responses like those related to cue onset.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Effect of diazepam on behavior and dmPFC and VTA neural calcium activity during task events</title><p>After animals were trained in the PRT, we sought to determine if anxiolytic treatment changed the neural response to task events by the dmPFC and VTA during corresponding changes in behavior.

In the real world, these outcomes are not independent because actions executed to obtain a reward are often associated with a risk of an aversive outcome. This risk is learned over experience, and the perceived risk of punishment can engender anxiety-related states that will bias action selection. Using a novel task, our previous work demonstrated that the dmPFC and VTA dynamically represent risk of punishment during reward-motivated actions after rats have learned the punishment contingencies associated with these actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>). The present study expands on these findings by focusing on the learning phase of the task, and the impact of diazepam after learning. We find that after exposure to conflicting reward and punishment contingencies, both VTA and dmPFC modify their response in the peri-action and subsequent reward periods but maintain similar responses to the punisher itself. Treatment with diazepam after learning did not influence the neural response to the punisher in either region but it potentiated the VTA action response and enhanced its correlated activity with the dmPFC. These data suggest that action, but not punishment, encoding is critical to adapting behavior to punishment risk contingencies and the resulting state of anxiety.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Learning of punishment risk produces changes in action, but not punisher, encoding in the dmPFC and VTA</title><p>Learning was evident because the suppressive effects of footshock risk were specifically seen for the risky action, but not reward retrieval, in risk blocks after training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolles et al., 1980</xref>). This work provides a substantial expansion of our prior paper because utilizing fiber photometry allowed us to measure neural responses during the footshock punisher over PRT training. The change in behavior was not related to dmPFC or VTA responsivity to the punisher itself as the magnitude of footshock encoding did not change in either region during learning. The large phasic response of these regions to footshock is consistent with previous literature implicating these regions in stress and pain responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">McKlveen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holly and Miczek, 2016</xref>) including our previous work showing that about 50–75% of spontaneously active PFC units respond to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson and Moghaddam, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Del Arco et al., 2020</xref>). Previous work has also shown that repeated exposure to the same stressor produces sensitization to some responses such as dopamine release in the prefrontal cortex (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gresch et al., 1994</xref>) and rapid desensitization of unit responses in the PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jackson and Moghaddam, 2006</xref>). We, however, found that repeated exposure to footshock in the context of action contingent punishment did not produce a sensitized (or desensitized) response. This suggests that context matters in how dmPFC neurons respond to an aversive stimulus. While dmPFC neurons may adapt by reducing their response to a repeated punisher/stressor when stress presentation is certain or not contingent on an action, they appear to sustain the same level of activation when punisher presentation is uncertain and associated with an action.</p><p>In contrast to punishment responses, peri-action responses changed in dmPFC and VTA as animals learned the PRT. This finding suggests that action encoding by the dmPFC and VTA can serve as a locus for learning of punishment contingencies during reward-guided behavior. This is an important observation because behavioral studies have shown that adaptation to reward and punishment is mostly associated with the learning of safe and/or dangerous contingencies rather than arousal from punishment or reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2019</xref>). The neural mechanisms which support reward-punishment contingency learning are thought to be diverse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McNaughton and Corr, 2004</xref>), and only recently have studies provided direct neural data for such processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021b</xref>). Our findings in the dmPFC and VTA implicate these regions in reward-punishment contingency learning and identify action encoding as a key behavioral event involved in this form of learning.</p><p>It is interesting that learning the FR1 without punishment also led to the emergence of a phasic peri-action decrease. We posit that this phasic decrease may represent PFC entering an offline state when actions become learned or action outcomes become predictable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kupferschmidt et al., 2017</xref>). Attenuations of this inhibitory response in the PRT could similarly reflect the PFC shifting back to an online state when uncertain and risky contingencies emerge.</p><p>Neuronal response to reward in dmPFC and VTA also changed in some phases of PRT suggesting that adaptive responses to reward processing may play a role in the learning of reward-punishment contingencies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Diazepam increases peri-action responsiveness of the VTA and VTA-dmPFC correlated activity without influencing punisher and reward responding</title><p>Diazepam is a common anxiolytic drug that is used to validate anxiety assays and attenuates the action suppression seen from punishment risk in this task and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacobs and Moghaddam, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liljequist and Engel, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>). The mechanism for diazepam’s anxiolytic effects are incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sartori and Singewald, 2019</xref>). One possibility is that diazepam itself attenuates responses to anxiogenic stimuli such as punishments. This mechanism was not supported by our data in that we did not see attenuation of footshock responsivity in the VTA or dmPFC after diazepam. An alternative explanation is that diazepam enhances responsivity to reward, which would consequently drive reinforced behavior under punishment risk. Again, our results did not support this explanation, as neural response to reward was similar across regions after drug treatment. Thus, diazepam has little impact on the processing of aversive or appetitive emotional stimuli in these regions. In contrast, diazepam influenced VTA activity during the peri-action epoch by producing a ramping of neural calcium activity where activity rose gradually over the 1.5 s before action in the first two blocks. The so-called ‘ramping activity’ of VTA neurons has been previously associated with attentional tuning, movement kinetics, and distance to goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kremer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Totah et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study which elegantly characterized VTA ramps using fiber photometry found that these signals reflect interoceptive goals particularly when internal maps, and not external stimuli, are utilized to process reward proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guru et al., 2020</xref>). One possible explanation for our results is that anxiogenic contingencies render subjects more attentive to stimuli and external conditions. Thus, diazepam’s production of VTA ramping activity may be a mechanism to direct attentional processes to serve internalized goal-driven states, and ultimately, more efficient reward seeking behavior. This interpretation is also in line with studies which assess the cognitive effects of diazepam in humans, as diazepam has been shown to attenuate vigilant-avoidant patterns of emotional attention to fearful stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pringle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While diazepam had negligible effects in the dmPFC, it influenced correlated activity between this region and VTA during action epochs in the safe and 6% risk block. This pattern of increased correlation of activity corresponded to the ramping signal in the VTA suggesting that a potential downstream effect of VTA’s response to diazepam is to increase its correlative activity with the dmPFC. Correlated activity between PFC units or local field potentials (LFPs) with subcortical regions including the VTA has been observed during other goal-directed behaviors including PRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujisawa and Buzsáki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mininni et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, while diazepam may not change the activity of dmPFC neurons, it may produce some of its effects by altering correlative activity between dmPFC and VTA. Future investigations using unit and LFP recordings will be needed to better characterize the mechanism for this change in correlated activity under anxiolytic treatment.</p><p>Effects of diazepam on behavior and VTA lessened by the last and the highest risk block, when anxiety is presumably highest. Diazepam’s half-life is about 1 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Friedman et al., 1986</xref>) and it is possible that this observation is due to lower receptor occupancy by the third (highest risk) block. Another possibility is that diazepam may function in different capacities when threats are either distal or lower in likelihood, that is, blocks 1 and 2, compared to when the threat probability is higher or certain. Future studies could address these possibilities through longer acting anxiolytics or temporally specific manipulations to systematically disrupt the transient and longer lasting effects from diazepam observed here.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Relationship of fiber photometry data to previous electrophysiology findings</title><p>Understanding similarities across neural measurements is an important area of future work as we resolve measurements across different assays and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kriegeskorte et al., 2008</xref>). Fiber photometry signals are not a direct measure of spiking seen in single unit recording, and additional studies investigating its exact relation to single unit approaches are nascent (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sych et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Legaria et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). While responses to the cue did not correlate well between the present work and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>, our observations that dmPFC action-related activity was most sensitive to risk of punishment and the VTA developed phasic increases at the time of action execution are consistent with unit recordings measured in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>. Similarly, we observed a large reward response in the VTA consistent with previous electrophysiology findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park and Moghaddam, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together these results provide support that calcium activity of dmPFC and VTA neurons through fiber photometry shows some similarities to the overall population responses seen from in vivo unit recording in this task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Assessing how the brain encodes reward-directed actions when conflicted by punishment probability is a novel approach to model learned anxiety. Using an animal model to study this form of learning, we find that dmPFC and VTA selectively adapt action and reward response during the learning of anxiogenic contingencies without modifying their response to the punisher. We also identify peri-action ramping of VTA activity as a potential marker for anxiolytic properties of diazepam in this model. The VTA ramping signal has been linked to preparatory attention and goal-driven states. Potentiation of this response may lead to attentional disengagement from harm probability and provide a mechanism for how diazepam influences action execution under anxiety.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the OHSU Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (Protocol #: 00000727) and were conducted in accordance with National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78912-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data generated for analyses has been deposited on Dryad.

remain poorly understood and certainly less understood relative to reward learning. This manuscript uses dual fiber photometry to make an important advance in understanding how punishment is learned by studying how punishment changes action and punisher coding in the medial prefrontal cortex and ventral tegmental area of rats. The authors interpret the results as supporting a role for both areas in foraging in the face of risky outcomes. This work follows nicely on prior work and presents a straightforward and interesting experiment, using a validated anxiolytic to test what components of the neural response are related to this emotional component.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78912.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Schoenbaum</surname><given-names>Geoffrey</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Schoenbaum</surname><given-names>Geoffrey</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Gavan P</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03r8z3t63</institution-id><institution>University of New South Wales</institution></institution-wrap><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.29.486234">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.29.486234v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Geoffrey Schoenbaum as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gavan P McNally (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While there was general consensus that the paper built nicely on the prior work and represented a meaningful and important Research Advance on that work, there was some disagreement in the reviews over whether the data was appropriately/clearly analyzed and what to do about it. Rather than trying to resolve this into specific points, the authors should look at the reviews and see various suggestions that highlight the respective difficulties the reviewers each had. Generally, there needs to be a bit more clarity and perhaps detail in the analysis of the behavioral and photometric data. At least two reviewers had difficulty locating data supporting or following the logic of data-specific claims made in the text. Additionally, some concern was raised that more discussion or reference should be made to places where the bulk calcium signal diverges from or fails to show information known from the prior report to be in the spiking activity. This came up in the discussion and seems particularly important in the context of this format.</p><p>We ask that you please address each of the reviewers points from both the public review and recommendations for authors. If you have not already done so, please include a key resource table and ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report exact p-values wherever possible alongside the summary statistics and 95% confidence intervals. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) To address the design issue and the language, I think the authors should just steer clear of strong language about punishment contingencies. As noted above, it is unclear to me whether the behavioral changes reflect the real-time imposition of the shock, or if the rats have really learned specific contingencies. There is some change across sessions, but it seems to me this could be just sensitization to the shock. Or some form of specific learning as the authors suggest. But with so little experience and such sparse shock, it is hard to know exactly. It would be simpler just to refer to what is operationally happening.</p><p>2) With regard to the neural data, I think an analysis that compares epochs both within and across the blocks and sessions. This might require approaching the signal differently so that it can be analyzed using multi-factorial approaches. The line plots are great, but supplementing them with bars or scatters that show the values being compared statistically would be great. And I think the diazepam data should be referenced back to these effects. If the shock introduction causes a shift one way, it would be interesting to know if the diazepam transiently reverses this, not just how it changes activity compared to the control in Figure 5.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– The behavioral results require more rigor and clarity. Whatever the authors choose to perform (mixed effects, ANOVA and/or MANOVA) more thorough descriptions of analysis factors and results for main effects and interactions must be provided.</p><p>– In places, the methods lack sufficient detail to understand what was done. I could not determine the full design of the diazepam study. Further, I could not tell which study used Long Evans vs. Sprague-Dawleys, nor why different strains were used for the two studies.</p><p>– Both studies are underpowered and did not include sex as a factor in analyses. &quot;Activity&quot; patterns that should have been equivalent on shock and no-shock trials were not so. This makes any apparent differences difficult to interpret. Significantly increasing the sample size is required to detect meaningful differences between calcium transients between sessions and groups.</p><p>– It would have been much more of an advance to image only GABA or only dopamine neurons in the VTA. This also would have maximized the strength of the calcium imaging approach. The argument that fluorescence and firing are tightly linked is not convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Probably the biggest overall issue is that it is unclear what is being learned specifically. There is no probe test at the end to dissociate the direct impact of shock from its learned impact. And the blocks are not signaled in some other way. And though there seems to be some evidence that the shock effects get more pronounced with a session, it is not clear if the rats are really learning to associate specific shock risks with the particular trials. Indeed with so few sessions and so few actual shocks, this seems really unlikely, especially since without an independent cue, the shock and its frequency is the cue for the block switch. It seems especially unlikely that there is a strong dichotomy in the rats model of the environment between 6% and 10% blocks. This may be quite relevant for understanding foraging under risk. But I think it means some of the language in the paper about contingencies and the like should be avoided.</p><p>– The second issue I had was that I had some trouble lining up the claims in the results with what appeared to be meaningful differences in the figures. Just looking at it, it seems to me that VTA shows higher activities at higher shocks, particularly at the time of reward but also when comparing safe vs risky anyway for the cue and action periods. DmPFC shows a similar pattern in the reward period. […] But these results are not described at all like this. The focus is on the action period only and on ramping? I don't really see ramping. it says &quot;Anxiogenic contingencies also did not influence the phasic response to reward...&quot;. But fig 3 seems to show clearly different reward responses? The characterization of the change is particularly important since to me it looks like the diazepam essentially normalizes these features of the response. This makes sense to me […].</p><p>– I did struggle to understand the functional significance of the PFC transients. I am convinced they are real and robust because we see precisely the same in our own unpublished work. But, I am still puzzled as to what a loss of an 'inhibitory' transient around the punished action in PFC means? This is not really addressed but it is the main effect of punishment on action coding in the PFC and I think some readers would appreciate the author's interpretation of this.</p><p>– Re: analyses. I thought these were generally well done. There are two questions one might be interested in. The first is whether the transients are different from 0%. The second is whether transients differ across sessions. The figures do a good job at answering the second question (which to me is the most important question) by using coloured bars above transients to show when session differences are present as assessed by a robust analysis. However, I do think some readers would also appreciate knowing whether and when transients themselves were significantly &lt; or &gt; 0%. Perhaps these figures could be presented as supplementary data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78912.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions:</p><p>1) To address the design issue and the language, I think the authors should just steer clear of strong language about punishment contingencies.

First we have included permutation analysis comparing to the first block (0%) for each of the first three sessions (also relevant to comments from Reviewer 3; see Figure 2 – supplements 2-3).</p><p>Second, to allow comparison within and across sessions, we calculated AUC values for each subject and assessed these with ANOVA for all blocks and sessions (i.e. learning sessions and saline and diazepam). This allows for visualization of individual variability as well as assessing both risk block and session as factors together. Given that not all subjects received injections of saline and diazepam, we used an ordinary two-way ANOVA (non-repeated measures). These results are shown in Figure 7 supplements 2 and 3, and a description has been added to the results. Please note while all sessions were included in the ANOVA, we split learning and saline/diazepam for plotting purposes because having all sessions and individual data on each panel was overly cluttered.</p><p>After these analyses, visual inspection of the neural data suggested changes in response as early as session 1. We, therefore, analyzed neural calcium responses in a new dataset involving FR1 training (in shock-naive animals) and split up the trials by early (1-30), middle (31-60), and late trials (61-90) to see if there were any peri-event changes that could be related to time on task rather than risk. These data further demonstrated that changes in neural response were not related to time on task because peri-action and reward responses were the same over FR1 trials in early, middle and late epochs (see Figure 3 – supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– The behavioral results require more rigor and clarity.

For the sake of transparency, we had included plots showing sessions split by each block whereas statistics related to the right side bar plots where data are collapsed across risk (which was done to minimize effects from ‘missing’ data). We appreciate that this may have caused confusion. In the revised manuscript we specify the exact figure for each statistical result and have added a better description in the methods and updated the statistics (Table 1) with the ANOVA and post-hoc results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Both studies are underpowered and did not include sex as a factor in analyses. &quot;Activity&quot; patterns that should have been equivalent on shock and no-shock trials were not so.

We assure the reviewer that we do not claim that fiber photometry is a perfect surrogate for direct recording of neural activity. However, a key question we wanted to answer in this study was whether the response of PFC and VTA to the footshock changes during task acquisition (please see last paragraph of introduction), hence the choice to use fiber photometry. We note in the results and discussion that this approach is not optimal for detecting cue or other rapid responses (see page 15 and 23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Probably the biggest overall issue is that it is unclear what is being learned specifically.

To address this (please also see response to reviewer #1’s first comment), we have toned down our use of the “contingency learning” throughout the manuscript and use the word contingency in relation to the underlying reinforcement/punishment schedules.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second issue I had was that I had some trouble lining up the claims in the results with what appeared to be meaningful differences in the figures.

However upon quantifying these responses again using AUC change scores to adjust for pre-event differences in the signal, we observed small reward related increases (data are in Figure 7 – supplements 2/3) and have updated results and the discussion.</p><p>Although some lessening of reward response may be apparent across the diazepam session in the VTA (Figure 7 – supplement 2/3G), we do not have statistical support for this as no significant differences were observed in permutation comparisons to saline and only session 3 deviated from the first session for the reward period in the AUC analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I did struggle to understand the functional significance of the PFC transients.

Additionally, we have added new data (now Figure 3) assessing the action related activity from recording when these same animals learned the FR1 response (before any footshock exposure). These data demonstrate that, as the action-outcome association is learned, an inhibitory transient emerges in the PFC. This suggests that a decrease in the inhibitory phasic response may reflect a less engaged PFC state when actions are predictable and learned. Speculation related to this potential mechanism has been added in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Re: analyses. I thought these were generally well done.
