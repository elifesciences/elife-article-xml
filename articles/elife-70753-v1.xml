Appropriate depth of placental invasion is needed to support a healthy pregnancy; shallow invasion is associated with the development of severe preeclampsia (sPE). Maternal contribution to sPE through failed decidualization is an important determinant of placental phenotype. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the in vivo defect linking decidualization to sPE is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>Global RNA sequencing was applied to obtain the transcriptomic profile of endometrial biopsies collected from nonpregnant women who suffer sPE in a previous pregnancy and women who did not develop this condition. Samples were randomized in two cohorts, the training and the test set, to identify the fingerprinting encoding defective decidualization in sPE and its subsequent validation. Gene Ontology enrichment and an interaction network were performed to deepen in pathways impaired by genetic dysregulation in sPE. Finally, the main modulators of decidualization, estrogen receptor 1 (<italic>ESR1</italic>) and progesterone receptor B (<italic>PGR-B</italic>), were assessed at the level of gene expression and protein abundance.</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Here, we discover the footprint encoding this decidualization defect comprising 120 genes—using global gene expression profiling in decidua from women who developed sPE in a previous pregnancy. This signature allowed us to effectively segregate samples into sPE and control groups. <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PGR</italic> were highly interconnected with the dynamic network of the defective decidualization fingerprint. <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PGR-B</italic> gene expression and protein abundance were remarkably disrupted in sPE.</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Thus, the transcriptomic signature of impaired decidualization implicates dysregulated hormonal signaling in the decidual endometria in women who developed sPE. These findings reveal a potential footprint that could be leveraged for a preconception or early prenatal screening of sPE risk, thus improving prevention and early treatments.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>This work has been supported by the grant PI19/01659 (MCIU/AEI/FEDER, UE) from the Spanish Carlos III Institute awarded to TGG.

PE is characterized by the onset of hypertension, proteinuria, and other signs of maternal vascular damage that contributes to maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gifford, 2000</xref>). Severe preeclampsia (sPE) is diagnosed based on elevated blood pressure (systolic ≥160 or diastolic of ≥100 mm Hg) or thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, progressive renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or the onset of cerebral or visual disturbances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gynecologists ACoOa, Pregnancy TFoHi, 2013</xref>). sPE is a placental insufficiency syndrome mediated by early-deficient extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion of uterine decidua and spiral arterioles, leading to incomplete endovascular invasion and altered uteroplacental perfusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts and Cooper, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brosens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Staff et al., 2020</xref>). Why shallow EVTs invasion occurs, however, remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Pregnancy health is dictated by the embryo, placenta, and the quality of the maternal decidua, where EVTs invasion and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Norwitz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cha et al., 2012</xref>). Accumulated evidence suggests that the contribution of the decidua to the etiology of PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabaglino et al., 2015</xref>), sPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garrido-Gómez et al., 2020</xref>), and placenta accreta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McNally et al., 2020</xref>) is significant, and cellular signaling in the decidua may determine whether these conditions develop. Decidualization is the remodeling of the endometrium initiated after ovulation that is necessary for adequate trophoblast invasion and subsequent placentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Defective decidualization (DD) entails the inability of the endometrial compartment to undertake tissue differentiation, leading to aberrations in placentation and compromising pregnancy health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garrido-Gómez et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In humans and other great apes, the formation of the decidua is a conceptus-independent process driven by progesterone and the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brar et al., 1997</xref>) that stimulates synthesis of a complex network of intracellular and secreted proteins through progesterone receptor (PR) activation. Endometrial decidualization involves secretory transformation of uterine glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelleher et al., 2018</xref>), influx of specialized immune cells, vascular remodeling, and morphological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dunn et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramathal et al., 2010</xref>), biochemical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giudice et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabbour and Critchley, 2001</xref>), and transcriptional reprogramming of the endometrial stromal compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). We recently characterized the transcriptomics of human decidualization at single-cell resolution from secretory endometrial samples and showed that the process is initiated gradually after ovulation, with a direct interplay between stromal fibroblasts and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, most knowledge on decidual function in health and disease comes from in vitro model systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganeff et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to discern the preconception decidual transcriptomic signature associated with in vivo DD. We performed a comparative global transcriptional profiling of endometrium in women who developed sPE in a previous pregnancy. Initially, we identified 593 genes differentially expressed in sPE compared to control cases. Then, molecular DD fingerprint of 120 genes associated with the development of sPE was defined and evaluated as a diagnostic tool in an independent cohort of samples. Finally, we identified PR and estrogen receptor 1 (ER1) as targets of the DD fingerprint genes. Our findings indicate that an endometrial transcriptomic signature persists years after the affected pregnancy. This signature may be leveraged for a preconception or early prenatal screening strategy in assessing sPE risk and may inform the development of sPE therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s2"

study for endometrial RNA-sequencing analysis. Endometrial samples were obtained for research purposes during late secretory phase in 24 women who had developed sPE in a previous pregnancy and in 16 women with no history of sPE with full term (n = 8) and preterm pregnancies (n = 8) as controls. sPE was clinically defined based on elevated blood pressure (systolic ≥160 or diastolic of ≥100 mm Hg) or thrombocytopenia, impaired liver function, progressive renal insufficiency, pulmonary edema, or the onset of cerebral or visual disturbances. Endometrial biopsies were processed to obtain RNA and then converted to cDNA for library generation to perform next-generation sequencing. The experimental design was based on a stratified random sampling with a 70:30 proportion in two cohorts: a training (n = 29) and validation (n = 11) set of samples. The training set of samples was analyzed by RNA-seq to identify the global transcriptomic profiling changes between control (n = 12) and sPE (n = 17) samples. Selection criteria were applied to define a transcriptomic fingerprinting associated with DD detected in sPE. Finally, targeted analysis of the DD signature was validated in the test set composed of controls (n = 4) and sPE (n = 7).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Human donors</title><p>Endometrial samples were collected from women aged 18–42 without any medical condition who had been pregnant 1–8 years earlier. All participants had regular menstrual cycles (26–32 days) with no underlying gynecological pathological conditions and had not received hormonal therapy in the 3 months preceding sample collection. After the inclusion criteria were applied, endometrial biopsies were obtained by pipelle catheter (Genetics Hamont-Achel, Belgium) under sterile conditions in the late secretory phase (cycle days 22–32). Specimens were kept in preservation solution until processing. Maternal and neonatal characteristics of women with sPE and controls are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Biological and technical variables for each donor were considered to discard confounding effects on the transcriptomic profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of University and Polytechnic La Fe Hospital (Valencia, Spain; 2011/0383), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before tissue collection and all samples were anonymized.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>Total RNA from endometrial biopsies was isolated using QIAsymphony RNA kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA concentrations were quantified using a Multiskan GO spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA) at a wavelength of 260 nm. Integrity of the total RNA samples was evaluated by the RNA integrity number (RIN) and DV200 metrics using an Agilent high-sensitivity RNA ScreenTape in a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies Inc, Santa Clara, CA).

The RNA fragmentation, first- and second-strand cDNA syntheses, end repair, single ‘A’ base addition, adaptor ligation, and PCR amplification were performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The average size of the cDNA libraries was approximately 350 bp (including the adapters). cDNA libraries were quantified using an Agilent D1000 ScreenTape in a 4200 TapeStation system (Agilent Technologies Inc). Libraries were normalized to 10 nM and pooled in equal volumes. The pool concentration was quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (Kapa Biosystems Inc) before sequencing in a NextSeq 500/550 cartridge of 150 cycles (Illumina).

The manipulation of SAM and BAM files was done with the software SAMtools (version 1.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2009</xref>). To count the number of reads that could be assigned to each gene, we used HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) and BEDtools software (version 2.17.0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quinlan and Hall, 2010</xref>) to obtain gene coverage and work with bedFiles. Quality control filters in each program were used following the software package recommendations, and reads were filtered by mapping quality greater than 90%. Transcriptomic data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE172381). The Bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) was used to analyze differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The trimmed mean of M-values normalization method was applied to our gene expression values. The glmTreat function was used to find DEGs between groups. The p-value adjustment method was false discovery rate (FDR) with a cutoff of 0.05 (FDR &lt; 0.05) and the fold-change (FC) threshold was 1.2. edgeR analysis was carried out in R version 3.5.1. A volcano plot was created to visualize DEGs.

String software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen et al., 2009</xref>) was used to construct network connections visualized with Cytoscape software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). The interactome contained 117 nodes directly interconnected by 361 edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This DD fingerprint network showed a highly enriched protein–protein interaction (PPI) in sPE; indeed, the interconnection between nodes was significantly higher than the 93 edges expected (PPI enrichment p&lt;1.0e-16). Clustering revealed three main modules based on their connectivity degree, with functionally relevant genes involved in gland morphogenesis, cell migration, extracellular matrix organization, stromal cell differentiation, cellular response to DNA damage stimulus, and regulation of cell cycle. The hub genes were determined by overlapping the top 10 genes obtained using two topological analysis methods in the cytoHubba plugin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chin et al., 2014</xref>), MCC, and MNC. Five genes were selected, all of which were downregulated. Interestingly, both ER1 and PR were strongly embedded in the network and highly connected with DD fingerprinting, highlighting the interaction of hormonal receptors with notable decidualization mediators such as <italic>IHH</italic> and <italic>MSX2</italic> validated by RT-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Furthermore, the interactome demonstrated a direct interaction between ER1 and PR. These results support the transcriptomic dysfunction of the genes present in the DD signature through imbalanced hormone receptor signaling in sPE.</p><p>We then analyzed the expression of <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PGR</italic> in the endometrial tissue from a subset of women with prior sPE (N = 13) compared to controls (N = 9) by RT-qPCR.

These results were confirmed at the protein level by immunohistochemical analysis of ER1 and PR-B in endometrial biopsies collected in the late secretory phase from women with previous sPE (n = 4) and controls (n = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I and J</xref>). Both receptors were highly expressed through the decidualized endometrium, especially in the secretory glands in controls. In contrast, their expression was greatly reduced or absent in sPE samples. These results suggest that the DD transcriptomic signature implicates dysregulated ER1 and PR-B signaling in the late secretory phase in sPE patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Most scientific and clinical diagnostic efforts in sPE focus on placental surrogates. In this context, shallow cytotrophoblast invasion induces deficient vascular remodeling and ultimately aberrant placentation. This leads to placental ischemia and the release of soluble factors that induce the maternal syndrome, including the imbalanced levels of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFLT1) and placental growth factor (PlGF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Powe et al., 2011</xref>). sFLT1 protein binds to PlGF, preventing its interaction with endothelial receptors and leading to endothelial dysfunction. Accordingly, sFLT1 is increased, while free PlGF is decreased in serum from women with PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Levine et al., 2004</xref>). The sFLT1/PlGF ratio has been proposed as a biomarker showing a positive predictive value of 36.7%, with 66.2% sensitivity and 83.1% specificity but its application is effective only 4 weeks before PE symptoms manifest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeisler et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, during the first trimester there is a lack of high sensitivity and specificity screening methods to detect sPE early and prevent mortality and morbidity.</p><p>Current strategies based on placental dysfunction provide delayed results for preventive interventions and new approaches are urgently needed. Recent studies suggest that sPE might also be a disorder of the decidua, opening new avenues. In this sense, there may be a molecular signature associated with impaired endometrial maturation during early pregnancy in women who develop sPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rabaglino et al., 2015</xref>). Our previous work demonstrated that hESC isolated from patients with previous sPE failed to decidualize in vitro, suggesting a role of the maternal factor in the development of this disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, molecular pathways of dysregulated decidualization in PE are also found in endometrial disorders such as implantation failure, recurrent miscarriage, and endometriosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabaglino and Conrad, 2019</xref>). Increasing evidence supports the detriment of inappropriate decidualization before pregnancy to reproductive outcomes, and the role of DD in the origin of sPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garrido-Gómez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we highlighted the underlying molecular defect that may explain in vivo decidualization failure as an important contributor to shallow placental invasion in sPE. For this purpose, we investigated the role of the decidua by leveraging global RNA-seq in late secretory endometrium. We identified 593 genes differentially expressed in sPE compared to controls, including genes involved in decidualization such as <italic>PRL</italic>, <italic>IL6</italic>, and <italic>IHH</italic>, as well as several novel genes. Nine of the DEGs overlapped with DEGs obtained in our previous in vitro decidualization study. In vivo endometrial biopsies include other cells in addition to hESC, and thus the expected degree of overlap between both in vitro and in vivo approaches should be modest as such was observed. However, we identified a large percentage of those DEGs that were associated with in vivo transcriptomic profile of hESC resolved at cell level from a healthy late secretory endometrium. Thus, the high number of our identified in vivo DEGs reflects the high complexity of decidualization at cellular heterogeneity in a physiological stage of women with previous sPE.</p><p>Previous reports of the decidual transcriptome in PE and sPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Løset et al., 2011</xref>) revealed the gene expression profile associated with the condition at the time of delivery. Here, we analyzed samples collected years after the affected pregnancy; thus, it could be interesting to find dysregulated genes in common among these approaches. We compared our transcriptomic results and the previously reported dysregulated decidual genes, obtaining 1.3% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrido-Gomez et al., 2017</xref>) and 1.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Løset et al., 2011</xref>) overlap in affected genes. These discordances may not be unexpected and are consistent with recent results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabaglino and Conrad, 2019</xref>). The decidua basalis transcriptome at delivery was compared with the transcriptome of decidua at ⁓11.5 gestational weeks and in vitro decidualized hESC from women who experienced sPE. Both analyses revealed little, if any, overlap between molecular signatures. In contrast, the signature encoding in vitro DD of hESC years after pregnancy overlapped significantly with the dysregulated profile found in decidual samples at the beginning of pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rabaglino and Conrad, 2019</xref>). Thus, decidual gene expression patterns during the clinically active disease largely differ from those observed during endometrial decidualization at the end of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, perhaps reflecting a consequence rather than the origin of sPE.</p><p>From the 593 genes differentially expressed in sPE compared to controls, we identified a DD signature comprising 120 genes associated with sPE. This sPE-DD signature includes genes that allowed us to segregate samples from the training set into sPE and control groups, which were confirmed by the test set. One sPE was misclustered in the test set, such that 90.9% of samples from an independent cohort were properly clustered in the dendrogram. Having controlled for confounding effects of biological and technical variables, we consider that this misclustering is consistent with the nature of decidualization and its inherent variability. Decidualization is a highly dynamic process governed by (1) inter-individual variability in the endometrial menstrual cycle supported by displacement of the window of implantation in one out of four patients experiencing recurrent implantation failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diaz-Gimeno et al., 2011</xref>), (2) the physiology of the spatial expansion of decidualization process starting in some areas around spiral arteries and extending to the entire endometrium during the last days of the menstrual cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>), (3) and the random spatial sampling during the endometrial biopsy that could influences cell-type proportions, which is inherent to the experimental strategy used in our investigation. Decidua sample segregation is consistent with the results presented by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Munchel et al., 2020</xref>, who classified PE patients based on circulating RNA (C-RNA). In our study, we determined that the gene expression associated with DD had the highest potential to segregate sPE.</p><p>Interestingly, most of the DD fingerprint genes in sPE were related to the downregulation of <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PGR</italic>, specifically <italic>PGR-B</italic>. We hypothesize that low expression of <italic>PGR-B</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic> activates endometrial decidualization by dysregulating progesterone (P4) and estrogen (E2) action. Consequently, P4- and E2-related cellular signaling may be compromised, leading to the development of DD. Stromal cell differentiation, stromal–epithelial crosstalk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), extracellular matrix degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh et al., 2012</xref>), immune system response, and endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okada et al., 2018</xref>) may all be disrupted by low expression of <italic>PGR-B</italic> and <italic>ESR1</italic>. Remarkably, the local immune system appeared to be dysregulated due to the altered expression of interleukins, cytokines, chemokines, and immunoglobulin, which could disrupt the tolerant microenvironment at the maternal–fetal interface in pregnancy and contribute to the development of sPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erlebacher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harris et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Based on our findings, we postulate that in non-sPE pregnancies balanced hormonal signaling leads to proper decidualization, which in turn interacts with immune and endothelial cells to control cytotrophoblast invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). P4 and E2 activate their receptors in the epithelium and signal to the stromal compartment. Likewise, stromal PR is activated by ER1, which induces target genes involved in decidualization such as <italic>MSX2</italic>, <italic>CCNB1</italic>, and <italic>IL6</italic>.

Further, metalloproteinases such as <italic>MMP1</italic>, <italic>MMP7,</italic> and <italic>MMP11</italic> were downregulated in sPE, which could be associated to defective cell motility and extracellular matrix degradation.

Taken together, our findings reveal a DD transcriptomic fingerprint in sPE driven by an imbalance in ER1 and PR signaling.</p><p>Our findings reveal significant gene expression dysregulation underlying DD in the late secretory phase in women who have had sPE. The potential origin of sPE may lie in the downregulation of <italic>ESR1</italic> and <italic>PGR-B</italic>. Both receptors are strongly coordinated to regulate decidualization and <italic>PGR</italic> expression is induced by ER1, which is inhibited by PR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patel et al., 2015</xref>). E2 and P4 act through ER1 and PR in the epithelium and stroma and modulate the transcriptome and to promote crosstalk between both compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winuthayanon et al., 2010</xref>). ER1 in the epithelium regulates stromal decidualization via paracrine mechanisms mediated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which controls <italic>IHH</italic> expression that transduce the signal activation of PR in the stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pawar et al., 2015</xref>). Also, stromal ER1 activates PR in the same compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaya Okur et al., 2016</xref>). These findings could inform the development of therapeutic targets to restore optimal decidualization in sPE. Further studies are needed to fully elucidate the hormone signaling pathways that become dysregulated in sPE and the role of DD in the manifestation of the condition.</p><p>Preeclampsia is a syndrome in which different condition types might coexist; here, we focused on the maternal contribution to sPE through DD. We are not claiming that our findings are related to sPE heritability (DNA), but rather to the pathogenesis of the decidualization defect (RNA expression) involved in the origin of PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garrido-Gómez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ng et al., 2020</xref>). Our findings reinforce a maternal cause for sPE through DD. This condition may result from an aberrant response to estrogen and progesterone mediated by ER1 and PR-B signaling. However, the primary driver of the predisposition to undergo decidualization resistance and its link with the main risk factors of sPE remain to be determined. Our work is an important step toward the development of new strategies that enable early assessment of risk for sPE and might prompt new therapeutic strategies to treat this enigmatic pathological condition. Future studies should focus on the translational potential of the DD fingerprinting to develop new noninvasive strategies based on circulating RNA to improve diagnosis and prognostication for women with sPE.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Investigation, Project administration, Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: This study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Hospital La Fe (Valencia, Spain) (2011/0383), and written informed consent was obtained from all participants before tissue collection and all samples were anonymized (Included in Methods section - Human donors).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Maternal and neonatal characteristics of endometrial donors.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70753-supp1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Biological and technical variables of interest for controlling confounding effects in the RNA-seq analysis.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70753-supp2-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>RT-qPCR primers list.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="doc" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70753-supp3-v1.doc"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70753-transrepform1-v1.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Transcriptomic data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE172381) (Included in results and material and methods section).

Although the question of molecular drivers preeclampsia has been explored at the molecular level directly in the placenta, this study provides a unique view in the endometrium of women years after the pregnancy in question, which is consistent with the fact that a previous preeclamptic pregnancy is one of the best predictors for a subsequent preeclamptic pregnancy.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disrupted PGR-B and ESR1 signaling underlies preconceptional defective decidualization linked to severe preeclampsia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the 3 reviewers noted the potential of the study, major concerns were raised about the soundness/clarity of the transcriptomics analysis, as well as lack of clarity on the study population. Specifically:</p><p>1. The manuscript needs to undergo major revisions in the statistics and transcriptomics analyses (see specific points with details in reviewers 1 and 2 comments):</p><p>a. The use of fold-change thresholding needs to be removed/updated.</p><p>b. Multiple hypothesis correction needs to be used prior to determining significance with genome-wide datasets. Please use FDR correction or other accepted methods.</p><p>c. Only use Student t-tests when data normality can be confirmed, otherwise, use non-parametric tests.</p><p>d. Since this study is done on endometria sampled <italic>years</italic> after actual pregnancy, it would be crucial to compare to public datasets on actual placentas, to determine overlap and differences.</p><p>e. PCA cannot be used to determine clustering or lack thereof, as well as whether differences exist or not.</p><p>f. There are concerns about batches and co-variates not taken into account (see reviewers 1 and 3 points) which could lead to the absence of DEGs. These need to be clearly stated and provided in a table. They also need to be corrected for, either using batch removal and/or multivariate modeling.</p><p>g. A continuous GSEA-type analysis would be more informative than a thresholded approach for functional enrichment (i.e. GO) analysis.</p><p>h. RT-qPCR (especially on the exact same sample set) is not an appropriate validation for robust RNA-seq datasets.</p><p>2. The authors needs to substantially revise and improve the details on methodology (i.e. RIN threshold), as well as deposit all code and data to public databases for re-analysis. This is crucial for long-term reproducibility and use of this as a resource. Analytical choices against the general rule of the field (such as using hg19 and not the more recent better annotated hg38) should be justified or at least explicitly addressed.</p><p>3. The patient population needs to be better defined (see reviewer 3 points, and to a lesser degree reviewer 1).</p><p>4. Make sure to define all abbreviations, and avoid using non-standard abbreviations to improve readability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. There are major concerns about the statistics in the analysis of the dataset.</p><p>a. Fold-change thresholding is used in multiple places in the analysis (e.g. line 94, 112, 128, etc.). This is a big problem, as it is known to lead to poor FDR control in the case of statistical tests not designed to take fold change into account (like edgeR used here). Thus, the practice of fold-change filtering without FDR control is considered problematic by statisticians (see PMID: 19176553). Thus, either the authors need to update their results after removing this problematic criteria to properly control for FDR, or all analyses should be rerun with a method that takes fold-change into account for FDR control (e.g. the TREAT method PMID: 19176553).</p><p>b. For the GO enrichment analysis (line 133), the authors only indicate a p-value filter (p &lt; 0.005). Was there not implementation of multiple testing correction? The data should be re-analyzed after proper multiple hypothesis correction control (native DEseq2 FDR, Bonferroni, or other). In addition, what was the gene list background used to compute enrichment? The nature of the background has been shown to hugely impact results and needs to be explicitly detailed in the methods.</p><p>c. The authors reports using Student t-tests (section starting line 404). Unless normality is proven (e.g. with a Shapiro-Wilkes test), parametric tests that relie on normal distributions should never be used. We recommend that all tests be rerun with non-parametric equivalents (e.g. Wilcoxon or Mann Whitney) to guarantee these assumptions are not violated.</p><p>2. With human sample studies, it is unlikely that all samples were processed exactly in parallel (i.e. all samples collected the same day, kept in stabilizer for the same amount of time, etc.), which all but guarantees the existence of batch effects. There are also a number of stated parameters (i.e. age of the donor, time since pregnancy 1-8 years, day in cycle 22-32, etc.) that could influence results without a relevant biological driver.</p><p>a. In addition to an aggregated table (Table 1), the authors should generate a table for each anonymized sample for key characteristics so that the resource can be analyzed with these caveats considered both in this current paper and to facilitate all future reanalysis attempts. This should include for each sample individually:</p><p>i. age of the donor.</p><p>ii. time since last pregnancy.</p><p>iii. day of cycle for biopsy.</p><p>iv. date of processing/batch (including biopsy batch, library batch AND sequencing batch).</p><p>v. RIN of RNA sample.</p><p>vi. Sequencing depth (raw reads per library).</p><p>vii. Percent reads mapping to the genome reference (here hg19).</p><p>viii. Ethnicity of donor.</p><p>b. The authors should implement a multivariate model to account for all these potential confounding effects so as to focus on the core biological signal. In addition, the use of a software like SVA or RUVseq is recommended to remove unwanted technical variation prior to analyses.</p><p>3. Additional methodological information is needed for long-term reproducibility of analyses.</p><p>a. For reproducibility of code and analyses, all analytical code for this study should be deposited in a repository such as Github or made available as a Supplementary file.</p><p>b. Please include all version numbers for all used software (e.g. R, etc.) packages and R packages (e.g. edgeR, goana, etc.), as well as all command parameters where relevant. The same should be applied to annotation databases (i.e. GO used here), and if a version number doesn't exist, date of access should be provided.</p><p>c. There is no mention of the softwares (nor versions) used to trim RNA-seq reads, to map to the hg19 genome or to aggregate counts to genes. All used software should be clearly named and their use described with all necessary options for reproducibility.</p><p>d. Line 84-88/Figure 1A, were the subtypes of &quot;control&quot; samples (pre vs. full-term) equally distributed in training vs. testing? Indeed, although the authors argue that the subtype made no difference on transcriptional profiles (i.e. Sup Figure 1A PCA), this reviews sees a general (if not clean separation) on PC1, that would probably be enhanced if sources of spurious variation (see point #2) were taken into account. In any case, the data provided cannot be used to support the statement &quot;demonstrated an absence of clustering&quot; (line 80), since the statistical tests used are not meant to prove the null hypothesis but to reject it when possible (i.e. confusion between type I and II error). Please amend the analysis to reflect this.</p><p>e. cDNA library cannot be validated for RIN (line 330), as only total RNA samples can be. The entire method section needs to be completely rechecked and rewritten for accuracy to avoid this kind of errors.</p><p>f. All used QC filters should be stated explicitly in the methods (see lines 338-342).</p><p>4. Since RT-qpCR is known to be less sensitive and more prone to normalizing biases (due to the choice of control genes which may vary themselves) than RNA-seq (which performs unbiased normalization at the transcriptome-wide level), it is unclear why validation was performed on the same samples that were processed by RNA-seq (line 375-389). Unless the authors want to include RT-qPCR data on an INDEPENDENT cohort of patients, these results are circular and shouldn't be included in a revised manuscript. If RT-qPCR on a new cohort is included, make sure to include information on which normalizing amplicons were used for δ CT calculation.</p><p>5. Can the authors explain why 3 specific samples (C20, 21, 22; line 147-152) do NOT cluster appropriately with their &quot;signature&quot;? Did they have any biological specificities (see need for sample-by-sample information as raised in point #2)? The fact that 3 control samples cluster with the sPE samples somewhat invalidate the signature as a signature of sPE, and may be the result of improper correction for batching or other technical (or irrelevant biological) noise. Please discuss explicitly what may be happening here in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In sum, I feel that this paper brings some interesting insights on the decidua status and preeclampsia; the degree of novelty is nevertheless unclear to me, and the clinical application seems far-fetched. There are several points that may be better presented and discussed.</p><p>Detail of the recommendations to the authors:</p><p>1. The study of the decidual transcriptome in preeclampsia has also already been performed by other teams in the past, rather at the moment of the disease than later. For instance, the paper of Mari Loset (Am J Obst Gynecol, 2011), is, I feel, an important base for comparison with the results presented here. So much so, that it used the same type of expressional approaches, and detected differential transcripts and cascades. I feel that the authors should analyze their own datasets in light of this type of seminal papers and discuss the commonalities and differences found.</p><p>2. In the overrepresented pathways in the Loset's work, the regulation by ESR1 and PGR was not obvious. Does it mean that analyzing samples 3-4 years after the event (normal or pathological pregnancy) leads to remnants of the disease at the uterine level, or is there a genetic predisposition? This is a question that cannot be truly addressed by the present dataset, and is important if the objective is to define markers, as stated below.</p><p>The introduction gives the necessary details to understand the question raised, finding a signature that could help assessing the risk of preeclampsia.</p><p>3. However, the genetic part of preeclampsia is estimated by a heritability of ~55%. The genetic decomposition of this heritability presented by Cnattingius and coworkers (2004) indicate that only part of this genetics is connected to the maternal genetic background (which concerns two organs: the uterus and thus the decidua) and the placenta for half of its genetics. Part of the genetics of preeclampsia is associated only to the paternal genetics (estimated at ~1/3 of the heritability), therefore, it is clear that the risk cannot systematically be found by analysis of the female (uterine-decidua) expression profile only. Alternatively, the difference observed by the authors may be a consequence of the previous preeclampsia not based on a predisposition, but if this is the case, it limits considerably the usefulness of the markers found since preeclampsia, and in particular severe preeclampsia is at 75% a disease of the first pregnancy. The authors should recognize this as an important limit as an early prenatal screening strategy.</p><p>The initial analysis is based upon the endometrial tissue of 24 women that had a severe preeclampsia, 16 controls (8 preterm and 8 term births). Gestational age at delivery had apparently no influence on the 'control' groups. Since the samples were not collected at the end of gestation, which means that the occurrence of preterm may be connected to the placenta and not to the maternal uterine situation.</p><p>4. Nevertheless, there are only 8+8 samples so it is not possible to prove that in some case a decidual expression is not involved. In addition, using PCA to check that there is no clustering is not enough to certify that there are no differentially expressed genes that separate the two groups, it means only that the number of differential genes compared to the mass of genes that are not differentially expressed is not enough to cluster the groups, which may be the case if the percentage of genes changed is small. There are some published evidences that recurrent spontaneous abortion, pre-term birth and preeclampsia share common mechanisms. The observation here seems to indicate that the uterus of women with PTB is identical to the one of term pregnancies. From the clinical data, the authors acted wisely in taking PTB without hypertension. But it is not clear from the data that the women that had PTB had a recurrent occurrence in this (not mentioned in Table S1).</p><p>5. In addition, the absence of DEG genes visible (Supplementary Figure 1B) is presented against FDR and not p-value which is unusual and I think a bot too stringent. Even random samples should give some significant genes (one out of 20) Using FDR leads to no significant genes, which is not a complete surprise. However, it does not mean that individual genes are not relevant for the difference between the two situations analyzed. Another interesting approach should be to check for enrichment of pathways using GSEA approaches, that do not rest on the establishment of thresholds that are always arbitrary. In sum excluding totally the existence of DEG between the two groups seem a bit rapid.</p><p>6. In the legend of Suppl figure S1, I do not understand 'Plot based on 728 genes labeled as fc (blue) and 17,748 genes labeled as none (purple)'. Nevertheless, it is admissible that the differences due to preterm or term are negligible compared to the differences induced by sPE.</p><p>The decomposition of the samples between sets for simulations is unusual in the field, but mathematically sound.

It would be nice to analyze the data not only relative to a threshold of induction, but taking the complete dataset and using GSEA-like approaches to see whether they are consistent with the gene clusters found by threshold-volcano plots analyses.</p><p>Previous studies by the authors evaluate gene expression differences in decidualization either from human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) from women with sPE versus normal. The authors identified 18 genes differentially expressed in vivo and in vitro in sPE compared to control.</p><p>8. The authors do question the observation of having only 18 common genes between in vivo and in vitro, out of 129 or 859 (in vitro – previous study- and in vivo -present study- respectively), and base them upon cell composition that is much more complex in vivo, which is reasonable. However, in the search for a signature, which is one of the justifications of the work, it could mean that the in vivo dataset could contain more 'relevant' genes compared to a in vitro model. The comparison with the results of Wang, which is much better (and focused better on a simple cell model) on the single-cell transcriptome may belong rather to a discussion rather than a results part of the paper. The validation by qRT-PCR is good, but the choice of the genes leads to a very high correlation (2D), that may be due to the use of only one induced gene (and only 5 genes used). About the actin as a control housekeeping gene, it is not sure that it is the best reporter gene in the uterine context. Generally, it is advised to normalize against the geometric mean of two to four different reporter genes.</p><p>A selection of 166 highly deregulated genes (&gt;4 fold) is then selected, and were shown to be enough to separate efficiently the samples, which is not surprising, given that this corresponds to a semi-supervised analysis from genes found differential between the two gene sets.</p><p>9. The identification of Estrogen/progesterone receptor is not a surprise, when uterus function is concerned. I would suggest that the authors complete their analyses using network analyses such as provided by the combination of Stringdb and Cytoscape. This would help to visualize the pivotal position of ESR1 and PGR more clearly, or maybe to find other important hubs that were overlooked in their current study. Also using GSEA or other tools on transcription factor binding sites databases, showing the actual involvement (through measuring the enrichment, and calculation of FDRs) of the Estrogen Responsive Element and Progesterone Responsive Element would be an essential element that must be shown to prove a genuine enrichment in these cascades</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There is much debate on whether the risk of PE is higher/lower in women with male vs. female fetuses.

There are major concerns about the statistics in the analysis of the dataset.</p><p>a. Fold-change thresholding is used in multiple places in the analysis (e.g. line 94, 112, 128, etc.). This is a big problem, as it is known to lead to poor FDR control in the case of statistical tests not designed to take fold change into account (like edgeR used here). Thus, the practice of fold-change filtering without FDR control is considered problematic by statisticians (see PMID: 19176553). Thus, either the authors need to update their results after removing this problematic criteria to properly control for FDR, or all analyses should be rerun with a method that takes fold-change into account for FDR control (e.g. the TREAT method PMID: 19176553).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their feedback that allows us to explain in more detail the statistical analysis performed in the manuscript. First, we would like to highlight that all the analyses were performed with a proper false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff as the basic criterion. Specifically, we used the exactTest function (edgeR package) that is recommended to make comparisons on datasets with a single-factor design, allowing us to achieve a global exploratory approach. This function uses the p-value adjustment method FDR, and a cutoff of 0.05 (FDR&lt;0.05) was applied to identify significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Once we obtained the DEGs, we selected those with a high fold change (FC≥2) to identify differences large enough to be biologically meaningful. We specified these two criteria (FDR&lt;0.05 and FC≥2) in each line where the DEGs were described (e.g., Lines 94, 112, 128) and in the “Differential expression analysis” section in the Material and Methods (Lines 341–342), but we now provide more detail on the statistical analysis information used in this work.</p><p>– Specifically, we rewrote the “Quality control and pre-processing data” and “differential expression analysis” sections of the Materials and methods. These sections were replaced by a new section titled “RNA-seq analysis” (Lines 144-167): “Reads were mapped to the hg19 human genome transcriptome using the STAR (version 2.4.2a) read aligner (1). FastQC (version 0.11.2) was used to determine the quality of FASTQ files. The manipulation of SAM and BAM files was done with the software SAMtools (version 1.1) (2). To count the number of reads that could be assigned to each gene, we used HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) (3) and BEDtools software (version 2.17.0) (4) to obtain gene coverage and work with bedFiles. Quality control filters at each program were used following the software package recommendations, and reads were filtered by mapping quality greater than 90%. Transcriptomic data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE172381). The Bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3) (5) was used to analyze differentially expressed genes. The trimmed mean of M-values normalization method was applied to our gene expression values. The exactTest function was used to find differentially expressed genes between groups. The p-value adjustment method was FDR with a cut-off of 0.05 (FDR&lt;0.05). Once p-value was adjusted, significant deregulated genes with log2-fold-change ≥1 (FC≥2) were selected to perform gene ontology analysis and to formulate the signature encoding defective decidualization. edgeR analysis was carried out in R version 3.5.1. A volcano plot was created to visualize DEGs. For a better overview, we distinguished significant (FDR&lt;0.05) and not significant (FDR≥0.05) DEGs with a high (FC≥2) or low fold-change (threshold FC&lt;2).”</p><p>– We improved the explanation about the statistical analyses used in the Results section (Line 270-273): “Transcriptional analysis in the training set was performed by comparing gene expression patterns in sPE (n=17) and controls (n=12). This comparison revealed 859 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) based on FDR&lt;0.05 and at least two-fold differential expression between groups (FC≥2)” and (Line 293-295): “Eighteen genes were similarly differentially expressed with at least a two-fold change between groups (FDR&lt;0.05 and FC≥2) (Figure 2A).”</p><p>– The legend of Figure 1B was also updated (Lines 673-675): “not significant-lowFC (FDR≥0.05, FC&lt;2); not significant-highFC (FDR≥0.05; FC≥2); significant-lowFC (FDR&lt;0.05; FC&lt;2); and significant-highFC (FDR&lt;0.05; FC≥2).”</p><p>– Supplementary file 3 has changed its name by “Figure1-Source data 1” and was included p-values, FDR values (corrected p-values), log FC, and FC, and we included how the criteria were applied in the legend, (lines 779-780) “Figure1-Source data 1. The 859 statistically differential expressed genes (FDR&lt;0.05) with at least two-fold change (FC ≥ 2) in sPE vs control cases obtained from RNA-seq analysis.”</p><p>– The Supplementary file 4 have changed its name by “Figure 3-Source data 1” and legend was updated (783-784): “List of genes selected as the defective decidualization signature in sPE (166 DEGs with an FDR of &lt;0.05 and an FC of ≥4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. For the GO enrichment analysis (line 133), the authors only indicate a p-value filter (p &lt; 0.005). Was there not implementation of multiple testing correction? The data should be re-analyzed after proper multiple hypothesis correction control (native DEseq2 FDR, Bonferroni, or other). In addition, what was the gene list background used to compute enrichment? The nature of the background has been shown to hugely impact results and needs to be explicitly detailed in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>For this analysis, we followed the recommendation provided by the edgeR user’s guide:</p><p>“The p-values returned by goana and kegga are unadjusted for multiple testing. The authors have chosen not to correct automatically for multiple testing because GO terms and KEGG pathways are often overlapping, so standard methods of p-value adjustment may be very conservative. Users should be aware though that p-values are unadjusted, meaning that only very small p-values should be used for published results.”</p><p>For this reason, we selected a p-value filter of &lt;0.005. Supplementary file 5 includes the p-value for each GO reported to provide statistical information to readers that are interested in using this information for their own research. Moreover, GO annotations emphasized in the text and in Figure 3 have a p-value of &lt;0.005, with the vast majority lower than 0.00005. In addition, we agree with the reviewer that more information regarding the gene list background used to compute the analysis needs to be explicitly detailed, and we have added this information in Materials and methods.</p><p>– We rewrote the Enrichment analysis section of Materials and methods (Lines 180-188):</p><p>“GO analyses were conducted to obtain biological processes using the goana function in edgeR (62).

The authors reports using Student t-tests (section starting line 404).

With human sample studies, it is unlikely that all samples were processed exactly in parallel (i.e. all samples collected the same day, kept in stabilizer for the same amount of time, etc.), which all but guarantees the existence of batch effects.

In addition, the use of a software like SVA or RUVseq is recommended to remove unwanted technical variation prior to analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about the relevance of potential confounding factors of key characteristics on our transcriptomics results. We have applied an experimental design to minimize the impact of the main sources of batch effect on our gene expression data. Endometrial biopsies were preserved with stabilization solution and frozen at −80º until analysis to obtain the best-quality RNA. We used a balanced batch-group design. Specifically, case and control samples were included and were balanced and processed at the same time in the same technical batch, including the RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing. The batches performed were reduced to the minimal number of three. Additionally, before conducting the transcriptomic analysis, the confounding effects of main technical and clinical variables were tested. Once confounding effects were discarded, we performed a differential gene expression analysis. We included in the revised manuscript this additional information used as a basic starting point in our data analysis. In (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>), we provide to the reviewer some data from analyses to control for confounding effects in our experimental design. To exclude confounding effects in the gene expression analysis, we applied a principal variance component analysis (PVCA) to fit a mixed linear model using biological and technical variables as random effects to estimate and partition the total variability.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70753-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The results demonstrated that the effect of biological and technical variables evaluated individually are less than 0.05, and their confounding effects are negligible.

Line 84-88/Figure 1A, were the subtypes of &quot;control&quot; samples (pre vs. full-term) equally distributed in training vs. testing? Indeed, although the authors argue that the subtype made no difference on transcriptional profiles (i.e. Sup Figure 1A PCA), this reviews sees a general (if not clean separation) on PC1, that would probably be enhanced if sources of spurious variation (see point #2) were taken into account. In any case, the data provided cannot be used to support the statement &quot;demonstrated an absence of clustering&quot; (line 80), since the statistical tests used are not meant to prove the null hypothesis but to reject it when possible (i.e. confusion between type I and II error). Please amend the analysis to reflect this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this preterm versus full-term analysis should be better explained. Our null hypothesis is that there is<bold> </bold>no differential gene expression across the two subtypes of control samples (preterm versus full-term). We performed a differential gene expression analysis with a proper FDR cutoff for multiple testing comparing preterm versus full-term, revealing that there was no statistical evidence of transcriptomic changes associated with the gestational week at delivery in our set of samples. Thus, gene expression patterns do not provide evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis of “no difference in gene expression between women with preterm or full-term labor who had never had preeclampsia”. This result is shown in the volcano plot in Figure supplement 1A In addition to this plot, we include a PCA because it is a technique for reducing the dimensionality of datasets, increasing interpretability but at the same time minimizing information loss. Thus, we consider it interesting for readers to keep the PCA figure in the manuscript to visualize variance among samples. However, we rewrote this part of the results to clarify that there were no significant differences between control groups. Furthermore, we would like to highlight that the two control subtypes were represented in both subsets of analyzed samples.</p><p>We rewrote this part of the Results to clarify this statement (Lines 248-262):</p><p>“Controls included women who had a preterm birth with no signs of infection (n=8) and women who gave birth at full term with normal obstetric outcomes (n=8). Transcriptomic profiles were compared by differential expression analysis, revealing no significant changes in the endometrial transcriptome between preterm and term controls [false-discovery rate (FDR) ≥0.05] (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Principal component analysis (PCA) supported that there was no underlying pattern of distribution depending on gestational age at delivery (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).

Since RT-qpCR is known to be less sensitive and more prone to normalizing biases (due to the choice of control genes which may vary themselves) than RNA-seq (which performs unbiased normalization at the transcriptome-wide level), it is unclear why validation was performed on the same samples that were processed by RNA-seq (line 375-389). Unless the authors want to include RT-qPCR data on an INDEPENDENT cohort of patients, these results are circular and shouldn't be included in a revised manuscript. If RT-qPCR on a new cohort is included, make sure to include information on which normalizing amplicons were used for δ CT calculation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about the less sensitive value of RT-qPCR than that of RNA-seq.

Can the authors explain why 3 specific samples (C20, 21, 22; line 147-152) do NOT cluster appropriately with their &quot;signature&quot;? Did they have any biological specificities (see need for sample-by-sample information as raised in point #2)? The fact that 3 control samples cluster with the sPE samples somewhat invalidate the signature as a signature of sPE, and may be the result of improper correction for batching or other technical (or irrelevant biological) noise. Please discuss explicitly what may be happening here in a revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. The new Supplementary file 2 (containing sample-by-sample information raised in point #2) shows that there was no biological or technical variable that allowed for the identification of the potential source for this misclustering. We suspect that this was due to the complexity of decidualization biology, which is explained in the Discussion section (lines 274–282). Decidualization is a highly dynamic process that shows interindividual variability. In addition, endometrial maturation starts around spiral arteries and extends to the entire endometrium. Consequently, random spatial sampling could affect the proportions of the decidualized cell types during biopsy collection. In fact, other authors, such as Munchel et al., 2020 (PMID: 32611681), have reported a misclustering of controls and PE cases using other approaches. This result is expected due to the high variability inherent to the pregnant human population, PE patients, and the endometrial cycle.</p><p>We decided to improve the explanation of this misclustering in the Discussion.

There are several points that may be better presented and discussed.</p><p>Detail of the recommendations to the authors:</p><p>1. The study of the decidual transcriptome in preeclampsia has also already been performed by other teams in the past, rather at the moment of the disease than later. For instance, the paper of Mari Loset (Am J Obst Gynecol, 2011), is, I feel, an important base for comparison with the results presented here. So much so, that it used the same type of expressional approaches, and detected differential transcripts and cascades. I feel that the authors should analyze their own datasets in light of this type of seminal papers and discuss the commonalities and differences found.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. Loset’s work provided interesting insights of genetic canonical pathways and gene–gene interaction networks in decidua basalis from preeclamptic pregnancies at the end of pregnancy, as we previously did [Garrido-Gómez T. et al., 2017 (PMID: 28923940)]. The lack of coincidence between the transcriptomes of decidua during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy and decidualized endometrium in the secretory phase was expected. At the time of the decidua sampling in Loset’s paper, decidualization has already occurred, the decidua has been formed, and PE has been clinically manifested. Therefore, the pattern of gene expression in this tissue may be very different compared to cyclic decidualization without pregnancy or disease. However, following the reviewer’s suggestion, we compared our 859 DEGs with those 455 DEGs from Loset M et al., 2011. We found a modest overlap that included 28 genes, which is consistent with the expected outcome. We also compared our results with the dataset of decidua basalis and decidua parietalis dysregulated genes (79 and 227 DEGs, respectively) in sPE from our group [Garrido-Gómez T. et al., 2017 (PMID: 28923940)]. We found an overlap of 4 DEGs with decidua basalis and 14 DEGs with decidua parietalis. These results are consistent with Rabaglino MB et al., 2019, who performed multiple comparisons, including a comparison of the transcriptome of decidualized endometrial stromal cells from women who experienced sPE (PE-DEC) with the transcriptome of decidua basalis (PE-DB) and parietalis (PE-BP) from the placental bed of preeclamptic patients after delivery (PMID: 31356122). They found that there was little, if any, overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PE-DEC and decidua specimens. Moreover, the decidual transcriptome at delivery differs from the decidual tissue of chorionic villi samples collected at ∼11.5 weeks. The authors explain, “These discordances may not be unexpected given the timing of the sample procurement—i.e., PE-DB (decidua basalis obtained from placental bed biopsy) and PE-BP (basal plate decidua obtained from delivered placentas) were procured during clinically active disease that by itself seems likely to perturb decidual gene expression, thus perhaps reflecting consequence rather than cause of disease.” Accordingly, our previous studies demonstrated impaired in vitro decidualization of ESC isolated from delivered placentas, consistent with the concept of endometrial antecedents of sPE (PMID: 28923940).</p><p>We agree with the authors that the lack of concordance between transcriptomes may be due to different type of samples (decidua and decidualized endometrium), and different timing of disease (samples at the end of the affected pregnancy versus samples years after) must show large differences in expressed genes. Thus, we did not include this type of comparison in the manuscript. Finally, in the manuscript, we include our own in vitro dataset because we wanted to test the abundance of new transcripts revealed for the first time in our in vivo bulk tissue approach. Also, we include the single-cell results because they were obtained via an in vivo approach using endometrial biopsies from healthy women across the endometrial cycle. Thus, these data could help identify which of the genes that were found to be dysregulated in women who experienced PE are potentially expressed by endometrial stromal cells. Altogether, these comparisons provide new data that we consider interesting due to its novelty.</p><p>Discussion (Lines 417-429):</p><p>“Previous reports of the decidual transcriptome in PE and sPE (10, 43), revealed the gene expression profile associated with the condition at the time of delivery. Here, we analyszed samples collected years after the affected pregnancy; thus, it could be interesting to find dysregulated genes in common among these approaches. We compared our transcriptomic results and the previously reported deysregulated decidual genes, obtaining 5.1% (10) and 6.2% (43) overlap in affected genes. These discordances may not be unexpected and are consistent with recent results (42). The decidua basalis transcriptome at delivery was compared with the transcriptome of decidua at ⁓11.5 gestational weeks and in vitro decidualized hESC from women who experienced sPE. Both analyses revealed little, if any, overlap between molecular signatures. In contrast, the signature encoding in vitro DD of hESC years after pregnancy overlapped significantly with the dysregulated profile found in decidual samples at the beginning of pregnancy (42). Thus, decidual gene expression patterns during the clinically active disease largely differ from those observed during endometrial decidualization at the end of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy, perhaps reflecting a consequence rather than the origin of sPE.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the overrepresented pathways in the Loset's work, the regulation by ESR1 and PGR was not obvious. Does it mean that analyzing samples 3-4 years after the event (normal or pathological pregnancy) leads to remnants of the disease at the uterine level, or is there a genetic predisposition? This is a question that cannot be truly addressed by the present dataset, and is important if the objective is to define markers, as stated below.</p><p>The introduction gives the necessary details to understand the question raised, finding a signature that could help assessing the risk of preeclampsia.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this interesting issue for discussion. In Loset’s work, the authors were focused on canonical pathways that could be affected by dysregulated genes in PE, which was valuable to increase the knowledge of PE pathogenesis. However, important differences between Loset’s work and our work need to be mentioned to answer this point. In Loset’s work, the authors did not examine in-depth the origin of the identified gene dysregulation. Biological processes or pathways tend to be quite specific, making it difficult to find obvious associations. We went one step further trying to investigate the association with hormone receptor activation due to the key role of ovarian hormones in decidualization. We tested this hypothesis, and this association became obvious from our results. However, Loset et al., did not address the same question.</p><p>Regarding the question “Does it mean that analyzing samples 3–4 years after the event (normal or pathological pregnancy) leads to remnants of the disease at the uterine level or is there a genetic predisposition?”, we agree with the reviewer that it could not be answered. Other analyses are needed, such as genetic variant analysis, to know if there is a genetic predisposition. We acknowledge the existence of this altered decidual transcriptome in sPE years after delivery, but there are other works that demonstrate that a decidualization defect occurs at both the end and the beginning of pregnancy (PMID: 28923940, PMID: 31356122). In addition, endometrial decidualization as a primary factor in pregnancy health and evidence to support the role of deficient decidualization in the origin of PE were presented last year (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32521725">32521725</ext-link>, PMID: 33007270). Therefore, genetic predisposition for a decidualization defect is plausible on this basis.</p><p>Discussion (Lines 498-501):</p><p>“However, the primary driver of the predisposition to undergo decidualization resistance and its link with the main risk factors of sPE remain to be determined. Our work is an important step toward the development of new strategies that enable early assessment of risk for sPE and might prompt new therapeutic strategies to treat this enigmatic pathological condition.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. However, the genetic part of preeclampsia is estimated by a heritability of ~55%. The genetic decomposition of this heritability presented by Cnattingius and coworkers (2004) indicate that only part of this genetics is connected to the maternal genetic background (which concerns two organs: the uterus and thus the decidua) and the placenta for half of its genetics. Part of the genetics of preeclampsia is associated only to the paternal genetics (estimated at ~1/3 of the heritability), therefore, it is clear that the risk cannot systematically be found by analysis of the female (uterine-decidua) expression profile only. Alternatively, the difference observed by the authors may be a consequence of the previous preeclampsia not based on a predisposition, but if this is the case, it limits considerably the usefulness of the markers found since preeclampsia, and in particular severe preeclampsia is at 75% a disease of the first pregnancy. The authors should recognize this as an important limit as an early prenatal screening strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>Preeclampsia is a syndrome in which different condition subtypes might coexist. Thus, to advance in its understanding, we have focused on the maternal contribution to severe preeclampsia through defective decidualization. Also, we are not claiming that our findings are related to heritability (DNA), but rather to the pathogenesis of the decidualization defect (RNA expression) involved in the origin of severe PE (PMID: 32521725; PMID: 33007270).</p><p>Discussion (lines 493-496):</p><p>“Preeclampsia is a syndrome in which different condition subtypes might coexist; here, we focused on the maternal contribution to sPE through DD. We are not claiming that our findings are related to sPE heritability (DNA), but instead, our findings are related to the pathogenesis of the decidualization defect (RNA expression) involved in the origin of PE (12, 22)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The initial analysis is based upon the endometrial tissue of 24 women that had a severe preeclampsia, 16 controls (8 preterm and 8 term births). Gestational age at delivery had apparently no influence on the 'control' groups. Since the samples were not collected at the end of gestation, which means that the occurrence of preterm may be connected to the placenta and not to the maternal uterine situation.</p><p>4. Nevertheless, there are only 8+8 samples so it is not possible to prove that in some case a decidual expression is not involved. In addition, using PCA to check that there is no clustering is not enough to certify that there are no differentially expressed genes that separate the two groups, it means only that the number of differential genes compared to the mass of genes that are not differentially expressed is not enough to cluster the groups, which may be the case if the percentage of genes changed is small. There are some published evidences that recurrent spontaneous abortion, pre-term birth and preeclampsia share common mechanisms. The observation here seems to indicate that the uterus of women with PTB is identical to the one of term pregnancies. From the clinical data, the authors acted wisely in taking PTB without hypertension. But it is not clear from the data that the women that had PTB had a recurrent occurrence in this (not mentioned in Table S1).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to improve the clarity of this point in our manuscript. We performed a gene expression analysis comparing preterm with full-term labor, revealing that there were no transcriptomic changes associated with the gestational age at delivery in our set of samples. This result is shown in the volcano plot in Figure supplement1A. In addition to this plot, we include a PCA because it is a widely used conventional method for reducing data complexity and visualizing the variance among samples. Thus, gene expression patterns do not provide evidence for rejecting the null hypothesis of “no difference in gene expression between women with preterm or full-term labor who had never had preeclampsia”. We agree with the reviewer that the sample size is limited to state conclusions such as “the uterus of women with PTB is identical to the one of term pregnancies”, but this is not our objective nor our intention. Our hypothesis is to demonstrate that patients that experience previous sPE have transcriptomic changes in the endometrium during the late secretory phase. To find the altered transcripts, we compared a case group with a control group, which was heterogeneous for the gestational age at delivery; but, testing differences due to preterm or full-term labor are negligible in controls compared to the differences induced in the cases that experience sPE.</p><p>We have rewritten this part of the Results to clarify this statement (Lines 248-256):</p><p>“Controls included women who had a preterm birth with no signs of infection (n=8) and women who gave birth at full term with normal obstetric outcomes (n=8). Transcriptomic profiles were compared by differential expression analysis, revealing no significant changes in the endometrial transcriptome between preterm and term controls [false-discovery rate (FDR) ≥0.05] (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). Principal component analysis (PCA) supported that there was no underlying pattern of distribution depending on gestational age at delivery (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In addition, the absence of DEG genes visible (Supplementary Figure 1B) is presented against FDR and not p-value which is unusual and I think a bot too stringent. Even random samples should give some significant genes (one out of 20) Using FDR leads to no significant genes, which is not a complete surprise. However, it does not mean that individual genes are not relevant for the difference between the two situations analyzed. Another interesting approach should be to check for enrichment of pathways using GSEA approaches, that do not rest on the establishment of thresholds that are always arbitrary. In sum excluding totally the existence of DEG between the two groups seem a bit rapid.</p></disp-quote><p>The p-value adjustment method for multiple comparisons was an FDR with a cutoff of 0.05. Thus, we used the p-value adjusted for this analysis, and we applied the same method for the gene expression analysis between controls and sPE. We are comparing more than 18,000 genes between groups. With any p-value adjustment, we will obtain significant differences, but many of them would be false positives just by pure random chance. In this regard, FDR retains more significant p-values while increasing non-significant p<italic>-</italic>values than the Bonferroni method. Thus, we selected a less conservative adjustment method to identify differences if they exist, maintaining the FDR at 5%. In fact, the most preferable approach is controlling FDR as it not only reduces false positives but also minimizes false negatives (more details can be found in PMID: 30124010).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

This function uses the p-value adjustment method FDR (“False Discovery Rate”), and a cutoff of 0.05 was applied to identify DEGs. Once we obtained the significantly differentially expressed genes, we applied a second filtering step, fold change, to select those genes where differences were large enough to be biologically meaningful. To show visually the proportion of genes that pass through the filters (after analyzing the complete dataset), we used a volcano plot. We specified these two filters in each line, and we refer to DEGs and in the section “Differential expression analysis” from the Material and Methods, but we improve the information provided about the statistical analysis.</p><p>– Specifically, we rewrote “Quality control and pre-processing data” and “differential expression analysis” sections of the Materials and methods.

FastQC (version 0.11.2) was used to determine the quality of FASTQ files. The manipulation of SAM and BAM files was done with the software SAMtools (version 1.1) (26). To count the number of reads that could be assigned to each gene, we used HTSeq (version 0.6.1p1) (27) and BEDtools software (version 2.17.0) (28) to obtain gene coverage and work with bedFiles. Quality control filters in each program were used following the software package recommendations, and reads were filtered by mapping quality greater than 90%.. Transcriptomic data were deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus database (accession number GSE172381). The Bioconductor package edgeR (version 3.24.3) (29) was used to analyze differentially expressed genes. The trimmed mean of M-values normalization method was applied to our gene expression values. The exactTest function was used to find differentially expressed genes between groups. The p-value adjustment method was FDR with a cut-off of 0.05 (FDR&lt;0.05).

The authors do question the observation of having only 18 common genes between in vivo and in vitro, out of 129 or 859 (in vitro – previous study- and in vivo -present study- respectively), and base them upon cell composition that is much more complex in vivo, which is reasonable. However, in the search for a signature, which is one of the justifications of the work, it could mean that the in vivo dataset could contain more 'relevant' genes compared to a in vitro model. The comparison with the results of Wang, which is much better (and focused better on a simple cell model) on the single-cell transcriptome may belong rather to a discussion rather than a results part of the paper. The validation by qRT-PCR is good, but the choice of the genes leads to a very high correlation (2D), that may be due to the use of only one induced gene (and only 5 genes used).
