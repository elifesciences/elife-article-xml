The estimation of magnitudes has been characterized in primates, yet it is largely unexplored in nonprimate species. Here, we use time interval reproduction to study rodent behavior and its neural correlates in the context of magnitude estimation. We show that gerbils display primate-like magnitude estimation characteristics in time reproduction. Most prominently their behavioral responses show a systematic overestimation of small stimuli and an underestimation of large stimuli, often referred to as regression effect. We investigated the underlying neural mechanisms by recording from medial prefrontal cortex and show that the majority of neurons respond either during the measurement or the reproduction of a time interval. Cells that are active during both phases display distinct response patterns. We categorize the neural responses into multiple types and demonstrate that only populations with mixed responses can encode the bias of the regression effect. These results help unveil the organizing neural principles of time reproduction and perhaps magnitude estimation in general.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>interval timing</kwd><kwd>regression effect</kwd><kwd>central tendency</kwd><kwd>magnitude estimation</kwd><kwd>population coding</kwd><kwd>gerbil</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung, Wissenschaft und Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>01GQ1004A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henke</surname><given-names>Josephine</given-names></name><name><surname>Thurley</surname><given-names>Kay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mixed responses in single cells or distributed across a local population of neurons can explain regression effects during time reproduction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Animals including humans estimate the magnitude of physical stimuli, integrate path length, and keep track of duration to gather behaviorally relevant information from their environment. Although such estimates may ultimately be used for binary actions, like discriminating items or events and making decisions, the estimation itself is done on a continuum of values. Behavioral analyses over the past century established specific biases in magnitude estimation (e.g., reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petzschner et al., 2015</xref>) such as the <italic>regression effect</italic>, that is, the overestimation of small and the underestimation of large stimuli across a range of values (also known as regression to the mean, central tendency, or Vierordt’s law). Recently, this bias regained attention as it may be the result of an error minimization strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petzschner and Glasauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cicchini et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite a long history of behavioral research on magnitude estimation, its neural basis is not well understood. It is an ongoing debate whether a dedicated or distributed magnitude system exists in the brain (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cohen Kadosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bueti and Walsh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Opstal and Verguts, 2013</xref>). Human studies identified frontal, parietal, and striatal brain regions that are active during magnitude estimation. Recent studies with nonhuman primates used time interval reproduction experiments to investigate the connection between neural population dynamics in frontal and parietal cortices and magnitude estimation behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>). These studies focused on the estimation of time intervals lasting hundreds of milliseconds. What remains unclear is how their findings translate to durations of several seconds, that is, to time scales that are relevant for more complex and ecologically important behaviors like spatial navigation and action planning. Furthermore, it is unresolved to what extent the results generalize to nonprimate species.</p><p>We addressed these issues for Mongolian gerbils (<italic>Meriones unguiculatus</italic>) and designed a psychophysical task for time interval reproduction of several seconds on a continuous range. The task was implemented in virtual reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thurley and Ayaz, 2017</xref>), which allows for the precise control of the behaviorally relevant variables. We used gerbils because we could successfully train these animals in complex virtual reality tasks before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thurley et al., 2014</xref>). We and others also performed timing experiments with gerbils in virtual reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kautzky and Thurley, 2016</xref>) or alike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shankar and Ellard, 2000</xref>).</p><p>First, we demonstrate the capability of gerbils to precisely measure and reproduce time intervals of several seconds. We show that the gerbils’ responses display the regression effect, indicative of an error minimization strategy. Then, we present associated neural activity in gerbil medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) – a brain area that has been implicated in interval timing in rodents and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Genovesio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>). The activity we observed was composed of mixtures of responses including phasic activation and ramp-like firing patterns, response types well known from the interval timing literature (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>). Since our task involves measurement and reproduction, that is, the timing of an external event and of one’s own behavior, we could test how individual cells participated in both. To make the variety of responses accessible, we provide a comprehensive characterization of activity at the single neuron level and show that, despite the response heterogeneity, the mPFC population jointly measures and reproduces time intervals lasting several seconds. We find that different types of ramping neurons are necessary to explain the regression effect and thus to gain a mechanistic understanding of the neural basis of time reproduction and perhaps of magnitude estimation in general. This reveals that variables underlying cognitive functions may be encoded by mixed responses within a local neural population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral characteristics of time reproduction in gerbils</title><p>We trained gerbils to measure and reproduce the duration of time intervals lasting a few seconds.

Across the range of stimuli, small stimuli were overestimated whereas large stimuli were underestimated, that is, the regression effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petzschner et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> gives an example from a single experimental session. To quantify the regression effect across sessions and animals, we calculated the slope of linear fits between stimuli and reproductions in each session. The slopes increased during training (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), indicating learning and improvement in the time reproduction task, but remained at levels less than 1 in the actual experimental sessions due to the regression effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Variability, that is, the coefficient of variation (CV), decreased with training and remained at low levels during the actual experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The CV correlated with the strength of regression, indicating a connection between the regression effect and error minimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Some sessions showed a general under- or overestimation in addition to the regression effect (bias, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To keep the animals motivated, we gave them feedback on their reproduction performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Although this feedback could be used to correct reproduction errors, we still observed the regression effect. Since we adapted the feedback range after every stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), its width indicated estimation precision, with a narrower feedback range corresponding to higher precision. The average width of the feedback range in a session correlated negatively with the slope, which is another sign of a connection between the regression effect and error minimization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single cells differentially encode time during measurement and reproduction</title><p>We recorded a total of 1766 mPFC units over 101 experimental sessions from three gerbils. Visual inspection of the spiking responses, after sorting by stimulus duration and splitting into the two task phases ‘measurement’ and ‘reproduction,’ revealed a variety of response patterns that could underlie time reproduction. Three examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; further examples can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>. The neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> increased its activity during measurement, such that the firing rate by the end of the phase correlated with the stimulus interval (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). During reproduction, this neuron displayed downward ramping. However, here the change in firing rate correlated with the stimulus interval to be reproduced, such that for shorter intervals the firing rate decreased faster than for longer intervals (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This effect was also observed in cells whose activity increased to a fixed level at the end of reproduction that was independent of the stimulus duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Such ramp-to-threshold cells peaked at a constant time from the end of the reproduction epoch, with higher slopes for shorter intervals, suggesting the prediction of time to an event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merchant and Georgopoulos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>). Yet other cells constantly increased firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), similar to what we saw during measurement in the neuron in displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. We also found cells that responded at absolute times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) or relative to the reproduction interval, for example, at its begin or end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Gerbil medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neuron responses during time reproduction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cell that linearly increased its firing rate during measurement and ramped down to zero during reproduction.

We did not find a single cell that responded in the very same way in both task phases and essentially repeated its activity pattern from the measurement phase during reproduction – an observation that will be analyzed systematically below.</p><p>Since reproduction involved walking in our behavioral task, we looked at dependencies between firing rate and running speed. In most example neurons, running speed influences were weak. Although speed response functions may have been significant (from shuffled controls, see Materials and methods), modulation of the speed response function was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Still, some neurons displayed an obvious speed modulation. For instance, the shape of the spike density functions (SDFs) of the neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3G and H</xref> was rising and decreasing over the reproduction phase, and this pattern corresponded well to changes of the running speed. These neurons had a monotonously rising speed response function. Yet other neurons had large speed modulation indices, but the overlap between their SDFs and the running speed pattern was small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C–F</xref>). Velocity changes over a trial certainly contributed to the response of such neurons but could not fully explain their firing. To assess speed modulation more systematically, we calculated modulation indices of all neurons for virtual speed and for running speed on the treadmill. These modulation indices were widely distributed and often larger for running speed on the treadmill than for virtual speed. Although also weak speed modulation could be significant, it was significant in only 22% of the neurons for virtual speed and in 27% for the running speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>We note that running speed as well as other unobserved behavioral factors may contribute to firing in some neurons and hence may explain differences in firing patterns between task phases.

These scaling indices theoretically range between 3.0/5.25 ≈ 0.57 and 7.5/5.25 ≈ 1.43. Indeed, scaling indices were close to the theoretical values during both measurement and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). During reproduction, scaling indices were even larger or smaller than the prediction in a manner consistent with the regression effect, that is, smaller durations had larger scaling factors and vice versa.</p><p>Finally, we obtained scaling indices after shuffling cell identities across stimuli to test whether the scaling indices from the recorded data were in fact the result of a meaningful modulation. Only for the reproduction phase the indices from shuffling were more widely distributed than the data; for the measurement phase, a difference was not clearly visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Statistical testing, however, identified significant effects in both phases (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>&lt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.01</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in all cases, Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). This statistical result was likely due to the large number of samples contained in the data set. Therefore, we performed bootstrapped Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests on 10% of the data over 10,000 runs. The p-values obtained lay below 0.05 for almost all cases during reproduction. During measurement, only about 30% of the bootstrapped Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this indicates activity-dependent temporal scaling of prefrontal single-cell responses in the reproduction phase alluding to a potential role in time encoding and the regression effect.

Moreover, the contribution of the PCs to the single-cell responses (PCA scores) correlated for PC 1 and stimulus PC 1, indicating a link between ramp-like and stimulus-dependent activity in both measurement and reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>).

In contrast, when a time interval is reproduced, trajectories of similar length are found for different stimuli but the speed of progression decreases with duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>). Since we separated time course-related from stimulus information through the demixed PCA, we could not see such stimulus-dependent effects directly. We therefore also applied conventional PCA to our data. The strongest PCs from conventional PCA were similar in shape to those from demixed PCA but were – as expected – influenced by the stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Indeed, in the measurement phase, neural activity developed at similar speed along trajectories with a length that depended on stimulus duration. During reproduction, trajectories had similar length. However, activity along those trajectories accelerated over an interval resulting at higher average speed for stimuli of shorter duration. Note that this effect corresponds to the temporal scaling described in the previous section.</p><p>It is possible that the population responses during measurement and reproduction are not actually collective phenomena but simply the result of pooling single neurons. To test this, we compared population activity to surrogate data that preserve stimulus tuning of single neurons, correlations of single-cell firing rates across time, and pairwise correlations between neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elsayed and Cunningham, 2017a</xref>). During measurement, PC 1 of the original data was larger than expected, suggesting that collective activity added to representing ongoing time; similarly, PC 3 was larger than expected during reproduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>).

For each neuron, a category was selected based on the angle between its PC 1 and stimulus PC 1 scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>). We only included cells with large demixed PCA scores (explained variance) in this analysis (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Cells with small scores were categorized as ‘unrelated activity,’ giving a fourth response category. Likewise, 15 different categories were defined for the reproduction phase from combinations of PCs 1–3 and stimulus PC 1 plus a 16th category for ‘unrelated activity’.</p><p>Categorization provided meaningful representations of single-cell responses as reflected in the variance explained by the contributing PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). For instance, large parts of variance were explained by PC 1 for neurons in the category ‘PC 1 only’ during measurement; contributions from stimulus PC 1 were marginal. In the stimulus PC 1-only category, the situation was reversed, and for the mixed PC 1 and stimulus PC 1 category contributions by both PCs matched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). However, only less than 50% of variance could be explained by the two PCs in the measurement phase. The PCs used for reconstructing during the reproduction phase better captured the activity; leaving less variance unexplained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In particular, for the PC 1-only category often cell activity could be explained to more than 50% by PC 1.</p><p>Cells that could be described by PC 1 had a ramp-like response profile. During measurement, about a quarter of the cells showed such ramping activity. These cells included ramping to stimulus duration-dependent levels like the neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and ramping that did not depend on stimulus. The other cells represented the stimulus duration in a different way or showed activity unrelated to the task during measurement (67%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p><p>During reproduction, about 10% of the neurons showed ramping activity (PC 1 only), for example, ramp-to-threshold cells where the rate of ramping decreased with stimulus duration (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Another ∼10% of neurons were explained by mixing PCs 1 and 2, and 6% by a mixture of PCs 1–3. Only 1% was explained by ramps that encoded stimulus (i.e., PC 1 and stimulus PC 1). However, counting all combinations of stimulus PC 1 with PCs 1–3 showed that about 5% of the neurons combined ramps with stimulus duration-dependent firing. In total, 35% of the cells contained a ramping component. These cells overlapped largely with those whose activity was significantly correlated across stimuli (not shown, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G<sub>2</sub></xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, further examples for the different categories can be found.</p><p>We also determined if the ramp-like responses (cells explained by PC 1 and those explained by PC 1 + stimulus PC 1) could be driven by running speed rather than time reproduction.

Nevertheless, speed modulation indices were in general low for those ramping cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The categorization analysis strengthened the picture of changing response patterns between measurement and reproduction we have already noted above in several places. Cells switched response types between task phases but with no specific pattern as becomes obvious from the flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Separating cells with small scores from those with large ones, we could estimate the number of cells active during the task phases. About 17% of the cells fired action potentials in both phases, 16% were only active during measurement and 23% only during reproduction; 44% of the cells did not contribute substantially in either phase (pie chart in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Time encoding is governed by different response types</title><p>To understand how mPFC may encode time in our task, we read out ongoing time from the responses of all neurons using a simple linear regression decoder (see Materials and methods).

This was due to neurons with large PCA scores, as we obtained a similar result when decoding only from such neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, time readouts using neurons with small PCA scores were very imprecise. Here, decoded time was almost constant throughout the reproduction phase, such that real time was overestimated initially and underestimated at the end of reproduction.

The slope of the linear regression between the final values of real and predicted time was close to zero <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, values from behavior were between 1 and 0.5 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This discrepancy probably comes from the fact that the neuronal population includes not only neurons encoding the regression effect. We therefore wondered what response types could mediate the regression effect and simulated a few stereotypical cases. Decoding time from neurons that ramp with same slope to stimulus duration-dependent levels (linear increasing neurons) shows precise time representation but no regression effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Whereas ramp-to-threshold cells that change slope but reach same activity levels by the end of an interval can only encode the mean of the stimulus distribution and result in maximal regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>Decoding time from the response categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) corresponding to the theoretical cases led to similar results. For the response type combining time-dependent PC 1 with stimulus PC 1, time reproduction displayed only a weak regression effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) and ramp-to-threshold responses (PC 1 only) displayed very strong regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>); see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>. Decoding time directly from the demixed PCs gave similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>).</p><p>Regression effects in our behavioral data lay between the extremes yielded by the two response categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This discrepancy made us think about another solution to the question of how regression effects may arise. In theory, combining ramping to stimulus duration-dependent levels with slope changes by stimulus also generates regression effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Such a combination can be implemented either with mixed response patterns within one neuron or as a mixture of response types across a neuronal population. To find out which of the two scenarios underlies our data, we looked at the distribution of PCA scores for the cells in the linear increasing and the slope-changing categories. These scores were broadly distributed and also the corresponding decoding weights did not reveal a particular structure, indicating time coding comprising different response types (bottom-right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). To further test this possibility, we mixed responses of recorded cells from both categories at different fractions. Decoding not only yielded regression effects, but the strength of regression could be manipulated by the relative shares of both response types. The more slope-changing cells were present in the population, the stronger was the regression effect (top-right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><p>Another response type that has been often connected to timing are phasically active cells. We therefore wondered how ongoing time would be encoded by such neurons. Constructing again theoretical stereotypes, we saw that neurons that are active relative to the stimulus interval can only encode a single time point. In contrast, a population of neurons that are phasically active at different absolute times tiling the whole interval would provide an accurate time representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since neither relative nor absolute timing neurons by themselves predict regression effects as found in the behavioral responses, again a mixture of both response types would be required. Matching these theoretical results to our own recordings turned out to be less straightforward. We recorded phasically active cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), but this subset of cells did not completely tile the whole time intervals. However, such a prerequisite is necessary to seriously attempt to reproduce the theoretical predictions.</p><p>Finally, we examined whether time could also be decoded from the neuronal responses in the measurement phase. Here, decoding was imprecise with overestimation at the begin and underestimation at the end of the interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) – a picture that also appeared for shuffled and noisy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) and matches the less pronounced time signaling across the population during measurement, which we have found above in several places. A general underestimation was also found when we used only neurons in the PC 1 + stimulus PC 1 category, indicating their foremost influence on the collective readout. Interestingly, when we decoded time from the cells in the PC 1-only category, a regression effect was also seen during measurement (rightmost panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting an impact of previous stimuli (prior knowledge) on the activity of these neurons already during stimulus measurement and not just during reproduction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We investigated the neural basis of time reproduction and analyzed neural correlates from rodent mPFC in a novel interval timing task. We showed that Mongolian gerbils (<italic>M. unguiculatus</italic>) are able to measure and reproduce durations lasting several seconds. To allow the gerbils to respond in a natural way, we used walking as a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Meijer and Robbers, 2014</xref>). The task was implemented in a rodent virtual reality system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thurley and Ayaz, 2017</xref>), which (1) gave us the use of a treadmill, (2) prevented landmark-based strategies for task-solving and (3) decoupled time from distance, such that the task could not be solved by path integration.</p><p>The rodents’ behavior exhibited typical characteristics of time reproduction and magnitude estimation, including the regression effect, that is, the overestimation of small and underestimation of large stimuli (also known as regression to the mean, central tendency, or Vierordt’s law; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">von Vierordt, 1868</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollingworth, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petzschner et al., 2015</xref>). Neural activity in gerbil mPFC correlated with and likely contributed to time reproduction behavior. Prefrontal neurons displayed various firing characteristics, which could be grouped into a number of representative categories. Single-cell firing patterns differed between measurement and reproduction. For those cells that participated in both task phases, activity profiles never matched between task phases – although they sometimes correlated; see, for example, the ramp-type neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4D</xref>. Moreover, changes in response characteristics between task phases were not coordinated across neurons, leading to low population vector correlations and no specific transition patterns between response types. Linear decomposition of the population activity, however, revealed state-space trajectories with common features in measurement and reproduction. This indicates that – despite the response heterogeneity within and between cells – the prefrontal population similarly encoded time in both task phases. Such effects on low-dimensional population activity in connection to changes of behavioral and cognitive state have been described for attention and task engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engel and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, task-related activity in the reproduction phase was more robust and less noisy compared to the measurement phase. This was obvious from most of our analyses and could mean that the mPFC is less involved or not involved at all during the measurement phase of our task. An issue that may be resolved in further experiments.</p><p>Neural correlates of interval timing in the range of seconds have been found in several brain areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merchant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Issa et al., 2020</xref>), including prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Genovesio et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tiganj et al., 2017</xref>), pre-/supplementary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">MacDonald et al., 2011</xref>), entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heys and Dombeck, 2018</xref>), and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakhurin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Emmons et al., 2017</xref>). What distinguishes our experiments from previous studies is twofold: (1) we tested time intervals on a continuous range and (2) we combined timing of an external event (measurement phase) and timing own behavior (reproduction phase), linking sensory and motor timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>). Our study is therefore conceptually different from the fixed interval or discrimination tasks that have been used in most of the above timing studies. Some studies with monkeys used tasks comparable to ours but focused on intervals lasting only hundreds of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>). The neural activity in primate parietal and frontal cortices observed in these studies is surprisingly similar to what we found in rodent mPFC. This is especially interesting since we tested timing of several seconds and neural dynamics typically act on much shorter time scales.</p><p>The mPFC responses we recorded during the reproduction phase are reminiscent of the neural correlates of self-initiated behavior found in rat secondary motor cortex by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>. The reproduction phase in our task also involves self-initiated behavior (i.e., to stop walking). Murakami et al. found ramp-to-threshold cells similar to the one in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. However, in contrast to our findings, they reported the absence of such responses in mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>). This discrepancy may be due to the different tasks involved: waiting for a signal to appear after a random interval in their experiments vs. responding after a previously measured interval in our case. Ramp-to-threshold responses have also been found in monkey motor cortices during various timing behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merchant and Georgopoulos, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mita et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>) and as a population pattern in lateral intraparietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2015</xref>) during time (re-)production, demonstrating their ubiquitous presence in self-initiated behaviors. Note that we also recorded negative ramp-to-threshold, that is, ramp-down, responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, we observed linear increasing neurons (neurons that ramp to stimulus duration-dependent levels at the same slope, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) that may serve as integrators of time information provided by sequentially activated, phasically responding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Again, both types of neurons have been reported in other timing tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merchant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Genovesio et al., 2016</xref>). Responses with a linear ramping component (comprising both linear increasing and ramp-to-threshold) have been shown to be important for precise time decoding and to underlie low-dimensional population dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cueva et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our time decoding analysis revealed that ramp-to-threshold and linear increasing neurons cannot by themselves explain the regression effect; rather, the combination of both response types is necessary in either a single neuron or mixed across a population of neurons. Reading out this activity will show the regression effect. We used a linear regression decoder, which takes the perspective of a neuron that forms a weighted sum of its inputs and provides a continuous time readout. This choice was motivated to gain insight into the potential mechanism of the regression effect. Despite its simplicity, it revealed that the regression effect may be the result of decoding from mixed responses. Other decoding approaches are far more efficient and precise in reading out elapsed time from neural activity like, for example, classifiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bakhurin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>). But due to their efficiency they do not show the regression effect and would contribute less to its understanding in the present framework.</p><p>Although we cannot tell from our data how mixing is accomplished, mixed response types are compatible with theoretical models of interval timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Simen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thurley, 2016</xref>). Similarly, distributing relative and absolute timing cells across a neuronal population may yield the regression effect. However, since ramp-like responses were prominent in our data set, we consider their contribution more likely. Mixed response types are in general important in cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rigotti et al., 2013</xref>) but have also been reported during spontaneous behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stringer et al., 2019</xref>). Coding of variables related to cognitive functions like choice and task engagement is often distributed across brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Steinmetz et al., 2019</xref>). Although we only recorded in one brain region and cannot comment on the distribution across the brain, our findings suggest that a local distribution of response types may also underlie cognitive functions.</p><p>Temporal scaling appears to be a general feature of timed computations in the brain as it has been described in various brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mello et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). It has also been demonstrated to be important for time coding in neural network models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bi and Zhou, 2020</xref>). In our experiments, neuronal activity scaled and changed speed in relation to the stimulus duration in the reproduction phase only. Here, animals had to actively generate timed behavior (motor timing); in contrast to the measurement phase (sensory timing), where due to the randomization stimulus duration could not be determined in advance.</p><p>Temporal scaling and speed dependence of neural dynamics corresponded to the regression effect we observed in the behavioral data. Bayesian models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jazayeri and Shadlen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petzschner et al., 2015</xref>) as well as other approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bausenhart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thurley, 2016</xref>) have demonstrated that the regression effect may be a strategy to minimize behavioral errors. Bayesian models fuse probability distributions of the current stimulus estimate and prior knowledge. The neural representations of these probability distributions and the mechanism underlying the probabilistic computations have yet to be determined. An interesting solution was proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref> based on recordings from monkey frontal cortex. While the animals measured time intervals in a task very similar to ours, frontal cortex activity followed low-dimensional curved state-space trajectories. These curved trajectories can be interpreted as a compressed nonlinear representation of time, which when read-out appropriately during reproduction can explain regression effects seen in behavior. Our demixed PCs also showed curved trajectories during measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>); however, trajectories from conventional PCA did not comprise such curvatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A</xref>). These results do not necessarily contrast with those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>. It is possible that – at least in our behavioral task – mPFC is not involved in the compression of the time estimate in the measurement phase. But it may contribute to reproduce the compressed estimate, for example, to signal when to stop running in the reproduction phase. The fact that we observed curved state-space trajectories in the reproduction phase suggests this possibility. At the single-neuron-level, curved state-space trajectories are supported by neurons with a ramping component. These contribute to the monotonous shape of the strongest PC (PC 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In combination with the non-monotonous PC 2, curved but non-entangled state-space trajectories result that can support the mechanism suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>Our results further suggest that two different types of ramping underlie the regression effect: ramping with a constant slope and ramping with a slope that depends on stimulus duration. When both response types are implemented in different neurons and distributed across the population, the amount of noise in the system determines the strength of the regression effect. Without noise, duration encoding is dominated by neurons that ramp with a constant slope and no regression effect emerges. If activity is noisy, neurons with stimulus-dependent slope contribute and the regression effect appears. Thus, the amount of noise (uncertainty about the current stimulus) determines the impact of either response type and thus the balance between current stimulus estimate and prior knowledge.</p><p>State-space trajectories for different stimulus durations were well separated during measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since stimulus duration is unknown at the beginning of the measurement phase, such duration-dependent trajectories are likely due to prior expectations about the stimulus duration. Small stimuli are typically followed by larger ones and vice versa, which may bias neural responses and behavioral estimates accordingly. Such sequential effects are known in magnitude estimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bausenhart et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Petzschner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thurley, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, when we only included ramping cells for time decoding a regression effect was also seen during measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>), implying that previous stimuli affect the current measurement. Influences of prior expectations on neural activity during time interval estimation have been reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meirhaeghe et al., 2021</xref>). During reproduction, trajectories were also ordered by stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5B</xref>), which is considered an indication that cortical dynamics are adjusted for (re-)producing different time intervals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Remington et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The present work provides insight into the neural substrate of time reproduction, including the regression effect and error minimization, in rodents. A thorough characterization of mPFC responses allowed us to show that only mixed responses in either single cells or distributed across a local population of neurons can explain the regression effect. By adjusting the relative fractions of response types, one can parameterize the strength of the regression effect and thus the fusion of stimulus estimate and prior knowledge. To resolve the specifics of the underlying neural computations will be an important direction for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The experiments in this study were conducted with three female adult Mongolian gerbils (<italic>M. unguiculatus</italic>) from a wild-type colony at the local animal house (referred to by IDs 10526, 11769, and 11770 throughout the article).

On top of the sphere, the rodent is fixated with a harness that leaves head and legs freely movable. Rotations of the sphere are induced when the animal moves its legs. The rotations are detected by infrared sensors and fed into a computer to generate and update a visual virtual scene. The scene is displayed via a projector onto a projection screen that surrounds the treadmill.

Animals were trained to measure its duration and not to move during this phase of the task. Stimuli were randomly chosen between 3 and 7.5 s (i.e., either 3, 3.75, 4.5, 5.25, 6, 6.75, or 7.5 s). Afterward, the visual scene switched, a virtual corridor appeared, and the animal had to reproduce the stimulus by moving through the corridor for the same duration. The animal decided on its own when to start reproducing the interval as well as when to stop. These ‘reaction times’ typically took a few seconds and correlated only weakly with the stimulus or the reproduced stimulus in some sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). If the animal continuously moved the treadmill for at least 1 s, the start of this movement was counted as the begin of reproduction. To finish reproduction, the animal had to stop for more than 0.5 s. These 0.5 s were not included in the reproduced interval. With this procedure, we avoided counting brief movements and stops as responses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> shows movement data from one example session.</p><p>We gave feedback to our gerbils on their reproduction performance. Following the reproduction phase, the entire projection screen was either set to green (positive, ‘in’) or white (negative, ‘out’) for 3–4 s.

With demixed PCA, this population activity can be separated into components related to the stimulus interval and those related to the overall time course of the population activity independent of the stimulus.</p><p>Demixed PCA was performed separately for measurement and reproduction on the SDFs of all recorded neurons aligned at the respective onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobak et al., 2016</xref> for a detailed description. We used the demixed PCA implementation available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/machenslab/dPCA">https://github.com/machenslab/dPCA</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobak et al., 2021</xref>). When we applied demixed PCA on data from individual animals, results were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). Conventional PCA was also done separately for measurement and reproduction and on the SDFs of all recorded neurons aligned at the respective onsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>Bootstrapping was done by performing demixed PCA on 1000 random subsets comprising each 10% of the whole data set. Subsets were picked in a stratified way, that is, accounting for the different numbers of cells recorded in each animal. The function StratifiedShuffleSplit from scikit-learn was used for picking the subsets. Results were similar for 5% and 20% subsets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-6"><title>Tensor maximum entropy surrogates</title><p>To test whether population responses contained collective contributions beyond what is expected from pooling single neurons, we generated control surrogate data according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Elsayed and Cunningham, 2017a</xref>. Random tensor maximum entropy surrogate samples were drawn that preserved the stimulus tuning of single neurons, correlations of single-cell firing rates across time and signal correlations across neurons. The implementation we used is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/gamaleldin/rand_tensor">https://github.com/gamaleldin/rand_tensor</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elsayed and Cunningham, 2017b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-7"><title>Categorization of response types</title><p>We categorized cells into different response types by their score values for specific PCs: time course-related PC 1 and stimulus PC 1 for measurement and time course-related PCs 1–3 and stimulus PC 1 for reproduction. Since the scores for those PCs had single peaked distributions, displaying no obvious clusters or response groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>), we used the following procedure to construct response categories: first, a cell’s responses in either task phase were reconstructed as a linear combination from the abovementioned PCs weighted by the respective PCA scores. Then the variance of the cell’s response was determined, which was explained by this reconstruction. If this explained variance was below the cumulative overall explained variance for the PCs (measurement: 6%, reproduction: 28%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), the cell was assigned to the ‘unrelated activity’ category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). Otherwise, first the strongest PC (the one with the largest absolute scores) was found and then the angles between this PC and each of the other PCs were determined (calculated on the absolute values). If any of those angles was above 22.5°, the other component was counted as contributing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In total, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> different response types were possible in the measurement phase and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mn>4</mml:mn></mml:msup><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>16</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> in the reproduction phase, that is, categories ranging from ‘unrelated activity’ with no overlap with any of the PCs to activity explained by all PCs used for categorization.</p><p>Categories were validated by categorizing every cell by its scores for each of the 1000 bootstrapped demixed PCAs described above. Finally, the category with maximum likelihood was assigned to the cell.</p><p>In addition, we compared the number of cells in each category to a random prediction. For that, we constructed random surrogate data by shuffling SDFs across stimuli and cells, performed demixed PCA on this data, categorized each ‘surrogate cell,’ and counted the number of cells in each category. From 1000 such shufflings, we got distributions of by chance expected cell counts in each category, which we used to determine p-values for the count in the original data. A level of 5% was chosen and indicated as significant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-8"><title>Time decoding</title><p>To decode elapsed time, we used multiple linear regression (Wiener filter; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glaser et al., 2020</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kordinglab/neural_decoding">https://github.com/kordinglab/neural_decoding</ext-link>) between time points and the spike responses (SDFs) of all neurons, that is, the SDFs of each neuron were weighted such that elapsed time could be most precisely decoded. The SDFs of all neurons were combined in a matrix <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> with the individual SDFs as columns, such that the matrix had as many rows as time points and as many columns as neurons.

However, we did not want to find individual weights for each stimulus but one weight for all stimuli per neuron. Therefore, we concatenated a neuron’s SDFs for all stimuli, such that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf27"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">R</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> had as many rows as time points × stimuli.

This treated the whole data set as a reference (prior). During decoding ongoing time at a particular stimulus, we plugged in only the SDF at this stimulus into the left side of <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> and received a vector of decoded time points. Fitting and decoding was done on random subsets of 20 cells (1000 bootstrap runs), from which we extracted average and standard deviation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hugo Merchant as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main weakness of the paper is a conceptual problem, which requires clarification. Both the title and the introduction point to magnitude quantification, which in general exhibits the regression effect (Vierordt's law). Interval timing is certainly a form of magnitude quantification and exhibits the regression effect. However, any neural correlate of the regression effect in interval timing does not necessarily generalizes to other forms of magnitude quantification. The way the findings of this paper are framed in the title, abstract, introduction, and discussion seem to make that generalization, and that claim is not supported because the data shown has a narrower scope.</p><p>2) It is necessary to clearly demonstrate that the behavioral protocol produces a robust, reliable time interval reproduction. Is also fundamental to provide a valid justification for such low levels of performance. It is especially important to clarify this point before analyzing the potentially associated neuronal activity. It is important to understand how stable the behavior is in a session-by-session base. We suggest including a full description of the learning curve. This point is especially relevant for the population analysis, where the activity of cells collected in different sessions was pooled together. In addition, it's well known that in behavioral protocols like this, behavior tend to stereotype, making it difficult to determine if the neural activity is associated with a particular behavioral variable (such as speed or distance) or elapsed time. Hence, it would be necessary to formally assess how behavioral variables covariate (or not) with time. For this, examples of single sessions are not sufficient. It is necessary to clarify several things. For example, the slopes of the linear regressions for dozens of sessions are presented (Figure 1E) but is not clear if there was a behavioral evolution over the training. For another example, animal 10526 presented high levels of variability in many variables (Figure S2), hence, it would be important to know which sessions were used for the analysis of the neural data.</p><p>3) A main conclusion of the paper is that only neural populations with mixed responses, including ramping activity with linear increasing and slope-changing modulations as a function of reproduced durations, can encode the regression effect. How the prior knowledge about the distribution of used intervals in the task is combined with the actual measurement of the passage of time? It is not evident on the last part of the paper how the slope changing cells, associated with a prior signal, are combined with the linearly increasing ramping cells to generate both the regression effect and a sufficiently accurate representation of produced duration. Sessions within the same animal with different slopes in the regression effect show different proportions of the two cell types? How is the mixing accomplished?</p><p>4) During reproduction, the percent of neurons categorized with time-dependent PC 1 and stimulus PC 1 responses is &lt; 1%, which is one of the two combinations that gives the best regression effect in the decoding. These linearly increasing ramping cells were very common during measurement and may be encoding elapsed time since the stimulus onset. In contrast, most of the responses in reproduction were slope changing cells, reaching a peak of activation close to the end of the produced interval. This type of responses has been observed when a prediction of time to an event is needed (time-to-contact cells Merchant and Georgopoulos, 2006). A key issue, then, is whether the decoding method used to reconstruct elapsed time is capturing the prediction to an event signal as a regression effect because is aligned to the onset of the time interval, instead of to the end of the produced interval, which is probably the task event that the cells are encoding.</p><p>5) The authors say the conventional PCA did not show curved trajectories (line 418, Discussion, Pg. 17) for the measuring phase. However, that is certainly not the case for the reproduction phase, where the decoding analysis was successfully performed, and the regression effect was observed. I don't see the present results as alternative to the hypothesis by Sohn et al., 2019., but as a quite interesting step forward from that. It is possible that what the PFC is encoding in this task is an estimate of when to stop moving. In that case, the neural activity would be equivalent to that observed in Sohn et al., 2019. And perhaps warped and transformed by down-stream reading areas similarly to the &quot;curved manifold projected onto a line&quot;. It would be very interesting if slope-changing cells were contributing to a more curved shape of the population trajectory, since they can be encoding a prior as the authors suggest. The results of the decoding analysis which uses a linear (i.e. lower dimensional) decoder indirectly suggest this.</p><p>6) Despite the clear differences in neural activity between the two phases presented in figures 2 to 4, authors named the following section &quot;Population activity shares similar components for measurement and reproduction&quot; (page 8 line 58). However, that entire section, that includes figures 5 and 6 and several supplementary figures (e.g. S8 and S9), shows notorious differences between the two phases. From the explained variance (Figures 5, S8, S9) to how single cell activity contributes to the population representations, there are striking differences between the two behavioral phases. Authors must clarify what do they mean by &quot;activity shares similar components&quot; or change the name of the section for something that better represents the data.</p><p>7) Elapsed time decoding from populations of cells using classifiers suggest that different ramping cell types can contribute to represent the passages of time and that the decoding error can explain the error in produced interval (Merchant and Averbeck, 2017; Bakhurin et al., 2017). Based on this and the previous comment I am wondering whether a classifier is not a better option for decoding than the linear decoder.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71612.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main weakness of the paper is a conceptual problem, which requires clarification.

This point is especially relevant for the population analysis, where the activity of cells collected in different sessions was pooled together.</p></disp-quote><p>The gerbils display very well and reliable time reproduction behavior in our experiments. Task performance of the gerbils in our behavioral paradigm is comparable to previous studies conducted with humans and non-human primates on time interval reproduction (Jazayeri and Shadlen 2010 <italic>Nature Neuroscience,</italic> Jazayeri and Shadlen 2015 <italic>Current Biology</italic> and Sohn et al., 2019 <italic>Neuron</italic>). This is indicated by the slope of the linear fit between stimulus interval and reproduced interval being between 0.5 and 1, and by the small coefficients of variation (CV) being below 0.2 on average. In own time reproduction experiments with humans, performance levels were similar (Thurley and Schild 2018 <italic>Sci Rep</italic>).</p><p>To better illustrate the behavioral performance, we now plot the development of slope and coefficient of variation across sessions for each animal in Figure 1—figure supplement 2D. In these plots we also include the final training sessions, when we started presenting the whole stimulus distribution. An ongoing improvement can be seen for each animal during training. Data at even earlier stages of training are not included in the plot, since these were not tracked systematically. Training data did not appear in the earlier version of the manuscript and only does in Figure 1—figure supplement 2D now.</p><p>The impression of “low levels of performance” most likely stems from the “percentage of hits” in each session that we presented in former Figure S2B. Hits in our paradigm can not be interpreted as for binary decision tasks, this means that 50% performance does not correspond to chance performance.</p><p>We used an adaptive feedback protocol to decide whether a reproduced interval is close enough to the stimulus interval and hence rewarded or not. Rewarding is necessary to keep the animals motivated. However, if rewards would always be given at a fixed distance off the stimulus, e.g. 15%, the animals could learn to reproduce 15% shorter intervals than the stimulus interval. Adaptive feedback avoids this situation as the distance from stimulus that needs to be reached to receive a reward changes with every (non-)rewarded trial. Effectively, rewards will be given in only a bit more than 50% of the trials. See the following papers that used a similar feedback protocol:</p><p>Jazayeri and Shadlen 2010 <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic>: “As such, every subject’s performance for every session yielded approximately 50% positively reinforced trials.”</p><p>Jazayeri and Shadlen 2015 <italic>Current Biology</italic>: “The scaling constant was adjusted so that approximately 60% of trials were rewarded.”</p><p>We understand that the term “hits” is misleading, so we now use “rewards” instead (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, it's well known that in behavioral protocols like this, behavior tend to stereotype, making it difficult to determine if the neural activity is associated with a particular behavioral variable (such as speed or distance) or elapsed time.

No data from training sessions is used in the paper at any other point.</p><p>We always excluded sessions with too low performance from the data set. In the revision, we reconsidered behavioral performance and decided to exclude another 4 border-line sessions. Our data set now includes 1766 cells recorded in 101 sessions.</p><p>We randomly changed the gain between virtual movement and treadmill movement in every trial. This efficiently decorrelates time and distance (stimulus interval and path length, Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, formerly Figure S1C). This is a typical procedure to enforce time reproduction and avoid e.g. distance reproduction as an alternative strategy for task solving in virtual reality experiments (e.g. Petzschner and Glasauer 2011 <italic>J Neurosci</italic>, Thurley and Schild 2018 <italic>Sci Rep</italic>, Robinson and Wiener 2021 <italic>NeuroImage</italic>). Since neural responses may nevertheless be related to, running speed, we extended the analysis in this respect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A main conclusion of the paper is that only neural populations with mixed responses, including ramping activity with linear increasing and slope-changing modulations as a function of reproduced durations, can encode the regression effect.

It is not evident on the last part of the paper how the slope changing cells, associated with a prior signal, are combined with the linearly increasing ramping cells to generate both the regression effect and a sufficiently accurate representation of produced duration. Sessions within the same animal with different slopes in the regression effect show different proportions of the two cell types? How is the mixing accomplished?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question! We do not have a specific mechanistic hypothesis as to how the mixing occurs, but we also do not think we can tell from our data. Our data and analyses in Figure 7F only indicates that mixing linear increasing and slope-changing cells at different fractions allows for parameterizing the strength of the regression effect. How mixing is accomplished, we can not directly tell from the present experiments, but we want to explore this question in future work.</p><p>We are also hesitant to draw direct conclusions from our data about the relationship between the proportions of active cell types and the regression effect in a given session. Our recording technique only allowed the recording of different cells in each session due to changes of electrode position between sessions. Cell numbers and types most likely depend on the specific subset of cells we were able to recorded rather than on a potentially dynamic recruitment of cells in each session.</p><p>A conclusive experiment would need to systematically record from the same cells across several sessions with changing strength of the regression effect.</p><p>We now explicitly point out in the Discussion that “we can not tell from our data how mixing is accomplished”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) During reproduction, the percent of neurons categorized with time-dependent PC 1 and stimulus PC 1 responses is &lt; 1%, which is one of the two combinations that gives the best regression effect in the decoding.

We tested this training a classifier to differentiate between the final time bin of reproduction versus all other time bins (25 bins in total) for data aligned at the end of the time interval. This shows that the slope-changing cells contain information about the “contact” to the final time point. However, this does not translate into the (behavioral) regression effect if one tries to decode elapsed time from the same cells. As we show in Figure 7C, the readout from slope-changing cells will be the same final time point for all stimulus durations, i.e. regression slope = 0. The insight we gained from our decoding analyses is that in order to explain the milder regression slopes observed behaviorally, slope-changing and linear-increasing cells need to be readout together. We emphasize this in the Discussion now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors say the conventional PCA did not show curved trajectories (line 418, Discussion, Pg. 17) for the measuring phase.

Since we determined response types from the principal components in the whole data set, restriction to or exclusion from certain response types means focusing or removing the related principal components.</p><p>The slope-changing cells contribute mostly a monotonous change (PC 1 in Figure 5B). This monotonous change is not completely linear and hence contributes to a curved shape of the population trajectory. The most important contribution to the trajectory, however, is the monotonous change. In combination with the non-monotonous PC 2 it results in a smooth and curved population trajectory. If we remove all cells with a slope-changing component, i.e. all response types with a contribution of PC 1, PC 2 and 3 become dominant. Since both PC 2 and PC 3 are non-monotonous they form a tangled population trajectory. From that we conclude that a slope-changing component is essential for a smooth, untangled but curved population trajectory that could support the regression effect as suggested by Sohn et al., 2019.</p><p>We added the above insights to the discussion. We also agree with the reviewers that our results do not represent an alternative to Sohn et al., 2019 and have therefore refined and tempered the discussion in this regard.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Despite the clear differences in neural activity between the two phases presented in figures 2 to 4, authors named the following section &quot;Population activity shares similar components for measurement and reproduction&quot; (page 8 line 58).

Indeed, with such a classifier one could decode elapsed time much more veridical than with a linear regression decoder. We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, a variant of Figure 7 from the main text in which we (1) split 7.5 s of real time into 25 bins and (2) decoded time with a support-vector machine classifier.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-71612-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The readout was similar whether decoding was done from all data (A), linear increasing cells (B), or slope-changing cells (C). Final values of decoded time displayed large slopes indicating veridical values close to real time (D). For slope-changing cells decoding deviated markedly from theoretical prediction (C). This is likely due to the classifier exploiting subtle differences (partly random and due to noise) between recorded cells for decoding time. This also explains the overall better decoding performance of a classifier compared to a linear regression decoder. Despite its lower performance, in our view, the insight gained from a linear regression decoder with respect to the nature of the regression effect is larger than from a classifier. Also the mechanistic interpretation is different. A linear regression decoder may be implemented by a readout unit receiving continuous inputs and decoding elapsed time. A classifier would correspond to several readout units decoding a different time point each.</p><p>We extended the Discussion by this aspect but we did not include the figure above into the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
