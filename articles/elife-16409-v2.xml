The gating mechanisms of the related TRPV2 channel are poorly understood because selective high affinity ligands are not available, and the threshold for heat activation is extremely high (&gt;50°C). Cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2 reveal that they adopt similar structures, and identify a putative vanilloid binding pocket near the internal side of TRPV1. Here we use biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to investigate the resiniferatoxin(RTx) binding site in TRPV1 and to explore the functional relationships between TRPV1 and TRPV2. Collectively, our results support the interaction of vanilloids with the proposed RTx binding pocket, and demonstrate an allosteric influence of a tarantula toxin on vanilloid binding. Moreover, we show that sensitivity to RTx can be engineered into TRPV2, demonstrating that the gating and permeation properties of this channel are similar to TRPV1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16409.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16409.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16409.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ion channels form pores in cell membranes and can open and close to allow specific ions to flow from one side of the membrane to the other. Humans and other mammals rely on an ion channel protein called TRPV1 to sense heat, and this protein is activated by the active ingredient in hot chili peppers, a chemical called capsaicin that belongs to a group of compounds called vanilloids.</p><p>An ion channel called TRPV2 is related to TRPV1 and has a similar shape, but is less well understood. This is partly because there are no chemicals that are known to selectively activate this channel, and it is not activated by the vanilloids that activate TRPV1.</p><p>Zhang, Hanson et al. have now investigated where vanilloid compounds bind to activate the rat TRPV1 channel and if the binding site can be created in the rat TRPV2 as well. Like all proteins, these channels are built from smaller units called amino acids. The results from an array of approaches identified four specific amino acids that can be exchanged between TRPV1 and TRPV2 to swap their ability to bind and be activated by resiniferatoxin (a vanilloid isolated from a cactus-like plant called resin spurge). When rat TRPV2 channels were engineered to contain these four amino acids, resiniferatoxin could easily open the channel. In addition, the engineered channel allowed ions to pass through in a way that is similar to TRPV1, which suggests that the channels are more similar than previously believed.</p><p>Together the findings show how the TRPV2 channel can be made sensitive to vanilloids. This will help researchers to solve the structure of this ion channel when it is active and open. In addition, the findings may also allow the role of TRPV2 to be explored further in animals, such as mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16409.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16409.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>capsicin</kwd><kwd>gating mechanism</kwd><kwd>temperature-sensing</kwd><kwd>thermosensing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS002945</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Swartz</surname><given-names>Kenton J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BC005270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blumberg</surname><given-names>Peter M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>102890</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Newstead</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003715</institution-id><institution>Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bae</surname><given-names>Chanhyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jara-Oseguera</surname><given-names>Andres</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Vanilloid sensitivity has been introduced into the TRPV2 channel, revealing that the gating and permeation properties of this enigmatic TRP channel are remarkably similar to the capsaicin receptor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are a large family of cation selective channels, some of which function in sensory terminals to detect a wide array of different stimuli, including temperature, lipid messengers and natural products such as capsaicin, menthol, wasabi and mustard oil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>).

Thus the external pore appears to be a critical nexus for allosteric gating in TRPV1. The cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 in the presence of resiniferatoxin (RTx) revealed the presence of an additional density at the interface between the S1-S4 domains and the S5-S6 pore domains near the internal side of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>).

TRPV2 from rats and mice can be activated by extreme temperature above 52°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neeper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yao et al., 2011</xref>), however, TRPV2 knock-out mice have normal sensitivity to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2011</xref>) and the TRPV2 channel from humans is insensitive to heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neeper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yao et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, temperature sensing does not appear to be a conserved function of the TRPV2 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, the absence of high-affinity selective activators and inhibitors of TRPV2 has made exploration of this channel and its functions challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</xref>), although the channel can be activated with low affinity by non-selective agonists such as 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Juvin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neeper et al., 2007</xref>), probenecid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bang et al., 2007</xref>) and cannabinoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qin et al., 2008</xref>), and inhibited by ruthenium red. The TRPV2 channel is more widely expressed compared to TRPV1, and has been identified in sensory neurons, spinal cord, brain, pancreas, muscle and the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</xref>). Although relatively few functional deficits have been observed in TRPV2 knock-out mice other than increased perinatal lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</xref>), the channel has been proposed to play important roles in osmosensation, mechanosensation, innate immunity and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katanosaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Link et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Peralvarez-Marin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shibasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zanou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The goal of the present study was to confirm the location of the binding site for vanilloids on TRPV1, and to explore whether TRPV2 channels share common gating mechanisms with TRPV1. The recent cryo-EM structure of TRPV2 reveals that the protein adopts a structure that is very similar to TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that the gating mechanisms of the two TRP channels may be more similar than their distinct pharmacology and functional properties might suggest. We began by investigating whether biochemically well-behaved domains of TRPV1 could be identified that are competent to bind vanilloids such as resiniferatoxin (RTx). Although we succeeded in producing truncated constructs of TRPV1, only the full-length channel binds RTx with high affinity. We also discovered that DkTx binding to the external pore of the full-length channel can enhance the affinity of RTx, providing critical support for an allosteric model for activation of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>). Using the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 as a guide, we interrogated the putative vanilloid binding pocket with mutations in TRPV1 and our results confirm the location of the vanilloid binding site seen in the cryo-EM structure. We also attempted to engineer vanilloid sensitivity into the TRPV2 channel and made the remarkable discovery that only two mutations in TRPV2 are sufficient to enable vanilloids to bind with high affinity and to activate the channel. Single channel recordings of the vanilloid-sensitive TRPV2 channel show that high open probability (P<sub>o</sub>) can be achieved with RTx, and that the permeation properties of TRPV2 also resemble those of TRPV1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of full-length and truncated constructs of TRPV1</title><p>Our initial objective was to see if we could define minimal domains of TRPV1 that were competent to bind the vanilloid RTx.

Constructs containing the S1-S4 or S1-S6 domains of TRPV1 displayed good monodispersity when evaluated with fluorescence-coupled size exclusion chromatography (FSEC) using a range of detergents previously used to successfully solubilize eukaryotic membrane proteins (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although purification attempts were initially promising for the S1-S4 domain, with clear protein bands visible in elution during the first step of purification, cleavage of GFP with TEV protease led to aggregation and precipitation (not shown).</p><p>To evaluate whether these constructs were competent to bind vanilloids, we initially measured the binding of [<sup>3</sup>H]-RTx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Szallasi and Blumberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szallasi et al., 1999</xref>) to intact yeast cells expressing each of the constructs.

To demonstrate that only the full-length GFP-tagged channel presents specific high-affinity binding to RTx, we studied the Y511A mutant that disrupts vanilloid binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jordt and Julius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), and found that the mutant greatly diminished RTx binding to GFP-tagged TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also measured the binding of RTx to a His-tagged TRPV1 construct and observed that RTx bound with an affinity that was comparable to that observed with GFP-tagged TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Allosteric interactions between DkTx and RTx</title><p>The polymodal activation of TRPV1 has been widely conceptualized using allosteric models wherein binding of activators (such as vanilloids, protons, DkTx or voltage) are allosterically coupled to opening of the pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brauchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matta and Ahern, 2007</xref>).

We therefore tested whether binding of DkTx can enhance the affinity of TRPV1 for RTx, which would be predicted by an allosteric model wherein the two activators promote opening by binding more tightly to the open state. For these experiments we used a 1D4-tagged TRPV1 construct where expression in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was driven by a constitutive promoter and we performed binding assays on yeast membranes where the vanilloid would have free access to the channel protein (see Methods). Under these conditions, we measured a K<sub>d</sub> for RTx binding to 1D4-tagged TRPV1 of 0.6 nM under control conditions, about ten fold higher affinity than what we measured in intact cells using GFP-tagged TRPV1. When we measured the concentration-dependence of RTx binding to 1D4-tagged TRPV1 in the presence of DkTx, we observed that the tarantula toxin enhanced the affinity for RTx by about 3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The effects of DkTx were concentration-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and were observed independent of whether the binding assay was performed at 37°C (our standard temperature) or at 30°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

This analysis identified S512 (F472 in TRPV2), M547 (L507 in TRPV2), T550 (L510 in TRPV2) and E570 (Q530 in TRPV2) as potentially important determinants of RTx binding to TRPV1, consistent with previous experimental demonstrations that mutations of these residues weaken activation of TRPV1 by vanilloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elokely et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavva et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jordt and Julius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). To quantify the contribution of each of these residues to TRPV1 channel activation by RTx under our experimental conditions, we mutated each to the corresponding residue in TRPV2. We then expressed each construct in oocytes and used the two electrode voltage-clamp technique to study activation by RTx and by the non-specific TRPV channel activator 2-APB. We recorded time courses for channel activation by each agonist while stepping the membrane potential from −60 to +60 mV every 3 s from a holding potential of 0 mV using an external recording solution containing 100 mM KCl (internal K<sup>+</sup> concentration in a healthy oocyte is 100 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left). We also recorded current-voltage (I-V) relations by stepping over a wider range of voltages in the absence and presence of activators, or in the presence of ruthenium red (RR), a non-specific inhibitor of TRP channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). Because RTx has high affinity for TRPV1 and its interaction with perfusion tubing makes it difficult to reliably control its concentration in the low nM range, we applied the vanilloid at 100 nM, a concentration that is saturating based on our RTx binding assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the case of the wild-type TRPV1 channel, 2-APB produced reversible activation of outward and inward currents, RTx produced effectively irreversible activation on the time-scale of our recordings, and RR blocked the RTx-activated currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left). The I-V relations we recorded gave results that were consistent with the time courses, and we used these to present results from a population of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, right). Similar results were obtained with each of the four TRPV1 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>), with the exception being the S512F mutant, where we could readily see dissociation of RTx after removing the vanilloid from the recording chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), suggesting that this mutant weakens the affinity of RTx.

Although we did not measure the binding affinity of RTx for the TRPV1 QM, leaving open the possibility that the vanilloid binds without activating the channel, this is unlikely because individually the T550I and M547L mutants dramatically weaken RTx binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gavva et al., 2004</xref>). To further define which residues are most critical, we made double mutants where we combined S512F, the mutation that speeds RTx dissociation, with each of the other three mutations. Both S512F/M547L and S512F/T550L channels lost sensitivity to RTx, whereas the S512F/E570Q mutant retained RTx sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>), indicating that S512, M547 and T550 are more important determinants of TRPV1 activation by RTx than E570.

Although TRPV2 could be activated by 2-APB, the channel was completely insensitive to RTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), consistent with previous reports that this TRP channel is insensitive to capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caterina et al., 1999</xref>). We then introduced all four TRPV1 residues that contribute to RTx sensitivity into TRPV2 to make the TRPV2 QM, and observed that the channel remained insensitive to capsaicin, but was robustly activated by the higher affinity vanilloid RTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). RTx produced much stronger activation when compared to 2-APB, and we observed little evidence for dissociation of the vanilloid after its removal from the recording chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggestive of strong and stable binding to TRPV2 QM. To examine the strength of RTx binding to the TRPV2 channel, we undertook binding assays after expressing 1D4-tagged TRPV2 and TRPV2 QM in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and isolating yeast membranes, similar to the experiments described above with TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Although we only observed weak binding of RTx to TRPV2, the TRPV2 QM displayed robust and high-affinity RTx binding with a K<sub>d</sub> of 18 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The affinity of RTx for the TRPV2 QM is about 30-fold lower compared to TRPV1, suggesting that other differences between TRPV1 and TRPV2 may influence RTx affinity. Indeed, there are eight other residues located near the RTx binding pocket that differ between TRPV1 and TRPV2 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), which may also explain why the TRPV2 QM is not activated by capsaicin. To examine the relative importance of the four residues for mediating RTx sensitivity in the TRPV2 QM, we constructed triple mutants and evaluated their sensitivity to RTx electrophysiologically. All three triple mutants containing the F472S mutation (equivalent to S512 in TRPV1) were sensitive to RTx, whereas the one triple mutant that retained F472 was insensitive to RTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), consistent with a dominant role of S512 that we observed in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also investigated the RTx sensitivity of three double mutants containing the F472S mutation, and observed that either L507M or L510T rendered the TRPV2 channel sensitive to RTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), again matching our results for loss of function experiments in TRPV1 and demonstrating that only two point mutations are required to make the TRPV2 channel sensitive to RTx. Notably, the F472S single mutation is likely not sufficient to confer RTx sensitivity to TRPV2, as the F472S/Q530E was unresponsive to the vanilloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16409.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>RTx binds to and activates the TRPV2 QM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, left panel) Representative time courses for WT TRPV2 in the presence of 2-APB (4 mM) or RTx (100 nM) measured at +60 and -60 mV.

To explore the extent to which RTx promotes the open state of the TRPV2 QM, we investigated the unitary properties of the channel using inside-out patch recordings obtained from transiently transfected HEK293 cells. In a patch containing a single TRPV2-QM channel, we observed no spontaneous channel activity prior to application of any agonist (data not shown), but a few seconds of exposure to a solution containing 100 nM RTx resulted in robust channel activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The channel entered a mode where the P<sub>o</sub> was very close to 1 for the entirety of the recording (approximately 8 min), presenting only brief closures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and E</xref>).

Our biochemical results with expressed TRPV1 constructs and the RTx binding assay demonstrate that the full-length protein expressed in yeast is competent to bind RTx with high affinity, but that the S1-S4 and S1-S6 domains are not sufficient to observe convincing binding of the vanilloid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). The RTx binding site identified in the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 is located at the interface between the S1-S4 domain of one subunit and the S5-S6 domain of the adjacent subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>), and therefore one explanation would be that our truncated constructs do not bind RTx because they are possibly monomeric. We took advantage of the ability of the full-length construct to bind RTx to investigate whether we could observe allosteric coupling between the binding of the vanilloid and that of DkTx, a tarantula toxin that binds to the outer pore of TRPV1. We observed readily detectable shifts in the K<sub>d</sub> for RTx binding in the presence of DkTx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicating that both toxins are able to bind to our preparation of TRPV1 and that they are allosterically coupled. Although this type of allosteric coupling is embodied in the allosteric models that have been widely used to understand the complex polymodal gating of TRPV1 seen in electrophysiological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Latorre et al., 2007</xref>), this is the first direct biochemical demonstration of allosteric coupling between two ligands that activate TRPV1.</p><p>In addition to providing further validation of the RTx binding site inferred from the cryo-EM structure of TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), our mutagenesis results in TRPV2 provide a new perspective with which to view this poorly understood TRP channel. Our results demonstrate that as few as two TRPV1 residues need to be introduced into TRPV2 in order for RTx to bind to the channel with high affinity and to fully activate the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This finding suggests that a quiescent RTx binding pocket already exists in TRPV2, requiring only subtle engineering to make it competent to bind RTx, and demonstrating that the same basic vanilloid-activation mechanism exists in TRPV2 channels. Our single channel recordings of TRPV2 show that RTx binding can achieve high P<sub>o</sub>, and that the conductance of the open state is high and exhibits rectification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), properties that are very similar to the TRPV1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oseguera et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Premkumar et al., 2002</xref>). Collectively, these findings fit very well with the recent TRPV2 cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>), which shows that the channel adopts a structure that is remarkably similar to TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results are also compatible with a computational model of RTx docked into the structure of TRPV1, where the methoxyl and hydroxyl bearing aromatic ring of RTx hydrogen bond with S512 in TRPV1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Elokely et al., 2016</xref>). If we superimpose the cryo-EM structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2, the native F472 in TRPV2 (corresponding to S512) would likely sterically clash with the methoxyl and hydroxyl groups of RTx, and could not support the stabilizing hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl side chain of S512 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), explaining why this position is so critical for vanilloid binding to both TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16409.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Comparison of the structures of TRPV1 and TRPV2 and the RTx binding pocket.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Side view of the superposition of the cryo-EM structure of the RTx/DkTx-bound rTRPV1 channel (gray) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>) with that of rabbit TRPV2 (colored by chain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zubcevic et al., 2016</xref>).

Proton activation, as well as regulation by external Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jara-Oseguera et al., 2016</xref>), for example, appear to be unique features of TRPV1 channels. In demonstrating that TRPV1 and TRPV2 share vanilloid-activation mechanisms, our results suggest that the TRPV2 channel should be an excellent tool for defining the sites and mechanisms of activation for stimuli that are specific to TRPV1. In addition, the residues mutated in the TRPV2 quadruple mutant are for the most part conserved among TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4 channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that despite differing functional properties and physiological roles, it is possible that the vanilloid gating pathway of TRPV1 and TRPV2 is also conserved in TRPV3 and TRPV4 channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and characterization of GFP-tagged TRPV1 constructs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></title><p>Following a previously described <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> membrane protein expression protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker and Newstead, 2014</xref>), small-scale expression trials were performed in 10 mL of -Leu selective medium with 2% glucose incubated at 30°C in an orbital shaker for ~22 hrs.

The protein was then eluted in 250 mM imidazole, and cleaved during overnight dialysis at 4°C with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease (2 mg TEV/1 mg protein as estimated by fluorescence) in 3,500 MWCO dialysis tubing with stirring in 1.5 L dialysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 3x CMC detergent). In a second step of purification, after dialysis, the presumably cleaved protein solution was filtered with a 22 µM filter, and passed through a Ni Sepharose High Performance HisTrap column. The flow-through, now devoid of His- and GFP tags, as well as His-tagged TEV, was then concentrated to 500 µL using a 50,000 MWCO Vivaspin 20 concentrator. Generally, for the S1-S4 and S1-S6 of rTRPV1, aggregates formed during the TEV cleavage step, and if the second step of purification was performed no cleaved protein was visible in coomassie-stained gels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Expression of 1D4-tagged TRPV1 and TRPV2 constructs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></title><p>The full-length TRPV1 and TRPV2 channels with 1D4 affinity tags (TETSQVAPA) on their C-termini were cloned into the YEpHIS vector and expressed in the BJ5457 strain of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> using the strong constitutively active PMA1 promoter, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moiseenkova-Bell et al., 2008</xref>).

All data was analyzed using Igor Pro 6.34A (Wavemetrics Inc., Tigard, OR). Pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass, covered in dental wax and heat-polished to final resistances between 10 – 15 MΩ.

Single channel currents were recorded using a protocol consisting of 100 ms at a holding potential of −90 mV, 500 ms pulse at +90 mV, followed by another 100 ms at −90 mV, which was applied every 700 ms for the duration of the recording. Data collected at +90 mV and the 100 ms before the step to +90 mV were used for analyzing channel behavior at the two potentials.</p><p>A series of null-traces were obtained in control solution (in the absence of agonists) before application of RTx, and were used for subtraction of the leak currents and the capacitive transients. No spontaneous channel activity was recorded in control solution (data not shown). Recordings in RTx were started as soon as the patch was perfused with the agonist, which was followed by a 10–30 s delay period in which no channel activity was observed, followed by robust channel activation. To reflect the P<sub>o</sub> of RTx-bound channels, mean P<sub>o</sub> values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> were calculated after the initial period where no channel activity was observed. The P<sub>o</sub> for every sweep was calculated using the 50% threshold crossing technique, which consists in generating idealized traces from the recordings, where data points above a specified threshold are assigned a value of 1 and data points below the threshold are assigned a value of 0, and the P<sub>o</sub> is calculated as the mean value of the idealized trace. For recordings at +90 mV, a threshold value of 4.5 pA was used (approximately half of the maximal conductance level of 10 pA), whereas a threshold of 1.2 pA was used for the recordings at -90 mV. A 5-pass binomial smoothing function was applied to the data at -90 mV prior to calculation of the P<sub>o</sub>. For multi-channel patches, multiple thresholds were used and idealized traces were assigned a value of 2 when two channels were open simultaneously. For data obtained at +90 mV a threshold slightly lower than 50% of the maximal single-channel current amplitude was used so that subconductance levels were counted as channel openings. The mean P<sub>o</sub> data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref> is the average of the P<sub>o</sub>-values for all sweeps in each patch, with an N = 2 for two-channel patches. For each patch the mean P<sub>o</sub>was also calculated from the normalized all-points histograms. In this case, histograms compiled from all recorded data-points after leak subtraction at a specified voltage were normalized to the area under the histogram curve. A Gaussian curve was fit to the data centered at 0 pA, and the area under its curve (A<sub>C</sub>) was calculated. The P<sub>o</sub> was then calculated as P<sub>o</sub> = 1 – A<sub>C</sub>. Both methods for calculating P<sub>o</sub> gave identical results (data not shown). The single-channel current amplitudes were calculated from Gaussian fits to the all-points histogram portion corresponding to the current level of a single open channel.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Joe Mindell, Shai Silberberg, Gilman Toombes and members of the Swartz lab for helpful discussions.

Your article has been reviewed by Rachelle Gaudet and Baron Chanda, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Despite the availability of a new higher resolution structure of TRPV2, the gating mechanisms of TRPV2 remain largely unknown. Unlike TRPV1 channels, vanilloid compounds do not activate TRPV2 channels, although both channels have a similar architecture. Here, the authors have used biochemical and electrophysiological approaches to identify the minimal determinants of resiniferatoxin (RTx) binding site in TRPV1 channels. Strikingly, they were able to transfer this binding site from TRPV1 to TRPV2 channels with as few as four binding site mutations, which also permitted investigation of the gating properties of TRPV2. This demonstrates that TRPV1 and TRPV2 not only share very similar structures, as demonstrated by recent cryoEM structures, but also very similar channel gating mechanics, and that a &quot;quiescent&quot; RTx binding pocket is present in TRPV2. This is a foundational study, which demonstrates that gating mechanism is conserved between these channels and the ligand sensing can be ported between various channels of this family.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers found the study to be of great interest and well executed, saying &quot;Overall, the data are of high quality, well-illustrated and assessed with good statistics. The manuscript is very clearly written and the interpretations generally warranted. The results are of high importance to the field of ion channels, but also to those interested in pain sensing and sensory perception in general&quot; and &quot;I was impressed by the use of extensive biochemistry to demonstrate binding rather than limiting the study to dose response curves which is a standard in the field. Their binding measurements provide crucial evidence that the activation of the channels involve direct binding of RTx to TRPV1 and mutant TRPV2 channels. From a mechanistic standpoint, this is much more insightful because a dose-response curve would have just demonstrated that the activity is portable. Dose-response curves do not discriminate between the possibility that the RTx is also binding to TRPV2 but fails to activate the channel due to a lack of &quot;proper&quot; gating machinery or that the RTx just does not bind to the TRPV2 channel. In this study, they have addressed these questions comprehensively.&quot; The essential points to be addressed are the following:</p><p>1) Addressing the question of oligomerization either by correcting/editing the Discussion or by adding information about FSEC experiments, as described in the first point below.</p><p>2) Addressing the question of whether RTx may still bind the QM mutant, as described in the second point below, either experimentally with biochemical studies or through a clear discussion that clarifies and considers that possibility.</p><p>Detailed description for essential revisions:</p><p>1) I have one somewhat substantial concern, regarding the authors' discussions of oligomeric states: In the subsection “Allosteric interactions between DkTx and RTx”, the authors discuss possible oligomeric states for their truncated TRPV1 constructs. The authors seem to confuse the TRPA1 structure with that of TRPV1? A coiled coil was observed in the C-terminal region of the TRPA1 structure, not TRPV1. Also the TRPV1 structure suggests that any construct containing S5-S6 would likely need to tetramerize to form a native structure. Furthermore, SEC is a rather poor method, without additional information from other experiments, to assess oligomeric state. This comes up again in the Discussion, where the authors discuss SEC data that are not presented in the paper (only data for S1-S4 is shown, and S1-S6 and S1-Cterm constructs are discussed). It would be preferable to either include the data under Discussion and/or to tone down the arguments about oligomeric state, which are not particularly essential to the conclusions. If the authors want to include the current discussion of likely oligomeric state, then they should also include additional information about their FSEC experiments, such as the behavior of molecular weight standards on their column, and/or of related or previously validated constructs.</p><p>2) Although TRPV1 QM mutant does not clearly get activated by RTx, there is no accompanying biochemical evidence to show that these channels are not binding to RTx. The authors have shown that TRPV2QM is binding to RTx but there are other differences between TRPV1 and V2. Therefore, it is still possible that RTx is binding to TRPV1QM mutant but is unable to activate the channels.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16409.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>The reviewers found the study to be of great interest and well executed, saying &quot;Overall, the data are of high quality, well-illustrated and assessed with good statistics.

We now comment on this in the Results (subsection “Interrogating the vanilloid binding pocket in TRPV1”, last paragraph) and point out that a previous study has shown that two of the four mutants in TRPV1-QM dramatically diminish binding of RTx, making it likely that the TRPV1-QM would bind RTx with very low affinity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
