Here, we show that the transcriptional regulator Yap, a key effector of the Hippo pathway, is required for the proper patterning and morphogenesis of SMG epithelium. Epithelial deletion of <italic>Yap</italic> in developing SMGs results in the loss of ductal structures, arising from reduced expression of the EGF family member Epiregulin, which we show is required for the expansion of Krt5/Krt14-positive ductal progenitors. We further show that epithelial deletion of the <italic>Lats1</italic> and <italic>Lats2</italic> genes, which encode kinases that restrict nuclear Yap localization, results in morphogenesis defects accompanied by an expansion of Krt5/Krt14-positive cells. Collectively, our data indicate that Yap-induced Epiregulin signaling promotes the identity of SMG ductal progenitors and that removal of nuclear Yap by Lats1/2-mediated signaling is critical for proper ductal maturation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23499.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23499.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23499.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our mouths are continually bathed by saliva – a thick, clear liquid that helps us to swallow and digest our food and protects us against infections. Saliva is produced by and released from salivary glands, which are organs that contain a branched network of tubes. Salivary glands can only properly develop if immature cells known as stem cells, which give rise to the mature cells in the organ, are controlled. Despite their importance for development of salivary glands, little has been known about the signals that control these stem cells.</p><p>Szymaniak et al. have now discovered new regulators of the salivary gland stem cells in mice, including essential roles in the regulation of these cells by a protein known as Yap. The Yap protein is controlled by a set of proteins that together are known as the Hippo pathway. Szymaniak et al. found that when the gene for Yap was deleted in mice very few stem cells were made, and the transport tubes of the salivary tubes failed to develop. Conversely, when the Hippo pathway was disrupted in mice there were too many stem cells because they could not properly develop into the mature cells, leading to incorrect transport tube development..</p><p>These results indicate that Yap is essential for controlling the stem cells of the salivary glands, and offer important insight into the signals that control how the salivary glands develop. The next step will be to investigate whether the Hippo pathway or Yap are affected in diseases of the salivary gland, which often show incorrect numbers of stem cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23499.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23499.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>salivary gland</kwd><kwd>Hippo pathway</kwd><kwd>YAP</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>differentiation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000912</institution-id><institution>March of Dimes Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1-FY14-219</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varelas</surname><given-names>Xaralabos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HL124392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varelas</surname><given-names>Xaralabos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100003392</institution-id><institution>Sjogren's Syndrome Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varelas</surname><given-names>Xaralabos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000072</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 DE024954</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kukuruzinska</surname><given-names>Maria</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UL1-TR001430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gower</surname><given-names>Adam C</given-names></name><name><surname>Varelas</surname><given-names>Xaralabos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptional regulator YAP directs the specification and differentiation of stem cells that give rise to salivary gland ductal epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian epithelial branching program is a highly dynamic and organized process that leads to the formation of branched networks of tubule structures that terminate in acini with specialized functions. Understanding how epithelial progenitor cells pattern into ducts and acini, and how this is coordinated with ongoing tissue morphogenesis, is one of the central questions in epithelial development. The submandibular gland (SMG) offers a model to study the molecular mechanisms directing epithelial branching morphogenesis and patterning, with distinct synchronized processes of cell proliferation, clefting, differentiation, migration and apoptosis occurring rapidly during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hauser and Hoffman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mattingly et al., 2015</xref>). The developing SMG epithelium communicates with neighboring mesenchymal, neuronal and endothelial cells to direct reiterative rounds of bud and duct formation that mature into epithelial domains that mediate the production, transportation, and secretion of saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knosp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Patel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Steinberg et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wells et al., 2014</xref>). Following initial bud formation, it is thought that specification of distinct multipotent progenitor populations give rise to the specialized cell populations that compose the acinar and ductal domains. For example, multi-potent populations of Cytokeratin-5 (Krt5, K5)- and Cytokeratin-14 (Krt14, K14)-positive progenitors are thought to govern the formation of epithelial cells that give rise to the mature ductal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>). Although numerous molecular studies have focused on understanding the biology of SMG progenitors, much remains unclear about the intrinsic signals that define their identity and/or control their differentiation.</p><p>Recent studies have provided evidence that the transcriptional regulator Yap plays essential roles in stem cell biology and that these roles are essential for the development of branching organs, such as the kidney, lung, pancreas, and mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Varelas, 2014</xref>). Ectopic expression of <italic>Yap</italic> has been shown to drive the expansion of progenitor populations in several tissues, while conditional deletion of <italic>Yap</italic> in organ-specific stem cells can lead to the inhibition of stem cell specification or the induction of premature differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Panciera et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). In particular, the dynamics of Yap localization is implicated in controlling the balance of specification, self-renewal, and differentiation of various stem cell populations. Yap localization is controlled by a multitude of signals that include those mediated by the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). The Hippo pathway is comprised of a series of kinase-mediated signaling events that result in the phosphorylation and activation of the Lats1 and Lats2 kinases (herein together referred to as Lats1/2). Activated Lats1/2 redundantly direct the phosphorylation of Yap on conserved serine residues, the best characterized of which is S112 in mouse Yap (S127 in human Yap), which restricts the nuclear accumulation and transcriptional activity of Yap. Loss of Lats1/2-mediated regulation of Yap activity leads to defective organ patterning and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heallen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reginensi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yi et al., 2016</xref>), highlighting the importance of Hippo pathway signaling in development.</p><p>Here, we used genetic approaches to examine the roles of Hippo-Yap signaling in SMG epithelial development. We found that embryonic deletion of Yap in developing SMGs resulted in severe morphogenesis defects, which notably did not arise from aberrant cell proliferation or apoptosis, but rather from defects in progenitor patterning. We show that Yap is required for the specification of Krt5/Krt14-positive ductal progenitor cells, and that Yap does so, in part, by controlling the expression of the epidermal growth factor family member Epiregulin (Ereg). Treatment of ex vivo cultured SMGs with Ereg was sufficient to expand Krt5/Krt14-positive cells and rescue cell fate specification defects observed in <italic>Yap</italic>-deleted SMGs. Conversely, we found that deletion of the Hippo kinases <italic>Lats1/2</italic> resulted in massive expansion of Krt5/Krt14-positive ductal cells in developing SMG epithelium, and that this phenotype could be blunted by EGFR (ErbB-1) inhibition. These findings demonstrate that Yap is a critical regulator of ductal progenitor cell identity in SMG epithelium and that proper control of Yap localization by Lats1/2 is essential for the maturation of SMG ducts. Our study therefore identifies novel essential effectors of SMG development and provides important insight into early patterning events that are coupled with branching morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Nuclear Yap marks distinct populations of developing SMG ductal epithelial cells</title><p>To gain insight into the role(s) of Yap during SMG development we examined the levels and localization of Yap in early branching SMGs using immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. We closely monitored the distribution of Yap with respect to known markers of early patterning, including Krt14, which labels multipotent progenitors that can give rise to ductal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nedvetsky et al., 2014</xref>) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We found that Yap was prominently expressed in E13.5 SMG epithelium, and distinct Yap localization differences were apparent in various cell populations of the branching gland. A cell layer at the peripheral edge of each end-bud showed some cells with nuclear Yap localization, whereas all cells immediately adjacent and extending away from the edge of the bud showed cytoplasmic Yap localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). Yap also showed very prominent nuclear localization in cells transitioning proximally towards the newly developing ductal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>), overlapping precisely with Krt14-positive ductal progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23499.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nuclear Yap marks distinct populations of developing SMG ductal epithelial cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Illustration depicting the early developing SMG epithelium, with the positioning of relevant multipotent progenitor cells highlighted.

Krt5-positive basal-positioned cells possess stem cell activity and are believed to play important roles in adult SMG injury repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knox et al., 2013</xref>) (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The large majority of maturing ductal epithelial cells in E15.5 and in differentiated E18.5 SMGs exhibited cytoplasmic Yap localization, particularly cells positioned at the luminal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). Cytoplasmic Yap localization correlated with increased Serine-112 phosphorylation of Yap (pS112-Yap) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which is a site phosphorylated by the Hippo pathway kinases Lats1/2 and promotes cytoplasmic Yap localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). While few in number, some ductal epithelial cells in E15.5 and E18.5 SMGs exhibited prominent nuclear Yap localization, and these cells were generally positioned in the basal layer of Krt5-positive epithelial cells. However, not all Krt5-positive cells showed nuclear Yap localization, suggesting that nuclear Yap marks a distinct sub-population of cells with this marker or that we captured a snapshot of dynamic Yap localization occurring in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Epithelial deletion of Yap results in severe branching defects and impaired ductal domain specification in developing SMGs</title><p>To assess the importance of Yap in SMG development, we sought to conditionally delete <italic>Yap</italic> in the epithelium of embryonic SMGs.

After 24 hr of explant culture, WT SMGs exhibited extensive branching, with expected robust Krt14 and Krt5 expression in developing ductal epithelial regions, and Krt19 expression marking maturing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs failed to branch after 24 hr of culture and exhibited an almost complete absence of Krt5, Krt14, or Krt19-expressing cells, except for a small segment of the most proximal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–E</xref>). The lack of these markers suggested that <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs fail to specify ductal progenitors and consequently ductal epithelium. Parasympathetic nerve innervation plays a crucial role in the growth and regulation of SMG ductal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knosp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nedvetsky et al., 2014</xref>), which prompted us to examine the distribution of the parasympathetic nerve in <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs by staining for the nerve marker TuJ1. Despite being present in the <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs, parasympathetic nerve innervation was diminished and unorganized, suggesting that signaling crosstalk with the nerve may be compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). The structural organization of the actin cytoskeleton was also severely disrupted in <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), indicating defective polarization that is required for proper epithelial maturation. Interestingly, markers associated with the developing bud domains, such as Sox10, were abundant in <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>), suggesting that the early development of the bud epithelium is unaffected following the loss of Yap. Taken together, our analyses indicated that the deletion of <italic>Yap</italic> leads to a loss of an early ductal progenitor population, resulting in branching morphogenesis defects.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23499.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Yap is required for SMG ductal epithelial patterning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IF analysis of Yap (green) and Krt14 (K14, white) in E15.5 WT and <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs.

Ereg treatment led to a morphological thickening and enlargement of the ductal domain that was accompanied by a reduction in the bud domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). IF microscopy analysis showed a striking enrichment in Krt5- and Krt14-positive cells, with these cells composing almost the entire SMG epithelium, including distal epithelial regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Comparative staining with Tuj1 showed a more broadly distributed nerve in the Ereg-treated glands, and F-actin cytoskeletal analysis indicated that along with the expansion of ductal progenitors in response to Ereg, the cytoskeletal organization was disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, treatment of <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMG explants with exogenous Ereg partially rescued some of the observed defects. Most notably, we observed the Ereg treatment led to the emergence of Krt5/Krt14-positive cells, with a subset of these cells also expressing Krt19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), all of which were normally absent in <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs. Analysis of the F-actin cytoskeleton of Ereg-treated <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs suggested a partial rescue in the organization of duct and bud domains, as some regions exhibited ductal-like F-actin organization and buds showed a slight clefting morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Moreover, slight broadening of nerve innervation was also apparent in the Ereg-treated <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMGs. To quantify the effects on cell fate, we performed qPCR analysis on parallel SMG explant cultures, and found that treatment of WT and Yap-cnull SMGs with exogenous Ereg led to increased <italic>Krt5</italic> and <italic>Krt14</italic> expression comparable to control glands without treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). These data indicated that Ereg stimulation of SMG epithelium was capable of rescuing some of the patterning defects observed in <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull epithelium, and that this modestly rescued the associated morphogenesis defects.</p><p>To explore the role(s) of endogenous Ereg in SMG epithelial patterning, we transfected E13.5 WT SMGs with either control siRNA or siRNA targeting Ereg, and then cultured the developing SMGs ex vivo for 24 hr.

Microscopy analysis of Ereg-depleted SMGs showed branching defects along with a dramatic loss of Krt5-and Krt14-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as well a reduction in cells marked with Krt19 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Depletion of Ereg also resulted in diminished nerve innervation and growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

The Lats1 and Lats2 kinases (Lats1/2) are known to phosphorylate Yap, which restricts nuclear Yap localization and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). Given that we observed Yap phosphorylation that correlated with its cytoplasmic localization in maturing SMG ductal epithelium, we next set out to characterize the potential relationship with the Lats1/2 kinases. We started by examining Lats1/2 activity and localization in E15.5 SMGs by IF microscopy using an antibody that recognizes the phosphorylated-active forms of Lats1/2 (p-Lats1/2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymaniak et al., 2015</xref>). We found that active Lats1/2 was absent in developing bud epithelium and abundant in mature luminal ductal SMG cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). P-Lats1/2 was localized to the apical domain of the majority of luminal ductal cells, correlating with cells that exhibit cytoplasmic Yap localization. We have shown previously that inhibition of Lats2 with siRNA in E13.5 SMG explant cultures gives rise to branching defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enger et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that p-Lats1/2 in the ductal epithelium plays an important role. To define how Lats1/2 activity impacts SMG development, we used the <italic>Shh</italic>-Cre recombinase to conditionally delete the <italic>Lats1</italic> and the <italic>Lats2</italic> genes in the epithelium of developing mouse SMGs (herein referred to as <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heallen et al., 2011</xref>). Deletion of either <italic>Lats1</italic> or <italic>Lats2</italic> alone did not show any observable morphological defects in SMG development (data not shown). However, deletion of both <italic>Lats1</italic> and <italic>Lats2</italic> led to severe morphogenesis defects, with an almost complete lack of branching at early developmental time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). E13.5 <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull SMGs displayed an enormous augmentation of the ductal domain at the expense of the distal bud, which continued to expand to a very large size in ex vivo cultures. Similarly, E15.5 <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull SMGs exhibited a large ductal structure with a severely enlarged major/primary ductal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). IF microscopy analysis showed that almost all the epithelial cells within <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull SMGs exhibited strong nuclear Yap localization and that pS112-Yap levels were completely absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). To investigate the effect of <italic>Lats1/2</italic> deletion on the entire ductal tree, we analyzed E18.5 WT and <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull SMGs for Krt5, Krt14, and Yap by IF microscopy.

We show that the deletion of Yap in developing SMG epithelium leads to severe patterning and morphogenesis defects. Our data suggest that these defects arise, in large part, from the loss of nuclear Yap transcriptional activity, which defines signals important for instructing the specification of ductal epithelial progenitors. This conclusion is based on our observations that <italic>Yap</italic>-cnull SMG epithelium fails to develop ductal domains and shows severely reduced numbers of Krt5 and Krt14-positive cells, which are markers that have been associated with ductal progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lombaert et al., 2013</xref>). We show that developing SMG epithelium displays distinct localization patterns for Yap in various regions, with nuclear Yap most pronounced in the cells of the developing bud, cells developing into ductal areas, as well as in subpopulations of basal epithelial cells that line the SMG ducts, which interestingly are all regions that exhibit cytoskeletal tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Harunaga et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, cytoplasmic Yap is observed in regions associated with luminal differentiation of the ducts, suggesting that the removal of nuclear Yap is required for SMG epithelial differentiation. Consistent with this premise, deletion of the Hippo pathway Lats1/2 kinases in developing SMG epithelium resulted in aberrant nuclear Yap localization and expansion of Krt5 and Krt14-positive cells in regions that normally undergo ductal maturation.</p><p>Hippo pathway-mediated restriction of nuclear Yap activity has classically been associated with the governance of organ size via a growth-restricting mechanism that relies on precise coordination between proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Pan, 2010</xref>). As such, Yap and upstream Hippo pathway effectors have emerged as influential oncogenes and tumor-suppressors, respectively. As evidenced here, dynamic Hippo signaling during epithelial morphogenesis extends beyond the view that Hippo signaling controls organ size only by directing cell growth. Rather, our observations from <italic>Yap</italic>- and <italic>Lats1/2</italic>-cnull SMGs indicate that Hippo pathway activity is primarily involved in directing a balance in the specification, renewal, and differentiation of ductal progenitors. Similar roles for Hippo pathway-mediated Yap signaling have been described in other branching organs, including the lung, kidney and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">George et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mahoney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reginensi et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, however, although Yap plays key roles in progenitor control across different organs, the mechanism(s) by which Yap exerts these functions appears to be context-dependent, likely relating to the distinct signaling network that is organized in each respective organ.</p><p>The identification of a role for Ereg in SMG patterning and morphogenesis resembles its role in other systems. In the intestine, a Yap-Ereg network that involves neighboring stromal cells is central for promoting epithelial cell survival and inducing a regenerative program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gregorieff et al., 2015</xref>). However, unlike the intestine, our data suggest that in the SMG, Yap promotes the expression of Ereg in the epithelium to sustain a progenitor niche. Accordingly, we observed elevated Ereg expression in the newly forming ductal progenitor regions and in distinct regions of basal ductal epithelium, precisely the sites with the highest levels of nuclear Yap. We further found that depletion of Ereg or small molecule-mediated inhibition of EGFR, a major receptor for Ereg, results in epithelial branching and maturation defects that resemble those in Yap-cnull SMGs. These observations paralleled those observed following the deletion of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Häärä et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jaskoll and Melnick, 1999</xref>) and are consistent with recent observations that heparin binding-EGF treatment of SMGs can promote the expansion of Krt5 progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, we show that ex vivo treatment of developing SMG organ cultures with Ereg expands Krt5 and Krt14-positive cells even in the absence of Yap, indicating that Ereg signaling is sufficient to overcome cell fate defects associated with Yap deletion. Together, these data support a model (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) in which nuclear Yap-induced Ereg defines a niche of EGFR signaling that is central in promoting the identity of ductal progenitors.</p><p>Signals transduced by the acetylcholine (Ach)/muscarinic (M) receptor 1 in the parasympathetic submandibular ganglion have been shown to increase EGFR protein expression and increase the expansion of Krt5 progenitors in the SMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knox et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that signals emanating from the nerve may crosstalk with Yap, or Yap-regulated signals may communicate with the nerve to control ductal progenitor specification and maturation. Consistent with this idea, we observed diminished and disorganized parasympathetic innervation in both the Yap-cnull and Lats1/2-cnull SMGs. Recent work has shown that Neuregulin1 (Nrg1), a neuregulin family ligand that can activate EGFR, promotes the expression of Wnt ligands that signal to direct parasympathetic innervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Knosp et al., 2015</xref>). The Hippo signaling pathway is highly interconnected with the Wnt pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzolin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Varelas et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heallen et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is tempting to speculate that Yap-nerve signaling crosstalk plays a key role in ductal progenitor patterning and may be linked to signals that direct epithelial branching.</p><p>Our observations implicate the dynamics of Yap localization in the control of ductal epithelial maturation. Several studies have shown that the developing ductal epithelium acquires specialized polarity cues as it matures. Given that polarity cues are tightly integrated with the control of Yap localization and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymaniak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Varelas et al., 2010b</xref>), it is likely that epithelial polarity-mediated regulation of Yap directs the differentiation of the ductal epithelium. Indeed, recent work in the developing lung epithelium shows that polarity-regulating proteins, such as the Crumbs transmembrane proteins that direct apical domain specification, promote interactions between the Lats1/2 kinases and Yap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymaniak et al., 2015</xref>). The dynamics of these polarity proteins, which may be controlled by the mechanical microenvironment, direct the localization of Yap and control cell differentiation. For example, basal stem cell cells in the lung epithelium lack aspects of epithelial polarity and exhibit high levels of nuclear Yap that promotes the basal stem cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymaniak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Notably, we observed a subset of basal epithelial cells in maturing SMG ducts with prominent nuclear Yap localization. These basal cells, a subset of which are marked by Krt5 in adult SMGs, are thought to possess stem cell activity that can repair adult SMG epithelium upon damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Knox et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, nuclear Yap may contribute to the identity of these stem cells as it does in other organs, such as the skin and the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Silvis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Szymaniak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). However, nuclear Yap in the ductal basal cells did not perfectly correlate with Krt5 expression, suggesting that the Krt5-positive population is composed of distinct subpopulations, as proposed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lombaert and Hoffman, 2010</xref>), or that Yap localization is dynamic in these cells and our observations captured only a snapshot. Our in situ analysis of <italic>Ereg</italic> expression in maturing ducts also suggested that only a sub-population of basal ductal cells express <italic>Ereg</italic>. Thus, it is possible that a Yap-Ereg signaling niche specifies a unique basal progenitor identity. Such a progenitor niche may be dysregulated in salivary gland carcinomas, as Krt5-positive populations are frequently amplified in these tumors. Many studies have implicated Yap as a pro-tumorigenic factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harvey et al., 2013</xref>), and thus knowledge into the developmental mechanisms, such as that provided by our study, may offer insight into the etiology of salivary gland diseases. One such disease may be Sjogren’s Syndrome, a debilitating autoimmune disease that affects salivary secretion, as aberrant Yap localization has been observed in the salivary gland epithelium of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Enger et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Krt5-expressing cell populations have been observed to be expanded in Sjogren’s Syndrome epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gervais et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, dysregulated Yap-mediated cell fate control may be linked to this diseased state.</p><p>In summary, our observations indicate that Yap is required for directing ductal SMG epithelial progenitor patterning, with nuclear Yap inducing the expression of Ereg, which drives signals for the specification of ductal epithelial progenitors; removal of Yap from the nucleus is therefore a requirement for the maturation of ductal structures. Importantly, our work highlights similarities in Yap signaling with other branching organs while also uncovering significant differences. Thus, given the importance of Yap signaling in organ development and disease, understanding this context is an important challenge for the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Developmental studies on wild-type mice were performed using C57BL/6 mice.

For increased resolution, SMGs were compressed between two coverslips before imaging, and imaged using an epi-fluorescent microscope (Carl Zeiss; Axio Observer.D1).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Dr. Jeffrey Wrana and Alexander Gregorieff (Lunenfeld Tanenbaum Research Institute, Toronto, Canada) for the <italic>Yap</italic>-loxP/loxP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reginensi et al., 2013</xref>) for the DIG-labeled <italic>Ereg</italic> probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gregorieff et al., 2015</xref>), and Dr. Randy Johnson (MD Anderson, Houston, TX) for the <italic>Lats1</italic>-loxP/loxP and <italic>Lats2</italic>-loxP/loxP mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heallen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers found your study interesting and highly relevant to the salivary gland, but felt that it lacks the level of novel insight expected for <italic>eLife</italic>. Additionally, there were concerns about extensive reuse of images (for instance, some images appear in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and lack of information on the numbers of experiments performed, throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors address the role of Yap and its regulators Lats1 and 2 in development of the submandibular gland (SMG). They show by conditional KO (using <italic>Shh</italic>-Cre) that Yap is needed for normal patterning and morphogenesis of the SMG; deletion of Yap results in loss of ductal structures, both in vivo and in explant culture. To gain insight into the mechanism through which Yap regulates SMG development, they then analysed the transcriptomes of E15.5 WT versus CKO SMG. This indicated Epiregulin as among the genes downregulated in the absence of Yap. Subsequent explant culture experiments showed that Epiregulin could partially compensate for loss of Yap; addition of Epiregulin to the in vitro cultures increased the size of the ductal domain and area expressing Keratins 5, 14 and 19, and from this the authors conclude that Epiregulin expression downstream of Yap regulates expansion of ductal progenitors. The authors then go on to show that regulation of Yap by Lats1 and 2 is required for differentiation of ductal epithelial cells; in the absence of Lats1/2, the primary ductal domain is enlarged and shows nuclear Yap localisation, along with substantially increased Epiregulin expression. By pharmacological inhibition, the authors show that signalling through EGFR (the receptor for Ereg) is required for expansion of the ductal progenitors observed in the absence of Lats1/2. Overall the manuscript is very clearly presented and the data appear to be of a high standard.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Syzmaniak et al. expands on the known roles of Yap in epithelial tissues and progenitor cell regulation by describing a novel role for YAP in regulating epithelial morphogenesis during embryonic salivary gland development. The authors show that genetic ablation of YAP and its regulators LATS1/2 impair epithelial branching morphogenesis and duct formation as well as maintenance of progenitor cells marked by KRT5 and KRT14. Furthermore, they show using genetic experiments and gene expression profiling that YAP is a positive regulator of the EGFR ligand epiregulin: in the absence of epithelial YAP, epiregulin is lost and that epiregulin may be a regulator of the progenitors, thus linking YAP to EGFR signaling. Using ex vivo cultures of the YAP mutant they are able to show that exogenous epiregulin can rescue progenitor cells (if not morphogenesis) in the remaining epithelium, suggesting that a YAP/epiregulin/EGFR signaling regulates these cells. This is further supported by the Lats1/2 conditional mutants where aberrant nuclear Yap expression drives increased levels of epiregulin and ductal progenitors. The increase in progenitors is abrogated when EGFR signaling is blocked. Together these findings begin to define the role of Hippo pathway signaling in the development of the salivary gland as well as establishing the novel requirement for epiregulin.</p><p>Substantive concerns</p><p>1) Although this is the first study showing the effects of ablation or activation of the Hippo pathway on salivary gland development, the Hippo pathway has previously been examined in multiple epithelial organs and these have shown a requirement for this pathway in their development and progenitor cell populations. This study indicates that morphogenesis of the tissue as well as the progenitor populations are also perturbed in this organ but the manuscript falls short of revealing new insights into how YAP regulates morphogenic or stem cell programs. The authors do point out some very interesting phenotypic and cellular outcomes, such as the expanded ducts and polarity defects in the LATS1/2 conditional and reduced bud number in the YAP mutant, but stop short of investigating how these cell/tissue phenotypic outcomes are achieved. Further characterization of these phenotypes is required for publication.</p><p>2) The finding that epiregulin is regulated by Hippo signaling is novel. However, there is little data to support the claim that epiregulin is a regulator of ductal progenitors during gland development. The authors use a gain of function assay in the ex vivo system and show increased progenitor cells in the absence of YAP when treated with exogenous epiregulin. This indicates that epiregulin is sufficient, but it does not show that epiregulin is either necessary or is involved in this process in the wild type tissue. Unfortunately, use of a chemical inhibitor of EGFR in the LATS1/2 mutant cultured ex vivo does not solve this due to non-specificity. It is just as likely that inhibition of EGFR is perturbing HBEGF/EGFR interactions. Knockdown or ablation of epiregulin in the epithelium is needed.</p><p>3) Previous studies in the salivary gland show that parasympathetic nerves regulate KRT5+ progenitor cells (Knox et al., 2010; Knosp et al., 2015). The authors in the current study base their conclusion that parasympathetic nerves are not affected by ablation of YAP or are adversely affected by ablation of LATS1/2 by visual inspection. However, visual inspection at low resolution cannot be used alone to draw the conclusion that the nerves are or are not affected. qPCR analysis of neuronal proteins or neurotransmitters that are suggestive of function or growth is needed to substantiate the claim that nerves are or are not altered. In addition, ablation of the nerves or inhibiting of their function would also indicate that they are not involved in altering progenitor populations in the mutants.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors report observations that advance our understanding of the role and regulation of Yap in the salivary gland. They show that Yap phosphorylation and localization are patterned, with nuclear (active) Yap in ductal progenitor cells, and cytoplasmic (inactive) Yap in differentiating cells. This is consistent with studies in other organs that have reported nuclear Yap in progenitor cells. They assess both loss and gain-of-function phenotypes for Yap, through deletion of a Yap conditional allele, or deletion of the Yap regulators Lats1 and Lats2. Consistent with the expression data, these studies support a key role for Yap in specifying progenitor cell fate, with both loss and gain of Yap activity severely disrupting salivary gland development. The authors also conduct expression studies, which leads them to identify the EGFR ligand Epiregulin as a key mediator of Yap activity in the salivary gland. An unanswered question is how Yap activity is normally controlled in the developing salivary gland, but I think it's reasonable to leave this for a future study. Overall I found this an interesting report that advances our understanding of salivary gland development and significantly advances our understanding of how Hippo signaling influences salivary gland development.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter sent to the authors in response to their appeal.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;The Hippo pathway effector YAP is an essential regulator of submandibular gland ductal progenitor patterning&quot; for consideration at eLife.

Our study reveals for the first time that Yap signaling is essential for salivary gland epithelial development, and offers novel insight into how Yap is directing the development of this organ. In doing so, we describe (for the first time) an important role for Epiregulin (Ereg) in SMG ductal progenitor patterning. Moreover, our manuscript describes (for the first time) that the Lats1/2 kinases are essential upstream regulators of Yap activity in SMG epithelium, and that loss of Lats1/2 leads to an uncontrolled expansion of Krt5/Krt14 cell populations. Our observations have implications beyond SMG development, as Krt5/Krt14 cell populations are critical for SMG epithelial repair and are often dysregulated in diseases, such as cancer. Therefore, we believe our work offers important novel insight into developmental and disease processes and will be relevant to a broad readership.</p><p><italic>The authors do point out some very interesting phenotypic and cellular outcomes, such as the expanded ducts and polarity defects in the LATS1/2 conditional and reduced bud number in the YAP mutant, but stop short of investigating how these cell/tissue phenotypic outcomes are achieved.
