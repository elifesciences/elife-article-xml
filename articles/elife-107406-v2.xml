However, functional inferences from morphology need to consider morphological features across different organizational scales and spatial resolutions. Here, we compare morphological features ranging from sub-dental patterns to whole dentitions within a large ensemble of species encompassing all extant shark orders. Although taxa scoring high for different heterodonty measures are distributed throughout the phylogeny, the two shark superorders show a different degree of modularity between mono- and dignathic heterodonty as well as substantial differences in ecological niches. Intriguingly, we observe two alternative ways of increasing dental complexity: either at the tooth- or dentition-level. Correlating heterodonty and single-tooth complexity with ecological and life-history traits, we find that pelagic and demersal species evolve dental complexity in different ways. We track trait variability as a function of genetic distance, thus quantifying dental trait adaptability at different resolutions. Overall, intermediate resolution levels, namely the degree of monognathic heterodonty, predict ecological traits best but carry a relatively low phylogenetic signal, suggesting a more dynamic adaptability on shorter evolutionary timescales. This raises macro-evolutionary interpretations about the evolvability of nested modular phenotypic structures, with important implications for paleo-ecological inferences from sequentially homologous traits.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Teeth are among the most diverse and complex organs in the animal kingdom that have evolved over millions of years to accommodate a wide range of diets and habitats.

This question is critical because many biological functions arise from the integration of traits across multiple spatial scales – from fine serrations and cusps to differences between teeth and jaws – and establishing a methodological framework for comparing these levels has remained a major challenge. Moreover, while isolated shark teeth have been studied previously, little is known about how sharks have adapted to different ecological niches.</p><p>To address this, Zimm et al. developed a new methodology for comparing dentitions using an online collection of shark teeth combined with genomic data. Their analyses revealed strong statistical differences in types of dental complexity between the two major shark groups and the different environments they inhabit, especially the deep sea and the open ocean. For example, the way neighboring teeth differ from each other is more shaped by their ecological niches rather than by genetic relationships, while the latter explains more details within teeth or dental differences between jaws.</p><p>These findings provide new insights into how integrated biological systems adapt and evolve. Because shark dentitions are tightly linked to ecological function, this work may also offer new avenues for studying long-term changes in marine ecosystems. Together, these perspectives could play an important role in developing both general and specific predictions about how the biosphere may evolve in a rapidly changing world.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sharks</kwd><kwd>tooth complexity</kwd><kwd>macro-evolution</kwd><kwd>ecology</kwd><kwd>evolvability</kwd><kwd>morphometrics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/018mejw64</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZI1809/1-1:1 Proj.432922638</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zimm</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00rbzpz17</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-21-CE02-0015 PLASTICiTEETH</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goudemand</surname><given-names>Nicolas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Shark dentition is a complex and hyper-diverse trait integrating multiple spatial levels, with mid-scale features being most crucial for functional adaptation, revealing evolutionary patterns that offer insights into distinct ecological strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Teeth have been used as a powerful proxy for ecological function and adaptive evolution across vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jernvall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Fischer et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eronen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Segall et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans and Sanson, 2003</xref>). As a hyper-diverse structure displaying considerable morphological variation within meso-evolutionary frameworks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Streelman and Albertson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lafuma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Davis et al., 2016</xref>), tooth shape tends to be fine-tuned for food acquisition and mastication strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Evans and Sanson, 2003</xref>). This is particularly important for the reconstruction and study of past ecosystems, since fossil teeth are often abundant, providing critical information about ecological niche occupancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jernvall et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eronen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Fulwood et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Evans, 2013</xref>). While complexity and shape of isolated teeth are functionally informative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitenack et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Whitenack and Motta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frazzetta, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballell and Ferrón, 2021</xref>), teeth tend to work as a whole (or partial) dentition, forming an emergent functional unit. Thus, single-tooth morphology is only one of several different organizational levels - from sub-dental features (e.g. serrations) to entire dentitions - that matter for specific functional aspects and their integration. This amounts to a limitation for paleontological studies often relying on isolated teeth whose relative positions are deduced indirectly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shimada, 2005</xref>). The functional integration of teeth, as whole dentitions or by regional subfunctionalization, is further illustrated by the widespread occurrence of heterodonty (juxtaposition of differently shaped teeth). Like mammals, sharks exhibit conspicuous tooth morphological variation at different scales, from single tooth to dentition levels. Interestingly, this is not a recently evolved feature, as heterodont arrangements of multicuspid teeth are described for Devonian sharks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maisey et al., 2014</xref>). Deep similarities across sharks and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Debiais-Thibaud et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thiery et al., 2022</xref>) point towards a kernel of developmental mechanisms capable of generating highly diverse dental morphologies both between and within individuals, which has been explored experimentally and computationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salazar-Ciudad and Jernvall, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zimm et al., 2023a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harjunmaa et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While a system of tooth classes is well-established in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mitsiadis and Smith, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sharpe, 2000</xref>), systematic knowledge about heterodonty biases in sharks is sparse. For specific low-rank taxonomic groups, patterns of tooth shape and size variation along the jaw are often diagnostic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shimada, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Türtscher et al., 2022</xref>). Some of these patterns have been linked to feeding mechanics, emphasizing the importance of dentition-level perspectives when connecting morphology and ecological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tapanila et al., 2020</xref>), while stark tooth morphology differences exist between sexes and age cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Türtscher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">French et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cullen and Marshall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Purdy and Francis, 2007</xref>). This is why dentitions of several species have been dissected morphometrically within proximate phylogenetic contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Türtscher et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cullen and Marshall, 2019</xref>). Complementarily, many studies have used isolated teeth across wider taxonomic levels, identifying clade- and ecotype-specific clusters and distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cullen and Marshall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bazzi et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazzi et al., 2018</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballell and Ferrón, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>). Representing even higher organizational levels, jaw geometry, cranial shape, musculature, and other anatomic macro-features have been linked to feeding strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">López-Romero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilga et al., 2007</xref>), underlining the adaptive interplay of traits on different scales. This suggests that a class-wide analysis of functional associations between dental variation and complexity at different scales and ecological functions might be highly informative. Here, we elucidate such macro-patterns in the light of environmental and life-history traits, applying a novel morphometrics tool combination. Specifically, we expect that complex dental traits on different organizational levels, from fine denticles to differences between jaws, exhibit specific contributions to functional adaptation in an either universal or clade-specific manner. This analysis may critically contribute to understanding the specific relevance of hierarchical organization of functional traits throughout an entire vertebrate class, a significant question across ecology, paleontology, and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Heterodonty is widespread across sharks</title><p>Heterodonty reflects the degree of tooth shape variation within a given individual. Such variation is not always subtle and gradual, limiting the use of common homology-based morphometrics tools (e.g. landmark-based approaches), arguably biasing efforts towards species with gradual heterodonty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Türtscher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berio et al., 2020</xref>) and against class-level comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazzi et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we aspire to account for the complexity of heterodonty and quantify it across the diversity of extant sharks. We calculate different types of within-toothrow heterodonty, namely differences between neighboring teeth within the same jaw (sequential monognathic heterodonty, HMS), between all teeth within the same jaw (total monognathic heterodonty, HMT), and between teeth from the same relative positions in opposing jaws (dignathic heterodonty, HDG), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. By quantifying different, but rigorously defined, types of heterodonties, we reduce complex, multidimensional features to one-dimensional measures and are able to compare morphologically heterogeneous taxa. Since heterodonty measures quantify shape variation between units, they can be considered a proxy for high-level (i.e. jaw-level) complexity. We also devise different proxies for single-tooth morphological complexity based on 2D-outline characteristics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), enabling us to contrast tooth and dentition-level features.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of heterodonty measures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heterodonty, a dentition-level disparity measure, can refer to (1) average differences between successive teeth along the jaw: sequential monognathic heterodonty: HMS, (2) averaged differences among all teeth within the same jaw, total heterodonty: HMT, (3) differences between pairs of teeth belonging to opposing jaws, also termed dignathic heterodonty: HDG.

Conversely, differences in tooth-level complexity increase significantly between very closely and intermediately related species. However, this does not apply to every specific measure of tooth-level complexity individually, as differences in cuspidity are uncorrelated with genetic distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that there are tooth-level complexity measures such as Fourier-analysis-based complexity (Cx.four) that might serve as a moderately better proxy for relatedness than heterodonty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Despite the absence of a substantial mid-range phylogenetic signal for specific heterodonty measures, we tested whether combinations of these measures differ between main shark clades.

While including only morphological features allows for separating the Squalomorphii from 80% of Galeomorphii along the first canonical axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), adding some important ecological characteristics leads to a complete separation of the superorders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Consistent with the higher correlation between differences in dental complexity and genetic distance, we find that certain tooth-level complexity measures, such as fine cuspidity (and the ratio between fine and coarse cuspidity) and Fourier-based complexity, show a significant clade-specific range of values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

This might reflect particularly high heterodonty in Hexanchidae - functional and conserved throughout the fossil record (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adnet, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kriwet and Klug, 2014</xref>), and the cutting-blade tooth rows widespread in Squaliformes that depend functionally on interlocked homodont teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Underwood et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Galeomorphii exhibit serrated teeth more frequently than Squalomorphii, another specific trait that can be linked to feeding strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Although gradual variation has been documented and quantified in some galean species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Türtscher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">French et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cullen and Marshall, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Goodman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Purdy and Francis, 2007</xref>), we are not aware of any previous study comprehensively quantifying heterodonty throughout sharks. Interestingly, jaw-level differences between the superorders may indicate different feeding strategies involving differences in dental characteristics and jaw shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">López-Romero et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>). Different ecological strategies between the superorders are, from a statistical perspective, supported by our finding that combining morphological and ecological descriptors allowed for a clearer separation of the galean and squalean sharks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), suggesting a link between ecology, heterodonty, and phylogeny. Strong functional, adaptive pressures may also underlie increased phenotypic evolution rates in Squalomorphii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">López-Romero et al., 2023</xref>). While a single-tooth-based analysis across sharks did not clearly separate morphospace regions for orders and superorders, morphospace occupancy was biased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bazzi et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, we find that most significant dental trait differences between squalean and galean sharks are in line with high levels of functional specialization. Yet, whether developmental or purely functional constraints ultimately underlie these differences remains to be elucidated. Answering this important question may require the quantification of heterodonty in fossil dentitions which would allow calibrating the pace of phenotypic change within lineages. However, complete dentitions are rarely preserved in the fossil record, leaving a comprehensive analysis to future researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Heterodonty predicts ecological features</title><p>Emerging correlations between ecological traits and heterodonty indicate a functional value of quantitative tooth shape variation. Specific correlations, however, may vary by method (one-to-one versus canonical correlation), highlighting that dental adaptations to ecological niches are best described by a non-trivial combination of features. The finding of stronger correlations with habitat-related versus trophic traits might <italic>prima facie</italic> appear contradictory. Yet, many sharks are opportunistic feeders; completeness of trophic information varies between species, and prey composition may change seasonally and between age cohorts; for example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baremore et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Vögler et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Habitats correlate with feeding habits and can serve as a coarser, yet more inclusive, proxy for a species’ primary food sources. Intriguingly, we found striking similarities in heterodonty correlation patterns between specific habitat and trophic characteristics, suggesting discrete clusters that represent major ecological-functional strategies: (1) shallow-water habitats, crustacean/small invertebrate diets, (2) open-sea habitats, large preys, with a sub-cluster of deep-sea cephalopod feeders. It is tempting to interpret these clusters in terms of different feeding mechanics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>). Many shark species specialized in hunting larger vertebrates benefit mechanically from dental serrations, absence of larger cusps, and low-to-intermediate heterodonty (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitenack et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Whitenack and Motta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frazzetta, 1988</xref>). Biomechanical studies showed that serrated teeth reduce tear and shear stresses, while impeding puncturing, reducing their suitability for smaller or hard-shelled prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitenack et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Whitenack and Motta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frazzetta, 1988</xref>). Interestingly, several squalean taxa exhibit dignathic heterodonty with interlocking asymmetric lower teeth and simpler arrow-shaped upper teeth, which cooperate in a grasping-sawing mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>). Consequently, increased diagnostic heterodonty may have enabled the emergence of mechanistically complex feeding strategies particularly across Squalomorphii (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Underwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss, 1977</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that this mechanism co-emerged with an adaptation to deep-water habitats within Squalomorphii, enabled by higher modularity of mono- and dignathic heterodonty in this group. Deep-water species within Carchariniformes (deep-sea catsharks), on the other hand, do neither show increased dignathic heterodonty nor large differences to shallow-water relatives, which may be due to clade-specific constraints. Many benthic feeders, including many deep-sea and reef dwellers, employ complex collecting-crushing or ambushing-grasping strategies aimed at smaller, often hard-shelled, prey, in line with diversified tooth shapes and assemblies along the jaw. In contrast, many smaller reef-inhabiting species catch small free-swimming animals using multi-cuspid dentitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilga et al., 2007</xref>). Complementarily, feeding strategies often involve jaw-cartilage/skeletal-level adaptations, indirectly affecting tooth numbers and heterodonty gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sadier et al., 2023</xref>). Together, habitat-heterodonty associations reflect how different environments and prey guilds underlie the dynamic evolution of a finite set of functional feeding strategies with specific signatures both at the tooth and dentition level. We have found strong correlations between combinations of phenotypic features and ecological traits, particularly habitat depth. Given the prominence of dental features for ecometric reconstructions of paleo-climates and mostly terrestrial ecosystems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Eronen et al., 2010</xref>), it is becoming clear that shark dental features can be highly diagnostic for marine habitats (e.g. depth), and that integrating information from several levels of organization, where available, might enable even more precise ecosystem reconstructions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Different levels of complexity characterize distinct ecological strategies</title><p>We have identified two morphological trends that are distinguished by an inverse relationship between tooth-level complexity and monognathic heterodonty (dentition-level complexity). This implies that species tend to either increase tooth-level or dentition-level complexity, but rarely both of them. Feeding strategies of group one, associated with deep-sea and benthic habitats, involve increased collecting and crushing of hard-shelled prey animals, leveraging specialized individual tooth shapes and complexity. Such specializations often involve adaptations of the entire feeding apparatus, i.e. modifications to jaw cartilage shape, articulation, and musculature, allowing for suction-based food acquisition mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moss, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wilga et al., 2007</xref>), with possible implications for dental shape. Conversely, the second group uses more homodont, high-cuspid/serrated dentitions to catch and dismember swimming prey. Such specializations require concerted fine-tuning on several levels, thereby strongly selecting against intermediate morphologies. At the single-tooth level, teeth adapted for specialized diets often occupy extreme positions within morphospaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bazzi et al., 2021b</xref>), in line with this assumption. Thus, the discreteness of the two trends, visualized by within-morphospace divergence, suggests morphological discreteness of highly specialized functional mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The importance of multi-scale modular complexity</title><p>Our analysis shows that diversification of functionality in a composed morphology featuring repetitive structures involves changes in complexity across scales. This is a common observation among ‘serially homologous’ traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bateson, 1892</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bateson, 1894</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wagner, 1989</xref>), whose units share developmental mechanisms that, during evolution, may accumulate divergent features ultimately leading to individualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sémon et al., 2025</xref>). This is exemplified by limbs, vertebrae, and ectodermal appendages, which include dentitions. Interestingly, such organs often nest repeated sub-structures at multiple levels, for example feather branches within feathers, or digits on limbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zimm et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Prum and Brush, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Young et al., 2011</xref>). Within dentitions, teeth are arranged in regular rows but feature themselves repeated sub-structures, namely cusps and smaller cusplets, making them a prominent example of serially organized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stock, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Luo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roth, 1984</xref>). Differences between units often stem from local differences in developmental regulation within the tissue background in higher-level structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jernvall and Thesleff, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tucker et al., 1998</xref>). This is in line with rather gradual patterns of dental variation in specific shark clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Türtscher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Berio et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shimada, 2002</xref>), while only a few species, for example Hexanchidae, show conspicuously discrete shape transitions. By comparing complexity across several nested levels of dental organization, this study is an important extension from the common focus on a single level of morphological organization.</p><p>With respect to function and ecology, we see that monognathic heterodonties have a significantly stronger correlation with ecological traits than dignathic heterodonty and cuspidity. A straightforward interpretation is that specialized food processing strategies involve correlated combinations of fine-tuned tooth shapes along the jaw, with function tied to the overall dental arrangement. As biomechanical studies often quantify single-tooth performances in piercing, slicing, or grinding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Whitenack et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Whitenack and Motta, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Frazzetta, 1988</xref>), our results suggest a need to complement those with whole-jaw testing paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Corn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cooper et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, we do not find any significant correlation between low-to-moderate genetic distances and heterodonty differences, implying absence of strong constraints that prevent closely related taxa from developing divergent heterodonty patterns. A similar observation was made for jaw shape differences, permitting stark divergences within relatively short evolutionary timespans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">López-Romero et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, disparity of tooth-level complexity, for most measures, appears to increase with genetic distance, suggesting significant phylogenetic constraints. This suggests that morphological adaptation tends to involve changes at the level of heterodonty rather than tooth morphology. Theoretical and experimental studies in mammals have demonstrated that both gradual and discrete heterodont tooth shape change can be achieved by a gradual modification of developmental parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Harjunmaa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Salazar-Ciudad and Jernvall, 2010</xref>). Thus, tinkering with odontogenesis in a global rather than local manner can generate adaptive phenotypic variation. We hypothesize that fine-tuning individual teeth without affecting their neighbors might be more difficult than altering jaw-level gradients of morphogens or developmental factors, which will impact downstream odontogenesis locally. Additionally, studies have shown that even functionally intertwined traits such as cichlid jaws can exhibit independent evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ronco and Salzburger, 2021</xref>). In the context of shark dentition, this means that dignathic heterodonty in the absence of occlusal constraints should be evolvable within short timespans.</p><p>This would render dentition an accessible model system of hierarchical developmental modularity underlying a mosaic fashion of evolutionary change in a set of functionally or ontologically connected traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zimm et al., 2023b</xref>). Besides functional constraints and evolutionary contingency, differences in the frequency of variational patterns may reflect developmental biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 1985</xref>). Given the weaker correlation of heterodonty differences with genetic distance compared to tooth-level traits, and a stronger association of heterodonties and ecological specializations, it is tempting to speculate that evolutionary change tends to developmentally originate from alterations in higher-level cues rather than from individually tinkering with low-level features. Evidence for this hypothesis comes from different lines of research: Developmental studies have revealed the explicit involvement of signal gradients from the jaw mesenchyme in establishing differences among mammalian teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tucker and Sharpe, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kavanagh et al., 2007</xref>). Leveraging developmental transcriptomics, another recent study showed how evolution in one tooth will indirectly affect the developmental regulation of teeth in other positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sémon et al., 2025</xref>). At the micro- to meso-evolutionary level, morphometric correlations between different mammalian tooth types suggest regulation by shared, yet not identical, developmental factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gómez-Robles et al., 2011</xref>), although the degree of covariation varies across traits and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Laffont et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Developmental and ontological nestedness might be a major biological principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zimm et al., 2023b</xref>). It has been argued that the repetitive nesting of modules within generative networks can be considered a general strategy for generating complex yet diverse outcomes that transcends the domain of biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Solé and Valverde, 2020</xref>). Theoretical research has emphasized that modularity will increase both robustness to undesirable variation and evolvability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Klingenberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Espinosa-Soto and Wagner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wagner, 2008</xref>), while different lines of evo-devo research have shown that functionally or developmentally integrated modules can evolve independently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ronco and Salzburger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Watanabe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Felice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sémon et al., 2025</xref>). In conclusion, teeth may be considered a model system to understand how nature adapts to environmental challenges not only by emergence and fine-tuning of hyperdiverse phenotypic modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jernvall and Salazar-Ciudad, 2006</xref>), but also by tinkering with their modular embedding in a morphological context across levels of organization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Shark dentition data acquisition and processing</title><p>We extracted entire lateral tooth outlines from selected shark species published on the j-elasmo database (j-elasmo:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://naka.na.coocan.jp/">http://naka.na.coocan.jp/</ext-link>; outlines downloaded 06–2021). This database contains displays of entire erupted tooth rows of over 100 species. The selection for this study was based on the criteria of phylogenetic representativity (i.e. sampling from all extant major clades and avoidance of redundancy by sampling among phenotypically similar sister species) and completeness of dentition, aiming at high coverage of all types of dentitions among extant shark species. Dentitions of which too many teeth overlapped visually were not used. However, negligibly overlapping teeth, that is teeth whose partial overlap with adjacent teeth was minor and did not obstruct important features such as cusps, were reconstructed by interpolation and comparison to neighboring teeth and included. More substantially visually obstructed or damaged teeth were excluded from the analysis. Occasionally visible minor damages such as small holes to the enameloid were manually corrected. The exception to the completeness criterion was <italic>Pseudotriakis microdon</italic>, which features extremely high counts of relatively small teeth. From this species, only a subset of teeth from different jaw positions was used. In addition, we excluded planktivorous sharks due to their highly specialized dentitions. As sharks keep generating teeth continuously, we defined tooth rows as the contiguous sequences of fully erupted teeth along the jaw, from meso/anterior to distal/posterior positions. Due to bilateral symmetry, only one jaw hemisphere was used. As the vast majority of shark teeth are blade-shaped and only feature negligible morphological information in bucco-lingual direction, we decided that 2D lateral views suffice for the purposes of our study. Tooth shape extraction was performed using custom-made tools that automatically identify tooth boundaries and manual segmentation where necessary. Tooth size was not taken into consideration within the scope of this study, because it cannot be explicitly included in the set of shape difference descriptors we used. In other words, size differences can be considered another, independent, dimension of phenotypic features that may differ between teeth. Since the shape of the basal part of the tooth crown tends to show less morphological-functional fine-tuning than the upper part that is exposed to nutrition and at times shows a less defined, undulating, or porous transition to the jaw mesenchyme, we decided to only consider the upper dental outline. In preliminary analyses for which the entire tooth outlines were considered, we had found that morphometric patterns were in part driven by the basal rather than the upper part of the tooth crowns. The segmentation point between upper and lower parts of the outlines was defined by (1) a visual transition of material, otherwise by (2) the lowest concave or most concave lateral point if a visible inflection could be discerned or (3) the most distant pair of outline points in the lower part. Outline point numbers (1000 per tooth) were equalized by interpolation or data reduction in order to ensure comparability across teeth.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ecological information</title><p>In order to be able to associate tooth phenotypic information with potential ecological function, we collected proxy features that were widely available in databases and publications.

In the few cases where suitable trophic information was not available, the phylogenetically closest species for which sufficient records were accessible were supplied instead. In the occasional case of conflicting values, the more detailed, higher-quality, or more clearly documented of the available sources was used preferentially. In addition, we assigned recorded prey items to larger trophic guilds. Piscivory was not assigned as it is highly unspecific with respect to prey size and trophic level, and because nearly all species include fish into their diet. Another specific diet, planctivory, was omitted, as the three plankton-feeding sharks feature very specialized dentitions, which tend to occupy separate parts within morphospaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bazzi et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, we used the following categories: TROPH: average trophic level, VERT: non-osteichthyan vertebrate prey, CEPH: cephalopod prey, MOLL: other molluscan prey, CRUST: crustacean prey, VERM: further small usually worm-like invertebrate prey, OMNI: degree of omnivory or number of documented food categories.

Extreme body length values were neglected as exceptions, or possibly overstated reports, and the documented ranges for mature male and female individuals were used. This means we excluded unconfirmed reports and measurements from single specimens that substantially exceeded the bulk of habitual measurements, suggesting unreliable or exaggerated claims, or rare outliers unrepresentative of the typical ecological niche of the respective taxon. Unless noted differently, length values used in our analyses were calculated as the average between upper and lower range limits for females and males, respectively, and the average of those. We used the following categories: SIZE: body length, as calculated above, S<sub>MIN</sub>, S<sub>MAX</sub>: reported extremes of adult/fertile individuals, S<sub>HATCH</sub>: size at hatching or birth. Depth was annotated similarly; we averaged between the upper and lower range limits that were reported, not considering exceptional reports: DEPTH: general depth of occurrence, D<sub>LOW</sub>: lower depth limit, D<sub>HIGH</sub>: upper depth limit, D<sub>RANGE</sub>: difference between D<sub>LOW</sub> and D<sub>HIGH</sub> We also noted whether shark species were associated with specific habitat types, as within the set of references used. For this assignment, we searched for habitat descriptor terms in encyclopedic literature (as given above) that were not explicitly mentioned as exceptional occurrence. This way, we avoided the need to define arbitrary limits between complementary ecological descriptors. In this paper, we used the following habitat categories: SHORE: occurrence near shore line, SHELF: occurrence along the continental shelf zone, REEF: reef habitat, OCEAN: open sea, DEEP: deep sea, BENT: benthic habitat, NECT: nektonic habitat.

Where the number of teeth differed between the opposing jaws, relative positions were used, eventually causing the same tooth to be compared to more than one tooth in the opposing jaw if the latter harbored a larger number of teeth. As introduced above, a schematic of these measures can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Note that in sharks, no dental occlusion occurs, allowing a higher degree of morphological freedom than in many mammals.

Such proxies are not only used for taxonomic identification but also for ecological function and feeding adaptations. What also is evident is that teeth within jaws might differ morphologically from mesial to distal or even between upper and lower jaws indicating varying degrees of monognathic and dignathic heterodonties, respectively. It already has been demonstrated that jaw geometry, cranial shape, and musculature among other macro-features are linked to feeding strategies. This highlights that different traits result in adaptive interplays, certainly also underlying the evolutionary success of sharks.</p><p>In this study, the authors analysed morphological features ranging from isolated teeth to whole dentitions within a large ensemble of species encompassing all extant shark orders applying a novel combination of morphometric approaches and ecological and life-history traits to better understand the specific relevance of hierarchical organization of functional traits. In doing so, the authors intend to track these heterodonties on all levels as a function of genetic distance within a strict phylogenetic framework to quantify trait adaptability. Understanding hierarchical organizations of functional traits is not only of importance to biologists, but also to palaeontologist, thus representing a cross-disciplinary study.</p><p>The analyses are based on 2D shape data from 51 extant shark species representing all orders derived from J-elasmo (http://naka.na.coocan.jp/). For reaching the goals of this study, the authors established differences between teeth, neighbouring teeth within the same jaw, i.e., sequential-monognathic heterodonty, between all teeth within the same jaw, i.e., total-monognathic heterodonty and between teeth from same relative positions in opposing jaws, i.e., dignathic heterodonty, identified the ecology of the various species, conducted phylogenetic analyses using different genetic markers, used novel tooth and dentition measures and employed robust statistic methodologies to calculate mean tooth shapes. However, it would be easier to understand the overarching goal and the individual aims if they would have been clearly formulated at the end of the introduction simultaneously formulating corresponding hypotheses.</p><p>The undisputed significance of this study is in the combination of the varying morphological levels (individual teeth to complete dentitions) and the methodological approaches, which enable the authors to gain quantitatively well-supported insights into the importance of dental heterodonties in sharks.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that dental variations within and between jaws obviously is not independent, with sequential heterodonty being significantly lower and dignathic heterodonty being significantly higher in squalomorph sharks. In highly specialized dentitions as those of extant hexanchiforms (Squalomorphii), the highest levels of both monognathic and dignathic heterodonty occur, while in various squalomorphs (e.g., Squalus, Squatina) and galeomorphs (e.g., Mustelus, Nebrius) these heterodonties are lowest.</p><p>The high heterodonty found in extant hexanchids is considered to be functional and conserved throughout the proximate fossil record (lines 185-186). However, what does &quot;proximate fossil record&quot; mean. In stem hexanchiforms such as Notidanoides from the Jurassic, seemingly only sequential heterodonty is developed with dignathic heterodonty being absent compare Kriwet and Klug 2014 [Dental patterns of the stem-group hexanchoid shark, Notidanoides muensteri (Elasmobranchii, Hexanchiformes)]. Thus, there seems to be a constraint in the evolution of hexanchiforms towards dignathic heterodonty. Including fossil taxa could increase our understanding of evolutionary pathways of such adaptive traits better than just using extant forms to identify possible constraints.</p><p>Conversely to squalomorphs, galeomorph sharks have a more gradual (sequential) heterodonty. Mapping all information derived from the shape analyses across all hierarchical levels indicates that the various heterodonty patterns and tooth-level complexities evolved independently several times based on information derived from extant taxa. Importantly, this approach reveals that no significant positive correlation between genetic distance and heterodonty differences for genetically close or moderately distant species exist, but genetically most distant species display significantly higher heterodonty differences. This indicates that heterodonty can change relatively unconstrained and thus is highly evolvable (lines 117-118). There seems to be no strong constraints preventing closely related taxa from developing divergent heterodonty patterns (line 273-275).</p><p>However, this seems odd. If only genetically distant species exhibit significantly higher heterodonties, why can heterodonty then change relatively unconstrained in low-to-moderately genetically related taxa? I would expect such a process if the pattern also is significant in closely related species. The study is based on 51 extant species, each obviously represented by a single specimen. While this rather large number of species and corresponding dental information, it does not catch the intraspecific and possible interspecific dental variations within extant taxa, let alone in fossil taxa. This information, however, could provide additional information about evolutionary pathways and constraints!</p><p>In lines 121-133, the authors state some tooth-level complexity measures might serve as a moderately better proxy for relatedness than heterodonty. Which measures are these? It would be useful to list these.</p><p>Interestingly, including ecological features, especially depth distribution in the analyses results in a better separation of the two superorders indicating that heterodonty and tooth complexity patterns result from adaptive morphological changes. Thus, the significantly higher dignathic heterodonty found in many squalomorphs would be the result of deep-water adaptation. But it remains ambiguous why this is. And moreover, dignathic heterodonty is absent in deep-water galeomorphs, such as, e.g., Apristurus. I would suggest to list such exceptions and to discuss possible reasons for presence / absence of dignathic heterodonties in relation to habitat in more detail.</p><p>In lines 174-175, the authors state that dental variation evolves dynamically within sharks. This result seemingly relies on the combination of the shape analyses with phylogenetic information. It remains unclear what dynamically means. Moreover, such a statement should be supported be specific trait analyses.</p><p>The authors continue to compare individual tooth shape development in sharks with that in mammals, stating that Hox genes are important in differentiating tooth classes in mammals, while the role of Hox genes in sharks remains ambiguous. A major difference between both groups, however, is the presence of a dental lamina in sharks, which is important in tooth development, and which is absent in mammals. Could it that this difference is more important than Hox genes? Compare, e.g., various publications by Gareth Fraser (see https://www.fraser-lab.net/publications.html).</p><p>According to the results, habitats correlate with feeding habits representing a proxy for a species' primary food sources. Based on this, two discrete clusters representing major ecological-functional strategies are identified, i.e., shallow-water habitats, crustacean/small invertebrate diets and open-sea habitats, large preys, with a sub-cluster of deep-sea cephalopod feeders. However, I wonder if this is not an oversimplification? Nevertheless, the results show that monognathic heterodonty is stronger correlated with ecological traits than dignathic heterodonty.</p><p>The study importantly shows that evolutionary change tends to developmentally originate from alterations in higher-level cues rather than from individually tinkering with individual teeth. This indicates that developmental and ontological nestedness could be a major biological principle.</p><p>Overall, the authors achieved the targeted goals based on the data set used here. But as stated above, inclusion of more specimens of each species and more species per clade as well as extinct taxa might provide additional information about inter- and intraspecific variations in heterodonty patterns through time and corresponding constraints. This also might better show, if heterodonty patterns are really highest in genetically distant taxa.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study is the first one using combined methodological approaches to establish the significance of heterodonty patterns on various hierarchical scales and thus certainly will serve a roadmap for future studies into the development of teeth and dentitions in sharks, and also beyond.</p><p>This is a very important study. But I have to admit that it was quite difficult to read and to follow your arguments. Therefore, I would like to make some additional comments.</p><p>- Include in the abstract ALL findings (results) of your study.</p><p>- State clearly all the goals. It was quite difficult to really identify all goals of the study as you only mention &quot;Here, we elucidate such macro-patterns in the light of environmental and life-history traits, applying a novel morphometric tool combination. This may critically contribute to understanding the specific relevance of hierarchical organization of functional traits across an entire vertebrate class, a significant question across ecology, palaeontology and evolution&quot;. Only by reading all the manuscript and focusing on your results it was possible to really understand what the different goals were. I also would expect some research hypothesis that you could directly address in the results and Discussion sections.</p><p>- Please use systematic names instead of G1 and G2 in the text! I had to refer to the various figures to find out the colour code for the two major groups in one figure, then refer to the next figure to correlate the colour code / systematic name with G1 and G2, respectively to understand what you meant.</p><p>- I would strongly suggest explaining the results of the graphs shown in Figure 4C in more detail in the text. In many instances, you simply make a statement without properly discussing it.</p><p>- What makes the manuscript difficult to read is the structure and the sometimes jumping around between topics. I would strongly suggest to alter the structure and address the different research questions / hypotheses so that there is a direct link between the goals indicated and the results and discussions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Zimm et al. investigated the relationships between dental traits, including heterodonty and complexity, with various aspects of shark biology, analysing a range of data from pre-existing sources in a novel and creative way. They find that traits coded on an intermediate level e.g. within a jaw show a low phylogenetic signal and a relatively strong relationship with ecology, suggesting significant adaptability of these traits. Particularly impressive is the quantification of these dental traits. The number of methodological approaches used to measure complexity and heterodonty is remarkable, and well-reasoned. There is excellent attention paid to the context of the study, given work that has been done previously in mammals, and the phylogenetic context is given through the genetic distance approach, which is important, and not always done in similar trait analyses for other clades.</p><p>The most significant aspect of the paper that could be expanded is the discussion of the implications of these results. In the abstract, introduction and discussion, the fossil record of sharks is mentioned, and one of the papers frequently cited in the introduction (Eronen et al., 2010) describes the use of traits, including tooth shape to reconstruct environments through the application of ecometrics. This has been done in mammals, but not, as far as I'm aware, using such a range of scales as in this study. Given the attention given to potential palaeoecological applications of the results here, I would suggest there could be further discussion of this. In particular, I wonder if a discussion of the availability of tooth rows to enough of an extent for measurement of heterodonty would be useful, as well as a consideration of the potential use of community-level shark traits for an assessment of water depth, for example.</p><p>In addition to the comments in the public review, I noticed a few small details that I would suggest addressing, although in general I thought the presentation of the work was excellent.</p><p>• In general, it would be helpful to restate the definitions for acronyms in all figure captions. There are a lot, understandably, but for a reader it would be helpful to have the definitions repeated in the captions e.g. for HMS, HMT, HMX, HDG.</p><p>• Figure 1 – Species names should be italicised in the figure. Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii are italicised in the caption but not in the rest of the text.</p><p>• Introduction – final paragraph could be expanded and made more specific about the methods and rationale</p><p>• Page 3, line 98 – I suggest making the clause &quot;the main outliers…&quot; into its own separate sentence, and I wonder if it would be better to use the full name rather than &quot;squalean&quot; which I don't think was previously defined</p><p>• Figure 2 – This may be personal preference, but I think it would be good to edit the figure so that the tip names are italicised and separated by a space rather than an underscore e.g. Carcharhinus sealei. The alignment of the bottom part of the figure between the different components is different and would be worth editing in the software used to make the figure. Should Selachimorpha be italicised in the caption? Other clade names in the text and in the figure are not.</p><p>• Section 4 (corresponding to Figure 5) – the choice of colour here is quite misleading, given that the same colours (or very similar) have been used to differentiate between the Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii in previous figures. Given that these groups do not simply correspond to the two major clades of sharks considered in Figure 4 for example, I think it would be preferable to use different colours to denote G1 and G2 in Figure 5. It would also be good to have included in the supplementary material the group assignment for each shark species included in the study. I note that this is included in the Github, but not in the spreadsheets available in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>• Line 365 – how many taxa was this substituting of close relatives used? It would be good to have an estimate for this.</p><p>• Line 374 – how is &quot;extreme&quot; defined? Similarly, the &quot;exceptional reports&quot; of line 379</p><p>• The list of ecological descriptors would be more useful if it were distributed in the text according to where the different categories are mentioned. For example, the prey categories could be listed at Line 368</p><p>• In the methods, you mention that the complexity is defined as the sum of the constituent measures. I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding, but are the different measures actually comparable in this way? I.e. are the different measures on the same scale in a way that would allow them to be summed? I'm struggling to tell from the raw data available in the Github, but if not, this would be quite problematic.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.107406.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Living sharks are characterized by exceptional dental diversities on all levels of hierarchy from individual teeth to complete dentitions.

Since we are assuming a mostly statistical/synthetic perspective on dental traits in this paper, we cannot dedicate an extended discussion to the group-specific evolution of dignathic heterodonty.

This means that pairs of closely related species are not less likely to show <italic>differences</italic> in heterodonty than pairs of more distant taxa. A notable exception is dignathic heterodonty, for which we do see significance of correlations with genetic distance for taxa that are somewhat distant (mid-range of genetic distances, cf.Figure 3). Thus, our result is, overall, consistent with absence of constraints. We assume that the reviewer refers to the “tail end” within the graph in Figure 3(A) for heterodonty differences. Therein, it can be seen that the significance of heterodonty changes between the genetically most distant clades, i.e. galeomorph-versus-squalomorph distances, tend to be higher than for mid-range distances. Upon in-detail measurement – now appended as Supplementary Figure F9 -, we find that this significance-of-correlation peak is chiefly driven by <italic>Hexanchus</italic> which presents one of the highest dignathic heterodonty scores, but also features the highest total genetic distances from any galeomorph clade. We had glossed over this aspect, because it reflected merely a disproportional influence of one “extreme” <italic>genus</italic> (given the structure of the phylogeny, this end of the distribution tends to be less reliable, since driven by fewer taxa). Note that this is not an artifact but an intrinsic limitation of the method: while the central bulk of the measurements represents a mix between diverse pairs of species, the terminal end over-represents a few most diverged taxa. However, we agree that it is important to interpret this finding explicitly. This is now done in the Results section, thereby neither omitting nor ignoring this limitation. As mentioned, we also provide another supplementary figure showing that single taxa have a disproportionate effect only on the tail end of the shown distribution, but not for the remainder of the curves.</p><p>The peak in correlation significance for dignathic heterodonty around dG=0.45 seen in Figure 3(B) can be interpreted as the transition between within-superorder to between-superorders ranges of genetic distances, and may reflect the generally higher dignathic heterodonty among squalean sharks, resulting in a significant increase of dignathic heterodonty at this point.</p><p>In a nutshell, constraints are understood to exist only in the case of strong correlation between genetic and phenotypic differences, as in that case, genetic similarity prevents phenotypic changes with respect to the trait in question. High p-values of correlation, as for most heterodonty measures between more closely related taxa, indicate the opposite, i.e. absence of constraints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study is based on 51 extant species, each obviously represented by a single specimen. While this rather large number of species and corresponding dental information, it does not catch the intraspecific and possible interspecific dental variations within extant taxa, let alone in fossil taxa. This information, however, could provide additional information about evolutionary pathways and constraints!</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it would be very insightful to delve into different levels of phylogenetic depth, including intraspecific variation, which includes variation between populations, sexes and age cohorts. While this would have certainly been possible for a few taxa (such as <italic>Scyliorhinus</italic>, lamnids, and carcharinids), no comparable data is available for the majority of taxa. Therefore, including variation in a partial way would have created a bias and might not have yielded class-level or generalizable conclusions. However, we are considering publishing species-level variation for a few selected taxa in a separate study with a different primary focus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 121-133, the authors state some tooth-level complexity measures might serve as a moderately better proxy for relatedness than heterodonty. Which measures are these? It would be useful to list these.</p></disp-quote><p>We meant to refer mainly to the Fourier analysis-based complexity measure whose phylogenetic signal exceeds all dentition-level complexity measures. We have now reformulated our statement accordingly in order to be clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Interestingly, including ecological features, especially depth distribution in the analyses results in a better separation of the two superorders indicating that heterodonty and tooth complexity patterns result from adaptive morphological changes. Thus, the significantly higher dignathic heterodonty found in many squalomorphs would be the result of deep-water adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is possible, or adaptation towards food sources and hunting strategies correlated with it. We have also added a supplementary figure to visualize this relationship better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>But it remains ambiguous why this is. And moreover, dignathic heterodonty is absent in deep-water galeomorphs, such as, e.g., Apristurus. I would suggest to list such exceptions and to discuss possible reasons for presence / absence of dignathic heterodonties in relation to habitat in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed an interesting topic for speculation and it might come down to micro-niches within the deep sea and/or developmental constraints, i.e. the degree of inter-jaw modularity. We had not gone into deeper speculation about group-specific findings as the paper aimed more at a class-level, statistical, analysis, and there is not enough data to statistically explore evolutionary hypotheses regarding heterodonty trends <italic>within</italic> orders. However, as this is indeed a fascinating topic for speculations, we have now included a paragraph in the discussion. We suspect it might have to do with distinct, specialized, feeding mechanisms that in case of squalomorphs make use of the higher modularity between mono- and dignathic heterodonty in this clade. Overall, deep-sea cat sharks do not feature qualitatively different dentitions than species inhabiting shallower waters, indicating developmental constraints within this clade.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In lines 174-175, the authors state that dental variation evolves dynamically within sharks. This result seemingly relies on the combination of the shape analyses with phylogenetic information. It remains unclear what dynamically means. Moreover, such a statement should be supported be specific trait analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>With “dynamical evolution”, we referred to the finding that there is no obvious specific phylogenetic signal for most dental traits, suggesting that dental complexity has increased, and decreased, repeatedly and independently. We have rephrased the statement slightly to make this point less ambiguous.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors continue to compare individual tooth shape development in sharks with that in mammals, stating that Hox genes are important in differentiating tooth classes in mammals, while the role of Hox genes in sharks remains ambiguous. A major difference between both groups, however, is the presence of a dental lamina in sharks, which is important in tooth development, and which is absent in mammals. Could it that this difference is more important than Hox genes? Compare, e.g., various publications by Gareth Fraser (see https://www.fraser-lab.net/publications.html).</p></disp-quote><p>Certainly, the dental lamina in elasmobranchs might be connected to a higher variability of shark tooth shapes in the jaw, as it is linked to a continuous odontogenesis with exposure to the local environment (e.g. mechanical cues from the jaw and from feeding). However, mammals show discrete tooth classes linked to Hox gene expression, and our impression is that dental variability tends to be more gradual in sharks, suggesting that there might be qualitative differences between the two classes in how within-jaw tooth shapes are generated. In other words, while the DL may have a role in generating overall and possibly more gradual heterodonty in sharks, Hox genes are involved in defining discrete dental types in mammals. We have now expanded our discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>According to the results, habitats correlate with feeding habits representing a proxy for a species' primary food sources. Based on this, two discrete clusters representing major ecological-functional strategies are identified, i.e., shallow-water habitats, crustacean/small invertebrate diets and open-sea habitats, large preys, with a sub-cluster of deep-sea cephalopod feeders. However, I wonder if this is not an oversimplification?</p></disp-quote><p>This paper presents a mostly statistical perspective which forces us to make certain oversimplifications (although there is no gold standard of what constitutes the best level of lumping data into categories), and the two clusters are actually an <italic>outcome</italic> of our analysis (cf.Figure S13). Overall, the limiting factor here, again, is the evenness of data resolution, with some species having an excellent trophic data record, and others being described from a single caught specimen supplemented by some inference from related species. Thus, we decided to consider coarse categories to remain commensurate with the heterogeneity of data, while outlining these limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, the results show that monognathic heterodonty is stronger correlated with ecological traits than dignathic heterodonty.</p><p>The study importantly shows that evolutionary change tends to developmentally originate from alterations in higher-level cues rather than from individually tinkering with individual teeth. This indicates that developmental and ontological nestedness could be a major biological principle.</p><p>Overall, the authors achieved the targeted goals based on the data set used here. But as stated above, inclusion of more specimens of each species and more species per clade as well as extinct taxa might provide additional information about inter- and intraspecific variations in heterodonty patterns through time and corresponding constraints. This also might better show, if heterodonty patterns are really highest in genetically distant taxa.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions that will be central in future follow-up projects. In this manuscript, we have elaborated possible limitations to our study such as the inescapable heterogeneity of ecological data. In addition, as elaborated previously, we now discuss more comprehensively the salient heterodonty differences between the genetically most distant species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Nevertheless, this study is the first one using combined methodological approaches to establish the significance of heterodonty patterns on various hierarchical scales and thus certainly will serve a roadmap for future studies into the development of teeth and dentitions in sharks, and also beyond.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we feel – as the reviewer – that there is substantial potential for future extensions. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a very important study. But I have to admit that it was quite difficult to read and to follow your arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made improvements throughout the manuscript that we believe will enhance the accessibility of our argumentation. Nevertheless, the key conclusions rely on interactions of different results, which makes repetitions and a more complex structure difficult to avoid entirely.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, I would like to make some additional comments.</p><p>- Include in the abstract ALL findings (results) of your study.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the compact nature of the abstract, some results, especially minor ones, might naturally become condensed or omitted. We have now added the characterization of the differences between the two superorders that was indeed missing previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- State clearly all the goals. It was quite difficult to really identify all goals of the study as you only mention &quot;Here, we elucidate such macro-patterns in the light of environmental and life-history traits, applying a novel morphometric tool combination. This may critically contribute to understanding the specific relevance of hierarchical organization of functional traits across an entire vertebrate class, a significant question across ecology, palaeontology and evolution&quot;. Only by reading all the manuscript and focusing on your results it was possible to really understand what the different goals were. I also would expect some research hypothesis that you could directly address in the results and Discussion sections.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded the introduction in order to provide a clearer presentation of our research hypotheses, making this summary less synthetic and more specific. We have also included guiding hypotheses into the final paragraph of the introduction, as well as specific questions/task within the first lines of each section presenting specific Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Please use systematic names instead of G1 and G2 in the text! I had to refer to the various figures to find out the colour code for the two major groups in one figure, then refer to the next figure to correlate the colour code / systematic name with G1 and G2, respectively to understand what you meant.</p></disp-quote><p>G1 and G2 are no actual groups in the systematic sense, but clusters emerging from the combination of tooth-level and dentition-level traits. We now made this aspect clearer in the respective figure caption and introduced a divergent color code in order to make the differences between the two figures more salient and less confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- I would strongly suggest explaining the results of the graphs shown in Figure 4C in more detail in the text. In many instances, you simply make a statement without properly discussing it.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Figure 4(C) contains a large array of individually relevant results. We think that we have already covered all significantly clade-specific findings in the last paragraph of the third section of the Results. To ensure, we have added a cross-reference to this figure, facilitating association. We have also expanded the Discussion section where these differences are contextualized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- What makes the manuscript difficult to read is the structure and the sometimes jumping around between topics. I would strongly suggest to alter the structure and address the different research questions / hypotheses so that there is a direct link between the goals indicated and the results and discussions.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed. This impression may reflect the multitude of different angles we were trying to encompass in this manuscript, their inter-connectivity which is sometimes required to arrive at our core conclusions, and our attempts to keep the manuscript as concise as possible. As suggested above, we have now added introductory hypotheses/statements/questions for all sections of the results part where we found them missing.</p><p>We have also improved sequence and connections throughout the Discussion section and ensured congruence with the results part where this was possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Zimm et al. investigated the relationships between dental traits, including heterodonty and complexity, with various aspects of shark biology, analysing a range of data from pre-existing sources in a novel and creative way. They find that traits coded on an intermediate level e.g. within a jaw show a low phylogenetic signal and a relatively strong relationship with ecology, suggesting significant adaptability of these traits. Particularly impressive is the quantification of these dental traits. The number of methodological approaches used to measure complexity and heterodonty is remarkable, and well-reasoned. There is excellent attention paid to the context of the study, given work that has been done previously in mammals, and the phylogenetic context is given through the genetic distance approach, which is important, and not always done in similar trait analyses for other clades.</p><p>The most significant aspect of the paper that could be expanded is the discussion of the implications of these results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Given the multiple research directions this paper tries to integrate, we have tried to be as concise and synthetic as possible, yet we agree that some of the directions of the discussion may deserve to be expanded. In particular, we have expanded the discussion on the use of our result for the reconstruction of marine paleo-ecosystems as well as on the specific differences between the superorders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the abstract, introduction and discussion, the fossil record of sharks is mentioned, and one of the papers frequently cited in the introduction (Eronen et al., 2010) describes the use of traits, including tooth shape to reconstruct environments through the application of ecometrics. This has been done in mammals, but not, as far as I'm aware, using such a range of scales as in this study. Given the attention given to potential palaeoecological applications of the results here, I would suggest there could be further discussion of this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have expanded the discussion on this point, which indeed enhances the scope of this paper. We agree that finding a strategy for reconstructing past ecosystems using the dental record that can be applied to marine ecosystems is an extremely important goal and our paper might canalize those efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In particular, I wonder if a discussion of the availability of tooth rows to enough of an extent for measurement of heterodonty would be useful, as well as a consideration of the potential use of community-level shark traits for an assessment of water depth, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>This might indeed be an interesting strategy for paleo-ecology. We have added this valuable suggestion in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to the comments in the public review, I noticed a few small details that I would suggest addressing, although in general I thought the presentation of the work was excellent.</p><p>• In general, it would be helpful to restate the definitions for acronyms in all figure captions. There are a lot, understandably, but for a reader it would be helpful to have the definitions repeated in the captions e.g. for HMS, HMT, HMX, HDG.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added abbreviation glossaries into the figure captions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 1 – Species names should be italicised in the figure. Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii are italicised in the caption but not in the rest of the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed naming conventions in taxonomic categories and those tend to be specific to different parts of the Tree of Life. For complex animals, we found that the use of italics is commonly restricted to categories below the family level (although we recognize that divergent opinions exist). We think that following the most common practice would be preferable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Introduction – final paragraph could be expanded and made more specific about the methods and rationale</p></disp-quote><p>We have now made our core questions more explicit at the end of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Page 3, line 98 – I suggest making the clause &quot;the main outliers…&quot; into its own separate sentence, and I wonder if it would be better to use the full name rather than &quot;squalean&quot; which I don't think was previously defined</p></disp-quote><p>We use the names squalean and galean as they are commonly, albeit perhaps less frequently or ubiquitiously, used in parts of the elasmobranch literature, which is why we think there is some value in using them. However, in order to make the paper more inclusive for readers with different backgrounds, we introduce the synonyms squalomorph/squalean and galeomorph/galean the first time they appear in the paper where we discuss differences between superorders.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 2 – This may be personal preference, but I think it would be good to edit the figure so that the tip names are italicised and separated by a space rather than an underscore e.g. Carcharhinus sealei. The alignment of the bottom part of the figure between the different components is different and would be worth editing in the software used to make the figure. Should Selachimorpha be italicised in the caption? Other clade names in the text and in the figure are not.</p></disp-quote><p>We realized that in this figure, using italics would make the names less readable due to the size of the figure. We have therefore made an exception to the convention for practical reasons. We have removed the underscore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Section 4 (corresponding to Figure 5) – the choice of colour here is quite misleading, given that the same colours (or very similar) have been used to differentiate between the Squalomorphii and Galeomorphii in previous figures. Given that these groups do not simply correspond to the two major clades of sharks considered in Figure 4 for example, I think it would be preferable to use different colours to denote G1 and G2 in Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We intended to make the graphics somewhat consistent in color scheme, but we agree that emphasizing the differences between phylogenetic groups and phenotypic clusters by choosing different color codes prevents confusion and is to be preferred. We have therefore changed the color code.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• It would also be good to have included in the supplementary material the group assignment for each shark species included in the study. I note that this is included in the Github, but not in the spreadsheets available in the Supplementary Material.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out; we have added a column &quot;group&quot; it this file: masterfile.data on Github, containing all measures used in the paper as columns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 365 – how many taxa was this substituting of close relatives used? It would be good to have an estimate for this.</p></disp-quote><p>This information is provided in the ecological table provided as supplementary material (Sharks_eco_refs.xlsx).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Line 374 – how is &quot;extreme&quot; defined? Similarly, the &quot;exceptional reports&quot; of line 379</p></disp-quote><p>We excluded explicitly “unconfirmed” reports or outliers that were substantially larger than the bulk of reports, suggesting unreliable or exaggerated records. The rationale being that, even if those reports were true, they would be likely outside the “ecologically typical” or “representative” range of the respective species and, therefore, less suitable for a statistical study. We have added a clarifying sentence in the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The list of ecological descriptors would be more useful if it were distributed in the text according to where the different categories are mentioned. For example, the prey categories could be listed at Line 368</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed, we have now moved/distributed the lists to the appropriate places.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the methods, you mention that the complexity is defined as the sum of the constituent measures. I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding, but are the different measures actually comparable in this way? I.e. are the different measures on the same scale in a way that would allow them to be summed? I'm struggling to tell from the raw data available in the Github, but if not, this would be quite problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we ensured consistency in two ways: (1) equal representation of weakly inter-correlated (but highly intra-correlated) orthogonal groups of measures, producing to three different groups of measures, cf. Figure S4: Cx.exec, Cx.four and Cx.ang; (2) normalization of the measures, with a commensurate range of values between 0 and 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
