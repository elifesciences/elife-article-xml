the mechanisms that coordinate the rate of stem cell self-renewal with differentiation at a population level remain uncharacterized. We find that two PUF family RNA-binding proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 have opposite effects on <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline stem cell dynamics: FBF-1 restricts the rate of meiotic entry, while FBF-2 promotes both cell division and meiotic entry rates. Antagonistic effects of FBFs are mediated by their distinct activities toward the shared set of target mRNAs, where FBF-1-mediated post-transcriptional control requires the activity of CCR4-NOT deadenylase, while FBF-2 is deadenylase-independent and might protect the targets from deadenylation. These regulatory differences depend on protein sequences outside of the conserved PUF family RNA-binding domain. We propose that the opposing FBF-1 and FBF-2 activities serve to modulate stem cell division rate simultaneously with the rate of meiotic entry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>germline</kwd><kwd>PUF</kwd><kwd>CCR4-NOT</kwd><kwd>deadenylase</kwd><kwd>stem cells</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM109053</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voronina</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voronina</surname><given-names>Ekaterina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18PRE34070028</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011427</institution-id><institution>Montana Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaobo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Complementary effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 on germline stem cell dynamics result from their distinct cooperation with mRNA deadenylase resulting in the opposite effects on the shared target mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult tissue maintenance relies on the activity of stem cells that self-renew and produce differentiating progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Morrison and Kimble, 2006</xref>). It is essential that self-renewal be balanced with differentiation to preserve the size of the stem cell pool over time. One simple mechamism achieving this balance is an asymmetric division that always produces a single stem cell daughter and a daughter destined to differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, tissue homeostasis can be controlled at a population level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Simons and Clevers, 2011</xref>), where some stem cells are lost through differentiation while others proliferate, with both outcomes occurring at the same frequency. Such population-level control of stem cell activity is observed in the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kimble and Crittenden, 2007</xref>). However, the mechanisms of population-level control of stem cell proliferation and differentiation in the adult tissues are largely unclear.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> hermaphrodite germline is a robust system to explore the mechanisms coordinating stem cell proliferation and differentiation. It is maintained by a stem cell niche that supports about 200â250 mitoticallyÂ dividing <italic>s</italic>tem and <italic>p</italic>rogenitor <italic>c</italic>ells at the distal end of the gonad (collectively called SPCs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,Bii</xref>). A single somatic distal tip cell serves as a stem cell niche and activates the GLP-1/Notch signaling necessary for SPC pool maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Austin and Kimble, 1987</xref>), which in turn supports germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hansen and Schedl, 2013</xref>). As germline stem cells move proximally away from the niche, they differentiate by entering meiotic prophase and eventually generate gametes near the proximal gonad end. Mitotic divisions of SPCs are not oriented and there doesnât appear to be a correlation between the position of cell divisions distributed throughout the SPC zone and the position of cells undergoing meiotic entry at the proximal end of the zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Maciejowski et al., 2006</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially regulate the extent of germline <italic>s</italic>tem and <italic>p</italic>rogenitor <italic>c</italic>ell (SPC) zone.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the distal germline of <italic>C. elegans</italic> adult hermaphrodite.

Genetic studies of stem cell maintenance led to a model where a balance of mitosis- and meiosis-promoting activities maintains tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hubbard and Schedl, 2019</xref>), but the regulatory mechanism coordinating proliferative SPC activity with meiotic entry remained elusive.</p><p>Importantly, the SPC cell cycle is distinct from that of most somatic stem cells. One characteristic feature of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline SPC cell cycle is a very short G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2018</xref>), reminiscent of the short G1 phase observed in mammalian embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kareta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">White and Dalton, 2005</xref>). Mouse and human ESCs maintain robust cell division rates supported by a cell cycle with a short G1 phase, while the length of S and G2 phases is similar to that observed in differentiated somatic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kareta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stead et al., 2002</xref>). Despite the abbreviated G1 phase, ESCs maintain S and G2 checkpoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chuykin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stead et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">White and Dalton, 2005</xref>). Similarly, <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPCs retain G2 checkpoints despite the shortened G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">ButuÄi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Muse and Boulton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lawrence et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Moser et al., 2009</xref>). This modified cell cycle may be due to a constant proliferative demand that both SPCs and ESCs are subject to. By contrast, this type of modified cell cycle is not observed in the adult stem cell populations that support regenerative response upon injury, such as adult mammalian bulge stem cells (hair follicle stem cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cotsarelis et al., 1990</xref>) or satellite cells (muscle stem cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schultz, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Schultz, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Snow, 1977</xref>) that remain in G0 or quiescent phase for the most of the adult life and only reenter cell cycle upon injury. Similarly, adult epidermal stem cells regulate their cell cycle by controlling the G1/S transition to maintain tissue homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mesa et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Unlike somatic cellsâ G1 phase that is triggered and marked by increased amounts of cyclins E and D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aleem et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guevara et al., 1999</xref>), germ cells and ESCs are characterized by a shortened G1 phase and maintain a constitutive robust expression of G1/S regulators Cyclin E and CDK2 throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Furuta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">White and Dalton, 2005</xref>). Despite continuous proliferation of <italic>C. elegans</italic> SPCs, the SPC mitotic rate changes during development and in different mutant backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kocsisova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Michaelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Roy et al., 2016</xref>), and it is unknown how SPC division and meiotic entry rates might be altered while maintaining the cell cycle with an abbreviated G1 phase. Here, we report the mechanism through which PUF family RNA binding proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 simultaneously change the rates of SPC cell cycle progression and meiotic entry.</p><p>PUF proteins are expressed in germ cells of many animals and are conserved regulators of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Salvetti, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Wickens et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> PUF proteins expressed in germline SPCs, FBF-1 and FBF-2, share the majority of their target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Porter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prasad et al., 2016</xref>) and are redundantly required for SPC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). Despite 89% identity between FBF-1 and FBF-2 protein sequences, several reports suggest that FBF-1 and FBF-2 localize to distinct cytoplasmic RNA granules and have unique effects on the germline SPC pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lamont et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Voronina et al., 2012</xref>). FBF-1 and FBF-2 each support distinct numbers of SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lamont et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, FBF-1 inhibits accumulation of target mRNAs in SPCs, while FBF-2 primarily represses translation of the target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Voronina et al., 2012</xref>). Some differences between FBF-1 and FBF-2 function might be explained by their association with distinct protein cofactors, as we previously found that a small protein DLC-1 is a cofactor specific to FBF-2 that promotes FBF-2 localization and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the fact that several repressive mechanisms have been documented for PUF family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Quenault et al., 2011</xref>), it is relatively understudied how the differences between PUF homologs are specified. Here, we sought to take advantage of the distinct SPC numbers maintained by individual FBF proteins to understand how they regulate the dynamics of SPCs cell cycle and meiotic entry and to probe the functional differences between FBFs.</p><p>Elaborating on the general contribution of PUF proteins to stem cell maintenance, we describe here that FBF-1 and FBF-2 have antagonistic effects on the rates of germline SPC cell cycle and meiotic entry. We find that FBFs regulate core cell cycle machinery transcripts along with transcripts required for differentiation to coordinately affect both transcript classes. FBF-1 requires CCR4-NOT deadenylation machinery, while FBF-2 functions independently of CCR4-NOT and might protect target mRNAs from deadenylation. These distinct functions of FBFs are determined by the protein regions outside of the conserved PUF homology domain. The opposing regulation of SPC cell cycle and differentiation by FBFs allows stem cells to simultaneously modulate cell division rate and meiotic entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially modulate cell division and meiotic entry of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline SPCs</title><p>During tissue maintenance, stem cells adjust their proliferative activity and differentiation rate through diverse regulatory mechanisms, including RNA-binding protein-mediated post-transcriptional regulation.

SPCs were marked by staining for the nucleoplasmic marker REC-8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hansen et al., 2004</xref>), and the extent of SPC zone was measured by counting the number of cell rows positive for REC-8 staining in each germline. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lamont et al., 2004</xref>), we observed that the SPC zone of <italic>fbf-1(ok91, loss-of-function mutation, lf)</italic> (~15 germ cell diameters, gcd; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bi</xref>) is smaller than that of the wild type (~20 gcd, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Bii</xref>), whereas the SPC zone of <italic>fbf-2(q738, loss-of-function mutation, lf)</italic> (~25 gcd, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Biii</xref>) is larger than that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The differences in the length of SPC zone between <italic>fbf</italic> single mutants and the wild type are consistently observed in animals through the first day of adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To test whether the differences in the lengths of germline SPC zone between <italic>fbf</italic> mutants and the wild type result from changes in the rate of cell division, we compared cell cycle parameters in each genetic background. We started with measuring the M-phase index (the percentage of SPC zone cells in M phase) following immunostaining for the SPC marker REC-8 and the M-phase marker phospho-histone H3 (pH3, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that the mitotic index of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> was significantly higher than that of the wild type (by 54%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, the mitotic index of <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> was significantly lower than that of the wild type (by 42%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These results suggested that loss of FBF-2 might reduce SPC proliferation. We also considered the possibility that the loss of FBF-1 might accelerate progression of SPCs through the cell cycle. However, as described below, this hypothesis was rejected. Since <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells have abbreviated G1 and extended G2 phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>), we tested whether the G2-phase duration is affected differentially by loss of function mutation of each <italic>fbf.</italic> Using phospho-histone H3 immunostaining and 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) pulse, we estimated a median G2 length by determining when 50% of pH3-positive cells become EdU-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). We found that the median G2 length of <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> is significantly greater than that of the wild type, suggesting that loss of FBF-2 results in slower progression through the G2-phase of the cell cycle (by 25%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By contrast, the median G2 length of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> is not significantly different from that of the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We conclude that FBF-2 accelerates SPC cell cycle by facilitating the G2-phase progression.</p><p>Since mutation of <italic>fbf-1</italic> did not affect the length of G2 phase, we tested whether percentage of SPCs in S phase is affected by this mutation. We determined percent SPCs labeled by EdU during a 30-min pulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>) and found a minor increase in S-phase index in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). These results refute the interpretation that <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> mutation causes faster cell cycle progression.</p><p>To directly estimate the rate of germ cell division in wild type and <italic>fbf</italic> mutants, we assayed germ cell proliferation during larval development before the onset of meiotic differentiation.

By contrast, there was no significant difference in germ cell proliferation rate between <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> and the wild type. We conclude that the cell division rate is decreased in <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> and unaffected in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>.</p><p>Despite the same SPC cell division rate, the SPC zone of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> is smaller than that of the wild type, suggesting a possibility that <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> might result in faster meiotic entry. Conversely, compared to the wild type, <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> maintains a relatively larger SPC population but with slower proliferation, suggesting that the rate of meiotic entry in <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> might be slower than in the wild type. To test these possibilities, we determined the rate of meiotic entry in each genetic background. Animals were continuously EdU labeled and stained for EdU and REC-8 at three time points. The number of germ cells negative for REC-8 but positive for EdU were scored at each time point and the rate of meiotic entry was estimated from the slope of the plotted regression line as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1G</xref>. We found that <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> results in a significantly increased rate of meiotic entry compared to the wild type (by 31%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), whereas <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> results in a significantly reduced rate of meiotic entry (by 18%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

We addressed this hypothesis in two ways. First, we tested whether mutation of FBF-binding elements (FBEs) in the 3âUTR of <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> mRNA would result in translational derepression of <italic>cyb-2.1</italic>.

Four mRNAs encoding Cyclin B family members co-purify with FBF proteins and three of them contain predicted FBEs in their 3âUTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Porter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prasad et al., 2016</xref>). Since <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> mRNA is found in complex with FBFs across multiple experimental conditions and contains more canonical FBE sites in its 3âUTR than the other cyclin B transcripts, we selected <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> for further analysis. If FBFs repress translation of <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> by binding to FBEs, mutation of FBEs would cause derepression of CYB-2.1 protein. To test this prediction, we established a transgenic animal <italic>3xflag::cyb-2.1(fbm)</italic>, expressing 3xFLAG::CYB-2.1 under the control of 3âUTR with mutated FBEs (ACAxxxAU); as a control, a transgenic animal expressing 3x<italic>flag::cyb-2.1(wt)</italic> with wild-type FBEs was also established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantification of transgene transcript levels by qPCR suggested that steady-state transcript levels of <italic>3xflag::cyb-2.1(fbm)</italic> wereÂ ~4.5 fold greater than those of <italic>3xflag::cyb-2.1(wt)</italic>, suggesting that FBEs affect steady-state transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

First, FBF proteins simultaneously adjust SPC cell cycle and meiotic entry rates through regulation of FBF target mRNAs affecting each process. Second, FBF-mediated repression of cyclin B affects SPC cell division rate. Third, distinct effects of FBF homologs on their target mRNAs and SPC development are mediated by differential cooperation of FBFs with deadenylation machinery. In turn, activation of deadenylation machinery by FBFs depends on the protein sequences outside of the conserved PUF RNA-binding domain. Collectively, our results support a model where two paralogous FBF proteins achieve complementary effects on SPC cell division and meiotic entry through distinct regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>A model of antagonistic effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 on germline SPC dynamics and target mRNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) FBFs regulate the rate of stem and progenitor (green) cell division and the rate of entry into meiosis (grey).

In a similar fashion, mutations of FBF targets <italic>gld-2</italic> and <italic>gld-3</italic> lead to a decrease in meiotic entry rate and to accumulation of excessive numbers of SPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eckmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fox and Schedl, 2015</xref>). Conversely, higher meiotic entry rate of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> SPCs might be explained by partial derepression of FBF targets. FBF-2 represses FBF target transcripts in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> background, while sequestering them in large cytoplasmic aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Voronina et al., 2012</xref>). However, this repression is less effective than that exerted by FBF-1 since partial derepression of GLD-1 has been previously observed in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenner and Schedl, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crittenden et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We find that FBF-2 promotes SPC cell division by facilitating progression through the G2-phase of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, SPCs of the <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> mutant are characterized by longer median G2-phase length. By contrast, the G2-phase of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> SPCs is the same as in the wild type, even though this genetic background shows an increase in the mitotic index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). There are several possible explanations for a higher mitotic index in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> background. One is slow progression through the M-phase of the cell cycle. We tested for activation of mitotic checkpoints in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> genetic background, but found no difference with the wild type in the prevalence of inactivated NCC-1/CDK-1 (pTyr15) (data not shown). Another possibility for the increase in mitotic index is the difference in the proportion of cycling-competent versus non-cycling cells in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>. The proximal SPC zone contains non-cycling cells in meiotic S-phase, estimated to comprise 30â40% of total SPC zone cells in the wild-type germlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crittenden et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaramillo-Lambert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2011</xref>). Faster meiotic entry rate of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> SPCs might be associated with faster progenitor transit through the meiotic S-phase. As a result, the number of non-cycling premeiotic cells (and consequently the total number of SPC zone cells) would be lower, leading to an inflated SPC mitotic index. We could not address whether <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> germlines have a lower number of progenitors in meiotic S-phase since there are no specific molecular markers for this developmental stage. Finally, we find that disruption of FBF-mediated regulation of a single B-type cyclin in slowly proliferating and slowly differentiating <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> SPCs is sufficient to disturb stem cell homeostasis, to promote faster cell cycle, and to result in excessive SPC accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This observation is consistent with a model where FBFs regulate the rates of SPC cell division and meiotic entry by affecting separate sets of target mRNAs.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that FBFs recognize the same FBE 3âUTR motif and bind largely same mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernstein et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Prasad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Porter et al., 2019</xref>). Based on this, we speculate that antagonistic regulation of FBF target mRNAs results from FBFs competing for the same transcripts. Alternatively, since some FBF targets have multiple FBEs, FBFs might co-bind the transcripts thus subjecting mRNAs to combinatorial regulation. Despite FBF localization to distinct RNA granules, diffuse cytoplasmic fraction of FBF proteins might be sufficient for such co-regulation. Either mechanism would result in FBF target mRNAs differentially responding to the presence of a single or both FBFs, and would explain how change-of-function mutants such as FBF-2vrm and FBF-1(FBF-2vr4) are able to rescue loss-of-function of the non-cognate <italic>fbf</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Variable regions outside of the RNA-binding domain regulate FBF function.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Transgene</th><th valign="bottom">Mutated variable region (VR) sequence</th><th>Rescues <italic>fbf-1(lf)?</italic></th><th>Rescues <italic>fbf-2(lf)?</italic></th><th>Dependent on CCR4-NOT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP::FBF-2wt</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td valign="bottom">No</td><td valign="bottom">Yes</td><td valign="bottom">No<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP::FBF-1wt</td><td valign="bottom">N/A</td><td valign="bottom">Yes</td><td valign="bottom">No</td><td valign="bottom">Yes<sup>*</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP::FBF-2(vrm)</td><td valign="bottom">mutated VR1, 2; VR4 deleted</td><td valign="bottom">Yes</td><td valign="bottom">No</td><td valign="bottom">Yes<sup>â </sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP::FBF-1(FBF-2vr4)</td><td valign="bottom">VR4 swapped with FBF-2</td><td valign="bottom">No</td><td valign="bottom">Yes</td><td valign="bottom">No<sup>â </sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">GFP::FBF-1(FBF-2vr3)</td><td valign="bottom">VR3 swapped with FBF-2</td><td valign="bottom">Yes</td><td valign="bottom">No</td><td valign="bottom">Yes<sup>â </sup></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>Rescue assays were performed by crossing transgenic GFP::FBFs into loss of function mutant of each <italic>fbf</italic>, followed by SPC zone length measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Here, we find that PUF-mediated regulation of mitotic cyclins affects cell cycle dynamics in the germline stem cells of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. A recent report suggests that regulation of cyclin B by PUFs is also observed in mouse embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Uyhazi et al., 2020</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether PUF-family proteins might affect cell cycle of embryonic stem cells through control of cyclin B expression. The slow cell cycle phenotype of the <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> mutant SPCs was rescued by introduction of a CYB-2.1 transgene with mutated FBE elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the levels of B-type cyclins are limiting for SPC progression through cell cycle in this genetic background. Among the B-type cyclins, CYB-3 has emerged as a major G2 regulator in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2019</xref>). Since <italic>cyb-3</italic> lacks canonical FBE elements in its 3âUTR, testing whether FBFs might regulate CYB-3 levels to control SPC division rate will require identification of the relevant non-canonicalÂ binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>mRNA deadenylation and PUF-mediated repression</title><p>Multiple studies suggest that deadenylation contributes to PUF-mediated translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Weidmann et al., 2014</xref>).

Although deadenylation is required for germline stem cell maintenance in flies, nematodes and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berthet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Joly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Nakamura et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Nousch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Shan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Suh et al., 2009</xref>), the contribution of deadenylation to PUF translational repression in vivo is still controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Weidmann et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies of CCR4-NOT component CCF-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic> suggested that paralogous PUF proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 might employ both CCF-1-dependent and CCF-1-independent regulatory modes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Suh et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we find that FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially cooperate with CCR4-NOT deadenylation machinery in <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline SPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that FBF-1âs function in vivo is supported by the CCR4-NOT deadenylation. First, the size of germline SPC zone maintained by FBF-1 in the absence of FBF-2 is significantly reduced by a knock-down of CCR4-NOT deadenylase components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Second, FBF-1-mediated repression of FBF target reporter in vivo requires CCR4-NOT deadenylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). By contrast, SPC zone maintained by FBF-2 and repression of reporter by FBF-2 in the absence of FBF-1 are not affected by CCR4-NOT component knock down. Taken together, these observations provide genetic evidence that CCR4-NOT promotes FBF-1 function in germline SPCs. The increase in FBF-1 protein levels that we observed after knocking down the CCR4-NOT subunit <italic>ccf-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) might result from the relief of FBF-1 auto-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lamont et al., 2004</xref>). Third, both endogenous FBF-1 and GFP::FBF-1 colocalize with a core CCR4-NOT subunit 3xFLAG::CCF-1 in vivo by co-immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Additionally, an in vivo test of protein interaction between GFP::FBF-1 and 3xFLAG::CCF-1 using proximity ligation assay detects positive signal suggesting that these proteins reside in the same complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). By contrast, thereâs significantly less in vivo colocalization and proximity between GFP::FBF-2 and 3xFLAG::CCF-1. These data are consistent with the model that FBF-1 and FBF-2 form distinct RNP complexes, of which FBF-1 complex preferentially includes CCR4-NOT deadenylase. Finally, we assessed the FBF target poly(A) tail length in the nematodes mutant for each <italic>fbf</italic>, and found that the poly(A) tail length of FBF targets <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> and <italic>htp-</italic>1 was relatively shorter in <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> background than in wild type and <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>. By contrast, <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> mutation resulted in a shift of poly(A) tail distributions to longer lengths compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We conclude that FBF-1 selectively cooperates with deadenylation machinery to promote translational repression of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Conversely, FBF-2 protects the target mRNAs from deadenylation and promotes repression of target mRNAs by a deadenylation-independent mechanism.</p><p>The two FBF proteins are 91% identical in primary sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zhang et al., 1997</xref>). If FBFs have distinct abilities to engage deadenylation machinery, what are the features of FBF-2 that prevent it from cooperating with CCR4-NOT? PUF RNA-binding domain is sufficient for a direct interaction with the CCF-1 subunit of CCR4-NOT and its homologs in multiple species, including <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Goldstrohm et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hook et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kadyrova et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Suh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Van Etten et al., 2012</xref>). However, protein sequences outside of the well-structured RNA-binding domain can promote PUF-induced deadenylation and are hypothesized to function either through improved recruitment of CCR4-NOT complex or through allosteric activation of CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Webster et al., 2019</xref>). We find that the Variable Region (VR) sequences outside of the RNA-binding domain of FBF-1 and FBF-2 play a key role in determining whether these proteins are able to cooperate with CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). Mutations of three VRs (VR1, 2, and 4) in FBF-2 result in a protein that now cooperates with CCR4-NOT, suggesting that these regions are necessary to prevent the wild-type FBF-2 from engaging with the deadenylase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Conversely, swapping the VR4 of FBF-2 onto FBF-1 renders the chimeric protein FBF-1(FBF-2vr4) insensitive to CCR4-NOT knockdown, indicating that VR4 of FBF-2 is sufficient to prevent cooperation with CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). By contrast, swapping VR3 residing within FBF-2 RNA-binding domain into FBF-1 does not affect the FBF-1(FBF-2vr3) chimeraâs cooperation with CCR4-NOT, supporting the importance of protein sequences outside of the RNA-binding domain for cooperation with CCR4-NOT. Overall, we conclude that the protein regions outside of the conserved PUF RNA-binding domain regulate the repressive action mediated by each PUF protein homolog. As a result, distinct sequences flanking the RNA-binding domain may lead to differential preference of regulatory mechanisms exerted by individual PUF-family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Identifying the sequences outside of FBF-1 RNA-binding domain that promote its cooperation with CCR4-NOT remains a subject for future studies.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest a new mechanism regulating stem cell mitotic activity in conjunction with meiotic entry rate or differentiation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline through antagonistic regulation of key mRNA targets by PUF family FBF proteins. Complementary activities of FBF-1 and FBF-2 combine to fine tune SPC proliferation and meiotic entry coordinately regulating both processes. PUF proteins are conserved stem cell regulators in a variety of organisms, and their control of target mRNAs that affect proliferation and differentiation is widespread as well. The future challenge will be to determine whether PUF-dependent RNA regulation in other stem cell systems might be modulated to adjust stem cell division rate along with changing the rate of differentiation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Primary anti-GFP and anti-FLAG antibodies were diluted in Duolink diluent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). After overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4Â°C, 1:5 dilutions of PLUS and MINUS Duolink PLA Probes were added to each slide and incubated at 37Â°C for 1 hr. Next, slides were incubated at 37Â°C for ligation (for 30 min) and amplification (for 100 min) steps and finally mounted with Duolink Mounting medium with DAPI. Images were acquired using Zeiss 880 confocal microscope. The ImageJ âAnalyze Particlesâ plugin was used to quantify PLA foci in germline images.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>FBF target reporter regulation assay</title><p>Reporter transgene with GFP fused to Histone H2B and the 3â untranslated region (UTR) of <italic>htp-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Merritt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Merritt and Seydoux, 2010</xref>) was crossed into <italic>rrf-1(lf), rrf-1(lf)/hT2; fbf-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>rrf-1(lf); fbf-2(lf)</italic> genetic backgrounds.

Although these may not require additional experiments, we would like the authors to address these points by editing to improve accuracy/clarity of the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. provide significant contributions to the interesting story of differing roles for two very similar PUF proteins FBF-1 and FBF-2 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line with implications for PUF proteins in general. First, based on cell cycle measurements, they define different and interesting roles for the FBFs in regulating rates of mitotic cell cycle progression and meiotic entry (&quot;proliferation&quot; and &quot;differentiation&quot;), and they identify a key cyclin. Second, they distinguish the role of FBF-1 as dependent on CCR4-NOT deadenylase, likely leading to degradation of target mRNAs. Third, they define sequences in FBF-1 that mediate CCR4-NOT dependence.</p><p>Comments and Suggestions:</p><p>1) Figure 5. A major conclusion is that FBF-1 is promoting deadenylation of its target mRNAs via CCR4-NOT. Demonstration of PolyA length differences with additional FBF-1 targets would bolster this conclusion.</p><p>2) mRNA quantification after CCR4-NOT RNAi as in and compared with Figure 1G would also further bolster the degradation conclusion.</p><p>3) Does the FBF-2 VR mutant now associate with CCF-1 in the proximal ligation assay? If so, this would strengthen the conclusion that the function has been shifted to FBF-1-CCR4-NOT.</p><p>4) Figure 8. Are you proposing a competition model? Can you clarify how your molecular model will play out in the control of the spatial extent of the PZ?</p><p>5) &quot;Proliferation&quot; and its control should be clarified where possible as control of &quot;rate of mitotic cell cycle progression&quot;. In the past, there has been confusion in the field regarding &quot;proliferation&quot; as the alternative cell fate to &quot;differentiation&quot;. For &quot;meiotic entry&quot;, clarify where possible spatial position versus rate. Again, to help with the past confusion in the field, several places in the manuscript could clarify by substituting &quot;differentiation&quot; with position or rate of &quot;meiotic entry&quot;.</p><p>6) Several comments regarding the term &quot;SPC zone size&quot;, throughout the manuscript:</p><p>First, best to call the pool of REC-8-positive cells &quot;progenitor cells&quot;, and the zone as the &quot;progenitor zone&quot;, abbreviating as &quot;PZ&quot;, rather than defining a new term and acronym.</p><p>Second, the &quot;zone size&quot; should be (1) standardized to numbers of cells in the key genotypes to account for possible differences in gonad width and (2) defined more clearly as a distance measurement since the term &quot;size&quot; has been used in the literature to mean cell numbers, and (3) justified better as a readout.</p><p>Third, since this distance measurement is a key phenotypic readout throughout the manuscript, define better how the position of the dotted lines indicating the edge of the PZ was determined: the distance between the end of the REC-8 positive cells and the dotted line is not uniform in the figures (compare, for example Figure 1C and 6B). It is especially unclear for Figure 7B.</p><p>7) Introduction paragraph two. The position of cell divisions is not uniform (e.g., Maciejowski et al.). Please restate.</p><p>8) Subsection âFBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially regulate mRNA abundance of target genes controlling proliferation and differentiationâ. Early adult <italic>glp-1(ar202)</italic> shifted to 25Âº as L1 does not contain &quot;only mitotic cells&quot; (Pepper et al., 2003). Please restate.</p><p>9) I found the naming of the vr mutants and swaps made this section hard to follow. Perhaps you could name them based on the donor and target proteins?</p><p>10) Discussion paragraph two. This point is subtle and a bit confusing. Perhaps clarify that you mean the proportions of cycling-competent versus non-cycling-competent pre-meiotic S that normally contribute to the PZ?</p><p>11) In the same paragraph add &quot;specific&quot;, &quot;no specific molecular markersâ¦&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Wang et al. have proposed that FBF proteins function differentially in regulating the same set of mRNA targets. Using a set of FBF targets they demonstrated that mRNA is downregulated by FBF-1 but not FBF-2. They provided evidence that FBF-1, but not FBF-2, functions together with CCR-4/NOT to de-adenylated cyb-2.1 and possibly other FBF targets. They argued that 3 variable regions (VR), present in FBF-2, are critical for their distinct molecular identity, removing and swapping these regions would make them each behave like other. This work furthers the mechanistic understanding on how puf proteins function in regulating their targets, the logic is straightforward and the manuscripts clearly deliver the above findings to readers. However, the data provided by the Wang et al. suffers from improper statistical analysis, imprecise interpretation of result and needs additional data to support the claims in the manuscript.</p><p>1) FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially modulate proliferation and meiotic entry of <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline SPCs.</p><p>The authors have found that fbf mutants have differential mitotic index and concluded that they have different rate of proliferation. For the <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant, a longer cell cycle is supported by slightly longer G2 phase. However, for the <italic>fbf-1</italic> mutant G2 length is the same as wild type, which is inconsitent with the higher mitotic index (Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2019). Higher M-phase index could instead be due to cells spending more time in M-phase (which is possible due to overexpression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin B proteins, which is downregulated to trigger M-phase exit). Additional data will need to be presented before making the conclusion that the <italic>fbf-1</italic> mutant has a shorter cell cycle. Determining the S-phase index could provide support for a shorter cell cycle. The S-phase index data could also bolster the point that <italic>fbf-2</italic> has a longer cell cycle, as the G2 lengthening is very modest and thus unlikely to explain the decreased meiotic output.</p><p>Importantly, the result that meiotic output of <italic>fbf-1</italic> and <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutants is higher and lower, respectively, than wild type is sufficient to explain the differences in the SPC zone length and FBF proteins role in meiotic entry. However, the data suffered from low sample size.</p><p>2) FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially regulate mRNA abundance of target genes controlling proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>The authors hypothesized that &quot;FBF-1 and FBF-2 might be acting differentially on the same set of mRNAs&quot;. They chose a set of mRNA targets of FBF (3 meiotic genes and 4 cell cycle regulators). Based on qPCR in fbf mutants and wild type (all in <italic>glp-1(gf)</italic> background, Figure 1G), authors argue that FBF-1 destabilize these target mRNAs, while FBF-2 promotes their accumulation. This data lays the foundation for their subsequent analysis. However, the data need improvement in several ways:</p><p>i) The authors have chosen linear trend analysis to show that, for all the mRNA tested, levels are higher in <italic>fbf-1(-)</italic> &gt; wild type &gt; <italic>fbf-2</italic>. While trend looks to be true, but given that control, tbb-2 mRNA levels are reduced by almost half in <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant compared to wild type, with a possible exception cyb-2.2, none of the mRNAs tested can be different in <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant compared to wild type. Based on the graph one can only argue that FBF-1 destabilize mRNA levels but FBF-2 does not have any appreciable effect.</p><p>ii) The statistical labels in Figure 1G is inconsistent with the statement made in the result. The authors claimed that other than cyb-1, all the other targets mRNA expression are increased in <italic>fbf-1(-)</italic>, but reduced in <italic>fbf-2(-)</italic>. While in Figure 1G, the statistical significance label for htp-2 and cyb-1 are EXACTLY the same. In addition, the authors are encouraged to explain why one-way ANOVA was chosen for their statistical analysis in the Materials and methods section. A pairwise comparison between wild type and each fbf single mutant should be performed for all the mRNAs tested; if there is a significant difference then one can make a conclusion.</p><p>iii) The authors indicate that they are studying these targets' regulation in germline tumor, however the RNA is from whole worms. The authors are encouraged to explain their approach.</p><p>3) Repression of cyclin B by FBF limits accumulation of germline SPCs.</p><p>The authors have mutated all three FBEs in cyb-2.1 and have successfully shown that CYB-2.1 protein levels have become higher in immunoblot. They also show that this mutation causes an increase of SPC size in <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant and this can be reverted by depleting cyb-2.1. Based on this the authors conclude that &quot;levels of B-type cyclins limit SPC proliferation rate in fbf-2(lf) and disruption of FBF-1-mediated repression of a single cyclin B gene is sufficient to affect the size of germline SPC zone&quot;.</p><p>There are multiple issues with this result:</p><p>i) <italic>C. elegans</italic> has ~12 puf genes (Prasad et al., 2016) and most of them have not been fully characterized; thus it is possible that mutated FBEs might be recognized by one or more of these puf proteins rather than FBF. Immunostaining and quantification of CYB-2.1 in extruded germlines of the <italic>fbf-1</italic> mutant and the <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant would be required to claim that there is reciprocal regulation by the FBF proteins, rather than other puf proteins.</p><p>ii) Mutating FBEs in cyb-2.1, results in its higher expression. Rationale for checking the effect of its overexpression in fbf-2(-) background, instead of wild type, is not clear. Since there are no FBEs in cyb-2.1fbm, its effects are expected to be fbf-agnostic.</p><p>iii) Subsection âRepression of cyclin B by FBF limits accumulation of germline SPCsâ paragraph three authors have concluded that increase in SPC zone size in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm vs <italic>fbf-2</italic> is due to increased proliferation and also the meiotic entry rate is unchanged between two mutants. They have not provided any evidence for either of these two possibilities, i.e. proliferation rate has increased in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm and meiotic entry rate is same in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm as compared to fbf-2.</p><p>4) FBF-1 promotes deadenylation of its target mRNA.</p><p>The authors moved back to cyb-2.1 to show that poly A tails are affected in fbf mutants without giving any rationale. The assay should be performed on a few more genes if any generalized statement statement is made, otherwise it must be restricted to cyb-2.1. Also wild type <italic>(glp-1(gf)</italic>) is missing in the assay, which makes it hard to interpret the data. Is FBF-1 alone or both FBFs responsible for deadenylation of cyb-2.1 mRNA or if FBF-1 and FBF-2 have opposing effect on cyb-2.1 mRNA?</p><p>5) While the authors present some solid lines of evidence that FBF-1 and FBF-2 are different (meiotic entry rate, FBF-1 acts with CCR-4/NOT to de-adenylated cyb-2.1 and there are specific sequences in FBF-2 that block this interaction), they are clearly redundant with each other for the stem cell fate and repression of htp-2. Thus, Figure 8 would be more useful to the community if their redundant function was also included.</p><p>6) FBF-1 and FBF-2 do not explain the spatial control of expression in the SPC zone and thus balance between proliferation and differentation, which is through <italic>glp-1</italic> targets lst-1 and sygl-1. It is surprising that there is no mention of lst-1 and sygl-1-1 in the Discussion, particularly since they are co-factors of FBF-1 and FBF-2 (Haupt et al., 2019, Shin et al., 2017).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline is a well-established model for investigating how signaling from a niche regulates the balance between stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. In the germline, the stem cell population is maintained as a pool, i.e. rather than undergoing invariant asymmetric divisions that always produce one stem cell and one differentiating daughter cell, the proliferative potential of any stem cell is determined by its distance from the niche and/or the level of niche signaling that it receives. The germline niche produces a Notch ligand which signals via the Notch receptor GLP-1 to promote the stem or mitotic cell fate. Once the level of Notch signaling drops below a threshold, cells enter meiosis. Downstream of Notch signaling, the FBF proteins, FBF-1 and FBF-2, act to maintain the stem cell pool and in <italic>fbf-1</italic>, <italic>fbf-2</italic> double mutants, at least at the adult stage, the stem cell population is lost and the germline resembles one in which Notch signaling has been removed entirely (Crittenden et al., 2002). This phenotype, in combination with the observation that FBF-1/2 share 89% identity and the majority of mRNA targets, has led to a simplified model in which they serve largely redundant roles. However, a fully redundant function is not supported by observations that single loss of function <italic>fbf-1</italic> or <italic>fbf-2</italic> germlines have distinct phenotypes (Lamont et al., 2004) and that FBF-1 and FBF-2 proteins have different localization patterns (Voronina et al., 2012).</p><p>Here the authors attempt to dissect what underlies this difference. Their work addresses two fundamental questions of broad impact/interest (1) how does niche signaling maintain a balance of proliferation and differentiation in a stem cell pool and (2) how can different modes of action be specified in largely similar proteins. As the first is broadly relevant to the stem cell field and the second is addressed within the context of two highly conserved proteins that play a role in stem cell maintenance in many organisms, this work is likely to be interesting to a wide audience. It should also be noted that because of the complexity of the system (the large number of FBF-1/2 targets and the number of other factors that also impinge upon stem cell dynamics), these questions are quite hard to address, and I commend the authors for trying to do so.</p><p>My critique of this manuscript can be broken into two categories: (1) it would benefit from some changes in writing to increase clarity and accessibility for non-experts and (2) there are a few questions that I had regarding experimental issues, some related to interpretation, which could be addressed in the text (points D, and F-H below) and some related to additional controls/experiments that would substantiate the authors' main conclusions (points A-C, E, and F). The suggested experiments are not substantially outside of those that the authors have already conducted and I think that most of them (enough to satisfy the majority of my major comments) could be performed within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Writing/interpretation:</p><p>As someone who works in the germline, but not on this pathway in particular, I found that this paper was often hard to digest. It would be very helpful if the authors could make sure that their rationale for each experiment and its interpretation is accessible to a reader not intimately familiar with the field. For example, the difference in proliferative zone (PZ) size in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic>, I think pointing out here how a change in PZ size shows a shift in the balance between proliferation and differentiation, as if both were slowed down or sped up in complete coordination, the size of PZ would likely be constant. In addition, explaining why experiments were designed in a certain way and why the (perhaps) easier experiment is not feasible would be very helpful.</p><p>I also believe that the authors need to revise their language in several instances to avoid conflating two different questions/fields. For example, I found the use of &quot;differentiation demands&quot; confusing, because, for me, &quot;differentiation demands&quot; implies reproductive demand, i.e. the need for mature gametes. In both the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (e.g. Narbonne et al., 2015) and in other stem cell populations (e.g. Hsu, Li and Fuchs, 2014), signaling from differentiated/differentiating progeny to their stem cell parents plays a significant role in regulating stem cell proliferation, such that proliferative output matches the demand for differentiated progeny. I do not think that the authors are addressing this type of &quot;feedback&quot; signaling â i.e. they do not show that the rate of meiotic entry regulates the rate of proliferation, but rather that these two things are coordinated. I think that it is important to clarify their questiion to avoid confusion and/or erroneous expectations from people, such as myself, who are more used to thinking about feedback mechanisms. There are several instances of this throughout, including: &quot;Complementary activities of FBF-1 and FBF-2 combine to fine tune SPC proliferation and differentiation to respond to proliferative demands of the tissue.&quot;</p><p>2) Experimental issues:</p><p>A) Figure 1. The cell cycle phenotype of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> is puzzling. Since there are no quiescent cells in the germline, an increase in mitotic index (MI) ought to reflect either a faster passage through the mitotic cell cycle or a longer duration of mitosis. The authors report no change in the length of G2, which leads me to wonder whether S phase is accelerated or mitosis is delayed (I believe there are assays to assess both (S phase, Fox and Schedl, 2011) and M phase (Gerhold et al., 2015)). This result is also odd in light of their observation that the transcript levels of most of the Cyclin Bs (except for CYB-1), are highly elevated â i.e. why is the duration of G2 unaffected despite higher levels? The authors explanation in the discussion that a higher MI could be due to a smaller proliferative population, due to accelerated meiotic entry, would predict (I think) that the stem cell pool should eventually be lost â i.e. in older <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> adults, do they see a progressive loss of proliferative cells? As this interpretation (i.e. FBF-2, rather than FBF-1, being primarily responsible for cell cycle regulation) is key to their model figure at the end, it bears a closer look.</p><p>B) Also Figure 1. I am unsure as to how to interpret the RT-qPCR data. The authors state that their negative control (tbb-2) is unaffected, yet in fbf-2(lf) transcript levels appear to be at least a strongly depressed as those of the genes that they argue are maintained by FBF-2. It is possible that I am missing something here, but it would be good if the authors could address/explain this, as it is visually striking/distracting in their data/graph and if it is accurate, i.e. that in fbf-2(lf) transcript levels are generally lower, it is problematic for the interpretation that FBF-1 and FBF-2 have reciprocal effects on shared target transcripts. It is also not entirely clear to me what the linear trend test adds to the data interpretation, some clarification/discussion would be helpful.</p><p>C) In Figure 2, the authors address the hypothesis that slow G2 and low MI in fbf-2(lf) is due to FBF-1-mediated translational repression of cyb-2.1. The authors state that protein levels for CYB-2.1 with mutated FBF binding elements (FBEs) are elevated, but they cannot detect protein levels for the WT version, which could imply that it is not expressed at all. It would be helpful if the authors could should that both transgenes are expressed by looking at transcript levels. I also wonder if this result predicts that in wildtype germlines, expression of cyb-2.1 with mutated FBEs, but not wild-type cyb-2.1 would affect cell cycle progression? Finally, this hypothesis also seems to predict that a partial RNAi of FBF-1 in a fbf-2(lf) background, should rescue, at least to some extent, the fbf-2(lf) phenotype. If this experiment is technically feasible, it would greatly strength the authors argument.</p><p>D) In Figure 3, the authors use a translational reporter for the htp-2 3'UTR, which their RT-qPCR results suggest should be derepressed in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>, but they do not seem to see this and I am unsure as to why not? In addition, their results strongly suggest that the change in PZ size in fbf-2(lf) requires CCR4-NOT complex members, which supports the hypothesis that FBF-1 activity with CCR4-NOT is leading to transcript loss. However, if FBF-1 acts with CCR4-NOT to regulate transcript levels, shouldn't RNAi of CCR4-NOT complex members phenocopy <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>? It would be helpful if the authors could address these questions. This may be another instance of where the data/results are not fully accessible to a non-expert.</p><p>E) In Figure 5, the authors quantify the polyA tail length of cyb-2.1 and show that it is shorter in fbf-2(lf), suggesting that it is being deadenylated, presumably by FBF-1/CCR4-NOT. It would strengthen the authors conclusion substantially, if they could show that the change in polyA tail length was rescued by depletion of CCR4-NOT complex members. It is also unclear to me why the authors compared <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> to fbf-2(lf) rather than to wildtype? I also wonder whether tbb-2 is the best control as the detection levels seem very low which could make slight changes in peak detection challenging.</p><p>F) Figure 6: I think that this a key place where the authors interpretation could be clarified somewhat. I believe that in Figure 6, the fact that FBF-2 without variable regions (VRs) 1, 2 and 4 cannot fully rescue the fbf-2(lf) phenotype in either a fbf-2(lf) or a <italic>fbf-1(lf) fbf-2(lf)</italic> background suggests that either this version of FBF-2 is only partially functional or it is acting like FBF-1. The authors then provide support for the latter interpretation by showing that the activity of FBF-2(vrm) requires CCR4-NOT and can also partially rescue <italic>fbf-1(lf).</italic> This last piece of data is in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, but, in my opinion, should be moved into the main figure panel. This also suggests that FBF-1 may be able to act with CCR4-NOT without any of its own variable regions, which (I think?) is somewhat surprising. The authors could test this by using a similar approach.</p><p>G) Figure 7: For the domain swapping experiments here, I believe the main conclusions are that VR3 (in the RNA-binding domain) is not required for FBF-1 activity, and that VR4 from FBF-2 is sufficient to prevent FBF-1 from acting with CCR4-NOT to regulate polyadenylation, as FBF-1 with FBF-2's VR4 cannot rescue <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> in a <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> or a <italic>fbf-1(lf),fbf-2(lf)</italic> background, while FBF-1 with FBF-2's R3 can. However, what I do not understand is why FBF-1 with FBF-2's VR4 rescues <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1)? Does this mean that it is acting as a dominant negative, since presumably wild-type FBF-1 is still present in this background?</p><p>H) Figure 8: The model figure as currently drawn doesn't really help me understand the authors' mains conclusions/findings. It would be great if this could be re-worked to reflect the effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 on the stem cell population (i.e. perhaps in relation to PZ size which is their phenotypic readout for most experiments) and how these activities lead to a balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52788.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The following is summary of required changes/revisions (suggested by multiple reviewers).</p><p>â Cell cycle phenotypes for fbf(-)s should be added to/improved</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we now report new experiments to provide additional analysis of cell cycle in the three genotypes, including the S-phase index (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D).

It is especially unclear for Figure 7B.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

In our experiments, we often observe fully tumorous phenotype with only a minor contribution of gametogenesis at the restrictive temperature.

For the fbf-2 mutant, a longer cell cycle is supported by slightly longer G2 phase. However, for the fbf-1 mutant G2 length is the same as wild type, which is inconsitent with the higher mitotic index (Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2019). Higher M-phase index could instead be due to cells spending more time in M-phase (which is possible due to overexpression of cell cycle regulators such as cyclin B proteins, which is downregulated to trigger M-phase exit). Additional data will need to be presented before making the conclusion that the fbf-1 mutant has a shorter cell cycle. Determining the S-phase index could provide support for a shorter cell cycle. The S-phase index data could also bolster the point that fbf-2 has a longer cell cycle, as the G2 lengthening is very modest and thus unlikely to explain the decreased meiotic output.</p><p>Importantly, the result that meiotic output of fbf-1 and fbf-2 mutants is higher and lower, respectively, than wild type is sufficient to explain the differences in the SPC zone length and FBF proteins role in meiotic entry. However, the data suffered from low sample size.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for being unclear: our conclusion from cell cycle analysis in the wild type and <italic>fbf</italic> mutants was that wild type and <italic>fbf-1</italic> have similar cell cycle lengths, while <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant has a longer cell cycle length. We now emphasize this conclusion in the Results section immediately after reporting the mitotic index increase in <italic>fbf-1</italic> by telling that the hypothesis of faster cell cycle in <italic>fbf-1</italic> mutant was later rejected to avoid confusion.</p><p>We added an alternative interpretation that <italic>fbf-1</italic> cells spend longer time in M-phase in Discussion.</p><p>We now report new experiments to provide additional analysis of cell cycle in the three genotypes, including determination of the S-phase index in the adult and documenting accumulation of germline stem cells during larval development (Figure 1E, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D, E, F; see also our response to Essential Revisions).</p><p>Finally, we respectfully disagree with regard to the sample size used for meiotic entry rate determination. The rate of meiotic entry was estimated in five independent experiments, each using 5-7 germlines per strain per time point. This comes up to 89-94 total germlines scored per strain, which is larger than the sample size utilized in previous reputable publications (eg., Kocsisova, Kornfeld and Schedl, 2019 Development score 49-57 total germlines per strain). We now report the total number of germlines analyzed per strain in the legends of Figure 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 to help communicate this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) FBF-1 and FBF-2 differentially regulate mRNA abundance of target genes controlling proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>The authors hypothesized that &quot;FBF-1 and FBF-2 might be acting differentially on the same set of mRNAs&quot;. They chose a set of mRNA targets of FBF (3 meiotic genes and 4 cell cycle regulators). Based on qPCR in fbf mutants and wild type (all in glp-1(gf) background, Figure 1G), authors argue that FBF-1 destabilize these target mRNAs, while FBF-2 promotes their accumulation. This data lays the foundation for their subsequent analysis. However, the data need improvement in several ways:</p><p>i) The authors have chosen linear trend analysis to show that, for all the mRNA tested, levels are higher in fbf-1(-) &gt; wild type &gt; fbf-2. While trend looks to be true, but given that control, tbb-2 mRNA levels are reduced by almost half in fbf-2 mutant compared to wild type, with a possible exception cyb-2.2, none of the mRNAs tested can be different in fbf-2 mutant compared to wild type. Based on the graph one can only argue that FBF-1 destabilize mRNA levels but FBF-2 does not have any appreciable effect.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now replaced linear trend analysis with comparisons between the wild type (<italic>glp-1gf</italic>) and <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant backgrounds. Additionally, we have replaced <italic>tbb-2</italic> with a different housekeeping gene, <italic>unc-54</italic> (myosin heavy chain). These new data are reported in Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) The statistical labels in Figure 1G is inconsistent with the statement made in the result. The authors claimed that other than cyb-1, all the other targets mRNA expression are increased in fbf-1(-), but reduced in fbf-2(-). While in Figure 1G, the statistical significance label for htp-2 and cyb-1 are EXACTLY the same. In addition, the authors are encouraged to explain why one-way ANOVA was chosen for their statistical analysis in the Materials and methods section. A pairwise comparison between wild type and each fbf single mutant should be performed for all the mRNAs tested; if there is a significant difference then one can make a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>ANOVA analysis is required to determine whether there is statistically significant difference among any of the data sets in groups of 3 or more sets, but does not indicate which data sets are different from each other. Therefore, it returns same significance for a group where <italic>fbf-1(-)</italic> is significantly different from both wt and <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> and a group where <italic>fbf-2(-)</italic> is different from <italic>fbf-1(-)</italic> and wt. Following detection of significant difference by ANOVA, a post-hoc test is used to determine which specific samples are different from each other. In response to the reviewerâs suggestion, we now follow ANOVA analysis by a Studentâs t-test to compare the abundance of FBF target mRNAs in <italic>fbf-2; glp-1</italic> mutants to those of <italic>glp-1</italic> single mutants instead of linear trend analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) The authors indicate that they are studying these targets' regulation in germline tumor, however the RNA is from whole worms. The authors are encouraged to explain their approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Materials and methods section now includes the explanation that FBF targets investigated in this paper are expressed in the germline and not in the somatic cells of the adult worms. Therefore, RNA abundance in whole worm lysates reports on germline-specific expression of these mRNAs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Repression of cyclin B by FBF limits accumulation of germline SPCs.</p><p>The authors have mutated all three FBEs in cyb-2.1 and have successfully shown that CYB-2.1 protein levels have become higher in immunoblot. They also show that this mutation causes an increase of SPC size in fbf-2 mutant and this can be reverted by depleting cyb-2.1. Based on this the authors conclude that &quot;levels of B-type cyclins limit SPC proliferation rate in fbf-2(lf) and disruption of FBF-1-mediated repression of a single cyclin B gene is sufficient to affect the size of germline SPC zone&quot;.</p><p>There are multiple issues with this result:</p><p>i) <italic>C. elegans</italic> has ~12 puf genes (Prasad et al., 2016) and most of them have not been fully characterized; thus it is possible that mutated FBEs might be recognized by one or more of these puf proteins rather than FBF. Immunostaining and quantification of CYB-2.1 in extruded germlines of the fbf-1 mutant and the fbf-2 mutant would be required to claim that there is reciprocal regulation by the FBF proteins, rather than other puf proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restated our conclusions to reflect that FBEs in <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> 3âUTR might mediate repression through recruitment of other PUF proteins expressed in progenitor cells, although the documented differences between PUF proteinsâ preferred binding sites (Bernstein et al., 2005; Opperman et al., 2005; Koh et al., 2009) would suggest that FBEs are likely recognized by FBFs rather than other PUFs expressed in the SPCs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Mutating FBEs in cyb-2.1, results in its higher expression. Rationale for checking the effect of its overexpression in fbf-2(-) background, instead of wild type, is not clear. Since there are no FBEs in cyb-2.1fbm, its effects are expected to be fbf-agnostic.</p></disp-quote><p>We now emphasize the rationale that the <italic>fbf-2(-)</italic> with its slow cell cycle rate provides a sensitized background to detect the effects of cell cycle regulator overexpression, since it is unclear whether cell cycle rate can be accelerated beyond that of the wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) Subsection âRepression of cyclin B by FBF limits accumulation of germline SPCsâ paragraph three authors have concluded that increase in SPC zone size in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm vs fbf-2 is due to increased proliferation and also the meiotic entry rate is unchanged between two mutants. They have not provided any evidence for either of these two possibilities, i.e. proliferation rate has increased in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm and meiotic entry rate is same in fbf-2; cyb-2.1fbm as compared to fbf-2.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. New experiments in response to these suggestions are summarized in Essential Revisions. As suggested, we now include the estimation of stem cell proliferation rate comparing <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> with the strains expressing wild type or mutant <italic>3xflag::cyb-2.1</italic> transgenes. These new experiments suggest that cell cycle rate is accelerated in <italic>fbf-2(lf); 3xflag::cyb-2.1fbm</italic> compared to <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> (Figure 2D). By contrast, meiotic entry rate of <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> is not affected by expression of either cyb-2.1 transgene (Figure 2E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) FBF-1 promotes deadenylation of its target mRNA.</p><p>The authors moved back to cyb-2.1 to show that poly A tails are affected in fbf mutants without giving any rationale. The assay should be performed on a few more genes if any generalized statement statement is made, otherwise it must be restricted to cyb-2.1. Also wild type (glp-1(gf)) is missing in the assay, which makes it hard to interpret the data. Is FBF-1 alone or both FBFs responsible for deadenylation of cyb-2.1 mRNA or if FBF-1 and FBF-2 have opposing effect on cyb-2.1 mRNA?</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now include the wild type (<italic>glp-1(gf)</italic>) as a control for PAT-PCR assay (Figure 5), and find that FBF-1 and FBF-2 have opposing effects on <italic>cyb-2.1</italic> poly(A) tail. Furthermore, we have included PAT-PCR assay for an additional FBF target, <italic>htp-1</italic>. Our choice of transcripts for analysis represents both cell cycle-related transcripts and differentiation-related transcripts. We focused on the targets for which we could obtain reliable and robust amplification of poly(A) tails.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) While the authors present some solid lines of evidence that FBF-1 and FBF-2 are different (meiotic entry rate, FBF-1 acts with CCR-4/NOT to de-adenylated cyb-2.1 and there are specific sequences in FBF-2 that block this interaction), they are clearly redundant with each other for the stem cell fate and repression of htp-2. Thus, Figure 8 would be more useful to the community if their redundant function was also included.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised model (Figure 8) now emphasizes that both FBFs repress the bound target mRNAs and both FBFs can maintain SPCs on their own (thus highlighting their redundant function).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) FBF-1 and FBF-2 do not explain the spatial control of expression in the SPC zone and thus balance between proliferation and differentation, which is through glp-1 targets lst-1 and sygl-1. It is surprising that there is no mention of lst-1 and sygl-1-1 in the Discussion, particularly since they are co-factors of FBF-1 and FBF-2 (Haupt et al., 2019, Shin et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We now include LST-1 and SYGL-1 in the Discussion. We have not investigated whether the changes in SPC zone size in <italic>fbf</italic> mutants are associated with altered expression of LST-1 or SYGL-1 (that are curiously themselves FBF targets), and it would be an interesting new direction to explore.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] My critique of this manuscript can be broken into two categories: (1) it would benefit from some changes in writing to increase clarity and accessibility for non-experts and (2) there are a few questions that I had regarding experimental issues, some related to interpretation, which could be addressed in the text (points D, and F-H below) and some related to additional controls/experiments that would substantiate the authors' main conclusions (points A-C, E, and F). The suggested experiments are not substantially outside of those that the authors have already conducted and I think that most of them (enough to satisfy the majority of my major comments) could be performed within a reasonable time frame.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) Writing/interpretation:</p><p>As someone who works in the germline, but not on this pathway in particular, I found that this paper was often hard to digest. It would be very helpful if the authors could make sure that their rationale for each experiment and its interpretation is accessible to a reader not intimately familiar with the field. For example, the difference in proliferative zone (PZ) size in fbf-1(lf) and fbf-2(lf), I think pointing out here how a change in PZ size shows a shift in the balance between proliferation and differentiation, as if both were slowed down or sped up in complete coordination, the size of PZ would likely be constant. In addition, explaining why experiments were designed in a certain way and why the (perhaps) easier experiment is not feasible would be very helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised to reflect that the changes in SPC zone size in <italic>fbf-1</italic> and <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutants suggest that each individual FBF protein does not perfectly balance the cell division and meiotic entry. Rather, antagonistic FBF activities combine to simultaneously modulate stem cell division with the rate of meiotic entry. Although our model might be oversimplified, it provides a framework for future exploration of factors controlling SPC dynamics.</p><p>Additionally, we have clarified the rationales for the reported experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also believe that the authors need to revise their language in several instances to avoid conflating two different questions/fields. For example, I found the use of &quot;differentiation demands&quot; confusing, because, for me, &quot;differentiation demands&quot; implies reproductive demand, i.e. the need for mature gametes. In both the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germline (e.g. Narbonne, et al., 2015) and in other stem cell populations (e.g. Hsu, Li and Fuchs, 2014), signaling from differentiated/differentiating progeny to their stem cell parents plays a significant role in regulating stem cell proliferation, such that proliferative output matches the demand for differentiated progeny. I do not think that the authors are addressing this type of &quot;feedback&quot; signaling â i.e. they do not show that the rate of meiotic entry regulates the rate of proliferation, but rather that these two things are coordinated. I think that it is important to clarify their questiion to avoid confusion and/or erroneous expectations from people, such as myself, who are more used to thinking about feedback mechanisms. There are several instances of this throughout, including: &quot;Complementary activities of FBF-1 and FBF-2 combine to fine tune SPC proliferation and differentiation to respond to proliferative demands of the tissue.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have clarified our writing to convey that the focus here is on coordinate regulation of cell division rate and meiotic entry.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Experimental issues:</p><p>A) Figure 1. The cell cycle phenotype of fbf-1(lf) is puzzling. Since there are no quiescent cells in the germline, an increase in mitotic index (MI) ought to reflect either a faster passage through the mitotic cell cycle or a longer duration of mitosis. The authors report no change in the length of G2, which leads me to wonder whether S phase is accelerated or mitosis is delayed (I believe there are assays to assess both (S phase, Fox and Schedl, 2011) and M phase (Gerhold et al., 2015)). This result is also odd in light of their observation that the transcript levels of most of the Cyclin Bs (except for CYB-1), are highly elevated â i.e. why is the duration of G2 unaffected despite higher levels? The authors explanation in the discussion that a higher MI could be due to a smaller proliferative population, due to accelerated meiotic entry, would predict (I think) that the stem cell pool should eventually be lost â i.e. in older fbf-1(lf) adults, do they see a progressive loss of proliferative cells? As this interpretation (i.e. FBF-2, rather than FBF-1, being primarily responsible for cell cycle regulation) is key to their model figure at the end, it bears a closer look.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these suggestions. We addressed many of these in response to the Essential Revisions. Briefly, we determined the S-phase index of the adult germlines, and find that S phase is not accelerated in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic>. We were not able to determine the duration of M-phase since we lack the required live imaging microfluidic set up. Additionally, an assay measuring germline stem cell accumulation during larval development suggested that overall division rate of <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> and wild type germ cells is the same.</p><p>Furthermore, we clarified the potential explanation for higher mitotic index: the total SPC cell count includes non-cycling cells in meiotic S-phase (they cannot be excluded because the field lacks specific molecular markers for this developmental stage). Accelerated meiotic entry in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> might selectively reduce this non-cycling cell population due to their faster transit through the meiotic S-phase. This would lower overall SPC cell counts (without reducing the number of proliferative cells), and thus lead to a higher MI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) Also Figure 1. I am unsure as to how to interpret the RT-qPCR data. The authors state that their negative control (tbb-2) is unaffected, yet in fbf-2(lf) transcript levels appear to be at least a strongly depressed as those of the genes that they argue are maintained by FBF-2. It is possible that I am missing something here, but it would be good if the authors could address/explain this, as it is visually striking/distracting in their data/graph and if it is accurate, i.e. that in fbf-2(lf) transcript levels are generally lower, it is problematic for the interpretation that FBF-1 and FBF-2 have reciprocal effects on shared target transcripts. It is also not entirely clear to me what the linear trend test adds to the data interpretation, some clarification/discussion would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed these suggestions in the Essential Revisions. Briefly: First, the transcript levels in Figure 1G (now Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B) are normalized to actin (<italic>act-1</italic>), so a decrease in FBF target transcripts in <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> does not reflect generally lower transcript levels. Additionally, we have tested other housekeeping mRNAs to provide an alternative negative control. We now replace <italic>tbb-2</italic> with <italic>unc-54</italic>, which abundance changes in the opposite direction to that of FBF targets. Second, as suggested, we now replaced linear trend analysis with comparisons between the wild type (<italic>glp-1gf</italic>) and <italic>fbf-2</italic> mutant backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) In Figure 2, the authors address the hypothesis that slow G2 and low MI in fbf-2(lf) is due to FBF-1-mediated translational repression of cyb-2.1. The authors state that protein levels for CYB-2.1 with mutated FBF binding elements (FBEs) are elevated, but they cannot detect protein levels for the WT version, which could imply that it is not expressed at all. It would be helpful if the authors could should that both transgenes are expressed by looking at transcript levels. I also wonder if this result predicts that in wildtype germlines, expression of cyb-2.1 with mutated FBEs, but not wild-type cyb-2.1 would affect cell cycle progression? Finally, this hypothesis also seems to predict that a partial RNAi of FBF-1 in a fbf-2(lf) background, should rescue, at least to some extent, the fbf-2(lf) phenotype. If this experiment is technically feasible, it would greatly strength the authors argument.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these excellent suggestions!</p><p>1) We have generated a new <italic>cyb-2.1wt</italic> transgene that we can now detect both at the transcript and at the protein level, and report these new data in Figure 2 (Figure 2B, C). Crossing the new <italic>cyb-2.1wt</italic> into <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> mutant did not affect the stem cell dynamics (Figure 2D-G).</p><p>2) As mentioned in the response to reviewer 2 (3ii), we now emphasize the rationale that the <italic>fbf-2(-)</italic> with its slow cell cycle rate provides a sensitized background to detect the effects of cyclin overexpression.</p><p>3) We have not been able to partially knock down <italic>fbf-1</italic> to address whether this would be able to rescue <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) In Figure 3, the authors use a translational reporter for the htp-2 3'UTR, which their RT-qPCR results suggest should be derepressed in fbf-1(lf), but they do not seem to see this and I am unsure as to why not? In addition, their results strongly suggest that the change in PZ size in fbf-2(lf) requires CCR4-NOT complex members, which supports the hypothesis that FBF-1 activity with CCR4-NOT is leading to transcript loss. However, if FBF-1 acts with CCR4-NOT to regulate transcript levels, shouldn't RNAi of CCR4-NOT complex members phenocopy fbf-1(lf)? It would be helpful if the authors could address these questions. This may be another instance of where the data/results are not fully accessible to a non-expert.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain that FBF targets are not derepressed in <italic>fbf-1</italic> mutant even though their mRNAs are accumulating in cytoplasmic foci (Merritt and Seydoux, 2010; Voronina et al., 2012) since FBF-2 on its own is capable of translational repression. However, FBF-2-mediated repression might be less effective since partial deprepression of several targets including <italic>gld-1</italic> has been previously observed in <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> mutants (Crittenden et al., 2002, Brenner and Schedl, 2016). To test whether <italic>fbf-1</italic> requires CCR4-NOT for function, we assess whether <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> after CCR4-NOT subunit RNAi show the same range of phenotypes as <italic>fbf-1(lf) fbf-2(lf)</italic>. These phenotypes include derepression of the <italic>htp-2</italic> 3âUTR reporter, sterility, and failure to initiate oogenesis. This reasoning is now included in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) In Figure 5, the authors quantify the polyA tail length of cyb-2.1 and show that it is shorter in fbf-2(lf), suggesting that it is being deadenylated, presumably by FBF-1/CCR4-NOT. It would strengthen the authors conclusion substantially, if they could show that the change in polyA tail length was rescued by depletion of CCR4-NOT complex members. It is also unclear to me why the authors compared fbf-1(lf) to fbf-2(lf) rather than to wildtype? I also wonder whether tbb-2 is the best control as the detection levels seem very low which could make slight changes in peak detection challenging.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added the wildtype control (<italic>glp-1(gf)</italic>) to the polyA tail length assay (Essential Revisions), and now use <italic>unc-54</italic> myosin instead of <italic>tbb-2</italic> as the control. These changes resulted in revised Figure 5. While testing whether changes in polyA tail length in <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> are dependent on CCR4-NOT would provide additional evidence supporting FBF-1/CCR4-NOT regulatory association, we did not have the time to perform the assay as large-scale culture of <italic>fbf-2(lf); glp-1(gf)</italic> nematodes on RNAi is challenging. Nevertheless, multiple lines of evidence presented in the paper strongly support this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) Figure 6: I think that this a key place where the authors interpretation could be clarified somewhat. I believe that in Figure 6, the fact that FBF-2 without variable regions (VRs) 1, 2 and 4 cannot fully rescue the fbf-2(lf) phenotype in either a fbf-2(lf) or a fbf-1(lf) fbf-2(lf) background suggests that either this version of FBF-2 is only partially functional or it is acting like FBF-1. The authors then provide support for the latter interpretation by showing that the activity of FBF-2(vrm) requires CCR4-NOT and can also partially rescue fbf-1(lf). This last piece of data is in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, but, in my opinion, should be moved into the main figure panel. This also suggests that FBF-1 may be able to act with CCR4-NOT without any of its own variable regions, which (I think?) is somewhat surprising. The authors could test this by using a similar approach.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have moved the <italic>fbf-1(lf)</italic> rescue from Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B to the main Figure 6. We agree that our data suggest that FBF-1âs variable regions flanking the RNA-binding domain are permissive for acting with CCR4-NOT. One simple possibility is that VR4 of FBF-2 includes a 16-amino acid C-terminal extension that might be sterically interfering with the recruitment of CCR4-NOT. However, rigorously testing this and other possible determinants allowing FBF-1/CCR4-NOT cooperation is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) Figure 7: For the domain swapping experiments here, I believe the main conclusions are that VR3 (in the RNA-binding domain) is not required for FBF-1 activity, and that VR4 from FBF-2 is sufficient to prevent FBF-1 from acting with CCR4-NOT to regulate polyadenylation, as FBF-1 with FBF-2's VR4 cannot rescue fbf-1(lf) in a fbf-1(lf) or a fbf-1(lf), fbf-2(lf) background, while FBF-1 with FBF-2's R3 can. However, what I do not understand is why FBF-1 with FBF-2's VR4 rescues fbf-2(lf) (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1)? Does this mean that it is acting as a dominant negative, since presumably wild-type FBF-1 is still present in this background?</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that FBFs bind to the same mRNAs, and either compete for the same binding sites or simultaneously bind to the transcripts that contain multiple FBEs. Either mechanism would explain how change-of-function mutants such as FBF-2vrm and FBF-1(FBF-2vr4) are able to rescue the loss-of-function of the non-cognate <italic>fbf</italic>. We do not think that change-of-function mutants are actually dominant-negative (i.e., poison the function of the original FBF), because in that case a combination of FBF-1(FBF-2vr4) with the wild type <italic>fbf-1</italic> in the <italic>fbf-2(lf)</italic> background would disrupt the activity of the sole remaining wt FBF-1 and produce a phenotype similar to a loss of function of both <italic>fbfs</italic> (loss of SPCs in the adult).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>H) Figure 8: The model figure as currently drawn doesn't really help me understand the authors' mains conclusions/findings. It would be great if this could be re-worked to reflect the effects of FBF-1 and FBF-2 on the stem cell population (i.e. perhaps in relation to PZ size which is their phenotypic readout for most experiments) and how these activities lead to a balance between stem cell maintenance and differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>The model in Figure 8 now depicts that FBF effects on the extent of the mitotic zone result from their regulation of stem cell dynamics (how fast the stem cells are able to divide and the rate of meiotic entry).</p></body></sub-article></article>
