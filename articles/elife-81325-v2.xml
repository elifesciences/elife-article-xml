motivational factors such as earning more money for performing well improve motor performance, how the motor system implements this improvement remains unclear. For instance, feedback-based control, which uses sensory feedback from the body to correct for errors in movement, improves with greater reward. But feedback control encompasses many feedback loops with diverse characteristics such as the brain regions involved and their response time. Which specific loops drive these performance improvements with reward is unknown, even though their diversity makes it unlikely that they are contributing uniformly. We systematically tested the effect of reward on the latency (how long for a corrective response to arise?) and gain (how large is the corrective response?) of seven distinct sensorimotor feedback loops in humans. Only the fastest feedback loops were insensitive to reward, and the earliest reward-driven changes were consistently an increase in feedback gains, not a reduction in latency. Rather, a reduction of response latencies only tended to occur in slower feedback loops. These observations were similar across sensory modalities (vision and proprioception). Our results may have implications regarding feedback control performance in athletic coaching. For instance, coaching methodologies that rely on reinforcement or ‘reward shaping’ may need to specifically target aspects of movement that rely on reward-sensitive feedback responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor feedback</kwd><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>proprioception</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science and Engineering Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2018-05458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gribble</surname><given-names>Paul L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institue of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156241</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gribble</surname><given-names>Paul L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Motor performance benefits from rewarding contexts via a non-uniform reduction of response latencies and increase in feedback gains across the feedback loops involved in upper limb motor control.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>If a cat pushes your hand while you are pouring a glass of water, a corrective response will occur that acts to minimize spillage. This simple action is an example of a behavioral response triggered by sensing a relevant change in the environment—here, a push that perturbs the movement of your arm away from the intended movement goal. This form of feedback control requires the brain to integrate sensory information from the periphery of the body, and thus suffers from transmission delays inherent to the nervous system. However, there is evidence that when more is at stake, we react faster to respond to demands of the task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>). For instance, if wine was being poured instead of water, and your favorite tablecloth covers the table, you may be faster at correcting for a perturbation that risks spilling your wine.</p><p>In the context of human motor control, feedback-based control is not a monolithic process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott, 2016</xref>). Rather, the term encompasses a series of sensorimotor feedback loops that rely on different sensory information, are constrained by different transmission delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), and are supported by different neural substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>). For instance, the circuitry underlying the short-latency rapid response (SLR) is entirely contained in the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liddell and Sherrington, 1924</xref>). The long-latency rapid response (LLR) relies on supraspinal regions such as the primary motor and primary sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheney and Fetz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Day et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evarts and Tanji, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palmer and Ashby, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pruszynski et al., 2011</xref>), and is modulated by upstream associative cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graaf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Omrani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zonnino et al., 2021</xref>). Visuomotor feedback responses rely on visual cortex and other cortical and subcortical brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Day and Brown, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Desmurget et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pruszynski et al., 2010</xref>). Due to these differences, each feedback response is sensitive to different objectives such as maintenance of a limb position or reaching toward a goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott, 2016</xref>). Therefore, to address whether sensorimotor feedback control is sensitive to motivational factors requires testing multiple perturbation-induced feedback responses that rely on a distinct set of feedback loops. Here, the term ‘feedback response’ refers to a behavioral response to an externally applied perturbation. The term ‘feedback loop’ refers to a neuroanatomical circuit implementing a specific feedback control mechanism that will lead to all or part of a behavioral feedback response. In this work, we employed rewarding outcomes (specifically, monetary reward) as a means to manipulate motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Codol et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goodman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hübner and Schlösser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McDougle et al., 2021</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different sensorimotor feedback responses are emphasized in different task designs.</title><p>Feedback responses can be classified along three dimensions: the sensory modality on which they rely (vertical axis), their post-perturbation latency (horizontal axis), and the function they perform (color-coded). Latencies indicated here reflect the fastest reported values from the literature and not necessarily what was observed in this study. Note that this is a partial inventory.

Reward results in changes to the speed-accuracy trade-off, a hallmark of skilled performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Codol et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Codol et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manohar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manohar et al., 2019</xref>). Reward can lead to a reduction in noise in the central nervous system and at the effector to improve the control of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Codol et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goard and Dan, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manohar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pinto et al., 2013</xref>). But whether reward modulates sensorimotor feedback control specifically remains scarcely tested, although previous work in saccadic eye movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manohar et al., 2019</xref>) and indirect evidence in reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Codol et al., 2020b</xref>) suggests this may be the case. Some studies outline a general sensitivity of feedback control to reward during reaching but do not differentiate between each distinct feedback loop that the nervous system relies on to implement this control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Comité et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poscente et al., 2021</xref>). However, the information to which each loop is tuned greatly varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott, 2016</xref>), and consequently it is unlikely that they are all uniformly impacted by reward.</p><p>In the present study, we tested how seven distinct sensorimotor feedback responses are modulated by reward. We measured feedback latency (how long does it take for a corrective response to arise) and feedback gain (how large is the corrective response) for each feedback response within rewarded and unrewarded conditions. Motivational factors can take different forms, such as rewarding or punishing outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Codol et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Galea et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guitart-Masip et al., 2014</xref>), inhibition versus movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guitart-Masip et al., 2014</xref>), contingency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>), expectation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lowet et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>), urgency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Poscente et al., 2021</xref>), or agency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parvin et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we focused on contingent rewarding outcomes, in which participants have agency over the returns they obtain, and with an expectation component since potential for returns is indicated at the start of each trial (see Results and Methods sections).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We first assessed feedback gain and latency for the SLR and LLR, which are the fastest feedback responses observed in human limb motor control. The SLR corrects the limb position against mechanical perturbations regardless of task information, whereas the LLR integrates goal-dependent information into its correction following a mechanical perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Weiler et al., 2016</xref>). Participants were seated in front of a robotic device that supported their arm against gravity and allowed for movement in a horizontal plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). They positioned their index fingertip at a starting position while countering a +2 N·m background load (dashed arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) to activate the elbow and shoulder extensor muscles. We recorded electromyographic (EMG) signals using surface electrodes placed over the brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major (clavicular head), posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii (short head). After participants held their hand in the starting position for 150–200 ms, a 10 cm radius target appeared at 20° either inward (closer to the chest) or outward (away from the chest) with respect to the elbow joint. Next, a ±2 N·m torque perturbation was generated by the robot about the elbow and shoulder joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). A positive or negative torque signifies an inward or an outward perturbation from the starting position, respectively. Participants were instructed to move their fingertip into the target as soon as possible after the perturbation occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). That is, the perturbation acted as a cue to quickly move the hand into the displayed target. This yielded a 2×2 factorial design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), in which an inward or outward perturbation was associated with an inward or outward target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>). In the present study, we will refer to this task as the ‘In-Out Target’ task. Different contrasts allowed us to assess the SLR and LLR within this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Results for the SLR contrast.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the apparatus from a top view.

For rewarded trials, the monetary gains were proportional to the time spent inside the end target, therefore promoting faster reaches (see Materials and methods) because trial duration was fixed.</p><p>Feedback latency and gain were assessed by measuring when the EMG signal diverged between those two conditions, and the magnitude of the EMG signal following this divergence, respectively.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The SLR remained similar in rewarded and non-rewarded conditions</title><p>The SLR can be assessed by contrasting the trials with an inward perturbation versus those with an outward perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and d</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> shows trials falling in these categories for a typical participant. Note that the trials for which the target is in the direction of the perturbation were excluded from this visualization for clarity, but in practice they are included in the analyses and their inclusion or exclusion does not have a significant impact on the results. Before comparing the impact of rewarding context on feedback responses, we tested whether behavioral performance improved with reward by comparing movement times (MTs) expressed (see Statistical analysis for details). To do so, we compared each participant’s median MTs in the trials corresponding to the conditions of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) with a rewarding context to those with a non-rewarding context and compared them using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Indeed, median MTs were faster during rewarded trials than in non-rewarded ones (<italic>W</italic>=136, <italic>r</italic>=1, <italic>p</italic>=4.38e−4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f</xref>).</p><p>The contrast successfully produced a clear divergence in EMG response between an inward and outward perturbation at the triceps (<italic>triceps lateralis</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). This divergence is due to the geometry of the movement induced by the position of the targets and the direction of the background load (elbow flexion/extension against a background load that pre-loads the triceps). In comparison, other muscles such as the brachioradialis are not expected to diverge for the movements considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>). This highlights the methodological approach that we will consistently take across experiments: we design the geometrical layout of the two conditions we contrast to create a divergence of triceps EMG signal when the feedback response of interest arises, and take advantage of this divergence to compute a clear estimate of the feedback latency using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) signal discrimination method (see Statistical analysis for details; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>). Because other muscles will not diverge, response latency cannot be assessed using these muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Once latency is determined, we can compute the feedback gains for each of the five muscles in a time window following the response onset (i.e., the latency) for each participant. Specifically, feedback gains were defined as the difference between integrated EMG in the two contrasted conditions for each muscle during a 50 ms time window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i</xref>; see Statistical analysis). Note that for the SLR only, we used a 25 ms time window to avoid overlap with the LLR response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>). In the figures, we show the log-ratio <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mi>G</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> of these gains between rewarded and non-rewarded conditions, meaning a positive number indicates an increase in feedback gain for the rewarded conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>).</p><p>For all muscles, we observed no difference in feedback gains following the onset of the SLR (biceps: <italic>W</italic>=78, <italic>r</italic>=0.57, <italic>p</italic>=0.61; triceps: <italic>W</italic>=81, <italic>r</italic>=0.6, <italic>p</italic>=0.5; deltoid: <italic>W</italic>=76, <italic>r</italic>=0.56, <italic>p</italic>=0.68; pectoralis: <italic>W</italic>=83, <italic>r</italic>=0.61, <italic>p</italic>=0.44; brachioradialis: <italic>W</italic>=80, <italic>r</italic>=0.59, <italic>p</italic>=0.53; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2j</xref>). Next, we assessed the time of divergence of each participant’s EMG activity between inward and outward perturbation conditions using a ROC signal discrimination method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2k</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>). We performed this analysis on the rewarded and non-rewarded trials separately, yielding two latencies per participant. Latencies for the SLR in the non-rewarded conditions were in the 25 ms range post-perturbation, and latencies in the rewarded conditions were in a similar range as well, with no significant difference observed (<italic>W</italic>=70.5, <italic>r</italic>=0.52, <italic>p</italic>=0.57; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2l</xref>).

We tested the effect of reward on this feedback response in a ‘Target Selection’ task, which used the same apparatus and layout as the In-Out task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). In that task, participants were instructed to select a target based on the direction of a mechanical perturbation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

In the other half of trials, only one target was displayed, and participants were instructed to reach to that target following perturbation onset, bypassing the need for any ‘selection’ process (brown trajectories).

The consensus is that reaction times are reduced when reward is available. However, previous work always considered reaction times triggered by non-proprioceptive cues, such as auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Douglas and Parry, 1983</xref>) or visual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stillings et al., 1968</xref>).

A go cue was provided in the form of a small flexion perturbation at the shoulder, which led to less than 1° of shoulder or elbow rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>). Participants were instructed to perform a fast elbow extension toward a target (10 cm radius) when they detected the go cue. While this experimental design is similar to the LLR contrast used in the In-Out Target experiment, a key distinction differentiates them. In the proprioception-cued reaction time task, the movement to perform can be anticipated and prepared for, while for the LLR the movement to perform depended on the direction of perturbation, which is unknown until the movement starts. Specifically, in the LLR, a perturbation toward or away from the target requires a stopping action to avoid overshooting or a counteraction to overcome the perturbation and reach the target, respectively. Therefore, the behaviour we are assessing in the reaction time task represents an initiation of a prepared action, rather than an online goal-dependent correction like the LLR.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Results for the Reaction Time tasks.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of task design for Proprioception-cued Reaction Times.

The reproduction of this pattern both in vision and proprioception hints at a mechanism that occurs across sensory domains. Likely, the usual latencies of the fastest feedback loops are constrained by transmission delays. For instance, electrophysiological recordings in monkeys show that proprioceptive information for the LLR takes about 20 ms to reach the primary sensory cortex, and a response traveling back downward would take an additional 20 ms, explaining most of the ~50 ms latencies generally observed for this feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheney and Fetz, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Omrani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pruszynski et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, the LLR has little room for latency improvements beyond transmission delays. This is well illustrated in the Proprioception-cued Reaction Time task, which holds similarities with the task used to quantify the LLR but with a smaller mechanical perturbation. Despite this similarity, latencies were reduced in the Proprioception-cued Reaction Time task, possibly because the physiological lower limit of transmission delays is much below typical reaction times.</p><p>As we move toward slower feedback loops, additional information processing steps take place centrally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carroll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nashed et al., 2014</xref>), which contributes to overall latencies. For instance, the Target Selection and Reaction Time tasks require accumulation of sensorimotor and/or cognitive evidence for selecting an action or triggering movement initiation, respectively. The time course of these processes can vary depending on urgency, utility, and value of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez-Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reddi and Carpenter, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Steverson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thorpe and Fabre-Thorpe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we propose that a rewarding context leads to a reduction in latencies only for the feedback loops relying on online accumulation of sensorimotor and cognitive information, which benefit from that rewarding context. Conversely, typical latencies of the faster feedback loops cannot be shortened because transmission delays cannot be reduced below certain physiological values, regardless of the presence or absence of reward.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Increase in feedback gains through anticipatory pre-modulation</title><p>Unlike transmission delays, the strength of feedback responses can be modulated before movement occurrence, that is, during motor planning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graaf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Selen et al., 2012</xref>), which we will refer to as anticipatory pre-modulation here. For instance, the gain of the LLR response can vary due to anticipatory cognitive processes such as probabilistic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckley et al., 1991</xref>) and verbal instructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hammond, 1956</xref>) provided before the start of a trial. We propose that this capacity to pre-modulate feedback gains may enable the distinct pattern of reward-driven improvements compared to latency shortenings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Pre-modulation results from preparatory activity, which at the neural level is a change in neural activity prior to movement that will impact the upcoming movement but without producing overt motor activity during the pre-movement period—that is, output-null neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsayed et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). Regarding feedback gain pre-modulation, this means that in the region(s) involved there is an output-null neural activity subspace from which the neural trajectory unfolding from the upcoming movement will respond differently to a perturbation. Importantly, not all preparatory activity will yield a modulation of feedback gain, or even task-dependent modulation at all. An extreme example of this distinction is the spinal circuitry, where preparatory activity is observed but does not necessarily translate into task-dependent modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prut and Fetz, 1999</xref>). This is also consistent with our result, as we observe no change in feedback gain with reward in the SLR.</p><p>A corollary to our proposal is that feedback loops that do not show increased feedback gains with reward would also more generally not be susceptible to gain pre-modulation like that which occurs in the LLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graaf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Takei et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zonnino et al., 2021</xref>). A task in our study that is suited to test this possibility is the Cursor Jump task, because it does not show feedback gain modulation, while the Target Jump task, which has a very similar design, does. Therefore, one could consider a probabilistic version of these tasks in which the probability of a jump in each direction is manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis, and participants are informed before each trial of the associated probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Selen et al., 2012</xref>). Previous work shows that this manipulation successfully modulates the LLR feedback gain of the upcoming trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckley et al., 1991</xref>). Given our hypothesis, it should pre-modulate the feedback gain following a target jump, but not following a cursor jump, because the absence of reward-driven feedback gain modulation would indicate the circuitry involved is not susceptible to anticipatory pre-modulation.</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no evidence that a neuroanatomical region’s capacity for pre-modulation of feedback gains will depend on the transmission delay of its somatosensory afferents. Rather, this capacity is likely dependent on the nature of the information made available locally by bottom-up and/or top-down input drive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Remington et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Seki and Fetz, 2012</xref>). Therefore, an important consequence of our proposal above is that there should be no central compensation mechanism taking place, that is, we should not expect feedback gains of a feedback loop to increase because latencies cannot be reduced. Feedback gains increasing before latencies are reduced may simply occur because it is easier, when possible, to have faster responses via pre-modulation, because it is done before the perturbation occurrence in the first place.</p><p>We hypothesize above that improved capacity to accumulate sensorimotor and cognitive evidence may underpin reduction in latencies for the feedback loops that rely on such process. It is unclear whether this improvement is due to improved processing of information online, or if it also stems from pre-modulation even before the accumulation of evidence starts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sohn et al., 2019</xref>). In the latter case, a possibility is that changes in feedback gains and reduction in latency co-occur due to the similar nature of the pre-modulation process involved.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>A behavioral classification based on sensory domain and response latency</title><p>Several categorization schemes have been used in the literature to sort the large variety of feedback loops involved in feedback control: by typical response latency, by function, or by sensory modality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forgaard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pruszynski and Scott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Scott, 2016</xref>). From our results, categorizing feedback loops by typical latency range appears to be sensible, at least in the context of our observations, and potentially as a general principle. Unsurprisingly, categorization by sensory modality is relevant as well, not only because latency range is impacted by sensory modality, but also because the pathways, neural regions, and mechanisms involved are fundamentally distinct across modalities.</p><p>This leaves categorization by function (color-coded legend box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) outstanding, as it does not match any observed pattern here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This is surprising, as categorization by function is a behavioral classification, and so one may expect it to yield greater explanatory power to interpret results of a behavioral, descriptive set of experiments like we report here. Therefore, while it may have value at a higher-order level of interpretation, our results suggest that a categorization of feedback loops based on function may not always be the most appropriate means of characterizing feedback control loops. This may partially stem from the inherent arbitrariness of defining function and assigning a specific task to that function. In contrast, categorization based on neural pathways, neural regions involved, and sensory modality may result in more insightful interpretations, because they are biologically grounded, and therefore objective means of categorization. More generally, our results provide additional evidence in favor of a bottom-up approach to understanding sensorimotor feedback control as opposed to a top-down approach based on a functional taxonomy. This approach is described as early as Sherrington (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burke, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sherrington, 1906</xref>), who put forward an organizational principle of the central nervous system tied to sensory receptor properties (extero-, proprio-, intero-ceptors, and distance-receptors). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Loeb, 2012</xref> proposed that the existence of an optimal high-order, engineering-like control design in the central nervous system is unlikely due to the constraints of biological organisms, a theory further detailed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cisek, 2019</xref> from an evolutionary perspective.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for optimal feedback control</title><p>The optimal feedback control (OFC) framework is a commonly used theoretical framework for explaining how movement is controlled centrally and producing behavioral predictions based on its core principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miyashita, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott, 2012</xref>). One such principle is that feedback gains may be tuned according to a cost function to produce optimal control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Todorov, 2004</xref>). The results we report here generally agree with this principle, because we do observe modulation of feedback gains as we manipulate expectation of reward (and so expected cost of movement). However, to our knowledge, previous OFC implementations do not distinguish between individual feedback loops in that regard, that is, it is assumed that any feedback loop can adjust their gains to optimize the cost function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Todorov, 2005</xref>). Our results suggest that not all feedback loops respond in this way, and that the OFC framework’s explanatory power may benefit from distinguishing between the loops that adjust their gains with reward, and those which do not.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>General considerations</title><p>While SLR circuitry is contained within the spinal cord, it receives supraspinal modulation and displays functional sensitivity to higher-order task goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crone and Nielsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nielsen and Kagamihara, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Prut and Fetz, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Weiler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Weiler et al., 2021</xref>).

Therefore, while unlikely, central modulation of SLR circuitry for rewarding outcomes during motor control could not be a priori ruled out.

Based on our observations, we propose that (1) reduction of latencies with reward is mainly dictated by neural transmission delays and the involvement (or lack) of central processes in the loop considered, and (2) increase of feedback gains with reward may be the result of central pre-modulation. We also argue against a ‘top-down’ classification of feedback loops based on function, and in favor of a ‘bottom-up’ classification based on neural pathways and regions involved. Finally, we propose potential refinements to apply to the OFC framework based on our results.</p><p>Together with previous work showing reduction in peripheral noise with reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Codol et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Manohar et al., 2019</xref>), the results presented here enable us to further complete the picture on how rewarding information triggers improvements in motor performance at the behavioral level.

In all cases, the participant was seated in front of a horizontally placed mirror that blocked vision of the participant’s arm and reflected a screen above so that visual stimuli appeared in the same plane as the arm. EMG activity of brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major, posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii was recorded using wired surface electrodes (Bagnoli, Delsys, Natick, MA).

Pilot tests using an accelerometer fixed on the distal KINARM boom showed that logged perturbation timestamps corresponding to the onset of commanded robot torque preceded the acceleration of the distal end of the robot linkage by 4 ms. Perturbation timestamps were adjusted accordingly for the analysis of experimental data.

At the beginning of each trial, a 3 mm radius start position appeared, along with a reward sign below the target showing ‘000’ or ‘$$$’ to indicate a non-rewarded or a rewarded trial, respectively. The start position was located so that the participant’s external shoulder angle was 45° relative to the left-right axis (parallel to their torso), and the external elbow angle was 90° relative to the upper arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). When participants moved the cursor inside the start position the cursor disappeared. It reappeared if the participant exited the start position before the perturbation onset. After the cursor remained inside the start position for 150–200 ms, a background torque (+2 N·m) ramped up linearly in 500 ms at the shoulder and elbow to activate the extensor muscles. Then, following another 150–200 ms delay, a 10 cm radius target appeared either at +20 or –20° from the start position (rotated about the elbow joint). Following target appearance and after a 600 ms delay during which we assessed baseline EMG activity for that trial (referred to as ‘trial baseline’ throughout the text), the robot applied a ±2 N·m perturbation torque at the elbow and shoulder joints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). This combination of load on the shoulder and elbow was chosen to create pure elbow motion, as the robot torque applied at the shoulder counteracted the interaction torque arising at the shoulder due to elbow rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Maeda et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maeda et al., 2020</xref>). Because the time interval between the onset of the visual target and the onset of the perturbation was fixed, we tested for anticipatory triceps EMG activity in a 20 ms window immediately before the perturbation onset.

The trial schedule was organized in epochs of 16 trials containing two of each combination of conditions, and the trial order was randomized within each epoch.</p><p>For EMG analysis, inward and outward perturbations were used as the contrast to observe the SLR on extensor muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).

First, the background loads were applied to the elbow only, and only outward targets were presented, so that the task consisted of elbow extension movements only. The starting position was located such that the external shoulder angle was 45° relative to the left-right axis, and the external elbow angle was 70° relative to the upper limb. The end target was located at a shoulder and elbow angle of 45°. The perturbation was applied only at the shoulder instead of both shoulder and elbow joints, and the perturbation magnitude was reduced to 0.5 N·m, to ensure that the perturbation led to no significant elbow motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, the perturbation time was jittered in a 600–1000 ms window following the target appearance (random uniform distribution). This window was used to measure baseline EMG activity for that trial (referred to as ‘trial baseline’ throughout the text). Participants were informed to initiate a movement to the target as fast as possible following the shoulder perturbation. MTs were defined as the time interval from the perturbation occurrence to entering the end target, regardless of velocity. They performed 27 epochs of 2 rewarded and 2 non-rewarded trials randomly interleaved, resulting in a total of 108 trials per participant.

At the beginning of each trial, an 8 mm radius start position was displayed at a shoulder and elbow angle of 35° and 65°, respectively, and below it a reward sign showing ‘000’ or ‘$$$’to indicate a non-rewarded or a rewarded trial, respectively. At the same time, a 2 cm radius target appeared at a 55° shoulder angle and same elbow angle as the start position (65°). This yields a reaching movement that consists of a 20° shoulder flexion with the same elbow angle throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7b</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Participants moved the cursor inside the start position, and after 200 ms, +2 N·m shoulder and elbow background torques ramped up linearly in 500 ms. Participants held the cursor inside the start position for 600–700 ms (random uniform distribution), during which baseline EMG activity for that trial was measured (referred to as ‘trial baseline’ throughout the text). Following this, the end target appeared. Participants were instructed to reach as fast as possible to that end target, and that their MT would define their monetary return on ‘$$$’ trials but not ‘000’ trials. They were informed that reaction times were not considered into the calculation of the return. Movement duration was defined as the time interval between exiting the start position and when the cursor was inside the target and its tangential velocity dropped below 10 cm/s. Once these conditions were met, the target turned dark blue, the reward sign was extinguished, and the final monetary return for the trial appeared where the reward sign was located before. In the Target Jump task, during the reach when the cursor crossed past the (invisible) 45° shoulder angle line, the target jumped to ±10° elbow angle from its original position or stayed at its original position (no-jump), with all three possibilities occurring with equal frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). In the Cursor Jump task, the cursor position rather than the target jumped to ±10° elbow angle or did not jump.</p><p>Monetary return was given using the same equation as for the Proprioception-cued Reaction Time task, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula>. The parameters used for each condition were calibrated using pilot data to ensure similar average returns and variance across conditions within participants. The values used are provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Both the target and cursor jumps consisted of 312 trials in one block, equally divided between rewarded and non-rewarded trials, and outward jump, inward jump, and no-jump trials in a 2×3 design. The trial schedule was organized in epochs of 12 trials containing two of each combination of conditions, and the trial order was randomized within each epoch.</p><p>For EMG analysis, flexion and extension jumps were contrasted to assess the visuomotor feedback response. No-jump conditions were not used for EMG analysis. All EMG signals were aligned to a photodiode signal recording the appearance of a white 8 mm radius target at the same time as the jump occurrence. The photodiode target was positioned on the screen horizontally 25 cm to the right from the starting position and vertically at the same position as the cursor jumping position (in the Cursor Jump task) or as the target position (Target Jump task). This target was covered by the photodiode sensor and was therefore not visible to participants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Target Selection task</title><p>The position of participants’ right index fingertip was indicated by a white 3 mm radius cursor. At the beginning of each trial, a 3 mm radius start position appeared, and a reward sign showing ‘000’ or ‘$$$’ was displayed to indicate a non-rewarded or a rewarded trial, respectively. The start position was located so that the external shoulder angle was 45° relative to the left-right axis, and the external elbow angle was 90° relative to the upper arm. When participants moved the cursor inside the start position the cursor disappeared. It reappeared if the cursor exited the start position before the target(s) appeared. Once inside the start position, the robot applied +2 N·m background torques which were ramped up linearly in 500 ms at the shoulder and elbow to activate the extensor muscles. Then, following a delay of 400–500 ms, a 7 cm radius target appeared at +30° (inward) from the start position (rotated about the elbow joint). In half of trials, a second, identical target also appeared at –30° (outward) from the start position. A jittered 600–1000 ms window followed target appearance, during which baseline EMG activity for that trial was measured. After this, a +2 or –2 N·m perturbation at the shoulder and elbow joints pushed participants away from the start position. Positive and negative perturbations occurred evenly in one- and two-targets trials, yielding a 2×2 task design. For one-target trials, participants were instructed to reach as fast as possible to the target available once the perturbation was applied. For two-target trials, participants were instructed to reach as fast as possible to the target opposite to the perturbation. For example, if the perturbation resulted in an inward push, then the participant should go to the outward target. Therefore, this task design resulted in a co-occurrence of the target selection and divergence of triceps EMG activity compared to one-target trials, enabling us to assess the feedback response that underlies selection of the goal target.</p><p>When the (correct) end target was reached, the target(s) turned dark blue, the reward sign was extinguished, and the final monetary return for the trial appeared where the reward sign was located before. For non-rewarded trials, this was always ‘0 ¢’ and for rewarded trials, the return was higher for shorter MTs. MTs were defined as the time interval from the perturbation occurrence to entering the (correct) end target, regardless of velocity. The monetary return equation was identical to that of the reaction time task, with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>15</mml:mn></mml:math></inline-formula> and the other parameters as provided in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>. These parameters were calibrated using pilot data to ensure similar average returns and variance across conditions within participants.</p><p>The task consisted of 224 trials and was divided into two blocks with a free-duration break time between each block. Each block consisted of 112 trials, equally divided between one- and two-targets trials, inward and outward perturbation trials, and rewarded and non-rewarded trials. The trial schedule was organized in epochs of 16 trials containing two of each combination of conditions, and the trial order was randomized within each epoch.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EMG signal processing</title><p>For each experiment, the EMG signals of the brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major (clavicular head), posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii (short head) were sampled at 1000 Hz, band-pass filtered between 20 and 250 Hz, and then full-wave rectified. Before each task, participants’ EMG signal was acquired by asking participants to position their arm such that the cursor remained, motionless, at the start position for 2 s (against the background load, if applicable for the task). This was repeated four times, after which the task started normally. Following band-pass filtering and full-wave rectification, the EMG signal of each muscle from 250 ms after entering the start position to 250 ms before the end of the 2 s window was concatenated across all four trials and averaged to obtain a normalization scalar for EMG signals. EMG measures during the task were then normalized by each muscle’s normalization scalar. Follow-up analyses (latency, feedback gains) were performed subsequently on the filtered, full wave rectified and normalized EMG traces.</p><p>For all experimental designs using a mechanical perturbation, trial baseline EMG activity was measured in a 50 ms window from 350 to 300 ms before displacement onset, while participants were at rest, background loads were applied, and after targets and reward context were provided. For the Target Jump and Cursor Jump tasks, this was measured in a 50 ms window from 350 to 300 ms before target appearance instead of before displacement onset because movements were self-initiated, and displacements occurred during the movement. However, the same target was displayed in every condition at the start of a given trial in those two experimental paradigms. For all experiments, the trial baseline EMG signals are displayed on a left axis next to the axis showing perturbation-aligned EMG signals. Note that these trial baseline EMG signals are distinct from the four trials described above in this section, which were done before the task started and were used to compute normalization scalars for EMG signals. The trial baseline EMG signals were not used for EMG normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To determine the time at which EMG signals for different task conditions diverged, we used ROC analysis. We used the same approach as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref>, using a 25–75% threshold of area under the curve (AUC) for establishing signal discrimination. The threshold was considered reached if two consecutive samples were greater than the threshold value. Discrimination was done for each participant and each reward condition independently, using all trials available for each contrast without averaging. Once the AUC threshold was crossed, we performed a segmented linear regression on the AUC before it crossed the 25–75% threshold. We minimized the sums-of-squared residuals to find the inflexion point, that is, where the two segments of the segmented linear regression form an angle (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiler et al., 2015</xref> and the analysis code online for details).</p><p>To compute feedback gains, for each feedback response considered, we defined a 50 ms window that started at that response’s latency found for each participant independently using ROC analysis. For the SLR contrast only, we constrained that window to a 25 ms width instead of 50 ms to avoid overlap with the LLR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>). We then calculated the integral of average EMG signals in that window using the trapezoid rule (MATLAB’s built-in <italic>trapz</italic> function), for each contrasted condition and each reward value. For instance, for the Target Selection task, the contrasted conditions were trials with an inard perturbation and only one target (no switch), and trials with an inward perturbation and two targets (switch occurring). We then calculated the absolute difference between those two conditions as a measure of feedback gains. We then calculated the log-ratio of the rewarded to non-rewarded conditions as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> . We used ratios to ensure that changes in feedback gains are normalized within participants to EMG activity in the non-rewarded condition. The log function was then applied to linearize the ratio values.</p><p>Using a fixed time window to assess feedback gains would allow for a potential confound. If the response onset (latency) is reduced with reward, by definition the EMG signal would be shifted closer to the perturbation onset. Therefore, if the time window used for feedback gains remained in an identical position with respect to the perturbation onset, this is equivalent to assessing feedback gains later with respect to the response onset. From the resulting estimation of feedback gains, one could spuriously conclude that feedback gains are increased with reward, when the gains are merely assessed further away from the response onset, where the EMG signal had more time to diverge.</p><p>MTs were defined as the time between the occurrence of the mechanical perturbation being applied and entering the end target in the proprioceptive tasks (In-Out task, Target Selection task, and Proprioception-cued Reaction Time task). They were defined as the time between leaving the starting position and being in the end target with a radial velocity of less than 10 cm/s in the visual tasks.</p><p>For the Proprioception-cued Reaction Times task, reaction times were defined as when the (processed) triceps EMG signal rose 3 standard deviations above the trial baseline level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pruszynski et al., 2008</xref>) for 5 ms in a row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Trials for which the triceps EMG did not meet that criterion were discarded. This represented 91 out of 1836 trials (4.9%). Feedback gains were then estimated using the same technique as for the other tasks, using the reaction time as the starting position for the integral window.</p><p>To test for differences between conditions we used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Sensorimotor feedback loops are selectively sensitive to reward&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor (Rich Ivry). The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jeroen BJ Smeets (Reviewer #2); Stephen H Scott (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. All reviewers think that systematic evaluation of different feedback processes that are impacted by reward is meaningful and timely for the area of perception and action. However, the reviewers also raised some major concerns that prevent the paper from being considered further.</p><p>Specifically, the following two concerns have been raised by reviewers unanimously. 1) The experiments used inconsistent reward function, which affects the acceptance of the paper's general conclusion; 2) The experimental design did not stick to a simple comparison between reward vs. no reward but included confounds other than the availability of reward, especially for the target switch experiment. Given that the study is descriptive without a prior hypothesis and its ambitious goal to comprehensively examine the feedback control in the continuum of feedback latency, we have to caution about the link between the data and the conclusion.</p><p>All reviewers' comments and suggestions are attached below. We hope you will find them helpful in furthering your pursuit of the topic.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>How reinforcement impacts motor performance is an active research area that interests many. However, various movement paradigms have been used with various manipulations of reward or punishment. The current study constitutes a timely effort to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying diverse findings in the area. The strength of the paper is that the tasks involving increasingly response latencies are implemented in a single upper-arm experimental setup. The two fastest responses, slow-latency reflex (SLR) and long-latency reflex (LLR), are beautifully examined with a single perturbation scheme. Their related findings are also convincing: SLR was largely unaffected by reward, but the LLR showed a reward-induced increase in EEG gain. The findings that simple reaction time and choice reaction time tasks were improved with reward are replicates of previous research, though the reaction time condition is implemented with a proprioceptive cue here instead of the common visual or auditory cues. However, the other three conditions, i.e., target switch, target jump, and cursor jump, did not yield any behavioral improvements by reward.</p><p>My major concern is whether the findings of either presence or absence of reward effect are generalizable and whether uncontrolled confounds can explain them. Note the current paper did not have any prior hypotheses for different conditions; thus, we need to scrutinize the supporting evidence for the conclusions. The study's strength is that diverse upper-arm movement perturbation paradigms are used and systematically varied in response latency, but the weakness also comes with this kind of study design. Each condition used a specific instantiation of each type of feedback control but differed in various factors besides the feedback loops involved. For example, the reward did not improve the performance in the target jump condition but improved the movement time in the target switch condition (though no EMG changes, see below). However, these two conditions had different reward functions, one for minimizing the movement time (MT) and reaction time (RT) but the other for minimizing the deviation from desired movement time. Furthermore, movement directions and muscles examined (brachioradialis vs. pectoralis) differ and probably affect the EMG response that is used for quantifying the reward effect.</p><p>Similarly, the cursor jump condition, with a slightly longer latency than the target jump condition but again with a reward function for desired MT, yielded no reward effect either. It makes people wonder whether other task designs would produce the opposite effect on EMG. For example, would the timing and the size of the cursor jump make a difference? What if we reward fast reaction as opposed to maintaining desired movement time in these conditions?</p><p>The conditions with significant reward effect are mostly those rewarding faster RT and/or MT; the ones rewarding desired movement time generally returns a null effect. The only exception is the target switching condition, which rewards fast MT and shows no reward effect. However, the target switch perturbation is associated with a peculiar instruction: once perturbed, the participants were required to relax their arms and let the perturbation push them toward the target and stop there. Relaxing while stopping at a target might conflict with the rewarding goal to move fast. Besides the instruction differences, the conditions drastically differ in muscles examined, movement amplitude/timing and etc. These differences make the conclusions, based on a single specific instantiation of each feedback control paradigm (using the taxonomy by Stephen 2006), debatable.</p><p>Relatedly, the lack of reward effect in the target switch, cursor jump, and target jump conditions is taken as evidence that feedback responses that rely on sensorimotor and premotor cortices are not modulated by reward, but those relying on prefrontal cortices are. However, it is not clear to me why the LLR condition involves prefrontal associative cortices, but the target jump condition does not. I did not find a discussion of this selective involvement of brain regions either. Given the concern that the specific task designs might cause those null effects, it might be premature to draw this conclusion.</p><p>The second major concern is whether analyzing a single muscle adequately captures the perturbation effect and the reward effect. For example, the reward improved the performance in the target jump condition (figure 3g), but there is no EMG difference. This has been attributed to other feedback responses that may not be apparent with the task contrast here. But looking at Figure 3J, there is no EMG activity difference between the reward and the control conditions whatsoever. Then, how can the immediate result of EMG, i.e., the movement time, differ between conditions? Is it possible that the muscle activity examined is not relevant enough for the task? This relates to a methodological issue: is the null effect of EMG response to reward caused by the selection of muscles for analysis? For example, the target and cursor jump conditions select the pectoralis muscle only, and thus only leftward target jumps and right cursor jumps are used for analysis. This is reasonable as the pectoralis muscle directly relates to these perturbation directions, but these perturbations probably cause changes in other muscles that are not examined.

The authors' aim is to answer the question &quot;which of the nested sensorimotor feedback loops that underly motor performance is/are affected by expected reward.?&quot;</p><p>The authors provide a large set of experimental conditions and show that their manipulation of the reward affects the response to some of the perturbations.</p><p>A major weakness is that the paper lacks a clear hypothesis on how reward would affect the feedback loops. There are several possibilities. It could speed up the information processing, increase the gain, etc. Without a clear hypothesis, it is unclear what the differences are one should be looking for. The authors instead perform a fishing expedition and look for any difference.</p><p>A second major weakness is that the conditions differ not only in the aspect that is presented as the reason for performing the task but also in several additional aspects. For instance, the paper contains two reaction time tasks. One is based on visual input, the other on proprioceptive input. However, the visual one is also a choice reaction time, whereas the proprioceptive one is not. The most serious variation is that what the authors reward differs between the experiments. For instance, performance in the target-switch condition is rewarded for short movement times whereas small deviations from the desired movement time are rewarded in the target-jump condition. In other conditions, the reward is based on time-in-target. So, any difference between the experiments might be due to this difference in reward criterion.</p><p>A third major weakness is that the authors use 'feedback' for aspects of control that are feedforward. Feedback control refers to the use of sensory information to guide the effector to the target. However, switching to another target (second experiment) is a decision process (selecting the goal), and is not related to reaching the target. It is unclear how this relates to the &quot;target jump&quot; condition, which can be interpreted as resulting from feedback control.</p><p>A fourth major weakness is that the analysis (or the written report of it) is sometimes confusing. For instance, the authors use terminology R1, R2, R3 as defined by Pruszynski et al. (2008). They don't report the definitions themselves (e.g.: R2 corresponds to 45-75 ms after the perturbation). Despite explicitly citing this paper, they don't seem to use these definitions. Instead, they redefine them as &quot;R2 and R3 epochs were taken as the first 25 ms.… after each participant's LLR latency&quot;. By using this flexible definition of epochs, the epoch is not an independent variable anymore.</p><p>A fifth major weakness is that it is unclear in the SL/LL experiment whether the stimulus (the stretch of the muscle) is affected by the reward, as the mechanical stiffness of the muscle might have been affected by the expected reward (e.g. by co-contraction).</p><p>There are at the moment some conflicting views on the relationship between reward and motor variability and learning. Well-designed experiments would be able to help to advance the field here. As the authors varied much more between the experiments than only the loop involved, they have not convinced me that the differences they report are indeed related to differences in how expected reward affects the nested sensorimotor feedback loops.</p><p>Using page numbers would have facilitated feedback</p><p>Title: In my understanding, it should contain &quot;expected&quot; rewards, as the responses that are investigated occur before the reward is provided.</p><p>&quot;a 10 cm target appeared at 20 degrees&quot; Use comparable units (all degrees or all cm) and clarify whether the size is radius or diameter.</p><p>A figure explaining the time-course of a trial might be helpful.</p><p>&quot;an inward&quot; Better use &quot;(counter-)clockwise&quot;</p><p>In several captions it is mentioned: &quot;The left panels show EMG at trial baseline (see methods)&quot;, but in the methods, there is no mention of &quot;trial baseline&quot;.

Is the scalar subtracted, expressed in multiples of baseline activity? And are the plotted signals those after normalising?</p><p>It is unclear how latencies and reaction times are determined. There are many options for this, and the results of the analyses of latencies depend critically on which options are chosen.</p><p>&quot;Conversely, the LLR arose.… (LLR not occurring, Figure 2c).&quot; This is not my interpretation. In both cases, an LLR is present, in one case much stronger than in the other. Secondly, the effect of the task is not present at the onset of the LLR, but starts at a moment the LLR has already started. The authors refer to this latter time as the latency, but the figure shows a clear SL and the onset of the LL, which is clearly before the effect kicks in.</p><p>Figure 2: explain graphically what continuous and dashed lines signify, and green/purple. I can't follow panel d: In my understanding, SLR and LLR are determined by subtracting data from within the same experiment in a different way.

I miss a discussion of how behaviour can be improved by expected reward with such little changes in the underlying sensorimotor control. A last item that could be discussed is that reward might affect behaviour not only by expected reward but also through a learning mechanism, so the (lack of) reward will affect the trial after the (lack of) reward.</p><p>References</p><p>Brenner E, Smeets JBJ (2003) Fast corrections of movements with a computer mouse.

Previous studies highlight how reward impacts motor function. Given feedback is an important aspect of motor control, it is useful to know which feedback responses may be specifically impacted or altered by reward.</p><p>A clear strength of the manuscript is the systematic evaluation of different feedback processes reflecting different latencies and behavioural contexts to initiate a response. These differences reflect differences in the underlying neural circuitry involved in each of these feedback processes. Examination on how reward impacts each of these processes using similar techniques and approach provides a comprehensive examination on how reward impact feedback responses and a much cleaner overview of the problem, rather than a fractured examination if explored over many separate studies.</p><p>The manuscript uses a functional taxonomy suggested by Scott (2016) to define the behavioural contexts examined in the paper. In most cases, the experimental paradigms match these taxonomies. However, some confusion seems to occur for responses elicited at ~50ms following mechanical disturbances which includes two distinct types: 1) goal-directed online control and 2) triggered reactions. These two conditions are behaviourally quite different as the former maintains the same goal before and after the disturbance, whereas the latter switches the behavioural goal, and thus, feedback responses are now set to a new spatial goal. Triggered reactions are examined in the present study, but it is assumed that this reflects goal-directed online control (the former). Thus, responses at ~50ms can reflect substantially different behavioural conditions (and likely processes) and these distinctions should be recognized.</p><p>I think the simplest approach for quantifying the impact of reward on corrective responses is to compare corrective responses in a single condition with and without reward. However, the manuscript used paired behavoural conditions to look at the difference in EMG between contexts and then identify if this EMG difference changes between rewarded and non-rewarded trials. This makes the material more complex to understand and follow. Admittedly, the use of this EMG difference between conditions works well if reward should increase a response for one context and decrease it in the other. For example, target jumps to the left compared to the right increase pectoralis activity for the leftward jump and decrease for the right jump. Reward should enhance both of these reciprocal responses (increase the first and/or decrease the latter) and thus lead to a larger EMG difference for rewarded trials. So this contrast approach makes sense in that experiment. However, the contrast for goal-tracking (actually should be called goal-switching) experiment contrasts the switching goal condition with a control condition in which corrective responses were generated to the original spatial goal. In this situation, both contexts could show an increase in EMG with reward, and in fact, that appears to be the case shown in Figure 3e (top panel shows both conditions have a slight increase in EMG for rewarded trials). However, by looking at the difference in EMG between conditions, this reward-related activity is removed. I think these two behavioural contexts should be assessed separately. Critically, the baseline condition where corrective responses were generated to the original goal fills the void regarding goal-directed online control mentioned in the previous paragraph that occurs at ~50ms. If there is a significant change in EMG for the goal-directed online control, then it could be used as a contrast for the target switching task to address whether there is any greater increase in EMG response specifically related to target switching.</p><p>I think there is some confusion with regards to some of the functional taxonomy and the experimental paradigms to assess these processes from the functional taxonomy outlined in Scott (2016). Specifically, there are two distinct behavioural processes that occur at ~50ms related to proprioceptive disturbances: there is 1) online control to an ongoing motor action where the behavioural goal remains constant, and 2) triggered reactions to attain a new goal. The present study is the latter and was developed by Pruszynski et al., 2008 (should be cited when describing the experiment) and is really just a spatial version of the classic resist/don't resist paradigm. However, this Target In/Out task is assumed to be the former both in Figure 1 and the text. These are distinct processes as the goal remains constant in the former and switches in the latter. The former is comparable to a cursor jump task where the arm (or cursor) is shifted, but the goal remains the same. I think Figure 1 and the text needs to recognize this distinction as outlined in Scott (2016).</p><p>This distinction between triggered reactions and online control is important as triggered reactions are related to another task examined in this study, proprioception-cued reaction time task. These are essentially the same tasks (disturbance drives onset of next action in Scott 2016), as the only difference between them is the size of the disturbance with triggered reactions using large disturbances leading to responses at ~50ms and small disturbances for reaction time tasks leading to responses starting at ~110ms. These are likely not distinct phenomena, but a continuum with the latency and magnitude likely impacted by the size of the mechanical disturbance, although I don't think it has ever been systematically examined. Critically, they are very similar from a behavioural context perspective. Interestingly, the present study found that reward shortened the latency and increased the magnitude for the proprioceptively cued reaction time task and increased the gain for the triggered reaction, but not the latency likely due to the fact the latter hit transmission limits. The manuscript should recognize the commonality in these behavioural tasks when introducing the tasks. Perhaps these experiments should be grouped together. I think the strategy of the manuscript was to introduce experiments based on their latency, but this creates a bit of an artificial separation for these two tasks.</p><p>It would be useful to add a goal-directed online control experiment to assess EMG responses when reaching to spatial goals with mechanical disturbances with and without reward. This would provide a nice parallel to the experiments examining cursor jumps to explore online control of the limb. Previous work has shown that increases in urgency to respond to a postural perturbation task led to increases in long-latency responses (Crevecouer et al., JNP 2013). Urgency in that study and reward in the present study are related as reward was based on how long individuals remained at the end target which is similar to the need to return faster to the target in Crevecouer et al. There may be specific differences between posture and reaching, but the basic principle of corrective responses to attain or maintain a goal are similar. In fact, you second experiment incorporates a simple goal-directed online control task with mechanical disturbances in the goal-tracking task displayed in 3a. This could be analyzed on its own to fill this void.</p><p>The experimental paradigms use comparisons between two conditions (termed a control and a manipulation condition, in some cases). I'm not entirely sure why they did this as a simpler strategy would be to examine the differences between rewarded and unrewarded trials for a given condition. The logic (and value) may be that multiple feedback processes could be impacted by reward and you wanted to see the incremental change between feedback processes. However, looking at the difference in EMG in the goal-tracking task makes me wonder if the authors missed something. It looks like both the control and manipulation condition show a slight increase in EMG in Figure 3e. However, the statistical test simply looks at the difference in these responses between control and manipulation, and since both show a slight increase for rewarded trials, the difference in EMG removes that increase observed in both signals resulting in no difference between rewarded and non-rewarded trials. I think the control and manipulation conditions should be separated as I don't think they are directly comparable. While lines overlap in the top panel of Figure 3e, it looks like the rewarded trials for the target switch condition may show a reduction in time and an increase in magnitude during the LLR for rewarded trials (the challenges of a dashed line).</p><p>The online control condition from the target switching task (Figure 3a) could be examined on its own. If a contrast design was important, that would require pairing the resistive load with an assistive load, or perhaps loads to deviate hand orthogonal to the target direction to parallel the cursor jump experiment.</p><p>I think it's confusing to frame the first two experiments based on short-latency, long-latency, and slower long-latency. You have provided a clean approach to introduce different feedback processes based on behavioural features of a task (Figure 1). I think you should stick to these behavioural features when describing the experiments and not talk about short-latency, long-latency and slower long-latency when developing the problem and experiments as this confuses the taxonomy based on behaviour with time epochs. As you carefully point out, there are many different layers of feedback processing and so epochs of time may include influences from many pathways and two processes may happen to take the same time (i.e. goal-directed online control and triggered reactions). Further, there are two distinct processes at ~50ms which needs to be clarified and kept distinct. Thus, behavioural context and not time epoch is important to maintain. This is why the later experiments on cursor jump, target jump and choice reaction time are much easier to follow.</p><p>The impact on reward on baseline motor performance is a bit confusing. It is not clear that various statistics of motor performance in the various conditions is related to the baseline movements without disturbances or with disturbances. This may be stated in the methods but should be clearly stated in the main text and legends to avoid confusion.</p><p>I don't think it is useful to talk about goal-tracking responses for experiment 2 as the term tracking is usually reserved for moving targets. I kept re-reading trying to understand how the goal was moving in the task and how the individual was tracking it, but this clearly didn't occur in this experiment! Rather, this task is probably best characterized as goal switching (as stated in methods section). The term slower in the title is also unnecessary and confusing. Again, stick to behavioural features of the task, not time epochs.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Sensorimotor feedback loops are selectively sensitive to reward&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>All reviewers find this paper (or a revised version of the previous submission) a timely effort to study how the motivational factor affects motor control. The methodological improvements are also helpful in addressing previous concerns about consistency across experimental tasks. However, the reviewers converged on two major concerns:</p><p>1) The link between functional tasks and their assumed feedback loops is poorly specified. For example, goal-switching and online action selection appear the same in function. Target jump and cursor jump are also similar. The LLR contrast and the target selection yielded similar latency and had the same sensory input but were treated as involving different feedback loops. The functional taxonomy proposed in Scott 216 paper was not meant to suggest that each functional process was supported by a different &quot;feedback loop.&quot; Thus, we suggest that the introduction should be less conclusive about the functions that the various experimental paradigms address and whether they tap into different or the same feedback loops. Perhaps simply referring to the existence of these paradigms in the introduction is enough for this descriptive research. At the same time, the link between functional tasks and their assumed feedback loops should be discussed more appropriately in the discussion.</p><p>2）The critical methodological problems that might affect the validity of the findings should be addressed. These problems include how the latency is determined (e.g., the need to have other methods to confirm the latency estimation, the need to have a fixed time window), which segment of EMG should be analyzed (e.g., R2 and R3 splitting), and which muscles should be used for analysis (e.g., most analyses based on one muscle though all muscles are monitored; having an arbitrary choice of muscles is a warning sign for p-hacking). These problems are more detailed in Reviewer 3's comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study aims to test whether sensorimotor feedback control is sensitive to motivational factors by testing a series of tasks that presumably rely on different feedback loops. The first strength of the study is that all the feedback control tasks were designed with a unified upper-limb planar movement setting with various confounding factors under control. Its previous submission a year ago had received some major criticisms, mostly about inconsistency across tasks in task goals, analyzed muscles, and reward functions. The new submission has used re-designed experiments to keep consistency across tasks and successfully addressed most, if not all, previous major concerns. As a result, this study gives a more complete picture of how motivation affects feedback control than previous studies that did not scrutinize the feedback loop involved in the task.</p><p>The study found that the fastest feedback loops, both for visual and proprioceptive feedback, are free from the effect of reward in terms of muscle response. The earliest reward-sensitive feedback loop has a latency of about 50ms, depicted by the response to the proprioceptive perturbation. Reduced response latency and increased feedback gains underlie the reward-elicited improvements, but their roles vary across tasks.</p><p>The weakness of the study is that the underlying mechanisms for the heterogenous results are speculative. Though the study included five tasks and one previous dataset, it did not conduct experiments for some tasks, or failed to have electromyography measurements. These tasks include those related to vision-cued reaction time, alternative targets, and choice RT. The incomplete task set might prevent drawing conclusive explanations for the current findings. The theoretical account to explain the increased feedback gain is so-called anticipatory pre-modulation, but this term is unspecified in any detail based on the present findings. Using this account to explain the finding that the cursor jump task (in contrast to the target jump) failed to induce a reward effect in feedback gain, the authors hypothesize that the anticipatory pre-modulation does not work for the cursor jump task since it cannot prime the participants with the probability of a cursor jump. I find this explanation unsatisfactory: the probability of the jump to either direction is similar for both the target jump and cursor jump tasks as they share identical trial designs.</p><p>In sum, the study achieved its goal of testing whether the motivation factor improves feedback control when different feedback loops are predominantly involved in various tasks. The experimental tasks are carefully designed to avoid multiple confounding factors, the analysis is solid, and most of the results are convincing (with the exception of the &quot;significant&quot; difference in Figure 5f). The study aim is more explorative than hypothesis-driven, thus limiting the insights we can obtain from the heterogeneous results. However, through systematically studying feedback loops in a unified experimental framework, the study provides more insights into the effect of motivation on sensorimotor feedback control in the aspect of response latency and gain and thus can serve as a new stepping stone for further investigations.</p><p>Labeling the experiments with numbers would be good, especially considering the paper also includes an online dataset (Figure 5g and 5h).</p><p>Page 5: &quot;Next, we assessed the time of divergence of each participant's EMG activity between the reward and no-reward conditions using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) signal discrimination method…&quot;</p><p>Does this refer to the divergence of EMG activity from the baseline, not between the two conditions?</p><p>Figure 2b: what do the two colors mean?

Is this really the case? It appears that their RTs are similar.</p><p>The paper proposes to classify feedback control by sensory domain and response latency, not by function. The argument is that &quot;…it does not macth any observed pattern here (Figure8)&quot;. But what pattern does this refer to? The fact that response latency and modality matter for the &quot;reward effect&quot; does not justify ditching the use of &quot;function.&quot; In my opinion, the more apparent pitfall would be the loose use of &quot;function&quot; terms for different tasks. For instance, I wonder whether associating the target jump task with online tracking of the goal is reasonable. Tracking is typically referred to as using an effector to follow or spatially match a moving visual target. It is certainly not the case for a reaching movement to a possibly-changing target that has not been attained yet. It appears to me that for the same function, people can design drastically different tasks; that's the real problem that the current study should emphasize.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The question on how reward or value impacts feedback processes is important to understand. Previous studies highlight how reward impacts motor function. Given feedback is an important aspect of motor control, it is useful to know which feedback responses may be specifically impacted or altered by reward.</p><p>The manuscript uses a functional taxonomy suggested by Scott (2016) to define the behavioural contexts examined in the paper. A clear strength of the manuscript is the systematic evaluation of these feedback processes with distinct latencies. This resubmission addresses several issues raised in the initial review. Notably, most experiments have been redone to better align with the defined behavioural processes and the use of more standardized experimental approach and analyses techniques across experiments.</p><p>There are some methodological issues that are either poorly described or seem to be a problem. From the methods section, it looks like only the R2 and R3 epochs (50 to 100ms) were examined for each experiment. This doesn't make sense for experiments such as target and cursor jumps that only lead to EMG responses at ~100ms after the disturbance. As well, magnitude changes are monitored for 4 different muscles, but why is there only one latency examined (last panels in most figures) and which muscle is being used is not clear for each experiment.</p><p>I think some of the points raised in the discussion need to be developed more including the addition of pertinent literature. Specifically, the section on 'categorizing feedback control loops', brings up the point that it might be better to not use functional processes as a framework for exploring feedback control. Instead, they suggest categorization should be based on neural pathways, neural regions and sensory modalities. There are no citations in this section. However, in the conclusion it appears they suggest this paragraph is about using a bottom-up approach based on pathways and neural regions rather than a top-down functional approach. If that is their message, then the bottom-up approach has been around since Sherrington (see also recent ideas by G. Loeb) and so it would be worthwhile to include some integration of existing ideas from the literature (if they are related). While this is a worthwhile conversation, I think the authors should be cautious in concluding from this one behavioural study on reward that we should just ignore functional processes. Perhaps the problem is the term of linking complex functional processes to single 'feedback loops' as such processes likely engage many neural pathways Notably, the present discussion states that the cortico-cerebellar feedback loop was not considered in the present study. However, it likely was involved. In fact, in the 1970s the R3 response was commonly associated with the cerebellar-cortical feedback pathway. The richness of brain circuits engaged after 100ms is likely substantive. Thus, there needs to be some caution on linking these behavoural experiments to underlying brain circuits. The value of thinking about behavioural function is not because function can be found in a single brain region or pathway. Rather it is to ensure tasks/experiments are well defined, providing a sound basis to look at the underlying circuits and neural regions involved.</p><p>From above, the key points I think need to be considered are defining the time epochs under study for each experiment (need to ensure reader knows for each experiment) and why latency in only one muscle and which one for each study. The other point is to expand section on categorizing feedback loops with the existing literature, as suggested above.</p><p>The diagrams are very well organized. However, I wonder if it would be useful to show the hand speed against time to highlight your point that movement times were faster in rewarded trials in either Figure 1 or 2. This may not be necessary for all figures, but the first few to give the reader some sense of how much hand speed/movement time was altered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It is known that if one can obtain a reward, motor performance improves. The authors' aim is to answer the question which of the nested sensorimotor feedback loops that underly motor performance is/are affected by expected reward (and how).</p><p>The authors provide a large set of experimental conditions and show that their manipulation of the reward affects some aspects of the response to the perturbations in a latency-dependent way. The experiments are designed very similarly, so easy to compare. The authors succeed to a large extent in showing very convincingly that reward affects some feedback loops, but not others. However, there are some weaknesses, mainly in how the authors deal with the possibility that latencies might depend on reward. If this is the case, then the analysis becomes problematic, as the way the gain ratio is defined (based on differences) assumes equal latencies. The authors do not have a solid method to disentangle effects on latency from effects on gain.</p><p>A weakness is that there is no clear theory to identify feedback loops. The most evident example is the use of the functions (the colour code in Figure 1). For instance, what is the difference between 'goal-switching' and 'on-line action selection'? To me, these two refer to the same function. Indeed, the latencies for on-line goal switching depend on the design of the experiment, and even be as short as those for on-line tracking of the goal (Brenner and Smeets 2022). Also, the difference in labeling the SLR and LLR is not straightforward. In figure 2, it is clear that there is a LL reflex that depends on reward, the function here is on-line control of the limb. In the experiment of figure 3, that also yields a LLR, I see no reason why the function would not be the same, despite the task being different. The splitting of the LLR in a R2 and R3 makes things even more complicated. Lastly, it is interesting that the authors label the feedback loops involved in experiment 3 to differ from those in experiment 2, although they have the same latency and same sensory input.</p><p>A second weakness is the discussion on the latency of the responses. We have shown previously that conclusions about effects of a manipulation on latency depend critically on the way latency is determined (Brenner and Smeets 2019). So the effect of reward on latency might be an artifact, and should be confirmed by using other methods to determine latency. The authors argue in their rebuttal against using fixed time-windows. I am not convinced for 3 reasons: 1) by using a data-driven definition of the various reflex-epochs, the authors compare responses at different moments after the perturbation. We see for instance in figure 2h that the latency obtained for a single participant can differ 20 ms between the rewarded and non-rewarded condition (without any meaning, as the two conditions have the same latency, and the length of the arm was also not changed), so that the gain compares different epochs without any reason. Thus any uncertainty in the determined latency affects the values obtained for the gain-ratio. 2) the paper that defined these epochs (Pruszynski et al. 2008) used fixed periods for R1, R2 and R3. 3) the much older monkey-work by Tatton et al. reported consistent latencies for R1 and R2, and only variable latencies for R3. The authors do the opposite: assume a fixed latency of R3 (relative to R20, and variable for R1 and R2.</p><p>A third weakness is that the authors seem to claim that the changes in the feedback are causing better performance. The first aspect that troubles me is that only one factor of performance is provided (speed), but higher speed generally comes at the cost of reduced precision, which is not reported. By the way, MT (i.e. end of movement) is not defined in the paper. The second aspect is that I think they are not able to determine causality using the present design. The authors do not even try to show that feedback and MT are correlated. The authors should then limit their claim to their finding that reward changes movement time and feedback mechanisms.</p><p>A fourth weakness is their flexibility in the choice of their dependent measures, and (related) the excessive use of hypothesis testing (p-values). For instance, they measure the EMG from five muscles, and use sometimes all signals, and sometimes restrict themselves to the ones that seem most suited (e.g. when claiming that the latency is significantly reduced). Not analysing some signals because they are noisier gives an impression of p-hacking to me. Furthermore, by using more than one signal to test a hypothesis about a feedback loop, they should use a (Bonferroni?) correction for multiple testing.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by eLife. All reviewers think that systematic evaluation of different feedback processes that are impacted by reward is meaningful and timely for the area of perception and action. However, the reviewers also raised some major concerns that prevent the paper from being considered further.</p><p>Specifically, the following two concerns have been raised by reviewers unanimously. 1) The experiments used inconsistent reward function, which affects the acceptance of the paper's general conclusion;</p></disp-quote><p>We re-designed and re-collected 4 experimental designs out of 5. The experiment that we kept was the first experiment described in the study, which quantified the short- and long-latency stretch reflexes, and is now referred to as the “In-Out Target” task to match previous literature. The four new experiments were all designed to have a similar reward function to the experiment that was kept identical to the first version of this study. We decided in favour of keeping the reward function of the first experiment because that experiment consistently appeared from reviewers’ feedback as the most compelling, and the reward function of the other experiments raised potential confounds as pointed below in the second main concern given by reviewers. On the other hand, the reward function of the first experiment did not give rise to these concerns about confounding factor (see below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The experimental design did not stick to a simple comparison between reward vs. no reward but included confounds other than the availability of reward, especially for the target switch experiment. Given that the study is descriptive without a prior hypothesis and its ambitious goal to comprehensively examine the feedback control in the continuum of feedback latency, we have to caution about the link between the data and the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We listed the potential confounds raised in the individual reviews:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Potential Confound 1: The main muscle used for analysis differed from experiment to experiment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potential Confound 2: The reward function was different from experiment to experiment.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potential Confound 3: The target switch task required participants to “let go” along the perturbation during the main condition, while all other experiments conversely required the participants to “move as fast as possible” against the perturbation and to the target.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Potential Confound 4: The target switch task was the only task where the proprioceptive cue was provided during movement rather than during postural control.</p></list-item></list><p>Overall, through re-designing and re-collecting 4 of the 5 experiments, we harmonized the specific muscles on which the analyses are based, now use the same experimental apparatus for all experiments, and we keep consistent the reward/reinforcement schedule across all experiments. We also include analyses of more muscles involved in the experimental tasks.</p><p>To address individual review comments (comments which were not shared across all reviewers), we edited the graphical summary figures to provide a more consistent overview of existing literature, and we enhanced and expanded all figures showing empirical results to improve completeness and readability of the data and task designs. We also completely re-wrote the discussion to address remaining questions, re-focus the points already discussed and improve the logical structure. Finally, we included missing information in the methods, figure captions, and references, and removed ambiguous or misleading wordings that were pointed out.</p><p>Finally, based on the points raised by the reviewers below and changes in the task designs, we adjusted the terminology of some elements within the manuscript.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The “target switch” task is now renamed “target selection” task.</p></list-item><list-item><p>“Stretch reflex” is now renamed “rapid response” to match the terminology used in one of the original studies that we are building from (Pruszynski et al., (2008)).</p></list-item><list-item><p>The task emphasizing the SLR and LLR responses is now labelled “In-Out Target” task to match the terminology of the original study that designed and used this task (Pruszynski et al., (2008)).</p></list-item></list><p>Beyond the above shared concerns, individual concerns were raised by each reviewer, which we answer below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>How reinforcement impacts motor performance is an active research area that interests many. However, various movement paradigms have been used with various manipulations of reward or punishment. The current study constitutes a timely effort to elucidate possible mechanisms underlying diverse findings in the area. The strength of the paper is that the tasks involving increasingly response latencies are implemented in a single upper-arm experimental setup. The two fastest responses, slow-latency reflex (SLR) and long-latency reflex (LLR), are beautifully examined with a single perturbation scheme. Their related findings are also convincing: SLR was largely unaffected by reward, but the LLR showed a reward-induced increase in EEG gain.</p></disp-quote><p>Considering this statement (amongst others), we decided to design the new experiments to be closer to this experimental design, particularly the target switch experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>findings that simple reaction time and choice reaction time tasks were improved with reward are replicates of previous research, though the reaction time condition is implemented with a proprioceptive cue here instead of the common visual or auditory cues.</p></disp-quote><p>The results of the new experiment testing for proprioception-cued reaction times now replicate this result. The main change in the new design is that the movement participants are required to initiate emphasizes lateral triceps contraction (a forearm extension) instead of brachioradialis contraction (a forearm flexion). This is done to address Potential Confound 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the other three conditions, i.e., target switch, target jump, and cursor jump, did not yield any behavioral improvements by reward.</p><p>My major concern is whether the findings of either presence or absence of reward effect are generalizable and whether uncontrolled confounds can explain them. Note the current paper did not have any prior hypotheses for different conditions; thus, we need to scrutinize the supporting evidence for the conclusions. The study's strength is that diverse upper-arm movement perturbation paradigms are used and systematically varied in response latency, but the weakness also comes with this kind of study design. Each condition used a specific instantiation of each type of feedback control but differed in various factors besides the feedback loops involved. For example, the reward did not improve the performance in the target jump condition but improved the movement time in the target switch condition (though no EMG changes, see below). However, these two conditions had different reward functions, one for minimizing the movement time (MT) and reaction time (RT) but the other for minimizing the deviation from desired movement time.</p></disp-quote><p>Now the target switch task, the cursor jump task, and the target jump tasks all reward minimizing movement times. This is also true of the newly designed proprioception-cued reaction time task and the In-Out Target task that we kept from the original study, looking at the short- and long-latency rapid response. This is done to address Potential Confound 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, movement directions and muscles examined (brachioradialis vs. pectoralis) differ and probably affect the EMG response that is used for quantifying the reward effect.</p></disp-quote><p>The new experimental designs now all emphasize lateral triceps activation as the central measure to quantify latencies and feedback gains. This includes the target jump and target switch tasks. This is done to address Potential Confound 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the cursor jump condition, with a slightly longer latency than the target jump condition but again with a reward function for desired MT, yielded no reward effect either. It makes people wonder whether other task designs would produce the opposite effect on EMG. For example, would the timing and the size of the cursor jump make a difference? What if we reward fast reaction as opposed to maintaining desired movement time in these conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>The cursor jump task now rewards fast movement times and emphasizes lateral triceps contraction like all task designs in this study. This is done to address Potential Confound 1 and 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The conditions with significant reward effect are mostly those rewarding faster RT and/or MT; the ones rewarding desired movement time generally returns a null effect. The only exception is the target switching condition, which rewards fast MT and shows no reward effect.</p></disp-quote><p>The tasks that used to reward desired movement times now all reward fast movement times. This is done to address Potential Confound 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the target switch perturbation is associated with a peculiar instruction: once perturbed, the participants were required to relax their arms and let the perturbation push them toward the target and stop there. Relaxing while stopping at a target might conflict with the rewarding goal to move fast.</p></disp-quote><p>The new experimental design for the target switch experiment now requires moving fast against the perturbation, therefore requiring contraction and no longer relaxation of the main muscle used for analyses. This is done to address Potential Confound 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides the instruction differences, the conditions drastically differ in muscles examined, movement amplitude/timing and etc. These differences make the conclusions, based on a single specific instantiation of each feedback control paradigm (using the taxonomy by Stephen 2006), debatable.</p></disp-quote><p>All experimental tasks now examine the same muscle (triceps lateral head) and are centred on the same shoulder position (a 45 degrees angle), including the visual tasks. Movement amplitudes have been harmonized where possible, with identical perturbation torques across proprioceptive tasks. The displacement amplitude was already identical across visual tasks, and this has been maintained in the new experiments with a visual perturbation. All tasks also now use the same experimental apparatus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Relatedly, the lack of reward effect in the target switch, cursor jump, and target jump conditions is taken as evidence that feedback responses that rely on sensorimotor and premotor cortices are not modulated by reward, but those relying on prefrontal cortices are. However, it is not clear to me why the LLR condition involves prefrontal associative cortices, but the target jump condition does not. I did not find a discussion of this selective involvement of brain regions either. Given the concern that the specific task designs might cause those null effects, it might be premature to draw this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion and conclusions drawn have been re-written to more closely match the new dataset we collected for the new experimental designs. We took particular care to emphasize which statements are speculative and which are not.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second major concern is whether analyzing a single muscle adequately captures the perturbation effect and the reward effect. For example, the reward improved the performance in the target jump condition (figure 3g), but there is no EMG difference. This has been attributed to other feedback responses that may not be apparent with the task contrast here. But looking at Figure 3J, there is no EMG activity difference between the reward and the control conditions whatsoever. Then, how can the immediate result of EMG, i.e., the movement time, differ between conditions? Is it possible that the muscle activity examined is not relevant enough for the task? This relates to a methodological issue: is the null effect of EMG response to reward caused by the selection of muscles for analysis? For example, the target and cursor jump conditions select the pectoralis muscle only, and thus only leftward target jumps and right cursor jumps are used for analysis. This is reasonable as the pectoralis muscle directly relates to these perturbation directions, but these perturbations probably cause changes in other muscles that are not examined. How can we be assured that any reward effect that is really there is all captured by analyzing the pectoralis only?</p></disp-quote><p>The EMG activity in figure 3J is centred on a time window closely matching the perturbation occurrence. There are many ways in which behavioural performance could be improved beyond that window, such as different muscle activation before or after that time window, different contribution from other muscles, better central processing of timing based on the auditory cues, or cocontraction to lock the hand position on the target at the end and finish the movement in a timelier fashion. How that improvement occurs is not the focus of the study, but its presence is a control measurement to ensure that rewarding context does affect the movement. We then analyse the time window matching the feedback response of interest to assess whether that feedback response contributed to the behavioural improvement or not, which is the focus of the current study.</p><p>However, we do agree that any study, our own included, would benefit from analysing as many muscles as possible for the sake of completeness. For each experiment, we included the EMG trace of each antagonist muscle to the muscle used for our main analysis, and we quantified and analysed the feedback gains of all muscles we recorded. All these results are consistently included in the</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the questions raised above, I would suggest:</p><p>1) Design tasks with similar reward functions, at least.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Analyze more muscles.</p></disp-quote><p>We now assess feedback gains for all muscles for which we have EMG data: brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major (clavicular head), posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii (short head). We also display the EMG trace of the main antagonist muscle alongside the main muscle of interest for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Explain why some tasks rely on associative cortices while others on premotor and sensorimotor cortices.</p></disp-quote><p>This is no longer relevant to the discussion points and conclusions we make given the new experimental designs and resulting data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Solve the issue of the conflicting instructions for the target switch condition.</p></disp-quote><p>This is now done by changing the design of the target switch experiment. Note that the target switch experiment is now re-labelled “target selection” experiment to address another point raised by reviewer 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is known that one can obtain a reward, motor performance improves. The authors' aim is to answer the question &quot;which of the nested sensorimotor feedback loops that underly motor performance is/are affected by expected reward.?&quot;</p><p>The authors provide a large set of experimental conditions and show that their manipulation of the reward affects the response to some of the perturbations.</p><p>A weakness is that the paper lacks a clear hypothesis on how reward would affect the feedback loops. There are several possibilities. It could speed up the information processing, increase the gain, etc. Without a clear hypothesis, it is unclear what the differences are one should be looking for. The authors instead perform a fishing expedition and look for any difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. If fishing expedition refers to an explorative study, as opposed to a confirmatory (hypothesis-driven) study, then indeed the present study would qualify. The dichotomy between explorative and confirmatory work is well formalized (Wagenmakers et al., 2012), with advantages and drawbacks stated and largely discussed for both types of studies. Particularly, omission of explorative work comes with its own bias (e.g., see “The Role of the Hypothetico-Deductive Method in Psychology’s Crisis” section in Scheel et al. (2021)). Importantly, we agree that explorative work should be presented as such (Nosek and Lakens, 2014), and so particular care was put in the present study to ensure this is clear to the reader.</p><p>Wagenmakers et al. (2012): An Agenda for Purely Confirmatory Research; DOI:</p><p>10.1177%2F1745691612463078</p><p>Scheel et al. (2021): Why Hypothesis Testers Should Spend Less Time Testing Hypotheses; DOI: 10.1177/1745691620966795</p><p>Nosek and Lakens, 2014: Registered Reports A Method to Increase the Credibility of Published Results; DOI: 10.1027/1864-9335/a000192</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second weakness is that the conditions differ not only in the aspect that is presented as the reason for performing the task but also in several additional aspects. For instance, the paper contains two reaction time tasks. One is based on visual input, the other on proprioceptive input. However, the visual one is also a choice reaction time, whereas the proprioceptive one is not. The most serious variation is that what the authors reward differs between the experiments. For instance, performance in the target-switch condition is rewarded for short movement times whereas small deviations from the desired movement time are rewarded in the target-jump condition. In other conditions, the reward is based on time-in-target. So, any difference between the experiments might be due to this difference in reward criterion.</p></disp-quote><p>All reward functions now reward minimization of movement time and so have the same reward criterion. Note that the task measuring the short- and long-latency rapid response still rewards time in target instead of movement times directly, but this is strictly equivalent to rewarding short movement times in practice because trial duration is fixed in that experiment, i.e., only the mathematical formulation differs. This is done to address Potential Confound 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third weakness is that the authors use 'feedback' for aspects of control that are feedforward. Feedback control refers to the use of sensory information to guide the effector to the target. However, switching to another target (second experiment) is a decision process (selecting the goal), and is not related to reaching the target. It is unclear how this relates to the &quot;target jump&quot; condition, which can be interpreted as resulting from feedback control.</p></disp-quote><p>Generally, this points to another discussion of when feedforward control stops, and feedback control starts. A proposed view, which we favour, is that feedback loops do not act as “sheathed” system with well-isolated ascending and descending loops, but as a nested set of loops which can bypass and override each other, while receiving constant streams of top-down modulation as well (Scott, 2016, Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020, particularly the last section). In this context it is reasonable to consider a decision-making process as being part of a feedback loop, similar to previous empirical work (Nashed et al., 2014, especially experiment 4; De Comite et al., 2021, DOI:10.1101/2021.07.25.453678).</p><p>We agree that this leans toward a broader definition of what feedback control is. Our main consideration is that this is a complex question that steers away from the purpose and scope of this study, although we concur that this is a very interesting and relevant question for the field.</p><p>Note: the studies cited above are referenced in the main manuscript, unless a DOI was provided.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A fourth weakness is that the analysis (or the written report of it) is sometimes confusing. For instance, the authors use terminology R1, R2, R3 as defined by Pruszynski et al. (2008). They don't report the definitions themselves (e.g.: R2 corresponds to 45-75 ms after the perturbation). Despite explicitly citing this paper, they don't seem to use these definitions. Instead, they redefine them as &quot;R2 and R3 epochs were taken as the first 25 ms.… after each participant's LLR latency&quot;. By using this flexible definition of epochs, the epoch is not an independent variable anymore.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the methods and Results sections throughout to be clearer in our description of the experimental design and analyses.</p><p>Regarding the specific point raised up, the use of an epoch definition that is fixed in time has its own limit. For instance, one would not expect the LLR response to arise at 45 ms both for an individual with a short arm length and one with a long arm length, simply due to differences in transmission delays. Therefore, not adjusting the time window accordingly will bias the results in a way that is unnecessary if we have knowledge of response latencies.</p><p>More critically, latencies themselves may (and in some experiments do) vary with a rewarding context, which is the manipulated variable in our experimental designs. Therefore, by not adjusting for that variation, we are in fact using window positions (relative to the onset of the feedback response of interest) that will vary as reward varies. That would make the epoch boundaries dependent on – not independent from – the presence or absence of reward.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A fifth weakness is that it is unclear in the SL/LL experiment whether the stimulus (the stretch of the muscle) is affected by the reward, as the mechanical stiffness of the muscle might have been affected by the expected reward (e.g. by co-contraction).</p></disp-quote><p>We have included average EMG activity at baseline (350 to 300 ms before the perturbation occurs) for all experiment, both for the main muscle used and its antagonist. Considering a follow-up comment made below, it appears we have missed some information on how we calculated trial-bytrial EMG baselines and therefore what they represent. A paragraph has been added on that point to section 4.5 of the new manuscript.</p><p>Perhaps a more direct way of measuring mechanical stiffness is by looking at maximum excursion in the kinematics following the mechanical displacement, which we display in the figure below. However, a clear difference was not consistently observed across participants between rewarded and non-rewarded trials in the LLR condition.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Position of maximum excursion following the perturbation in the condition with an inward (counterclockwise) push and an outward (clockwise) target.</title><p>Trials where reward was provided are colorcoded in green, and trials where no reward was provided are color-coded in red.

Well-designed experiments would be able to help to advance the field here. As the authors varied much more between the experiments than only the loop involved, they have not convinced me that the differences they report are indeed related to differences in how expected reward affects the nested sensorimotor feedback loops.</p><p>Using page numbers would have facilitated feedback</p></disp-quote><p>This is now done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Title: In my understanding, it should contain &quot;expected&quot; rewards, as the responses that are investigated occur before the reward is provided.</p><p>&quot;a 10 cm target appeared at 20 degrees&quot; Use comparable units (all degrees or all cm) and clarify whether the size is radius or diameter.</p></disp-quote><p>We now specify that the sizes indicate radii in the methods.</p><p>The degrees unit refer to the angle formed between the arm and the forearm (see Figure 2a of the new manuscript). Therefore, a target in degrees would not have the same size in cm for a participant with a long forearm compared to one with a short forearm due to angular projection. Consequently, degrees and cm are not strictly convertible units here, and we have now specified this in the text to ensure this is clear to the reader (section 4.4.1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A figure explaining the time-course of a trial might be helpful.</p><p>&quot;an inward&quot; Better use &quot;(counter-)clockwise&quot;</p><p>In several captions it is mentioned: &quot;The left panels show EMG at trial baseline (see methods)&quot;, but in the methods, there is no mention of &quot;trial baseline&quot;.

Is the scalar subtracted, expressed in multiples of baseline activity? And are the plotted signals those after normalising?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information. We have added this paragraph to section 4.5 in the methods:</p><p>“For all experimental designs, trial-by-trial baseline EMG activity was measured in a 50 ms window from 350 to 300 ms before displacement onset, while participants were at rest, background loads were applied, and after targets and reward context were provided. For the target Jump and Cursor Jump tasks, this was measured in a 50 ms window from 350 to 300 ms before target appearance instead of before displacement onset because movements were self-initiated, and displacements occurred during the movement. However, the same target was displayed in every condition at the start of a given trial in those two experimental paradigms. Note that these trial-by-trial baseline EMG signals are distinct from the 4 baseline trials described above in this section, which were done before the task started and were used for normalization of EMG signals. The trial-by-trial baseline EMG signals were not used for EMG normalization.”</p><p>Additionally, we have specified where in the task design the trial-by-trial baselines are positioned where appropriate, in sections 4.4.2 to 4.4.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear how latencies and reaction times are determined. There are many options for this, and the results of the analyses of latencies depend critically on which options are chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the method used to obtain latencies and reaction times are particularly important. For that reason, we used previously employed methods that were successfully employed in that context, specifically Pruszynski et al. (2008) for the reaction times and Weiler et al. (2015) for the other experiments. Weiler et al. (2015) is particularly interesting in that regard, as it dedicates a significant portion of the methods describing, explaining, and analysing the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) method we employed to estimate latencies in most tasks (reaction times excluded). We followed the procedure as strictly as possible, and detail where appropriate the parameters we used when they were different (see below).</p><p>Regarding reaction times, section 2.5. in the results indicate:</p><p>“Reaction times were defined as when the (processed) triceps EMG signal rose 5 standard deviations above baseline level (Pruszynski et al., 2008) for 5 ms in a row (Figure 5d).”</p><p>Regarding latencies, section 4.6 in the methods specifies:</p><p>“To determine the time at which EMG signals for different task conditions diverged, we used Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We used the same approach as in Weiler et al. (2015), using a 25-75% threshold of area under the curve (AUC) for establishing signal discrimination. The threshold was considered reached if two consecutive samples were greater than the threshold value. Discrimination was done for each participant and each reward condition independently, using all trials available for each contrast without averaging. Once the AUC threshold was crossed, we performed a segmented linear regression on the AUC before it crossed the 25-75% threshold. We minimized the sums-of-squared residuals to find the inflexion point, that is, where the two segments of the segmented linear regression form an angle (see Weiler et al. (2015) and analysis code online for details).”</p><p>Particularly, the analysis code for the segmented linear fitting is freely available online at the URL:</p><p>https://journals.physiology.org/doi/suppl/10.1152/jn.00702.2015</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Conversely, the LLR arose.… (LLR not occurring, Figure 2c).&quot; This is not my interpretation. In both cases, an LLR is present, in one case much stronger than in the other. Secondly, the effect of the task is not present at the onset of the LLR, but starts at a moment the LLR has already started. The authors refer to this latter time as the latency, but the figure shows a clear SL and the onset of the LL, which is clearly before the effect kicks in.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a misleading statement, as LLRs can occur in both conditions, although in different strengths.

This is not a problem in the first analysis (figure 2e in the original manuscript, 3f in the new manuscript) because we compare a time window in condition 1 to the same time window in condition 2. However, in the second analysis across epochs, this is a problem (figure 2f in the original manuscript, 3g in the new manuscript). We specify in the text for clarity:</p><p>“For this analysis, we did not use a log-ratio, because EMG activity was not scaled similarly in R2 and R3 epochs (Figure 3d-e), and that difference would lead to a mismatched ratio normalisation across epoch, hindering comparisons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would help if all the figures were showing similar data in the same format.

I miss a discussion of how behaviour can be improved by expected reward with such little changes in the underlying sensorimotor control. A last item that could be discussed is that reward might affect behaviour not only by expected reward but also through a learning mechanism, so the (lack of) reward will affect the trial after the (lack of) reward.</p></disp-quote><p>The discussion is now completely re-written.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The question on how reward or value impacts feedback processes is important to understand. Previous studies highlight how reward impacts motor function. Given feedback is an important aspect of motor control, it is useful to know which feedback responses may be specifically impacted or altered by reward.</p><p>A clear strength of the manuscript is the systematic evaluation of different feedback processes reflecting different latencies and behavioural contexts to initiate a response. These differences reflect differences in the underlying neural circuitry involved in each of these feedback processes. Examination on how reward impacts each of these processes using similar techniques and approach provides a comprehensive examination on how reward impact feedback responses and a much cleaner overview of the problem, rather than a fractured examination if explored over many separate studies.</p><p>The manuscript uses a functional taxonomy suggested by Scott (2016) to define the behavioural contexts examined in the paper. In most cases, the experimental paradigms match these taxonomies. However, some confusion seems to occur for responses elicited at ~50ms following mechanical disturbances which includes two distinct types: 1) goal-directed online control and 2) triggered reactions. These two conditions are behaviourally quite different as the former maintains the same goal before and after the disturbance, whereas the latter switches the behavioural goal, and thus, feedback responses are now set to a new spatial goal. Triggered reactions are examined in the present study, but it is assumed that this reflects goal-directed online control (the former). Thus, responses at ~50ms can reflect substantially different behavioural conditions (and likely processes) and these distinctions should be recognized.</p><p>I think the simplest approach for quantifying the impact of reward on corrective responses is to compare corrective responses in a single condition with and without reward. However, the manuscript used paired behavoural conditions to look at the difference in EMG between contexts and then identify if this EMG difference changes between rewarded and non-rewarded trials. This makes the material more complex to understand and follow. Admittedly, the use of this EMG difference between conditions works well if reward should increase a response for one context and decrease it in the other. For example, target jumps to the left compared to the right increase pectoralis activity for the leftward jump and decrease for the right jump. Reward should enhance both of these reciprocal responses (increase the first and/or decrease the latter) and thus lead to a larger EMG difference for rewarded trials. So this contrast approach makes sense in that experiment. However, the contrast for goal-tracking (actually should be called goal-switching) experiment contrasts the switching goal condition with a control condition in which corrective responses were generated to the original spatial goal. In this situation, both contexts could show an increase in EMG with reward, and in fact, that appears to be the case shown in Figure 3e (top panel shows both conditions have a slight increase in EMG for rewarded trials). However, by looking at the difference in EMG between conditions, this reward-related activity is removed. I think these two behavioural contexts should be assessed separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely re-designed and re-collected the experiment relating to target switching so that it more closely matches the task used for the SLR and LLR measurements. We believe the new task design should alleviate the concern raised here. This was done also to address Potential Confound 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Critically, the baseline condition where corrective responses were generated to the original goal fills the void regarding goal-directed online control mentioned in the previous paragraph that occurs at ~50ms. If there is a significant change in EMG for the goal-directed online control, then it could be used as a contrast for the target switching task to address whether there is any greater increase in EMG response specifically related to target switching.</p><p>I think there is some confusion with regards to some of the functional taxonomy and the experimental paradigms to assess these processes from the functional taxonomy outlined in Scott (2016). Specifically, there are two distinct behavioural processes that occur at ~50ms related to proprioceptive disturbances: there is 1) online control to an ongoing motor action where the behavioural goal remains constant, and 2) triggered reactions to attain a new goal. The present study is the latter and was developed by Pruszynski et al., 2008 (should be cited when describing the experiment) and is really just a spatial version of the classic resist/don't resist paradigm. However, this Target In/Out task is assumed to be the former both in Figure 1 and the text. These are distinct processes as the goal remains constant in the former and switches in the latter. The former is comparable to a cursor jump task where the arm (or cursor) is shifted, but the goal remains the same. I think Figure 1 and the text needs to recognize this distinction as outlined in Scott (2016).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the LLR contains several responses, including one that relates to online control of the limb (earlier) and one that relates to goal switching (later). As we use figure 1 as the basis for figure 8 to provide a “graphical abstract” of the set of results we obtain, we are trying to keep an approach based on task used. In light of the comment above it appears that this could be improved. Specifically:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The “target switch” task is renamed “target selection” task in figure 1 and 8 and in the main text</p></list-item><list-item><p>The new “target selection” task and the “alternative target” task now correspond to an “action selection” function.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We indicate that the first two contrasts are part of the in-out target experiment</p></list-item><list-item><p>Each response (SLR and LLR) relates to a different contrast within the in-out target experiment</p></list-item><list-item><p>The short-latency contrast now correspond to the “online control of the limb” function in figure 1.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The long-latency rapid response functionally relates to online goal switching</p></list-item></list><p>We also move away from the “stretch reflex” nomenclature and instead use the original “rapid response” nomenclature as in Pruszynski et al.

These are essentially the same tasks (disturbance drives onset of next action in Scott 2016), as the only difference between them is the size of the disturbance with triggered reactions using large disturbances leading to responses at ~50ms and small disturbances for reaction time tasks leading to responses starting at ~110ms. These are likely not distinct phenomena, but a continuum with the latency and magnitude likely impacted by the size of the mechanical disturbance, although I don't think it has ever been systematically examined. Critically, they are very similar from a behavioural context perspective. Interestingly, the present study found that reward shortened the latency and increased the magnitude for the proprioceptively cued reaction time task and increased the gain for the triggered reaction, but not the latency likely due to the fact the latter hit transmission limits. The manuscript should recognize the commonality in these behavioural tasks when introducing the tasks. Perhaps these experiments should be grouped together. I think the strategy of the manuscript was to introduce experiments based on their latency, but this creates a bit of an artificial separation for these two tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this very interesting point. We have added it to the main text, in the new discussion in the paragraph where we discuss transmission delays, as it is particularly relevant there:</p><p>[…] “Consequently, the LLR has little room for latency improvements beyond transmission delays. This is well illustrated in the proprioception-cued reaction time task, which holds similarities with the task used to quantify the LLR response but with a smaller mechanical perturbation. Despite this similarity, latencies were reduced in the proprioception-cued reaction time task, possibly because the physiological lower limit of transmission delays is much below typical reaction times.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be useful to add a goal-directed online control experiment to assess EMG responses when reaching to spatial goals with mechanical disturbances with and without reward. This would provide a nice parallel to the experiments examining cursor jumps to explore online control of the limb. Previous work has shown that increases in urgency to respond to a postural perturbation task led to increases in long-latency responses (Crevecouer et al., JNP 2013). Urgency in that study and reward in the present study are related as reward was based on how long individuals remained at the end target which is similar to the need to return faster to the target in Crevecouer et al. There may be specific differences between posture and reaching, but the basic principle of corrective responses to attain or maintain a goal are similar. In fact, you second experiment incorporates a simple goal-directed online control task with mechanical disturbances in the goal-tracking task displayed in 3a. This could be analyzed on its own to fill this void.</p></disp-quote><p>As the experimental design of the second experiment is now different and we have re-worked the nomenclature in figure 1, this point may not apply directly anymore. We look forward to discussing it further should it be needed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experimental paradigms use comparisons between two conditions (termed a control and a manipulation condition, in some cases). I'm not entirely sure why they did this as a simpler strategy would be to examine the differences between rewarded and unrewarded trials for a given condition. The logic (and value) may be that multiple feedback processes could be impacted by reward and you wanted to see the incremental change between feedback processes. However, looking at the difference in EMG in the goal-tracking task makes me wonder if the authors missed something. It looks like both the control and manipulation condition show a slight increase in EMG in Figure 3e. However, the statistical test simply looks at the difference in these responses between control and manipulation, and since both show a slight increase for rewarded trials, the difference in EMG removes that increase observed in both signals resulting in no difference between rewarded and non-rewarded trials. I think the control and manipulation conditions should be separated as I don't think they are directly comparable. While lines overlap in the top panel of Figure 3e, it looks like the rewarded trials for the target switch condition may show a reduction in time and an increase in magnitude during the LLR for rewarded trials (the challenges of a dashed line).</p><p>The online control condition from the target switching task (Figure 3a) could be examined on its own. If a contrast design was important, that would require pairing the resistive load with an assistive load, or perhaps loads to deviate hand orthogonal to the target direction to parallel the cursor jump experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have completely re-designed and re-collected the experiment relating to target switching so that it more closely matches the task used for the SLR and LLR measurements. We believe the new task design should alleviate the concern raised here as one would now expect a rewarding context to increase the response in each of the diverging conditions. This was done also to address Potential Confound 3 and 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think it's confusing to frame the first two experiments based on short-latency, long-latency, and slower long-latency. You have provided a clean approach to introduce different feedback processes based on behavioural features of a task (Figure 1). I think you should stick to these behavioural features when describing the experiments and not talk about short-latency, long-latency and slower long-latency when developing the problem and experiments as this confuses the taxonomy based on behaviour with time epochs. As you carefully point out, there are many different layers of feedback processing and so epochs of time may include influences from many pathways and two processes may happen to take the same time (i.e. goal-directed online control and triggered reactions). Further, there are two distinct processes at ~50ms which needs to be clarified and kept distinct. Thus, behavioural context and not time epoch is important to maintain. This is why the later experiments on cursor jump, target jump and choice reaction time are much easier to follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reframed those two experiments and now stay closer to the task-related and behavioural features we measure, as suggested in this point. This is particularly apparent in the new format for figure 1 and 8 and in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The impact on reward on baseline motor performance is a bit confusing. It is not clear that various statistics of motor performance in the various conditions is related to the baseline movements without disturbances or with disturbances. This may be stated in the methods but should be clearly stated in the main text and legends to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>When we refer to the motor performance (MTs) in the result, we have added a sentence describing in more details the method used. For instance, in section 2.1 (new sentence underlined):</p><p>“Before comparing the impact of rewarding context on feedback responses, we tested whether behavioural performance improved with reward by comparing movement times (MT) expressed. To do so, we computed for each participant the median MT of trials corresponding to the conditions of interest (Figure 2a, rightmost panel) for rewarded and non-rewarded trials and compared them using a Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Indeed, median MTs were faster during rewarded trials than in nonrewarded ones (W=136, r=1, p=4.38e-4, Figure 2c).”</p><p>Generally, for each task, we took the conditions of interest represented in panel A of each figure and calculated the median MT for each participant in those conditions, for rewarded and non-rewarded trials. This resulted in two median MT per participant (rewarded, non-rewarded). We computed a Wilcoxon rank-sum on these pairs of median MT to assess statistical significance.</p><p>In the new task designs used, all conditions of interest include a perturbation, so there is always presence of a disturbance in the trials included in calculation of median MT. Note that this was also true in the previous experimental designs, although this is no longer relevant to the current version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I don't think it is useful to talk about goal-tracking responses for experiment 2 as the term tracking is usually reserved for moving targets. I kept re-reading trying to understand how the goal was moving in the task and how the individual was tracking it, but this clearly didn't occur in this experiment! Rather, this task is probably best characterized as goal switching (as stated in methods section). The term slower in the title is also unnecessary and confusing. Again, stick to behavioural features of the task, not time epochs.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point and have re-designed figure 1 and 8 accordingly. This task is now renamed “target selection”, which we think is more accurate, as no switch occurs in the new experimental design that we use for assessing that feedback response. This is also categorized functionally as an “action selection” process. This change has also been done throughout the text.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>All reviewers find this paper (or a revised version of the previous submission) a timely effort to study how the motivational factor affects motor control. The methodological improvements are also helpful in addressing previous concerns about consistency across experimental tasks. However, the reviewers converged on two major concerns:</p><p>1) The link between functional tasks and their assumed feedback loops is poorly specified. For example, goal-switching and online action selection appear the same in function. Target jump and cursor jump are also similar. The LLR contrast and the target selection yielded similar latency and had the same sensory input but were treated as involving different feedback loops. The functional taxonomy proposed in Scott 216 paper was not meant to suggest that each functional process was supported by a different &quot;feedback loop.&quot; Thus, we suggest that the introduction should be less conclusive about the functions that the various experimental paradigms address and whether they tap into different or the same feedback loops. Perhaps simply referring to the existence of these paradigms in the introduction is enough for this descriptive research. At the same time, the link between functional tasks and their assumed feedback loops should be discussed more appropriately in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation is identical to the one described above, that is, that each functional process is not supported by a different &quot;feedback loop.&quot;. First, we draw a distinction between a feedback loop and a feedback response. A feedback loop will have a biological meaning (e.g., the spinal circuitry), while a feedback response is simply the behavioural outcome following a perturbation. For instance, the circuitry that produces the Long Latency Response (LLR) will also contribute to the response observed in the Target Selection task. A feedback loop will likely contribute to movements for which there is no externally applied perturbation as well and thus for which there is no feedback response. Therefore, the perturbation is merely a means to force a response whose properties can be used to infer about the nature of the feedback loop(s) involved.</p><p>Second, even if we were to replace feedback “loop” by feedback “response in the statement above (“each functional process is not supported by a different &quot;feedback response&quot;), this would still be misleading. A feedback response is sensitive to a specific goal by virtue of the information integrated in the circuitry implementing it, but the response does not exist “by design” to implement that function, as the term “is supported by” implies.</p><p>Considering the comment above, this view is not clear enough from the manuscript as it stands. To better convey this viewpoint, we have amended the second paragraph of the introduction. Specifically, we changed “each feedback loop is governed by different objectives” to “each feedback loop is sensitive to different objectives”, and we added the following statement:</p><p>“Here, the term “feedback response” refers to a behavioural response to an externally applied perturbation. The term “feedback loop” refers to a neuroanatomical circuit implementing a specific feedback control mechanism which will lead to all or part of a behavioural feedback response.”</p><p>We have also expanded on how each the feedback response of each experiment relates to the functions of figure 1 as each experiment was introduced in the results.</p><p>“Section 2: The SLR corrects the limb position against mechanical perturbations regardless of task information, whereas the LLR integrates goal-dependent information into its correction following a mechanical perturbation (Pruszynski et al., 2014; Weiler et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Section 2.3: Therefore, the divergence point between each condition is the earliest behavioural evidence of a target being selected and committed to.”</p><p>“Section 2.4: While this experimental design is similar to the LLR contrast used in the In-Out Target experiment, a key distinction differentiates them. In the proprioception-cued reaction time task, the movement to perform can be anticipated and prepared for, while for the LLR the movement to perform depended on the direction of perturbation, which is unknow until the movement starts. Specifically, in the LLR, a perturbation toward or away from the target requires a stopping action to avoid overshooting or a counteraction to overcome the perturbation and reach the target, respectively. Therefore, the behaviour we are assessing in the reaction time task represents an initiation of a prepared action, rather than an online goal-dependent correction like the LLR.”</p><p>“Section 2.5: In a new task using the same apparatus (Figure 6a), a visual jump of the cursor (indicating hand position) occurred halfway through the movement, that is, when the shoulder angle was at 45 degrees like the Target Selection task (Figure 6b). This allowed us to assess the visuomotor corrective response to a change in perceived limb position (Dimitriou et al., 2013).”</p><p>Finally, we have amended the relevant Discussion section (Section 3.3) according to individual reviewer comments, as described in details below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2）The critical methodological problems that might affect the validity of the findings should be addressed. These problems include how the latency is determined (e.g., the need to have other methods to confirm the latency estimation, the need to have a fixed time window), which segment of EMG should be analyzed (e.g., R2 and R3 splitting), and which muscles should be used for analysis (e.g., most analyses based on one muscle though all muscles are monitored; having an arbitrary choice of muscles is a warning sign for p-hacking). These problems are more detailed in Reviewer 3's comments.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the validity of the metrics used, in the individual responses below:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We demonstrate that the effect of reward on feedback gains remains similar if using a fixed window.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We demonstrate that the latency estimation method we use in this study is superior to alternative choices. Specifically, we performed a series of simulations on the four alternative latency estimation methods suggested as well as the one we used and show that the other methods do not perform as well in the context of our dataset. We then proceed to show that the EMG signals on which latency estimation is done in this study likely express amounts of noise that are greater than what alternative methods can handle. Finally, we illustrate this on data from individual participants.</p></list-item></list><p>In light of comments made by the reviewers, we have removed the R1-R2-R3 terminology in this manuscript, as it does not correspond to the canonical way this terminology is used in the main literature. The comparison between R2 and R3 was also removed, as it distracts away from the main points of this study in its current form.</p><p>Regarding p-hacking, there are in fact several layers of protection against it in the current study. Here we are quoting elements of one of our answers further below:</p><p>Quote starts</p><p>[For any given task,] if a muscle’s activity does not diverge between conditions, one cannot estimate the latency of that (non-existent) divergence. For our study, this situation would indicate that there is no relation between the geometry of the task (orientation of movement) and the geometry of the muscle (orientation of pull) considered. Since there is little redundancy in the geometry of the muscles we recorded from (and in the musculoskeletal system overall), it is essentially impossible to find an experimental design that would result in two muscles diverging for the same movement, forcing one to decide pre-collection which muscle to emphasize. Here, we decided to emphasize the triceps in all our experiments to remain consistent with the experiment measuring the SLR and LLR, since this is the experiment that the reviewers had found most convincing and appealing in the first round of review.</p><p>We could have designed the experiments to emphasize another muscle (i.e., which muscle we want to emphasize is arbitrary). But having only one muscle whose EMG signal diverges between conditions prevents us from exploring all the muscle signals post-hoc and picking whichever would be the most convenient. In other words, since the muscle to analyse must be declared pre-collection, one cannot decide on post-hoc changes once data is collected. That situation is in fact robust to p-hacking rather than prone to it.</p><p>In addition, since we use the same muscle across experiment for estimating latencies, there is no rationale for changing post-hoc the muscle considered for one experiment without having to change it for all five experiments. And since the first experiment (assessing the SLR and LLR) is preserved from the first version of this draft, this acts as an anchor point preventing unchecked data mining with respect to which muscle to use for latency estimation.</p><p>More generally, we would like to point out that by re-designing and re-collecting four out of five experiments, the original (first) draft of this study acts as a check against data mining. The scientific question at hand, the variables of interest (feedback gain and latency), the analysis to estimate them (difference of integrals over a time window, ROC analysis), and statistical tests used (Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests) are all strictly the same as in the first draft.</p><p>Quote ends</p><p>More generally, many comments made throughout this review suggest that we are not explaining the experimental designs and their motivation clearly enough in the main text. We have included two additional paragraphs in section 2.1 to better describe the experimental process, alongside additional panels in each figure breaking down the experimental design at hand.</p><p>Note that for this reason, the panel letters that the reviewer indicate in their comments below will not match those in the new manuscript. For convenience, we specify the new panel labels where appropriate in the responses below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study aims to test whether sensorimotor feedback control is sensitive to motivational factors by testing a series of tasks that presumably rely on different feedback loops. The first strength of the study is that all the feedback control tasks were designed with a unified upper-limb planar movement setting with various confounding factors under control. Its previous submission a year ago had received some major criticisms, mostly about inconsistency across tasks in task goals, analyzed muscles, and reward functions. The new submission has used re-designed experiments to keep consistency across tasks and successfully addressed most, if not all, previous major concerns. As a result, this study gives a more complete picture of how motivation affects feedback control than previous studies that did not scrutinize the feedback loop involved in the task.</p><p>The study found that the fastest feedback loops, both for visual and proprioceptive feedback, are free from the effect of reward in terms of muscle response. The earliest reward-sensitive feedback loop has a latency of about 50ms, depicted by the response to the proprioceptive perturbation. Reduced response latency and increased feedback gains underlie the reward-elicited improvements, but their roles vary across tasks.</p><p>The weakness of the study is that the underlying mechanisms for the heterogenous results are speculative. Though the study included five tasks and one previous dataset, it did not conduct experiments for some tasks, or failed to have electromyography measurements. These tasks include those related to vision-cued reaction time, alternative targets, and choice RT. The incomplete task set might prevent drawing conclusive explanations for the current findings. The theoretical account to explain the increased feedback gain is so-called anticipatory pre-modulation, but this term is unspecified in any detail based on the present findings. Using this account to explain the finding that the cursor jump task (in contrast to the target jump) failed to induce a reward effect in feedback gain, the authors hypothesize that the anticipatory pre-modulation does not work for the cursor jump task since it cannot prime the participants with the probability of a cursor jump. I find this explanation unsatisfactory: the probability of the jump to either direction is similar for both the target jump and cursor jump tasks as they share identical trial designs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the lack of a clear definition on the “anticipatory premodulation” term used here. We have amended the discussion to introduce a definition of the term where first introduced, in section 3.2:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“Unlike transmission delays, the strength of a feedback responses can be modulated before movement occurrence, that is, during motor planning (de Graaf et al., 2009; Selen et al., 2012), which we will refer to as anticipatory pre-modulation here.”</p></disp-quote><p>And a more detailed description of what form we expect this mechanism to take at the neural level:</p><p>“In a general sense, pre-modulation results from preparatory activity, which at the neural level is a change in neural activity that will impact the upcoming movement without producing overt motor activity – that is, output-null neural activity (Churchland et al., 2006; Elsayed et al., 2016; Vyas et al., 2020). Regarding feedback gain pre-modulation, this means that in the region(s) involved there is an output-null neural activity subspace from which the neural trajectory unfolding from the upcoming movement will respond differently to a perturbation. Importantly, not all preparatory activity will yield a modulation of feedback gain, or even task-dependent modulation at all. An extreme example of this distinction is the spinal circuitry, where preparatory activity is observed but does not necessarily translate into task-dependent modulation (Prut and Fetz, 1999). This is also consistent with our result, as we observe no change in feedback gain with reward in the SLR. Therefore, since not all preparatory activity is equivalent, we do not propose that the presence of any preparatory activity, even task-related, will automatically result in reward-driven modulation of feedback gains.”</p><p>Regarding the last point, we agree that there is no difference in jump probability between the cursor jump and target jump designs. The reviewer’s point highlighted that the main text may be confusing. We had initially written:</p><p>“Therefore, one could consider a version of these tasks in which participants are primed before the trial of the probability of a jump in either direction (Beckley et al., 1991; Selen et al., 2012). In the Target Jump task, the above proposal predicts this should pre-modulate the gain of the feedback response according to the probability value. In the Cursor Jump task it should not.”</p><p>We edited this segment to now read (section 3.2, third paragraph):</p><p>“Therefore, one could consider a probabilistic version of these tasks in which the probability of a jump in each direction is manipulated on a trial-by-trial basis, and participants are informed before each trial of the associated probability (Beckley et al., 1991; Selen et al., 2012). Previous work shows that this manipulation successfully modulates the LLR feedback gain of the upcoming trial (Beckley et al., 1991). Given our hypothesis, it should premodulate the feedback gain following a target jump, but not following a cursor jump, because the absence of reward-driven feedback gain modulation would indicate the circuitry involved is not susceptible to anticipatory pre-modulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In sum, the study achieved its goal of testing whether the motivation factor improves feedback control when different feedback loops are predominantly involved in various tasks. The experimental tasks are carefully designed to avoid multiple confounding factors, the analysis is solid, and most of the results are convincing (with the exception of the &quot;significant&quot; difference in Figure 5f). The study aim is more explorative than hypothesis-driven, thus limiting the insights we can obtain from the heterogeneous results. However, through systematically studying feedback loops in a unified experimental framework, the study provides more insights into the effect of motivation on sensorimotor feedback control in the aspect of response latency and gain and thus can serve as a new stepping stone for further investigations.</p><p>Labeling the experiments with numbers would be good, especially considering the paper also includes an online dataset (Figure 5g and 5h).</p></disp-quote><p>We considered labelling the experiments using numbers or even letters, but ultimately avoided it because it would assign arbitrary numbers to each experiment without semantic meaning attached to it, rendering the reading experience less explicit and thus more tedious.</p><p>Instead, we decided to actively name experiments with an explicit reference to their content (e.g., the cursor jump experiment is the experiment in which the cursor jumps halfway through the reach) to avoid forcing the reader to hold into memory a mental label-to-content “map”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Page 5: &quot;Next, we assessed the time of divergence of each participant's EMG activity between the reward and no-reward conditions using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) signal discrimination method…&quot;</p><p>Does this refer to the divergence of EMG activity from the baseline, not between the two conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>It refers to the divergence between the inward and outward perturbations conditions (see new figure 2b-d). We thank the reviewer for spotting out this typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2b: what do the two colors mean? Reward and no reward?</p></disp-quote><p>The colors refer to the two conditions that we contrast to show and characterize the SLR, in this specific case, trials with an inward perturbation and those with an outward perturbation. A legend has been added to the panels showing the task design across all figures, and kept consistent across all panels. We have also added more panels to further break down each experimental task design throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5f: though it is statistically significant, 8 out of 17 subjects showed increased (or unchanged) RT as opposed to reduced RT.</p></disp-quote><p>We also noted this trend, which we believe is due to a floor effect. We can see from the absolute reaction times in panel g that the participants whose reaction times are already fast in the non-rewarded condition show generally less change in reaction times with reward.</p><p>Thanks to the reviewer’s comment, we also noted an important mistake in the analysis of our proprioception-cued reaction times. In the main text and in our code, we define reaction times by finding when the triceps EMG signal rises 5 times above the trial baseline standard deviation for 5 ms consecutively. However, this is a very stringent criterion, which leads to a significant number of trials being thrown out for not meeting it (~20% of all trials across participants). In the updated version of the manuscript, we now use a more typical 3 standard deviations, which leads 91 out of 1836 trials being removed (~4.9%). Critically, this does not change the results in any meaningful way: we still observe a significant decrease in reaction times with reward, a widespread increase in feedback gains across all recorded muscles, and about a third of participants showing little to no change in reaction times with reward, as per the reviewer’s initial comment (see updated manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: Is the MT improvement a result of a movement speed increase not related to the cursor jump response that happens during the movement?</p></disp-quote><p>That is correct. Each of the tasks serve to highlight one aspect of movement relating to a feedback response, but it does not mean that the other feedback responses are unchanged (or for that matters even the feedforward drive). Therefore, if any other aspect of movement was sensitive to the rewarding context, the movement times would still benefit from those, even if this is not picked up by the particular task design. Assessing movement times is useful as a control to ensure that the varying reward was indeed effective at motivating participants in the first place. Otherwise, one may (rightfully) ask whether the varying reward was effective at all when faced with a non-significant result for a change in latency or in feedback gain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The target jump condition is theorized with longer latency than the cursor jump condition (Figure 8). Is this really the case? It appears that their RTs are similar.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study they appear similar indeed, which diverges from the literature. For that reason, we have indicated in figure 1 captions that “<italic>Latencies indicated here reflect the fastest reported values from the literature and not necessarily what was observed in this study.</italic>”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper proposes to classify feedback control by sensory domain and response latency, not by function. The argument is that &quot;…it does not macth any observed pattern here (Figure8)&quot;. But what pattern does this refer to? The fact that response latency and modality matter for the &quot;reward effect&quot; does not justify ditching the use of &quot;function.&quot; In my opinion, the more apparent pitfall would be the loose use of &quot;function&quot; terms for different tasks. For instance, I wonder whether associating the target jump task with online tracking of the goal is reasonable. Tracking is typically referred to as using an effector to follow or spatially match a moving visual target. It is certainly not the case for a reaching movement to a possibly-changing target that has not been attained yet. It appears to me that for the same function, people can design drastically different tasks; that's the real problem that the current study should emphasize.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important point. We agree with this, and it aligns with what we are arguing for, in that categorization based on sensory modality or neural pathway are factual and therefore objective, making it a more normative framework. However, categorization by function is also useful in some contexts, which we emphasize with this underlined segment (section 3.3):</p><p>“Therefore, while it may have value at a higher-order level of interpretation, we argue that a categorization of feedback loops based on function may not always be the most appropriate means of characterizing feedback control loops.”</p><p>We appreciate that the manuscript will greatly benefit from making the reviewer’s point more explicit. We have edited the end of section 3.3 to read:</p><p>“This may partially stem from the inherent arbitrariness of defining function and assigning a specific task to that function. In contrast, categorization based on neural pathways, neural regions involved, and sensory modality may result in more insightful interpretations, because they are biologically grounded, and therefore objective means of categorization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The question on how reward or value impacts feedback processes is important to understand. Previous studies highlight how reward impacts motor function. Given feedback is an important aspect of motor control, it is useful to know which feedback responses may be specifically impacted or altered by reward.</p><p>The manuscript uses a functional taxonomy suggested by Scott (2016) to define the behavioural contexts examined in the paper. A clear strength of the manuscript is the systematic evaluation of these feedback processes with distinct latencies. This resubmission addresses several issues raised in the initial review. Notably, most experiments have been redone to better align with the defined behavioural processes and the use of more standardized experimental approach and analyses techniques across experiments.</p><p>There are some methodological issues that are either poorly described or seem to be a problem. From the methods section, it looks like only the R2 and R3 epochs (50 to 100ms) were examined for each experiment. This doesn't make sense for experiments such as target and cursor jumps that only lead to EMG responses at ~100ms after the disturbance.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that focusing exclusively on the R2 and R3 epoch would be an issue for the reason mentioned above. The method section 4.6, second paragraph defines the time window in which the gains were estimated to be a 50 ms window starting at the latency time:</p><p>“To compute feedback gains, for each feedback response considered we defined a 50 ms window that started at that response’s latency found for each participant independently using ROC analysis.”</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, since the target jump and cursor jump conditions start at ~100 ms, then the window boundary will start at that point as well, and finish 50 ms later. To make this methodological point clearer, we have added the following at the end of section 2.5:</p><p>“Consistent with the previous experiments, we assessed feedback gains on all five recorded muscles in a time window of 50 ms following each participant’s response latency for the experiment considered (here a cursor jump).”</p><p>All figures throughout the manuscript also now indicate in the caption for the feedback logratio panel:</p><p>“Log-ratio G of feedback gains in the rewarded versus non-rewarded conditions in a [relevant duration here] ms window following the [relevant feedback response here] onset.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As well, magnitude changes are monitored for 4 different muscles, but why is there only one latency examined (last panels in most figures) and which muscle is being used is not clear for each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>EMGs were recorded for the same 5 different muscles for all experiments. The first paragraph of section 2 states:</p><p>“We recorded electromyographic signals (EMG) using surface electrodes placed over the brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major (clavicular head), posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii (short head).”</p><p>Additionally, each time the feedback gains are assessed throughout the manuscript, each muscle name is repeated with the associated statistics, e.g.:</p><p>“Feedback gains were greater in the rewarded condition for the triceps, deltoid, and brachioradialis in a 50 ms window following LLR onset (biceps: W=98, r=0.72, p=0.12; triceps: W=136, r=1, p=4.4e-4; deltoid: W=135, r=0.99, p=5.3e-4; pectoralis: W=96, r=0.71, p=0.15; brachioradialis: W=129, r=0.95, p=1.6e-3; Figure 3f-h).”</p><p>The same five muscles are used across all experiments where EMG signals are recorded, which was one of the main requests of the previous round of reviews. For each figure throughout the manuscript, the same five muscles are also enumerated in the feedback gains panel.</p><p>To make this clearer, in the methods section 4.5, the first sentence now reads:</p><p>“For each experiment, the EMG signals of the brachioradialis, triceps lateralis, pectoralis major (clavicular head), posterior deltoid, and biceps brachii (short head) were sampled at 1000 Hz, band-pass filtered between 20 Hz and 250 Hz, and then full wave rectified.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I think some of the points raised in the discussion need to be developed more including the addition of pertinent literature. Specifically, the section on 'categorizing feedback control loops', brings up the point that it might be better to not use functional processes as a framework for exploring feedback control. Instead, they suggest categorization should be based on neural pathways, neural regions and sensory modalities. There are no citations in this section. However, in the conclusion it appears they suggest this paragraph is about using a bottom-up approach based on pathways and neural regions rather than a top-down functional approach. If that is their message, then the bottom-up approach has been around since Sherrington (see also recent ideas by G. Loeb) and so it would be worthwhile to include some integration of existing ideas from the literature (if they are related). While this is a worthwhile conversation, I think the authors should be cautious in concluding from this one behavioural study on reward that we should just ignore functional processes. Perhaps the problem is the term of linking complex functional processes to single 'feedback loops' as such processes likely engage many neural pathways Notably, the present discussion states that the cortico-cerebellar feedback loop was not considered in the present study. However, it likely was involved. In fact, in the 1970s the R3 response was commonly associated with the cerebellar-cortical feedback pathway. The richness of brain circuits engaged after 100ms is likely substantive. Thus, there needs to be some caution on linking these behavoural experiments to underlying brain circuits. The value of thinking about behavioural function is not because function can be found in a single brain region or pathway. Rather it is to ensure tasks/experiments are well defined, providing a sound basis to look at the underlying circuits and neural regions involved.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the points brought up here as they enrich the content of the discussion on that matter. We have already developed this section in response to reviewer #1, and have added the following at the end of section 3.3 to further expand with reviewer #2’s comments:</p><p>“More generally, our results provide additional evidence in favour of a bottom-up approach to understanding the brain as opposed to a top-down approach. This approach is described as early as Sherrington (Burke, 2007; Sherrington, 1906), who put forward an organizational principle of the central nervous system tied to sensory receptor properties (extero-, proprio-, intero-ceptors, distance-receptors). More recently, Loeb (2012) proposed that the existence of an optimal high-order, engineering-like control design in the central nervous system is unlikely due to the constraints of biological organisms, a theory further detailed by Cisek (2019) from an evolutionary perspective.”</p><p>Following reviewer #1’s comments, we have also toned down the language of this section to ensure it does not represent a rebuttal greater than this study alone warrants.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From above, the key points I think need to be considered are defining the time epochs under study for each experiment (need to ensure reader knows for each experiment) and why latency in only one muscle and which one for each study. The other point is to expand section on categorizing feedback loops with the existing literature, as suggested above.</p></disp-quote><p>From the points raised above we do appreciate that the manuscript would greatly benefit from the methodology being more clearly described at the beginning of the Results section. We have added two paragraphs in section 2.1 for that purpose (see main text). We have also added panels describing the experimental design at hand for each figure across the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The diagrams are very well organized. However, I wonder if it would be useful to show the hand speed against time to highlight your point that movement times were faster in rewarded trials in either Figure 1 or 2. This may not be necessary for all figures, but the first few to give the reader some sense of how much hand speed/movement time was altered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. This has now been done throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is known that if one can obtain a reward, motor performance improves. The authors' aim is to answer the question which of the nested sensorimotor feedback loops that underly motor performance is/are affected by expected reward (and how).</p><p>The authors provide a large set of experimental conditions and show that their manipulation of the reward affects some aspects of the response to the perturbations in a latency-dependent way. The experiments are designed very similarly, so easy to compare. The authors succeed to a large extent in showing very convincingly that reward affects some feedback loops, but not others. However, there are some weaknesses, mainly in how the authors deal with the possibility that latencies might depend on reward. If this is the case, then the analysis becomes problematic, as the way the gain ratio is defined (based on differences) assumes equal latencies. The authors do not have a solid method to disentangle effects on latency from effects on gain.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. We acknowledge that there are advantages and disadvantages with either analysis methods. The reviewer’s last sentence summarizes this situation well: “The authors do not have a solid method to disentangle effects on latency from effects on gain”. Therefore, ideally one would observe the same result with each analysis method.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>, we show the feedback gain log-ratios for fixed time windows. The SLR time window has a 25 ms width and the other time windows have a 50 ms width, similar to the original analysis from the main text. The time windows are fixed: the SLR time window starts at 25 ms post-perturbation, the LLR time window starts at 50 ms, the target selection time window starts at 75 ms, and the remaining time windows (target and cursor jump, and reaction times) start at 100 ms. Overall, we observe a similar pattern of increase in feedback gains as with the original, latency-locked estimate of feedback gain log ratios (Figure 9).</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81325-sa2-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A weakness is that there is no clear theory to identify feedback loops. The most evident example is the use of the functions (the colour code in Figure 1). For instance, what is the difference between 'goal-switching' and 'on-line action selection'? To me, these two refer to the same function. Indeed, the latencies for on-line goal switching depend on the design of the experiment, and even be as short as those for on-line tracking of the goal (Brenner and Smeets 2022). Also, the difference in labeling the SLR and LLR is not straightforward. In figure 2, it is clear that there is a LL reflex that depends on reward, the function here is on-line control of the limb.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the use of function-based categorization inherently carries arbitrariness. In this study it is included for scholarly completeness, but in the discussion, we argue against it as well for similar reason (section 3.3). This also relates to other reviewers’ points on the matter. Based on this comment and the other reviewers’, we have expanded this section to better communicate the points developed here (see main text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the experiment of figure 3, that also yields a LLR, I see no reason why the function would not be the same, despite the task being different. The splitting of the LLR in a R2 and R3 makes things even more complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the LLR arises essentially in all experiments that employ a mechanical perturbation. For instance, besides figure 2 and 3, figure 4 shows a LLR response (figure 4 panel d), even though it is a different experimental design. The main point of the experiment and contrast used in figure 3 is that it leads to a divergence in EMG signals for the triceps muscle exactly when the LLR should arise (Pruszynski et al., 2008, Rapid Motor Responses Are Appropriately Tuned to the Metrics of a Visuospatial Task). This allows us to compute a clear estimate of the LLR latency for each individual and in the rewarded and non-rewarded conditions independently in that experiment.</p><p>The task in figure 3 is the same task as in figure 2, but the contrast used is different (see figures 2d and 3c). Based on the reviewer’s comment, we appreciate that this methodological approach was not clear enough at the beginning of the results, and we added two paragraphs to amend this in section 2.1 (see main text), as well as more panels to all figures breaking down the experimental design and contrast at hand.</p><p>We have also removed the R2-R3 comparison, as we agree in its current form, the manuscript does not clearly benefit from this comparison and detracts from the main motivation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, it is interesting that the authors label the feedback loops involved in experiment 3 to differ from those in experiment 2, although they have the same latency and same sensory input.</p></disp-quote><p>The latencies observed for figure 2 are in the 20-35 ms range, and those of figure 3 are in the 40-75 ms range (last panel for each figure).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second weakness is the discussion on the latency of the responses. We have shown previously that conclusions about effects of a manipulation on latency depend critically on the way latency is determined (Brenner and Smeets 2019). So the effect of reward on latency might be an artifact, and should be confirmed by using other methods to determine latency.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this study. It is a particularly interesting work in that it assesses several different means of estimating latencies. This study tests each method on empirical data, for which the “true” latency is unknown. In addition, testing the same methods on simulated data, for which the true latency is known, would naturally expend on these results, enabling us to assess each method’s actual accuracy, systematic bias, and robustness to noise. It would also allow us to compare these alternative methods to the method we use (Receiver Operating Characteristic; ROC).</p><p>To assess the true bias and robustness of each alternative method from Brenner and Smeets (2019), we created simulated data that diverge according to a piecewise linear function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Simulated data with gaussian noise (noise standard deviation = 0).</title><p>2).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81325-sa2-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We then tested each reaction time estimation method’s accuracy as we varied noise, which was a random gaussian process centred on 0.

We fitted the extrapolation line on rewarded and non-rewarded conditions independently (green and red, respectively). We can see that the resulting latencies (intersection of the extrapolation line and the null line, in black) occasionally represent an unreliable estimate. In comparison, the segmented linear fits on the area-under-curve (AUC) data are more reliable (Author response 6). This suggests that the EMG data we are dealing with in this study more closely relates to the high-noise regime from the simulation. The same general result was observed for other experiments in our study. We believe that this is mainly tied to the inherently noisy nature of EMG signals compared to e.g., kinematic data rather than the specifics of a given task design.</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Extrapolation method from Brenner and Smeets, 2019, on triceps EMG from the cursor jump task.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-81325-sa2-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa2fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><caption><title>ROC method from Weiler et al.</title><p>, 2015, on triceps EMG from the cursor jump task.

I am not convinced for 3 reasons: 1) by using a data-driven definition of the various reflex-epochs, the authors compare responses at different moments after the perturbation. We see for instance in figure 2h that the latency obtained for a single participant can differ 20 ms between the rewarded and non-rewarded condition (without any meaning, as the two conditions have the same latency, and the length of the arm was also not changed), so that the gain compares different epochs without any reason. Thus any uncertainty in the determined latency affects the values obtained for the gain-ratio. 2) the paper that defined these epochs (Pruszynski et al. 2008) used fixed periods for R1, R2 and R3. 3) the much older monkey-work by Tatton et al. reported consistent latencies for R1 and R2, and only variable latencies for R3. The authors do the opposite: assume a fixed latency of R3 (relative to R20, and variable for R1 and R2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this point. As mentioned in the response to the reviewer’s first comment, using fixed latencies for computing feedback gains yields the same result as the method employed in the main text.</p><p>We acknowledge that the use of the R1-R2-R3 terminology is confusing here as it does not match the canonical definition. For this reason, and because this analysis detracts from the main points of the manuscript in its current form, we have removed this analysis from the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third weakness is that the authors seem to claim that the changes in the feedback are causing better performance. The first aspect that troubles me is that only one factor of performance is provided (speed), but higher speed generally comes at the cost of reduced precision, which is not reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, there is a speed-accuracy trade-off in motor control (Wickelgren, 1977). However, rewarding participants tends to break that speed-accuracy trade-off, in that movements can be faster and as accurate (during upper arm reaching movements; Codol et al. 2020, J Neurosci) or faster and more accurate (during eye saccades; Mahonar et al. 2015, Current Biology). In reaching movements, one mechanism that explains this phenomenon is an increase in endpoint stiffness in a rewarding context at the end of the movement (Codol et al. 2020, J Neurosci). Importantly, the same study shows this increase in stiffness is absent at movement onset, which would have been an important confound in the current study otherwise (that last point was also discussed in the previous round of reviews).</p><p>DOIs for references</p><p>Wickelgren (1977): 10.1016/0001-6918(77)90012-9</p><p>Codol et al.

The authors do not even try to show that feedback and MT are correlated. The authors should then limit their claim to their finding that reward changes movement time and feedback mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>MTs are provided here as a control measurement to ensure rewarding context impacts performance at all. This is a suitable control measurement because MTs becoming shorter with reward is a well-established phenomenon. But performance improving with reward is generally not constrained to shorter MTs, and this is well-documented as well. This study does not attempt to characterize all the ways behaviour is improving because it is already done. Rather, we ask through what means may the sensorimotor system enable those behavioural improvements, specifically targeting the feedback control system. Some feedback loops will contribute to these improvements, and some will not, but all feedback loops (and other mechanisms such as stiffness control and noise reduction) are still taking place in every experiment presented here. For instance, we can see a clear LLR response in the triceps EMG of the Target Selection task (figure 4). Nevertheless, each experiment is designed to make a specific feedback response easily observable and so quantifiable, which then allows us to unambiguously assess whether that feedback response has changed with reward. In all experiments presented here, we should expect a change in MTs with reward, signifying that rewarding context is integrated by the sensorimotor system into the control policy. But we will not always see a correlation with the specific feedback response that task is probing, because that specific feedback response may not integrate that rewarding context. If so, the change in MT would be enabled by changes in other mechanisms that this specific task is not probing but that is still contributing to behaviour. So, correlation between feedback-related variables and MTs is not always expected and is in itself uninformative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A fourth weakness is their flexibility in the choice of their dependent measures, and (related) the excessive use of hypothesis testing (p-values). For instance, they measure the EMG from five muscles, and use sometimes all signals, and sometimes restrict themselves to the ones that seem most suited (e.g. when claiming that the latency is significantly reduced). Not analysing some signals because they are noisier gives an impression of p-hacking to me. Furthermore, by using more than one signal to test a hypothesis about a feedback loop, they should use a (Bonferroni?) correction for multiple testing. By reporting p-values rather than the differences themselves, the authors obscure the sign of the difference. A better strategy would be to report all differences with their confidence intervals and base your conclusion on this (the reader can check to what extent this ensemble of results indeed supports your conclusion).</p></disp-quote><p>In the context of ROC, “noisy” does not refer to the standard deviation of EMG signals, but rather the noise in the classification signal (area under curve, AUC) to produce above-chance classification. Even with similar standard deviation of the EMG, if a muscle’s activity does not diverge between conditions, one cannot estimate the latency of that (non-existent) divergence. For our study, this situation would indicate that there is no relation between the geometry of the task (orientation of movement) and the geometry of the muscle (orientation of pull) considered. Since there is little redundancy in the geometry of the muscles we recorded from (and in the musculoskeletal system overall), it is essentially impossible to find an experimental design that would result in two muscles diverging for the same movement, forcing one to decide pre-collection which muscle to emphasize. Here, we decided to emphasize the triceps in all our experiments to remain consistent with the experiment measuring the SLR and LLR, since this is the experiment that the reviewers had found most convincing and appealing in the first round of review.</p><p>We could have designed the experiments to emphasize another muscle (i.e., which muscle we want to emphasize is arbitrary). But having only one muscle whose EMG signal diverges between conditions prevents us from exploring all the muscle signals post-hoc and picking whichever would be the most convenient. In other words, since the muscle to analyse must be declared pre-collection, one cannot decide on post-hoc changes once data is collected. That situation is in fact robust to p-hacking rather than prone to it.</p><p>In addition, since we use the same muscle across experiment for estimating latencies, there is no rationale for changing post-hoc the muscle considered for one experiment without having to change it for all five experiments. And since the first experiment (assessing the SLR and LLR) is preserved from the first version of this draft, this acts as an anchor point preventing unchecked data mining with respect to which muscle to use for latency estimation.</p><p>More generally, we would like to point out that by re-designing and re-collecting four out of five experiments, the original (first) draft of this study acts as a check against data mining. The scientific question at hand, the variables of interest (feedback gain and latency), the analysis to estimate them (difference of integrals over a time window, ROC analysis), and statistical tests used (Mann-Whitney rank-sum tests) are all strictly the same as in the first draft.</p><p>The individual data of each statistical test is shown in the figures, alongside the group mean and bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors might want to add information on the correlation between changes in feedback gain/latency and changes in MT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.

Accordingly, we removed the averaged trajectories from the figures and main text since we do not make use of these averages and since trial-by-trial trajectories are sufficient to provide a sense of how a trial unfolds over time to the reader as was our primary purpose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 2d,e, 3d,e, etc: Unclear why the left panels with the trial-baseline are included, as it is visible in the right panels as well (from -50 to 0). In the right panel, use the same x-axis, so responses are more easily comparable. Please indicate the time-window under study by a bar on the time-axis. I understand that the time-window used varies a bit from participant to participant, you might show this by letting for instance the thickness or saturation of a bar at each time indicate the number of participants that contributes to that part.

For the Target Jump and Cursor Jump tasks, this was measured in a 50 ms window from 350 to 300 ms before target appearance instead of before displacement onset because movements were self-initiated, and displacements occurred during the movement.”</p><p>From the above quote, we can see that the 50 ms preceding the perturbation are not the same as the trial baseline for any of the experiments. For clarity, we have also added in section 4.5:</p><p>“For all experiments, the average trial baseline EMGs are displayed on a left axis next to the axis showing perturbation-aligned EMG signals.”</p><p>The left and right axes both contain the same amount of participant through the entire period shown (specifically, all of them).</p><p>We have now changed the units of δ MT panels from sec to ms throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2f: The caption text &quot;Feedback gains following SLR onset&quot; is not informative and even wrong.
