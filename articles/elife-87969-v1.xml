learnt associated signals are presumably encoded by associative memory cells. In the accumulation and enrichment of memory contents in lifespan, a signal often becomes a core signal associatively shared for other signals. One specific group of associative memory neurons that encode this core signal likely interconnects multiple groups of associative memory neurons that encode these other signals for their joint storage and reciprocal retrieval. We have examined this hypothesis in a mouse model of associative learning by pairing the whisker tactile signal sequentially with the olfactory signal, the gustatory signal, and the tail-heating signal. Mice experienced this associative learning show the whisker fluctuation induced by olfactory, gustatory, and tail-heating signals, or the other way around, that is, memories to multi-modal associated signals featured by their reciprocal retrievals. Barrel cortical neurons in these mice become able to encode olfactory, gustatory, and tail-heating signals alongside the whisker signal. Barrel cortical neurons interconnect piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortical neurons. With the barrel cortex as the hub, the indirect activation occurs among piriform, gustatory, and S1-Tr cortices for the second-order associative memory. These associative memory neurons recruited to encode multi-modal signals in the barrel cortex for associative memory are downregulated by <italic>neuroligin-3</italic> knockdown. Thus, associative memory neurons can be recruited as the core cellular substrate to memorize multiple associated signals for the first-order and the second-order of associative memories by neuroligin-3-mediated synapse formation, which constitutes neuronal substrates of cognitive activities in the field of memoriology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>associative learning</kwd><kwd>associative memory neuron</kwd><kwd>barrel cortex</kwd><kwd>synapses</kwd><kwd>neurons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jin-Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U2241209</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jin-Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81930033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Jin-Hui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The coactivity of cortical neurons in associative learning recruits them as associative memory cells based on their synapse interconnections by neuroligin-3-mediated synapse formation, which endorses the first order and the second order of associative memory.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Associative learning and memory are major forms of the information acquisition and storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byrne, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wasserman and Miller, 1997</xref>), in which multiple cross-modal signals are learnt associatively and memorized jointly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Memories to associated signals have been thought to be essential for the cognitive activities and emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kandel and Pittenger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silva et al., 2009</xref>). The cellular mechanism underlying associative memory was presumably based on an activity-dependent strengthening in the interconnection of cell assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebb, 1949</xref>), which has been supported by synaptic and neuronal plasticity during the learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Armano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bliss and LÃ¸mo, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliss and Lynch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lisman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). Although the neuronal plasticity influences the strengths in the formation of associative memory and the retrieval of memorized signals, this activity-dependent plasticity in a single neural pathway cannot interpret the associative memory featured by the joint storage and the reciprocal retrieval of associated signals specifically inputted from multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). Recent studies have discovered the recruitment of associative memory neurons in mice while they memorize the associatively learnt signals. These associative memory neurons show the synapse interconnections morphologically among coactive cross-modal cerebral cortices and encode the synapse signals functionally received from these cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2016</xref> ; ). These data have been supported by causal relationships between the recruitment of associative memory neuron and the formation of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Whether these associative memory neurons can be recruited with more extensive cross-modal interconnections and work as the core to translate the multiple signals directly and indirectly for the first order and second order of associative memory remains tested to strengthen the principle of coactivity together and interconnections together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>In the accumulation of memory contents during the postnatal growth, a signal may become the core signal shared by other signals for their reciprocal retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schacter et al., 2020</xref>). The auditory signal of âappleâ is shared with the visual signal about its shape/color, the gustatory signal about its taste, and the olfactory signal about its smell. The listening of this âappleâ sound by the auditory sensory modality can induce the reciprocal recalls of other appleâs features in different modalities. The thunderstorm signal often associates with other signals, for example, a heavy rain, something wetness, and flooding. A thunderstorm can lead to the logical reasoning about the forthcoming of the heavy rain and flooding in the cognition as well as the worry about their happening in the emotion. In terms of cellular bases of these memory retrievals, cognition, and emotion, we assume that neuronal assemblies in a single modality cortex may interconnect neuronal assemblies in other modality cortices by their coactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>) and that these neuronal assemblies become able to encode all of these associated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), that is, the recruitment of the associative memory neurons to encode multi-modal signals in the associative learning during the postnatal growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>). By the repetitive activations of these connected neurons in the retrievals of the associated signals, the interconnections of associative memory neurons in a single modality cortex with those associative memory neurons in other modality cortices may be further strengthened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebb, 1949</xref>). Through the activity-dependent interconnection and strengthening, associative memory neurons in this single modality may become a core station to translate other signals by jumping over the shared signal, or the retrieval of associative memory in the cross-core manner indirectly. For instance, the appleâs shape signal in the mind retrieves its taste signal or odor signal with jumping over the appleâs sound signal. The heavy rain signal may retrieve the flooding signal without thinking about the thunderstorm signal in the mind. The test of this assumption is critical to reveal the cellular substrate correlated to a wide range of brain functions in the cognition and the emotion in the field of memoriology.</p><p>In the present study, we intend to investigate the recruitment of associative memory cells in a single modality cortex that functions as the core to encode and translate the associated signals among multiple modalities as well as morphologically interconnect with other modality cortices. Strategies to test this hypothesis are presented below. A mouse model of associative learning was conducted by pairing whisker and odorant stimulations, whisker and tail stimulations, as well as whisker and gustatory stimulations sequentially. The formation of associative memory based on the core of the whisker signal was expectedly featured by reciprocal responses induced between whisker and olfactory signals, whisker and tail signals, as well as whisker and gustatory signals, similar to the cases about associative memory in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>). The interconnections of associative memory neurons among cross-modal cortices were examined by microinjecting anterograde and retrograde adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) carried genes for encoding fluorescent proteins into the barrel cortex and by detecting the expression of these fluorescent proteins in their interconnected cortical areas, or the other way around. The recruitment of associative memory neurons was ensured by detecting their convergent reception of synapse contacts between fluorescent-expressed axon boutons from presynaptic neurons and fluorescent-labeled dendritic spines on postsynaptic neurons in local areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>). The spike-encoding ability in response to these signals was used to ensure the recruitment of associative memory neurons functionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The role of neuroligin-3 in the recruitment of associative memory neuron was investigated by applying short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) that are specific to silence neuroligin-3 mRNA (AAV-DJ/8-U6-mNlgn3) in the barrel cortex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In this section, we present data about the recruitment of associative memory neurons in the core region correlated to the formation of associative memory and the role of neuroligin-3 in this process. The formation of associative memory was evoked by the pair-stimulations of the whisker signal with the odorant signal, the gustatory signal, and the tail signal sequentially. The associative memory neurons in the barrel cortex that was presumably the core region interconnected with piriform, gustatory, and S1-Tr cortices were functionally identified by in vivo electrophysiologically recording barrel cortical neurons in response to whisker, odorant, tail, and gustatory signals. The morphological identification of associative memory neurons in the barrel cortex was conducted by detecting convergent synapse innervations onto the barrel cortical neurons inputted from piriform, gustatory, and S1-Tr cortices alongside the interconnections of the barrel cortex with the piriform, gustatory, and S1-Tr cortices.

The formation of associative memory was accepted when the reciprocal retrievals of these associated signals emerge in PSG mice, such as odorant-induced whisker motion plus whisking-induced olfactory response, gustation-induced whisker motion plus whisking-induced gustatory response, as well as tail-heating-induced whisker motion plus whisking-induced tail swing.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The pair-stimulations of the whisker stimulus (WS) with the odor stimulus (OS), the tail-heating stimulus (TS), and the gustatory stimulus (GS) sequentially lead to odorant-induced whisker motion versus whisking-induced olfactory response, tail-heating-induced whisker motion versus whisking-induced tail swing, and gustation-induced whisker motion versus whisking-induced taste response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The associative learning in C57BL/6JThy1-YFP mice was conducted by the pair-stimulations of the whisker tactile signal with the olfactory butyl acetate signal, the whisker tactile signal with the sucrose taste signal, and the whisker tactile signal with the tail-heating signals sequentially in mice, which were assigned in paired-stimulus group (PSG), compared to mice in unpaired-stimulus group (UPSG), for 12 days.

The olfactory signal by giving butyl acetate appears to induce whisker fluctuations in PSG mice (an example in the middle trace of left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but not in UPSG mice (an example in bottom trace). Whisker fluctuation amplitudes, or whisking angles (degree), are 36.22Â±2.46 in PSG mice (red bar in right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; n=13) and 10.20Â±2.7 in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=14, p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). This odorant-induced whisker motion indicates the retrieval of the whisker signal by olfactory signal, that is, the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. On the other hand, the whisker signal by stimulating mouse whiskers in a âTâ maze appears to induce mice away from the butyl acetate due to the smelling of this odorant in PSG mice (an example in a top âTâ maze of left-top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), but not in UPSG mice (an example in a bottom âTâ maze of left-bottom panel). Percentages away from the butyl acetate block are 64.82 Â± 2.8% in PSG mice (red bar in the right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; n=17) and 48.20 Â± 4.62% in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=10, p&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA). This whisking-induced olfactory response indicates that the whisker signal induces the retrieval of the olfactory signal, or the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. Thus, the associative learning by pairing the whisker signal and the olfactory signal leads to the odorant-induced whisker motion and whisking-induced olfactory responses, that is, the reciprocal retrieval of the associated signals as a complete format of associative memory.</p><p>In the test of outcomes of associative learning by pairing the whisker signal and tail-heating signal, we analyzed the whisker fluctuation in response to the tail-heating signal and the tail swing in response to the mechanical whisker stimulation. The tail stimulation appears to induce whisker fluctuations in PSG mice (a sample in the middle trace of left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but not in UPSG mice (a sample in bottom trace). Whisker fluctuation amplitudes are 33.63Â±1.95 in PSG mice (red bar in right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; n=17) and 8.79Â±1.66 in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=10, p&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA). This tailing-induced whisker motion indicates the retrieval of the whisker signal by the tailing signal, that is, the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. On the other hand, the whisker signal by stimulating mouse whiskers appears to induce the tail swing in PSG mice (a sample in the left-top panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), but not UPSG mice (a sample in left-top panel). The durations of the tail swing in response to the whisker stimulus are 5.91Â±0.63 s in PSG mice (red bar in right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; n=17) and 1.13Â±0.36 s in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=10, p&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). This whisking-induced tail swing indicates the retrieval of the tail signal by the whisker signal, that is, the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. Thus, the associative learning by pairing the whisker signal and the tail signal leads to tailing-induced whisker motion and whisking-induced tail swing, or the reciprocal retrievals of these associated signals as a complete format of associative memory.</p><p>We also tested outcomes of associative learning by pairing the whisker signal and gustatory signal, in which the whisker fluctuation in response to the sucrose signal and the gustatory licking in response to the whisker stimulation were analyzed. The gustatory sucrose signal appears to induce the whisker fluctuation in PSG mice (a sample in the middle trace of left panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), but not in UPSG mice (a sample in bottom trace). Whisker fluctuation amplitudes are 35.27Â±2.62 in PSG mice (red bar in right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; n=17) and 10.33Â±1.96 in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=10, p&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA). This gustation-induced whisker motion indicates the retrieval of the whisker signal by gustatory signal, that is, the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. On the other hand, the whisker signal by stimulating mouse whiskers appears to evoke tongue-licking mouth lips in PSG mice (a sample in the left-top panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), but not UPSG mice (a sample in left-top panel). The times of tongue licking-out in response to whisker stimulus are 4.41Â±0.54 in PSG mice (red bar in right panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; n=17) and 0.3Â±0.15 in UPSG mice (blue bar; n=10, p&lt;0.0001, one-way ANOVA). The whisking-induced gustatory response implies the retrieval of the gustatory signal by the whisker signal, or the formation of associative memory in PSG mice. Therefore, the associative learning by pairing the whisker signal and the gustatory signal leads to gustation-induced whisker motion and whisking-induced gustatory response, or the reciprocal retrievals of these associated signals as a complete format of associative memory.</p><p>These types of associative memory are featured by the reciprocal retrievals of the associated signals, in which the whisker signal as a core is associated with the olfactory signal, the tail signal, and the gustatory signal. As our general knowledge, the barrel cortex encodes the whisker signal, the piriform cortex encodes the olfactory signal, the S1-Tr cortex encodes the tail signal, and the gustatory cortex encodes the taste signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brecht, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Olavarria et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogawa, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Petersen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson, 2001</xref>). These reciprocal forms of associative memory are likely based on a process that the barrel cortex interconnects the piriform cortex, the S1-Tr cortex, and the gustatory cortex, after the learning of such associated signals has been done and the memories to these associated signals are formed, as implied in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). If it is a case, we expect to observe that barrel cortical neurons mutually innervate cortical neurons in the piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices as well as convergently receive synapse innervations from these cortices by neural tracing. Moreover, these barrel cortical neurons become to encode all of these associated signals, that is, associative memory neurons of encoding multiple signals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Associative memory neurons are recruited in the barrel cortex for this core pattern</title><p>To study the interconnections of the barrel cortex with piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices, we microinjected AAV2/retro-CMV-EGFP and AAV2/8-CMV-tdTomato into the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). AAV2/8-CMV-tdTomato was uptaken and expressed in the somata of barrel cortical neurons, and tdTomato was transported to their axonal boutons and terminals in target regions in the anterograde manner. AAV2/retro-CMV-EGFP was uptaken by the axonal terminals and boutons of barrel cortical neurons, transported in the retrograde manner, and expressed in the somata of the neurons that projected to the barrel cortex. If the interconnections were formed between the barrel cortex and piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices after associative learning and memory, we should detect tdTomato-labeled axonal boutons and EGFP-labeled somata in piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices. It is noteworthy that much retrograde transportation of EGFP is detected in hippocampal CA1-CA3 areas from the mice experienced associative learning (PSG mice), in comparison with UPSG mice (right panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This substantially increased synapse innervation from the hippocampus to the barrel cortex after memory formation grants a possibility that the hippocampus strengthens memories. Together with an observation about the secondary associative memory cells in the hippocampus innervated from the primary associative memory cells in the barrel cortex (our unpublished data), we suggest that memories to specific signals in the barrel cortex and other cortices are facilitated and strengthened by the interactions between the hippocampus and cerebral cortices.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Associative learning by pairing whisker stimulus (WS) with the odor stimulus (OS), WS with tail-heating stimulus (TS), and WS with gustatory stimulus (GS) induces synapse innervations from PC, S1-Tr, and GC to BC, as well as from BC to PC, S1-Tr, and GC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The AAV2/retro-CMV-EGFP and AAV2/8-CMV-tdTomato were microinjected into the barrel cortex.

The suppression of the new synapse contacts on barrel cortical neurons inputted from piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices by neuroligin-3 knockdown indicates that the formation of new synapses and the recruitment of associative memory neurons require neuroligin-3-mediated synapse linkage. It is noteworthy that the learning-induced connection from the hippocampus to the barrel cortex disappears by the knockdown of barrel cortical neuroligin-3, indicating that new synapse innervations from the hippocampus to other cortices of memorizing specific signals is essential for the hippocampus to strengthen specific memory in cerebral cortices.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> presents the functional study about the suppression of associative memory neuron recruitment in the barrel cortex by the neuroligin-3 knockdown.

This associative learning by multiple pairs of cross-modal signals leads to the reciprocal form of associative memory, in which the reciprocal retrievals of these associated signals include odorant-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced olfactory response, tail-heating-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced tail swing, and gustation-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced gustatory response. In this model of associative learning, the whisker tactile signal is a common signal in the pairs of associated signals. After memory formation, the whisker motion is the common response induced by the paired signals during the retrieval of associative memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The whisker tactile sensation as a core signal commonly shared for olfactory, gustatory, and tail signals is based on mutual synapse innervations between the neurons in the barrel cortex and those neurons in the piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, certain barrel cortical neurons receive convergent synapse innervations from piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as well as encode the signals from these sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Such morphological and functional data indicate that barrel cortical neurons have been recruited as associative memory cells to encode associative memory correlated to the reciprocal retrievals of these associated signals in behavior tasks. Interestingly, with the interconnections of the barrel cortex with piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices, the excitation of piriform cortical neurons by the olfactory signal may indirectly activate S1-Tr and gustatory cortical neurons intermediated by the active barrel cortex, such that the odorant-induced tail swing and odorant-induced gustatory response emerge in the retrieval of associative memory, or the other way around (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). If the reciprocal retrievals of the associated signals between the whisker signal as a common signal and olfactory, tail and gustatory signals are thought of as the first order of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>), the reciprocal retrievals of the non-associated signals including olfactory, tail, and gustatory signals would be the secondary order of associative memory, upgrading those terms of the first order and the secondary order of Pavlovâs conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wasserman and Miller, 1997</xref>).

The classical conditioning usually includes Pavlovâs salivary-secretion conditioning, eye-blinking conditioning, and body-freezing conditioning induced by the bell ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bracha et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burhans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maren, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Perkowski and Murphy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Reijmers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woodruff-Pak and Disterhoft, 2008</xref>). The operant conditioning includes the pedal-pushing and the conditioned place preference induced by the foods or drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardo and Bevins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeLong, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLong, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tzschentke, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeLong, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McKendrick and Graziane, 2020</xref>). All of these conditioning models were formed by the associations of the bell ring with food, air-puffing, or electrical shock in the classical conditioning as well as the light with the pedal-pushing for food or drug rewards in the operant conditioning. In the studies of memory retrievals, the bell ring or the light was used to induce the conditioned responses that were evoked originally by the innate signals. Beyond these conditionings with a single direction, associative memory formed by the association of two or more signals in lifespan can be induced reciprocally. One signal evokes the responses originally induced by other signals, or the other way around, for example, the reciprocal retrievals between words in the sound signal and words-presented images in the visual signal. The reciprocal form of the associative memory has been previously shown in the associations of the whisker signal and the olfactory signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). The reciprocal form of associative memory through the associations of the whisker signal with the tail signal and of the whisker signal with the gustatory signal is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, the reports in the previous conditioning models have not systemically denoted the relationship between the common core signal (the bell ring or the light) and their paired signals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> in the present study shows that the whisker signal is the core signal commonly shared by multiple signals for their direct and indirect retrievals in the reciprocal form of the associative memory. In terms of their cellular substrates, our studies reveal the formation of new synapse interconnections between coactivated cerebral cortices by the barrel cortex as the core station or the hub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These data have not been thought and examined in previous studies about various conditioning models.</p><p>The accumulation and the enrichment of specific memory contents in the brain are fulfilled by learning more and more pairs of associated signals during postnatal development. One signal among these pair signals may become the common signal shared for their reciprocal retrievals and the cognitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schacter et al., 2020</xref>). The appleâs auditory signal can be a common signal shared by the visual signal of its shape and color, the gustatory signal of its taste and the olfactory signal of its smell. The listening of this appleâs vocal sound can induce the reciprocal retrievals of its other cross-modal features. The thunderstorm often associates heavy rain, something wetness and even flooding. The thunderstorm can lead to the reasoning about the forthcoming of heavy rain and flooding in the cognitive activities as well as the worry about their happening in the emotional reactions. To elucidate the cellular and molecular substrates for these cognitive and emotional activities commonly seen in the lifespan, we expect to establish an animal model in consistence with these phenomena. In the present study, we develop a mouse model of associative learning by giving multiple pairs of associated signals in distinct time points, in which one of such paired signals is a common signal for others. The associations of the whisker tactile with the olfactory signal, the tail-heating signal, and the gustatory signal are sequentially given to the mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After this associative learning, the reciprocal forms of the associative memory emerge in these mice, including odorant-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced olfactory response, tail-heating-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced tail swing, and gustation-induced whisker motion with whisking-induced gustatory response. The whisker signal is set as the common core of these signals and the whisker fluctuation appears to become the common core of their responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Therefore, the animal model with one signal to be a common core signal for the reciprocal form of the associative memory and the logical reasoning is established in our studies.</p><p>In terms of cellular substrates underlying these memory retrievals, cognitions and emotions with the common signal, the neuronal assemblies in the cerebral cortex for one modality may interconnect those neuronal assemblies in the cerebral cortices for other modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>), and these neuronal assemblies may encode all of these associated signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). In other words, associative memory neurons are recruited to encode multi-modality signals after associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). This hypothesis has been examined and proved in our studies. With experiencing the associative learning, mutual axon projections and synapse interconnections emerge between the neurons in the barrel cortex and the neurons in piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Barrel cortical neurons receive the convergent synapse innervations from piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Barrel cortical neurons become able to encode the signals inputted from these sensory cortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The synapse interconnections formed among the coactive cortices and the associative memory neurons recruited in the cortical area to encode a common core signal plus other associated signals endorse the hypothesis that memory retrievals, cognitive activities, and emotional responses are based on the common signals memorized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). Morphological and functional data in this study suggest that the barrel cortical neurons have been recruited as associative memory neurons to encode the joint storages and reciprocal retrievals of the whisker signal with other associated signals in behavioral tasks. Based on these associative memory neurons to encode a common signal plus other signals associatively learned previously, any one of these signals is able to induce the retrievals of other signals in associative memory as well as the associative processes during cognitive activities and emotional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>).</p><p>The associated signals in memories are often retrieved in any time of the lifespan. Based on the rules, the coactivity together and the interconnection together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>) as well as coactivity together and the strengthening together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebb, 1949</xref>), those cortical areas are interconnected and connection-strengthened after the learning of associated signals and the memory to these signals. With the repetitive activations of these interconnected neurons for the retrievals of those associated signals, associative memory neurons in the single modality cortex become a core station to translate those signals encoded by other cortices as well as to forward the signals from one of its interconnected cortices to others of its interconnected cortices, or the other way around (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). With these interconnections and associative memory neurons in the core station (or the hub), any one of these signals surrounding the signal encoded in the hub may become the signal associated with other surrounding signals, which have not been directly associated in previous associative learnings. Our studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> show this type of indirect retrievals of non-associated signals, likely they seem associated. The olfactory signal induces the retrievals of tail and gustatory signals, or the other way around, indirectly mediated by the active barrel cortex. This datum also explains those phenomena in the retrievals of non-associatively memorized signals in a cross-core manner indirectly. For instance, the appleâs shape signal in the mind can retrieve its taste signal or odor signal over the apple sound signal. The heavy rain signal retrieves the flooding signal over the thunderstorm signal in the mind. The data in behavior tasks and cellular mechanisms underlying these first-order and secondary-order associative memories in the retrieval of many signals are critically important to reveal a wide range of brain functions and their neural substrates.</p><p>Molecular substrates for the formation of new axon projections and synapse innervations as well as the recruitment of associative memory neurons in cerebral cortices have to be addressed. The microtubule prolongation and the synapse formation require activity-dependent epigenetic events from microRNA-324 and microRNA-133a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). As we know, the formation of new synapses is followed by the linkage and fixation of presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes through linkage proteins, such as neuroligin, neurexin, N-cadherin, ephrin, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Kang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LisÃ© and El-Husseini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uchigashima et al., 2021</xref>). In the present study, we have studied the requirement of neuroligin-3 for the synapse linkage and fixation. Neuroligin-3 mRNA knockdown by its specific shRNA in the barrel cortex significantly inhibits the formation of new synapses innervated from coactive cortices and the recruitment of associative memory neurons in the barrel cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), in addition to the suppression of associative memory formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Therefore, our studies indicate that synapse linkage and fixation are essential for the recruitment of associative memory neurons based on the formation of new synapses. With the rule of coactivity together and interconnection together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>), the cascade from the inputs of associated signals during associative learning to the recruitment of associative memory neurons for memory formation may include these following steps, the coactivity of somatosensory cortical neurons by their intense action potentials, the alternation of epigenetic processes by microRNA-324/133, the expression of neuroligin-3, and the synapse linkage for new synapse formation in these cortical neurons. In addition to neuroligin-3, other molecules including NET3 and ttbk1 have been found to be involved in the formation of new synapse innervations and the recruitment of associative memory neurons for the formation of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><p>Associative memory neurons are recruited in the formation of associative memory after the associative learning by pairing whisker tactile, olfaction, gustation, and tail temperature signals in the present study and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Associative memory neurons are featured by their recruitment from coactive neurons, the synapse interconnections among coactive neurons, the convergent synapse innervations onto these coactive neurons from the new and innate inputs, as well as the encoding of multiple signals inputted from these synapse innervations on these coactive neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). In another study, the social stress by the association of the stressful signals, including the battle sound produced from the mouse fighting, the pain from body injury regions, and the visual image from the fighting scene, results in fear memory and anxiety. Some neurons in the somatosensory cortex interconnect with auditory and visual cortical neurons receive the synapse innervations from the auditory cortex, the visual cortex, and the thalamus, as well as encode these stressful signals from auditory, visual, and somatosensory systems, that is, recruited as primary associative memory neurons. Moreover, the prefrontal cortical neurons are recruited as secondary associative memory neurons by receiving convergent synapse innervations from these sensory cortices as well as encode their inputted stressful signals (our data ready to be published). Two lines of evidences reveal the recruitment of associative memory neurons during associative learning. With such two mouse models of the associative learning, we have identified associative memory neurons for the joint storage and the reciprocal retrieval of multiple signals associated during the learning, which strengthens the concept of associative memory cells as basic units in memory traces or engrams for the associative learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). This strengthened conclusion also encourages those memoriologists to examine whether associative memory neurons are recruited in other types of the associative learning and memory under their investigations.</p><p>Associative memory is based on the recruitment of associative memory neurons. Moreover, the function and the connection of these neurons are strengthened. For instance, barrel cortical neurons are functionally upregulated in their spiking frequencies in response to the input signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) as well as their morphological interconnections with other brain areas are raised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The decreases in spiking thresholds and refractory periods as well as the increase of synapse-driving force strengthen neuronal activities. The morphological upregulation of synapse interconnections among associative memory neurons can enhance their spike-encoding ability. In addition, the coactivity of associative memory neurons may trigger the activation of intracellular Ca2+/calmodulin signaling pathway. This signaling pathway can initiate the conversion of silent synapses into functional synapses and the conversion of inactive synapses into active synapses to strengthen the synapse-driving force and increase the activities of associative memory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liao et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang and Kelly, 2001</xref>) as well as to upregulate neuron-encoding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2008</xref>), which leads to the strengthening of associative memory. Taken these together, our studies support the hypothesis about the activity-dependent positive recycle in the recruitment and the refinement of associative memory neurons for the formation and the strengthening of associative memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>). In other words, our studies endorse two ideas in the field of memorioscience, that is, the coactivity together and the interconnection together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>) as well as the coactivity together and the strengthening together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hebb, 1949</xref>). Memorioscience refers to science in relevance to discovering the regulations and mechanisms of memory formation and strengthening under physiological and pathological conditions as well as to developing the approaches for the improvement of memory deficits.</p><p>In summary, our studies present that the barrel cortex can become the core station for the first-order and secondary-order associative memory. Barrel cortical neurons can be recruited as associative memory neurons, in addition to the interconnections between the barrel cortex and piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices. Animals are able to conduct the retrievals of newly learned signals based on these new synapse interconnections in the barrel cortex as the wire-hub among coactive cortices, alongside the retrieval of the innate signals through their innate circuits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Molecular substrates for such cellular changes are based on the activity-dependent epigenetic processes and neuroligin-3-mediated synapse linkage. Thus, the coactivity of the cerebral cortices in the associative learning induces the formation of their interconnection, which can endorse the first order and the secondary order of associative memory. Associative memory neurons in the cerebral cortices are recruited by mutual synapse innervations based on neuroligin-3-mediated synapse linkage. Our study appears an initiative that reveals the associative memory neurons and their assemble circuits as the neural basis of cognitive activities and emotional responses in the field of memory science. In this regard, the learning of associated signals can be thought of as the coactivation of sensory cortices that encode these signals. Associative memory can be thought of as the activity-dependent formation of new interconnections among these cortices and the convergent synapse innervations on coactive neurons by new synapses and previous synapses, which is the feature of the recruitment of associative memory neurons in the early development to memorize unitary and simple signals, as well as the activity-dependent strengthening of these synapse connections among associative memory neurons in the following periods to memorize those complex signals organized from unitary/simple signals. The retrieval of associative memory can be thought of as the reactivation of these associative memory neurons by exogenous cues or endogenous thinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Barrel cortical neurons are recruited to be associative memory neurons in the hub-like core station, based on the synapse interconnections with piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortices, in addition to their intramodal interconnection.</title><p>Molecular substrates for these cellular changes are based on the activity-dependent epigenetic processes and neuroligin-3-mediated synapse linkage.

The timeline of our experiments was executed in the following steps, the separation of these mice randomly into PSG and UPSG, the injections of AAVs into their barrel cortices, the uses of the training paradigm in mice for 2 weeks after this surgical operation of AAV injection was done about 48 hr, the maintenance of these mice in their living houses about 5 days, and then the morphological and electrophysiological studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Behavioral study</title><p>The paradigm of associative learning was pairing the signals of whisker tactile with odorant, gustation, or tail-heating in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>). The whisker signal was mechanical vibrate stimuli (5 Hz) to longer whiskers for 20 s, which were the contralateral side of the barrel cortex for searching associative memory neurons recruited during associative learning. The whisker signal intensity was enough to evoke whisker fluctuations, or the innate whisking-induced whisker motion. The odor signal was the butyl acetate pulse closely to the noses for 20 s, which was given by switching on a butyl acetate-containing tube to generate a small liquid drop in front of the noses. The intensity of butyl acetate reached to the level of activating olfactory bulb neurons, which had been ensured by the two-photon cell imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The tail-heating signal was given by using the heat plate that touch the distal ends of mouse tail. The tail-heating signal intensity was about 45 Â± 2Â°C that was enough to induce the tail swing away from this heating plate within 10 s. This temperature did not make the injury of thick skin on the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2000</xref>). The gustatory signal was administered by giving a sucrose drop (0.06 mol/l) to mouse lips and teeth, where this concentration sufficiently induced tongue lickings to mouth lips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vincis and Fontanini, 2016</xref>). The response to this sucrose in the mice was the licking of their tongues to their mouth lips within 20 s.</p><p>The detailed paradigm of the associative learning has been described in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, the mice were divided into two groups, PSG and UPSG. In PSG mice, the paradigms of the associative learning were the pairing of whisker tactile with butyl acetate stimulations for 20 s, the pairing of whisker tactile with tail-heating for 20 s, and the pairing of whisker tactile with sucrose for 20 s sequentially, in which the intervals for each of these pairing stimulations were 5 min. The paired-stimulations to PSG mice in the paradigm of associative learning were lasted for 20 s within each of times, were given five times per day with 2 hr intervals, and were used for 12 days. In UPSG mice, the paradigm for unpaired-stimulations was featured by whisker tactile, butyric acid, tail-heating, and sucrose stimulations sequentially, where the intervals for each of these stimulations were 5 min. The unpaired-stimulations to all UPSG mice lasted for 20 s in each of individual stimulations and five times per day in 2 hr intervals for 12 days. The setting of these paradigms was based on a fact that the onsets of reciprocal retrievals in these associated signals reached to their plateau level by training approximately 10 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

On the other hand, the olfactory response to butyl acetate by odorant selection in T-maze, the gustatory response to sucrose by tongue-licking lips, as well as the pain response to tail-heating by tail swing, which were induced by the whisker stimulation, were measured to identify the reciprocal retrieval of associative memory that had been formed in paired-training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). To quantify the onset time and the strength of whisker responses induced by odorant, gustation, or tail-heating, the whisker fluctuations in response to these testing stimulations (20 s) of butyl acetate, sucrose, and tail-heating were recorded by the digital video camera (HDR-AS100V, SONY, Japan; 240 fps) after the training. The whisker motions induced by butyl acetate, sucrose, or tail-heating, or the formation of associative memory, were accepted if whisker fluctuations met the following criteria. The patterns of odorant-induced whisker motion, gustation-induced whisker motion, and tail-heating-induced whisker motion were similar to innate whisker motions induced by the whisker stimulation, but differed from spontaneous low-magnitude whisking. The whisking frequencies and angles raised significantly in PSG mice, compared to those in baseline controls and UPSG mice. The patterns of whisker fluctuations in odorant-induced whisker motion, gustation-induced whisker motion, and tail-heating-induced whisker motion were originally presented in the whisker stimulus, such that the odorant, gustatory, and tail signals triggered the recall of the whisker signal and then the whisker motions similar to the innate reflex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).

Theoretically and practically, AAV2/8-CMV-tdTomato was uptaken and then expressed in barrel cortical neurons, where the red fluorescent protein (RFP) was produced.

Electrophysiological recordings to barrel cortical neurons in vivo were conducted in the mice under the light anesthetic condition with the withdrawal reflex by pinching, the eyelid blinking reflex by air-puffing, and the muscle relax. The unitary discharges of cortical neurons in the category of local field potential were recorded in layers II-III of the barrel cortices by using glass pipettes filled with a standard solution (150 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, and 5 mM HEPES). The resistance of those recording pipettes was 30â50 MÎ©. The electrical signals of barrel cortical neurons in their spontaneous spikes and evoked spikes by the whisker, odorant, gustatory, or tail stimulations were recorded and acquired by AxoClamp-2B amplifier and Digidata 1322A, and were analyzed by pClamp 10 system (Axon Instrument Inc, CA, USA). Spiking signals were digitized at 20 kHz and filtered by a low-pass at 5 kHz. The 100â3000 Hz band-pass filter and the second-order Savitzky-Golay filter were used to isolate the spike signal. Spiking frequencies were quantitatively analyzed. Relative spike frequencies in response to the whisker, odorant, tail, and gustatory stimulations were the ratio in that spike frequencies in response to these stimuli were divided by spontaneous spike frequencies in 20 s before the stimulations. When the ratio of evoked-spike frequencies by a stimulus to spontaneous spike frequencies reached 1.7 or above, barrel cortical neurons were deemed as the response to this stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). The associative memory neurons were accepted by detecting a situation that barrel cortical neurons respond to at least two sources of those paired signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang, 2019a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>The study of molecular mechanism for the recruitment of associative memory cells</title><p>In the study of the role of neuroligin-3, one of the proteins for synapse linkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Kang, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LisÃ© and El-Husseini, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Uchigashima et al., 2021</xref>), in the formation of new synapse innervations and the recruitment of associative memory cells in the barrel cortex, the approach of mRNA knockdown was applied by the shRNA specifically for neuroligin-3 mRNA that was carried by AAVs and was microinjected in this cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khatri et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pardridge, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pushparaj et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rao et al., 2009</xref>). The microinjections of AAV-DJ/8-U6-mNlgn3-GFP (pAAV[shRNA]-U6-mNlgn3-EGFP) into the barrel cortex were done 3 days prior to the training paradigm of associative learning. This approach was expected to deteriorate the expression of neuroligin-3 in barrel cortical neurons, to prevent the formation of new synapse innervations from piriform, gustatory, and S1-Tr cortical neurons as well as to weaken the recruitment of associative memory neurons in the barrel cortex. The experiments in neuroligin-3 knockdown were conducted with AAV-mediated neural tracing and electrophysiological recording to examine its effectiveness on the morphology and function of associative memory cell recruitment. After the training paradigm of associative learning, those mice in the subgroups of shRNA and scramble-shRNA control within PSG were examined about their behaviors in memory tasks, convergent synapse innervations on barrel cortical neurons, as well as their electrophysiological activities in response to the whisker, olfactory, gustation, and tail stimulations. The quantities of barrel cortical neurons in response to those whisker, olfactory, gustatory, and tail signals were analyzed and compared in these two subgroups. The effectiveness of shRNA specific for neuroligin-3 on new synapse formation and associative memory cell recruitment was confirmed if the number of new synapse contacts and associative memory neurons in the subgroup of neuroligin-3 shRNA was significantly lowered in comparison with shRNA control subgroup.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>All data are presented as arithmetic mean Â± SEM.

In addition, more details and clarification of the experimental methods are needed.</p><p>Thank you so much for your comments on our studies in terms of the recruitment of associative memory neurons as the hub for the joint storage and reciprocal retrieval of multi-modal associated signals. You are right about that the concept of associative memory neuron and the new established interconnection among cerebral cortices for the formation of associative memory are not novel. The original finding has been reported by senior authorâs lab many years ago, which has also been presented in a book by Jin-Hui Wang âAssociative Memory Cells: Basic Units of Memory Traceâ published by Springer-Nature 2019. In addition, we have made certain clarifications in our revision, but the detailed information about experimental approaches and concepts are expected to be seen in our previous publications and this book as well.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have two points that I find would strengthen the manuscript further:</p><p>1. Associative memories are also based on specificity, which is not addressed in this manuscript. The authors could discuss this and also the magnitude of plasticity. In general, I would suggest also testing plasticity in response to a non-linked stimulus to prove specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>This a good point. In terms of the specificity of associative memory in our model, we have shown this point in our previous studies, such as Wang, et al. âNeurons in the barrel cortex turn into processing whisker and odor signals: a cellular mechanism for the storage and retrieval of associative signalsâ. Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience 9-320:1-17 2015, and Jin-Hui Wang âAssociative Memory Cells: Basic Units of Memory Traceâ published by Springer-Nature 2019.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Nlg3 knock-down is a strong intervention. The authors could discuss the implications of interfering with synapse assembly and mechanistic implications at the synaptic level. It could help to compare the consequences of this intervention to a post-training lesion.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. To prevent the possibility of post-training lesion by the intervention of Nlg3 knockdown, we have conducted the use of shRNA-scramble control. In addition, the discussion about the intervention of Nlg3 knockdown at synapse level has been added in our discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In general, the clarity of the wording in some sections/sentences could be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>The rewording of certain sentences has been done in our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. The writing of the manuscript needs major editing, there are grammatical errors even in the title. The extremely long introduction and discussion section with repeated details can be distracting from the main focus of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been taken during our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Many bar graphs, such as Figure 5C and 5G, Figure 6C-6G, have low-resolution images, meaning that the axis titles and labels are unreadable.</p></disp-quote><p>The resolution of Figures have been improved in our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The bar graph with data points and illustration in Figure 1E and 1G are misplaced.</p></disp-quote><p>This mistake has been corrected in our revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. On page 23, Figure 2B, which layer(s) of the PC, S1Tr and GC were the images taken from? In the PSG group, why is there no red axon terminal signal observed in the three regions? does it indicate that there is no significant projection from the BC axon to PC, S1Tr, or GC neurons? Given that Thy1-YFP labeled glutamatergic neurons at PC, S1Tr, and GC and there is no discernable co-localization of yellow and green cells, can we assume that the glutamatergic neurons at PC, S1Tr, and GC are not involved in the associative learning after PSG paradigm? Lastly, the number of synapse contacts in Figure 2E is only 1-2 per 100um dendrite, but this is not quite consistent with the confocal images in Figure 2D. In Figure 2D, there are at least three tdTomato boutons on the cropped dendrite which is ~16um according to the scale bar.</p></disp-quote><p>If we magnify Figure 2B, we are able to see red boutons, which can be seen in Figure 2C with a higher magnification. In addition, the distribution of synapse contacts is variable, we have demonstrated the averaged values of synapse contacts over dendrites in Figure 2E, such that the single original image may not exactly same as the statistical data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 4C and Figure 8C, how were the percentages of associative neurons calculated after LFP recording? More details are needed on the method of this in vivo LFP/single unit recordings, including the spike sorting algorithm.</p></disp-quote><p>In the section of Results, the total number of neurons recorded in each of groups has been given. For instance, the neurons recorded from PSG mice (Figure 4) were 70, which was used as denominator. With the number of neurons that responded to two or more signals, the percentage of associative memory neurons recruited in associative learning was calculated. This information has been added in our revision (please see the section of Results).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The rationale for the authors choosing Neuroligin 3 as the target for investigating the formation of new synapse interconnections between BC, PC, S1Tr, and GC after PSG should be more clearly spelled out. Synaptic CAMs include SynCAM, NCAM, Neurexin, Cadherin et al all play a role in new synapse formation. Neuroligin 1 is expressed specifically in the CNS at excitatory synapses. Why did the authors choose to study Neuroligin 3 instead of Neuroligin 1?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point. Based on our previous data, miRNA-324 is upregulated during the associative learning by our mouse model, which degrades neuroligin-3 mRNA. The role of neuroligin-3 in the formation of new synapses and the recruitment of associative memory neurons is studied in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The behavioral results in Figure 5B-5G indicated that after pair-stimulation of WS-OS, WS-TS, or WS-GS, the memory learned in piriform, S1-Tr and gustatory cortical neurons can be retrieved from each other, by jumping over the barrel cortex. Is it possible that there is some direct interconnection formed between piriform, S1-Tr, and gustatory cortical neurons? Maybe they can try to do barrel cortical lesion or chemogenetic inhibition after PGS training and then repeat the behavioral tests as in Figure 5B-5G.</p></disp-quote><p>We have done experiments to examine the potential direct interconnection among piriform, S1-Tr and gustatory cortical neurons, after the associative learning about twelve days. We have no convincing data to support this possibility at this moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Some of the images showing the location of virus injections look VERY similar, such as Figure 3A left and right, Figures 7A and 7D. Larger variability of different animals/injection sites is definitely expected.</p></disp-quote><p>The injected viruses in Figure 3 and Figure 7 are different, since AAV-carried fluorescent proteins in different cortical areas are different. In addition, if we carefully enlarge the images in the right and left panels of Figure 3A, we will see that the areas of AAV transfection in morphology are different. The similarity of injection areas as Reviewer two claimed indicates the more precision of our virus-injection sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. On page 49, are the green neurons in Figure 9B the BC cells? Just to be consistent, the authors should use the same color for BC cells as in Figure 9A. Also, label the primary and the secondary associative memory cells in Figure 9.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 9 has been thoroughly changed in our revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
