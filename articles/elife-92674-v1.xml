in cross-sectional area). Muscle fibers are largely composed of myofibrils, but whether radial growth is mediated by an increase in the size of the myofibrils (i.e. myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e. myofibrillogenesis) is not known. Electron microscopy (EM) can provide images with the level of resolution that is needed to address this question, but the acquisition and subsequent analysis of EM images is a time- and cost-intensive process. To overcome this, we developed a novel method for visualizing myofibrils with a standard fluorescence microscope (fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution [FIM-ID]). Images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines for automated measurements of myofibril size and number. After extensively validating the automated measurements, we used both mouse and human models of increased mechanical loading to discover that the radial growth of muscle fibers is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Collectively, the outcomes of this study offer insight into a fundamentally important topic in the field of muscle growth and provide future investigators with a time- and cost-effective means to study it.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Approximately 45% of human body mass is made of skeletal muscle. These muscles contract and relax to provide the mechanical forces needed for breathing, moving, keeping warm and performing many other essential processes. Both sedentary and active adults lose approximately 30-40% of this muscle mass by the age of 80, increasing their risk of disease, disability and death. As a result, there is much interest in developing therapies that can restore, maintain and increase muscle mass in older individuals.</p><p>Muscles are made of multiple fibers that are in turn largely composed of smaller units known as myofibrils. Previous studies have shown that performing resistance training or other exercise that increases the mechanical loads placed on muscles stimulates muscle growth. This growth is largely due to increased girth of the existing muscle fibers. However, it remained unclear whether this was due to myofibrils growing in size, increasing in number, or a combination of both.</p><p>To address this question, Jorgenson et al. developed a fluorescence imaging method called FIM-ID to count the number and measure the size of myofibrils within cross-sections of skeletal muscle. Using FIM-ID to study samples of mouse and human muscle fibers then revealed that increasing mechanical loads on muscles increased the number of myofibrils and this was largely responsible for muscle fiber growth.</p><p>FIM-ID mostly relies on common laboratory instruments and free open-source software is used to count and measure the myofibrils. Jorgenson et al. hope that this will allow as many other researchers as possible to use FIM-ID to study myofibrils in the future. A better understanding of how the body controls the number of myofibrils may lead to the development of therapies that can mimic the effects of exercise on muscles to maintain or even increase muscle mass in human patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>exercise</kwd><kwd>growth</kwd><kwd>skeletal muscle</kwd><kwd>ultrastructure</kwd><kwd>myofibril</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR074932</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hornberger</surname><given-names>Troy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000069</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AR082816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hornberger</surname><given-names>Troy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM141739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McIntosh</surname><given-names>Mason C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016538</institution-id><institution>National Strength and Conditioning Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Doctoral Student Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mesquita</surname><given-names>Paulo HC</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel imaging method for measuring myofibril size/number reveals that the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to increased mechanical loading is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comprising ~45% of the body’s mass, skeletal muscles are not only the motors that drive locomotion, but they also play a critical role in respiration, whole-body metabolism, and maintaining a high quality of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Izumiya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srikanthan and Karlamangla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McLeod et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seguin and Nelson, 2003</xref>). Indeed, both sedentary and active adults will lose 30–40% of their muscle mass by the age of 80, and this loss in muscle mass is associated with disability, loss of independence, an increased risk of morbidity and mortality, as well as an estimated $40 billion in annual hospitalization costs in the United States alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seguin and Nelson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janssen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Proctor et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pahor and Kritchevsky, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goates et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the development of therapies that can restore, maintain, and/or increase muscle mass is of great clinical and fiscal significance. However, to develop such therapies, we will first need to define the basic mechanisms that regulate skeletal muscle mass.</p><p>Skeletal muscle mass can be regulated by a variety of different stimuli with one of the most widely recognized being mechanical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bodine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Bamman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roberts et al., 2023</xref>). For instance, a plethora of studies have shown that an increase in mechanical loading, such as that which occurs during resistance exercise (RE), can induce radial growth of the muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conceição et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ema et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Williams and Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, however, the ultrastructural adaptations that drive this response have not been well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Haun et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, a number of seemingly simple and fundamental important questions have not been answered. For instance, during radial growth, the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the muscle fiber increases, but whether this is mediated by an increase in the CSA of the individual myofibrils (i.e. myofibril hypertrophy) and/or the number of myofibrils (i.e. myofibrillogenesis) has not been resolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashmore and Summers, 1981</xref>).</p><p>A longstanding model in the field proposes that the radial growth of muscle fibers can be explained by a process called ‘myofibril splitting’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson and Goldspink, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldspink, 1983</xref>). The myofibril splitting model was developed by Goldspink in the 1970s and contends that, during radial growth, myofibrils initially undergo hypertrophy. Then, as the CSA of the myofibrils increases, the outward radial force that they exert on the Z-disc increases. The outward radial forces place a strain on the center of the Z-disc, and when the forces reach a critical threshold the Z-disc will break. It is proposed that the break will begin at the center of the Z-disc and form a longitudinal split that will then propagate through the remainder of the myofibril and, in turn, result in the formation of two smaller daughter myofibrils. It is also proposed that the daughter myofibrils can undergo a cycle of further hypertrophy and splitting, and this cycle will continue until the radial growth of the muscle fiber ceases.</p><p>In support of his model, Goldspink published numerous images of single myofibrils that appeared to split into two smaller daughter myofibrils, as well as quantitative data which demonstrated that longitudinal splits usually occur in myofibrils that are significantly larger than myofibrils that do not contain splits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson and Goldspink, 1976</xref>). Indeed, the model seemed so convincing that, when discussing how an increase in mechanical loading leads to the growth of muscle fibers, Goldspink concluded “<italic>The number of myofibrils increases</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldspink and Howells, 1974</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldspink and Howells, 1974</xref>)<italic>, and this is almost certainly due to the longitudinal splitting of existing myofibrils rather than</italic> de novo <italic>assembly</italic>” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldspink, 1983</xref>). This statement has been highlighted because, for decades, the myofibril splitting model has served as the textbook explanation of how muscle fibers undergo radial growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacIntosh and McComas, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Komi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourne, 1972</xref>). However, after performing an exhaustive review of the literature, it was clear that this model has not been rigorously tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>). In fact, in many instances, the potential implications of the model are based on erroneous claims. For instance, in Goldspink’s aforementioned conclusion, neither reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goldspink and Howells, 1974</xref>), nor any other study that we are aware of, has ever shown that an increase in mechanical loading leads to an increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber. Thus, one is left to wonder why this widely cited model of growth has not been rigorously tested.</p><p>When considering currently available technologies, electron microscopy (EM) would be viewed as the gold standard method for testing the myofibril splitting model; however, EM has several drawbacks/limitations. For instance, electron microscopes are highly specialized instruments, and their use requires immense training and potentially cost-prohibitive user fees. Furthermore, the extensive fixation and processing required for EM often yields samples that are not readily amenable to immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">D’Amico et al., 2009</xref>), and EM images typically do not have a high degree of contrast between the area that is occupied by the myofibrils and the intermyofibrillar components that surround the myofibrils (e.g. the sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR], see Figure 4A). The latter point is particularly important because it serves as a barrier to the development of programs that can perform automated measurements of features such as myofibril CSA and myofibril number. Thus, with EM, such measurements would need to be manually derived.</p><p>To gain insight into the effort that manual measurements of myofibril CSA would require, we collected pilot data from EM images of mouse skeletal muscles. We then used Cochran’s formula to determine how many myofibrils per fiber would have to be measured to estimate the mean myofibril CSA with a 5% margin of error at a 95% level of confidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cochran, 1977</xref>). The outcomes revealed that &gt;180 myofibrils per fiber would have to be manually traced. Bear in mind that estimating the average myofibril CSA for the entire sample would require measurements from multiple fibers. For instance, if just 20 fibers per sample were analyzed, it would require the manual tracing of &gt;3600 myofibrils. Taking this a step further, it would mean that a two-group comparison with 7 samples per group would require the manual tracing of &gt;50,000 myofibrils. In our hands, it took 1 hr to measure ≈125 myofibrils, and thus the simple two-group comparison described above would require ≈400 hr of manual tracing. With numbers like this, it was easy to appreciate why the basic elements of Goldspink’s model have not been rigorously tested. Thus, the first goal of this study was to develop a time- and cost-effective method for visualizing myofibrils with a level of resolution and contrast that would support automated measurements of myofibril size and myofibril number. With this method in hand, we then set out to answer the fundamentally important question of whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of the fixation, cryoprotection, and sectioning conditions for FIM-ID</title><p>As explained in the Introduction, one of the primary goals of this study was to develop a time- and cost-effective method for visualizing myofibrils with a level of resolution and contrast that would support automated measurements of myofibril size. To accomplish this, we took advantage of the fact that myofibrils are largely surrounded by an SR that is highly enriched with an enzyme called the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rossi and Dirksen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandl et al., 1987</xref>). There are two major isoforms of SERCA (SERCA1 which is found in Type II fibers, and SERCA2 which is found in Type I fibers), and monoclonal antibodies for each isoform have been in existence for many years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brandl et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braun et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johansson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Majerczak et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Periasamy and Kalyanasundaram, 2007</xref>). Importantly, these antibodies have been shown to possess excellent reactivity in both flash-frozen and aldehyde-fixed tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rudolf et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toral-Ojeda et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that these antibodies could be used to illuminate the periphery of the myofibrils in muscles that had been subjected to a variety of different preservation conditions.</p><p>To test our hypothesis, we first performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) for SERCA1 on cross-sections of mouse plantaris muscles that had been flash-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, small patches within the fibers revealed seemingly intact myofibrils, but the overall integrity of the myofibrils was very poor. This was not surprising because it is known that flash-frozen muscles can suffer from freezing artifacts that present as holes within the fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nix and Moore, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaspar et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, to determine if the integrity of the myofibrils was being distorted by freezing artifacts, we co-stained the cross-sections with phalloidin, and the results confirmed that regions of poor myofibril integrity were directly associated with the presence of freezing artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Importantly, unlike resin-embedded tissues, it was shown that tissues preserved with the Tokuyasu method retain a high level of immunoreactivity and are therefore amenable to immunolabeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Möbius and Posthuma, 2019</xref>). Indeed, in 1982, the Tokuyasu method was used to define the ultrastructural localization of SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 1982</xref>). The key components of the Tokuyasu method involve an aldehyde-based fixative and sucrose which not only serves as a cryoprotectant but it also controls the consistency of the tissue to allow for ultrathin (&lt;0.2 µm) sectioning. Specifically, Tokuyasu demonstrated that with a proper combination of the sucrose and sectioning temperature, one could obtain ultrathin sections of various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tokuyasu, 1973</xref>). However, the traditional Tokuyasu method requires sectioning temperatures that range from –50°C to –110°C, and such sectioning temperatures are dependent on the use of a cryo-ultramicrotome which is a rare and expensive instrument. Hence, although it appeared that the traditional Tokuyasu method would enable us to obtain immunoreactive sections that were devoid of freeze artifacts, the need for a cryo-ultramicrotome defeated our goal of developing a cost-effective method. Nevertheless, we were inspired by the Tokuyasu method, and we predicted that the right combination of sucrose and sectioning temperature would enable us to obtain adequately cryoprotected and immunoreactive semi-thin sections with a regular cryostat.</p><p>To examine the validity of our prediction we performed a lengthy series of trial-and-error experiments, and through these experiments, we discovered that SERCA immunoreactive cross-sections that were devoid of freeze artifacts could be obtained from muscles that had been extensively fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subsequently cryoprotected with 30–45% sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Qualitatively, we concluded that the best integrity of the myofibrils was found in samples that had been cryoprotected with 45% sucrose and we also discovered that by lowering the sectioning temperature to –30°C we could eliminate sectioning artifacts that were readily present on the surface of samples that had been sectioned at warmer temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, whenever possible, all future studies were performed on tissues that had been fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 45% sucrose, and sectioned at –30°C.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The effect of sectioning temperature on surface artifacts.</title><p>An EDL muscle from a mouse was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, cryoprotected with 45% sucrose, and longitudinally sectioned at −15, –20, –25, or –30°C.

We chose to use a widefield fluorescence microscope for image acquisition because the per frame capture time on a widefield fluorescence microscope is extremely short when compared with alternatives such as a confocal fluorescence microscope. For instance, our image acquisition parameters required &lt;1 s per frame on a Leica Widefield Thunder Microscope compared with &gt;3 min per frame on a Leica confocal SP8 microscope. In other words, the use of widefield microscopy aligned with our goal of developing a time-effective method. However, it is known that the resolution and contrast in widefield images can be negatively impacted by the acquisition of light that resides outside of the focal plane. Fortunately, major advancements in deconvolution algorithms have made it possible to reassign the out-of-focus light to its appropriate location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stemmer et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, it has been shown that deconvoluted widefield images can actually have better resolution and contrast than confocal images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shaw, 2006</xref>). Thus, to improve the resolution and contrast of the widefield images, we employed Leica’s ‘Computational Clearing’ algorithm for image deconvolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schumacher and Bertrand, 2019</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, the application of the deconvolution algorithm led to a dramatic increase in the resolution and contrast. Thus, by applying our optimized fixation, cryoprotection, and sectioning conditions, along with widefield fluorescence microscopy and image deconvolution, we fulfilled our goal of developing a time- and cost-effective method for visualizing intact myofibrils with a high degree of resolution and contrast, and we refer to the collective method as fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Validation of an automated pipeline for measuring myofibril size with FIM-ID</title><p>Having established the conditions for FIM-ID, we next sought to determine whether the images from FIM-ID would be amenable to automated measurements of myofibril size.

Approximately one-half of these objects appeared to be unseparated clusters of myofibrils and/or obliquely sectioned single myofibrils.

Indeed, a highly significant correlation (R=0.9589, p=0.0002) was observed when the automated measurements of myofibril CSA from each ROI were compared with the mean of the manual measurements. Thus, the results from these studies established that our automated program could accurately measure the size of myofibrils as identified with FIM-ID.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Further refinement and validation of the automated measurements with FIM-ID</title><p>EM has been extensively used to assess the ultrastructural characteristics of skeletal muscle and numerous EM-based studies have reported measurements of myofibril size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashmore and Summers, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Penman, 1969</xref>). Hence, to further test the validity of our method, we directly compared our automated FIM-ID measurements of myofibril CSA with manual EM-based measurements. Specifically, we performed an experiment with four mice in which one plantaris muscle from each mouse was subjected to FIM-ID, and the other was processed for EM-based imaging. With FIM-ID it was determined that all fibers in the plantaris muscles were SERCA1 positive, but during the EM imaging it became apparent that these SERCA1 positive fibers consisted of two clearly discernable fiber types. One type was generally large in CSA and possessed very few intermyofibrillar mitochondria, and we referred to these fibers as glycolytic (Gly) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The other type was generally small in CSA and highly enriched with intermyofibrillar mitochondria, and we referred to these fibers as oxidative (Ox) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The classification of the two fiber types was important because previous studies have shown that the morphological arrangement of myofibrils in different fiber types can be quite distinct. For instance, previous studies have shown that myofibrils in fibers that are rich in mitochondria typically have a ‘felderstruktur’ appearance (i.e. field structure) whereas myofibrils in fibers that lack extensive mitochondria present with a ‘fibrillenstruktur’ appearance (i.e. fibril structure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kruger and Gunther, 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shear and Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng and Breinin, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Durston, 1974</xref>). Accordingly, our experimental design was modified so that FIM-ID and EM-based measurements of myofibril CSA could be directly compared in the Ox and Gly fiber types.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Automated measurements of myofibril size and number with fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID) versus manual measurements with electron microscopy (EM).</title><p>For each mouse, one plantaris muscle was (<bold>A</bold>) processed for imaging with EM, and the contralateral plantaris was (<bold>B</bold>) processed for FIM-ID, n=4 mice, scale bars = 25 μm.

For the FIM-ID workflow, an additional step was needed to classify randomly selected fibers as being Ox or Gly, and this was done by taking advantage of previous studies which have shown that mitochondria are enriched with NADH and FAD+, which are endogenous fluorophores that can be excited with blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gooz and Maldonado, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schaefer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kolenc and Quinn, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shadiow et al., 2023</xref>). Specifically, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, excitation of the FIM-ID samples with blue light yielded a weak autofluorescent decoration of the periphery of the myofibrils in all fibers, along with a prominent punctate signal in a subset of the fibers. The strongly autofluorescent fibers were generally small in CSA and closer examination of the autofluorescent signal revealed that the puncta were positioned at points in which there was a gap in the SERCA signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). It has been reported that intermyofibrillar mitochondria do not contain SERCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorgensen et al., 1982</xref>), and therefore, the presence of the autofluorescent signal at sites in which there were gaps in the signal for SERCA, the small CSA of the fibers, and the pre-existing knowledge about the fluorescence properties of NADH and FAD+, all suggested that the autofluorescence was coming from the mitochondria. Accordingly, the strong autofluorescent fibers were classified as being equivalent to the Ox fibers identified with EM, and the non-autofluorescent fibers were classified as Gly fibers.</p><p>Our work with the autofluorescence signal not only provided us with a means for classifying the Ox vs. Gly fibers, but it also helped us realize that any myofibrils that are heavily surrounded by intermyofibrillar mitochondria would not meet the morphological criteria for automated measurements of CSA (i.e. the myofibrils would not present as objects that were &gt;90% enclosed by the signal for SERCA). Thus, to address this, the automated measurements were performed on images in which the signal for autofluorescence and SERCA had been merged. With this approach, a more comprehensive decoration of the periphery of the myofibrils was obtained, and therefore, all of the remaining automated measurements on mouse skeletal muscle were conducted on merged images.</p><p>Having established the finer details of our workflow, we were finally able to compare automated measurements of myofibril CSA obtained with FIM-ID with the manual EM-based measurements. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, the FIM-ID- and EM-based measurements both revealed the linear correlation between myofibril CSA and fiber CSA that has been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>), and there was no significant difference in the slope of this correlation when the two methods were compared. Moreover, no significant differences in mean myofibril CSA to fiber CSA ratio were found when the results from the FIM-ID and EM-based measurements were directly compared, and this point was true when the data from all analyzed fibers were considered, as well as when the results were separated according to the Ox and Gly fiber type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Thus, it can be concluded that the automated measurements of myofibril CSA obtained with FIM-ID were indistinguishable from the manually obtained EM-based measurements.</p><p>As described in the Introduction, another goal of our study was to develop a time- and cost-effective method for measuring the number of myofibrils per fiber. With the EM images, this number was estimated for each fiber by manually obtaining measurements of the average myofibril CSA, the fiber CSA, and the percentage of the fiber CSA that was occupied by myofibrils. This was a time-intensive process, but with the latter two values, the total CSA of the fiber that was occupied by myofibrils could be calculated. The number of myofibrils per fiber was then derived by dividing the total CSA of the fiber that was occupied by myofibrils by the average myofibril CSA for that fiber. The same principles were also used to calculate the number of myofibrils per fiber with FIM-ID, but in this case, the total CSA of the fiber that was occupied by myofibrils was measured with an automated pipeline in CellProfiler. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, the FIM-ID and EM-based measurements both revealed the linear correlation between myofibril number and fiber CSA that has been reported in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jorgenson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>), and there was no significant difference in the slope of this correlation when the two methods were compared. Moreover, no significant differences in the mean number of myofibrils per fiber CSA were found when the results from the FIM-ID and EM-based measurements were directly compared, and this point was true when the data from all analyzed fibers were considered, as well as when the results were separated according to the Ox and Gly fiber type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Hence, just like myofibril CSA, the automated measurements of the number of myofibrils per fiber with FIM-ID were indistinguishable from the manually obtained EM-based measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to chronic mechanical overload is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis</title><p>Having validated the accuracy of the FIM-ID measurements, we then set out to determine whether the radial growth of muscle fibers (i.e. an increase in fiber CSA) that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis. We first addressed this in mice by subjecting their plantaris muscles to a chronic mechanical overload (MOV) or a sham surgical procedure. After a 16-day recovery period, the plantaris muscles were collected and processed for FIM-ID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, the outcomes revealed that MOV led to a 28% increase in fiber CSA when all fibers in the muscle were considered as a single group, and fiber type-specific analyses revealed that this was mediated by a 39% increase in the CSA of Ox fibers, and a 25% increase in the CSA of the Gly fibers. Similarly, the area per fiber that was occupied by myofibrils increased by 29% for all fibers, 39% for the Ox, and 26% for the Gly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Moreover, the area per fiber that was occupied by the intermyofibrillar components (e.g. SR, mitochondria, etc.) also showed a 26% increase for all fibers, a 38% increase in the Ox fibers, and a 22% increase in the Gly fibers. When taken together, these results indicate that the MOV-induced increase in fiber CSA was mediated by a proportionate increase in the area that is occupied by the myofibrils and the area that is occupied by the intermyofibrillar components.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The radial growth of fibers that occurs in response to chronic mechanical overload (MOV) is largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The plantaris muscles of mice were subjected to a chronic MOV or sham surgery, allowed to recover for 16 days, and then mid-belly cross-sections were subjected to fluorescence imaging of myofibrils with image deconvolution (FIM-ID).

As illustrated throughout the study, the images from FIM-ID have a high degree of resolution and contrast, and these properties enabled us to develop pipelines that can perform automated measurements of myofibril size and myofibril number. Importantly, these pipelines were developed in a free open-source program (CellProfiler), and our manuscript includes copies of the pipelines along with instructions and test images so that prospective users can easily employ them (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>). Moreover, the bulk of the FIM-ID workflow utilizes common lab instruments, and essentially anyone who has access to a standard cryostat and a fluorescent microscope with a motorized Z-stage can perform it. Indeed, for first-time users, we suspect that the most complicated part of the workflow will be the implementation of image deconvolution. Fortunately, deconvolution modules have become a commonly available add-on for commercial imaging platforms, and when not available, there are several open-source deconvolution algorithms that users could deploy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lam et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Makarkin and Bratashov, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Katoh, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Su et al., 2023</xref>). As such, we are confident that a broad range of investigators will be able to take advantage of our method.</p><p>With the development of our method, we were able to gain insight into whether the radial growth of muscle fibers that occurs in response to an increase in mechanical loading is mediated by myofibril hypertrophy and/or myofibrillogenesis. This is a fundamentally important question in the field of skeletal muscle growth and therefore we addressed it with two model systems. As expected, both models induced significant radial growth of the SERCA1 positive muscle fibers. However, a significant increase in myofibril CSA (i.e. myofibril hypertrophy) was not consistently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), and no significant correlation between the magnitude of the radial growth of the fibers and myofibril hypertrophy was detected in any of the fiber types that we examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). At face value, these results could be viewed as evidence that myofibril hypertrophy does not play a major role in the radial growth response. However, it is important to consider that the results were obtained from muscles in which the radial growth response was already well advanced. This is important because, according to Goldspink’s model of myofibril splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson and Goldspink, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldspink, 1983</xref>), myofibril hypertrophy would only be detected during the early stages of the radial growth response (i.e. before the induction of myofibril splitting which would lead to a reduction in the CSA of the involved myofibrils). Thus, to further address the role of myofibril hypertrophy, future studies should obtain data from muscles that are going through various stages of the radial growth response (i.e. a time course). With the use of FIM-ID, the pursuit of such studies would be a feasible endeavor and the resulting data would not only help to resolve whether myofibril hypertrophy contributes to the radial growth response, but it would also provide insight into whether myofibril hypertrophy precedes the onset of myofibrillogenesis as predicted by the myofibril splitting model.</p><p>In contrast to the induction of myofibril hypertrophy, all the fiber types in this study that showed significant radial growth also showed a significant increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber (i.e. myofibrillogenesis) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). Moreover, each of these fiber types revealed a significant positive correlation between the magnitude of radial growth and the magnitude of myofibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). These points, when coupled with the other data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, indicate that radial growth of the muscle fibers was largely mediated by myofibrillogenesis. Importantly, this conclusion was upheld in two very distinct models of increased mechanical loading (i.e. chronic MOV in mice and progressive RE in humans). Thus, it appears that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is a conserved component of the radial growth response.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that an increase in mechanical loading can induce myofibrillogenesis. Moreover, the results of this study indicate that myofibrillogenesis is the major driver of the radial growth response. Given these conclusions, one is faced with the question of how an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis. As mentioned several times, one possibility is that the induction of myofibrillogenesis is mediated by hypertrophy and subsequent splitting of the pre-existing myofibrils (i.e. the myofibril splitting model) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldspink, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldspink, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Patterson and Goldspink, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldspink, 1983</xref>). However, numerous studies have also described a different type of myofibrillogenesis that involves the de novo formation of myofibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rhee et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanger et al., 2002</xref>). Specifically, with de novo myofibrillogenesis, it is thought that new myofibrils are derived from nascent proteins and that these nascent proteins are assembled into new myofibrils via a three-step sequence of events (for more details, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fenix et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, the concepts of de novo myofibrillogenesis have largely been studied within the context of myogenesis (i.e. during the early stages of differentiation, embryonic development, etc.), but whether de novo myofibrillogenesis can be induced in adult skeletal muscle remains largely unexplored. In our opinion, the concepts of myofibril splitting and de novo myofibrillogenesis are very intriguing, and we consider both models to be worthy of further investigation.</p><p>In summary, the outcomes of this study have revealed that the induction of myofibrillogenesis plays a major role in the mechanically induced growth of skeletal muscle. The mechanisms via which an increase in mechanical loading induces myofibrillogenesis are not known, but the groundwork for two different models has already been established. Studies aimed at testing the validity of these models should lead to important advancements in the field, and with the advent of FIM-ID, such studies can now be performed in a time- and cost-effective manner.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ethical approval</title><p>Experimental procedures were performed on male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) that were 8–10 weeks of age.

After curing for 48 hr, randomly selected ROIs were imaged with a THUNDER Imager with a Y3 filter (Ex: 545/26, EM: 605/70) and subjected to deconvolution as described for FIM-ID. The images were then examined by a blinded investigator and each fiber within a given ROI was scored for the presence of artifacts on the surface of the section (a score of 1 indicates no artifacts and a score of 10 indicates extensive distortions).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Automated measurements of myofibril size and number with FIM-ID</title><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Assessment of myofibril size and number in muscles from mice</title><p>Within each image from FIM-ID, individual fibers were randomly selected by a blinded investigator and manually traced in ImageJ to record the fiber CSA. Then, the traced fiber was isolated for automated analysis by choosing the ‘Clear Outside’ option. The resulting image was then cropped so that it only contained the isolated fiber. The cropped image was then saved as a .tiff file. For the studies in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, preliminary analyses were performed on 24 fibers per sample with an approximately equal number of autofluorescent and non-autofluorescent fibers. Additional ROIs/fibers were then randomly selected for analysis until the average CSA of the selected fibers fell within ±10% of the mean fiber CSA that was observed for the entire muscle during the Keyence-based analyses. For automated measurements of myofibril size, each single fiber image was imported and processed with our custom pipeline ‘Myofibril CSA Analysis’ in CellProfiler version 4.2.1, which measures the mean myofibril CSA for each fiber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stirling et al., 2021</xref>). To calculate the number of myofibrils per fiber, the total CSA of the fiber that was occupied by myofibrils had to be determined. To obtain this value, each single fiber image that contained the merged signal for autofluorescence and SERCA1 was imported and processed with our custom pipeline ‘Intermyofibrillar Area’ in CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). This pipeline performs automated measurements of the area occupied by the merged autofluorescence and SERCA1 signal for each fiber (i.e. the area occupied by the intermyofibrillar components such as the SR, mitochondria, etc.). This value was then subtracted from the fiber CSA to obtain the total area occupied by the myofibrils for each fiber. Finally, the number of myofibrils per fiber was determined by dividing the total area occupied by the myofibrils by the mean myofibril CSA. Note: the ‘Myofibril CSA Analysis’ and ‘Intermyofibrillar Area’ pipelines as well as user instructions and test images have all been included as supplemental material.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Assessment of myofibril size and number in muscles from humans</title><p>The same general methods that were used in mice were applied to the analysis of human samples. Exceptions to this included that the analyses were performed on images of SERCA1 or SERCA2. Furthermore, preliminary analyses were performed on 16 fibers (8 SERCA1, 8 SERCA2 fibers), and additional ROIs/fibers were selected for analysis until the average CSA of the selected fibers fell within ±4% of the mean fiber CSA that was observed with for the entire muscle section during the Keyence-based analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Processing of mouse skeletal muscle for EM</title><p>The hindlimbs of mice were removed and secured to an aluminum wire mesh as described in the section entitled ‘Collection and processing of the mouse skeletal muscles’. The hindlimbs were then submerged in a 100 mL glass beaker filled with 20 mL of Karnovsky fixative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karnovsky, 1965</xref>) (2.5% EM-grade glutaraldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences #16019] plus 2.0% EM-grade paraformaldehyde [Electron Microscopy Sciences #15714S] in 0.1 M PB) for 3 hr at room temperature on a tabletop rocker set to 50 RPM. Each plantaris muscle was then extracted from the hindlimb and submerged in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube containing 1.0 mL of 2.5% EM-grade glutaraldehyde plus 2.0% EM-grade paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M PB solution and placed on a nutating rocker for 21 hr at 4°C. The fixed plantaris muscles were then transversely cut at the mid-belly and further transversely cut into 1 mm thick slices on either side of the midline.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, the following steps were performed at room temperature in approximately 10 mL of solution in 20 mL scintillation vials on a rotator set at 10 RPM. Tissue slices were first washed three times for 15 min with 0.1 M PB solution, followed by overnight incubation in 1% osmium tetroxide (Electron Microscopy Sciences #19170) in 0.1 M PB solution at room temperature. The samples were then washed four times for 5 min in 0.1 M PB solution, followed by graded dehydration in ethanol with 5 min incubation steps (2×35%, 2×50%, 2×70%, 2×80%, 2×90%, 2×95%, 4×100%). Samples were then incubated in 100% anhydrous acetone for 2×5 min and 2×10 min. Epon resin was prepared by mixing 6.25 g Epon 812, 3.25 g DDSA, 3.0 g NMA, and 8 drops of DMP 30 (Electron Microscopy Sciences #14120) before incubating the samples in a 3:1 acetone:epon solution overnight at room temperature. Samples were then incubated in a 1:1 acetone/epon solution for 2 hr, followed by a 1:3 acetone/epon solution for 2 hr, before being placed in 100% epon overnight in a vacuum at room temperature. Samples were then added to fresh 100% epon for 3×30 min at 60°C before being placed into molds with fresh 100% epon to cure at 60°C overnight.</p><p>The resin-embedded samples were sectioned on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome at 500 nm to generate semi-thin sections using a Histo Diamond Knife (DiATOME) and stained with Toluidine blue to confirm proper orientation (i.e. the cross-sections of the muscle fibers were oriented perpendicular to the length of the fibers). After confirming the correct orientation of the block, the samples were sectioned at 100 nm and collected on carbon formvar-coated copper grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences #S2010NOT). Sections were then contrast-stained with 8% uranyl acetate (Electron Microscopy Sciences #22400) in 50% ethanol for 10 min at room temperature, followed by lead citrate (Electron Microscopy Sciences #22410) for 10 min at room temperature with 4×30 s washes in diH<sub>2</sub>O water after each contrast stain. The sections were viewed at 80 kV on a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope equipped with AMT BioSprint12 digital camera.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Manual measurements of myofibril size and number with EM</title><p>For each muscle processed for EM, 20 Ox and 20 non-Ox fibers were randomly selected for imaging. For each fiber, one low-magnification image (×1250) and one randomly chosen high-magnification region (×5600) within the fiber were captured. The low-magnification images were used to measure the fiber CSA and the high-magnification images were used to measure the myofibril CSA as well as the percentage of the fiber CSA that was occupied by myofibrils. Specifically, for each high-magnification image, ≈30 randomly selected myofibrils were manually traced and used to determine the mean myofibril CSA for that fiber. To estimate the percentage of the fiber CSA that was occupied by myofibrils, an ROI from the high-magnification image that had an equal representation of the A- and I-band regions of the myofibrils was selected. Then, within that ROI, all areas containing myofibrils were manually traced and the total area occupied by the myofibrils was recorded. The total CSA of the myofibrils in the ROI was then divided by the total area of the ROI to obtain the percentage of the fiber CSA that was occupied by the myofibrils. This value was then used to calculate the total CSA of fiber that was occupied by myofibrils. Finally, the number of myofibrils per fiber was determined by dividing the total CSA of the fiber that was occupied by myofibrils by its mean myofibril CSA. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> for an example of the process for manual measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined by using Student’s t-tests, paired t-tests, Wilcoxon-matched paired t-tests, two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons, or repeated measures two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc comparisons, as indicated in the figure legends.

For decades this process has been described as the splitting of myofibrils to produce more myofibrils during the growth process. However, a closer look at the original papers shows that the evidence underlying this description was incomplete. In this paper, the authors have developed a novel method using fluorescence microscopy to directly measure myofibril size and number. Using a mouse model of mechanical loading and a human model of resistance exercise they discovered that myofibrillogenesis is playing a key role in the radial growth of muscle fibers.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>1.

The usage of young growing mice (8-10 weeks) versus adult mice (&gt;4 months) in the murine mechanical overload experiments. The usage of adult mice would be preferable for these experiments given that maturational growth may somehow affect the outcomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The basis for this critique is not clear as it has been shown that the longitudinal growth of bones is complete by ⁓8 weeks of age (e.g., PMID: 28326349, and 31997656). These studies, along with others, also indicate that 8 weeks is a post-pubescent age in mice. For these reasons, 8 weeks of age was viewed as being representative of the human equivalent of when people start to perform resistance exercise with the goal of increasing muscle mass. Also, it’s important to consider that the mice were 10-12 weeks of age when the muscles were collected which would be equivalent to a human in their lower 20’s. In our human study, the mean age of the subjects was 23. Given the above points, it’s hard for us to appreciate why the use of mice that started at 8-10 weeks of age is viewed as a weakness. With that being said, we recognize that there may be age-related changes in mechanisms of mechanical load-induced growth, but it was not our intent to address this topic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) No consideration for biological sex.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and we agree that sex is an important variable to consider. In this study, we explored an unchartered topic and therefore we wanted to minimize as many known variables as possible. We did that, in part, by focusing specifically on male subjects. In the future, it will certainly be important to explore whether sex (and age) impact the structural adaptations that drive the mechanical load-induced growth of muscle fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Information on whether myofibrillogenesis is dependent on hypertrophy induced by loading, or just hypertrophy in general. To provide information on this, the authors could use, for instance, inducible Myostatin KO mice (a model where hypertrophy and force production are not always in lockstep) to see whether hypertrophy independent from load induces the same result as muscle loading regarding myofibrillogenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great suggestion, but it goes beyond the intended scope of our study. Nevertheless, with the publication of our FIM-ID methodology, the answer to this and related questions can now be obtained in a time- and cost-effective manner.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Limited information on Type 1 fiber hypertrophy. A &quot;dual overload&quot; model is used for the mouse where the soleus is also overloaded, but presumably, the soleus was too damaged to analyze. Exploring hypertrophy of murine Type 1 fibers using a different model (weight pulling, weighted wheel running, or forced treadmill running) would be a welcome addition.</p></disp-quote><p>The point is well taken and further studies that are aimed at determining whether there are differences in how Type I vs. Type II fibers grow would be an excellent subject for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review)</bold></p><p>1. Supplemental Figure 1 is not very clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Supplemental Figure 1 is now presented as Supplemental Figure 2. We carefully reexamined this figure and, in our opinion, the key points have been appropriately conveyed. We would be more than happy to revise the figure, but we would need guidance with respect to which aspect(s) of the figure were not clear to the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold></p><p>Introduction.</p><p>1. I do not think the first paragraph is really necessary. Cell growth is a fundamental property of cell biology that requires no further justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that it is essential to remind all readers about the importance of skeletal muscle research. For some, the detrimental impact of skeletal muscle loss on one’s quality of life and the greater burden on the healthcare system may not be known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

As usual for the Hornberger lab, the authors do an excellent job of providing the (historical) context of the research question.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this positive comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I prefer “Goldspink” as “Dr. Goldspink” feels too personal especially when you are critical of his studies.</p></disp-quote><p>All instances of “Dr.” have been removed when referring to the works of others. This includes Dr. Goldspink and Dr. Tokuyasu.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Fourth paragraph, after reference #17. I felt like this discussion was not necessary and did not really add any value to the introduction.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that this discussion should remain since it highlights the widely accepted notion that mechanical loading leads to an increase in the number of myofibrils per fiber, yet there is no compelling data to support this notion. This discussion highlights the need for documented evidence for the increase in myofibril number in response to mechanical loading and, as such, it serves as a major part of the premise for the experiments that were conducted in our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors do a nice job of laying out the challenge of rigorously testing the Goldspink model of myofiber hypertrophy.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results</p><p>1). For the EM images, can the authors provide a representative image of myofibril tracing? From the EM image provided, it is difficult to evaluate how accurate the tracing is.</p></disp-quote><p>-Representative images and an explanation of myofibril calculation have been provided in Supplemental Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the mouse, how does the mean myofibril CSA compare between EM and FIM-ID?</p></disp-quote><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92674-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The above figures compare the myofibril CSA and fiber CSA measurements that were obtained with EM and FIM-ID for all analyzed fibers, as well as the same fibers separated according to the fiber type (i.e., Ox vs. Gly). The above figure shows that the FIM-ID measurements of myofibril CSA were slightly, yet significantly, lower than the measurements obtained with EM. However, we believe that it would be misleading to present the data in this manner. Specifically, as shown in Fig. 4C, a positive linear relationship exists between myofibril CSA and fiber CSA. Thus, a direct comparison of myofibril CSA measurements obtained from EM and FIM-ID would only be meaningful if the mean CSA of the fibers that were analyzed were the same. As shown on the panel on the right, the mean CSA of the fibers analyzed with FIM-ID was slightly, yet significantly, lower than the mean CSA of the fibers analyzed with EM. As such, we believe that the most appropriate way to compare the measurements of the two methods is to express the values for the myofibril CSA relative to the fiber CSA and this is how we presented the data in the main figure (i.e., Fig. 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Looking at Fig. 3D, how is intermyofibrillar space calculated when a significant proportion of the ROI is odd-shaped myofibrils that are not outlined? It is not clear how the intermyofibrillar space between the odd-shaped myofibrils is included in the total intermyofibrillar space calculation for the fiber.</p></disp-quote><p>The area occupied by the intermyofibrillar components is calculated by using our custom “Intermyofibrillar Area” pipeline within CellProfiler. Briefly, the program creates a binary image of the SERCA signal. The area occupied by the white pixels in the binary image is then used to calculate the area that is occupied by the intermyofibrillar components. To help readers, an example of this process is now provided in supplemental figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What is the average percentage of each ROI that was not counted by CP (because a myofibril did not fit the shape criteria)? The concern is that the method of collection is biasing the data. In looking at EM images of myofibrils (from other studies), it is apparent that myofibrils are not always oval; in fact, it appears that often myofibrils have a more rectangular shape. These odd-shaped myofibrils are excluded from the analysis yet they might provide important information; maybe these odd-shaped myofibrils always hypertrophy such that their inclusion might change the overall conclusion of the study. I completely understand the challenges of trying to quantify odd-shaped myofibrils. I think it is important the authors discuss this important limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we would like to clarify that myofibrils of a generally rectangular shape were not excluded. The intent of the filtering steps was to exclude objects that exhibited odd shapes because of an incomplete closure of the signal from SERCA. To illustrate this point we have annotated the images from Figure 3B-D with a red arrow which points to a rectangular object and blue arrows which point to objects that most likely consisted of two or more individual myofibrils that were falsely identified as a single object.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92674-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We appreciate the reviewer's concern that differences in the exclusion rates between groups could have biased the outcomes. Indeed, this was something that we were keeping a careful eye on during our analyses, and we hope that the reviewer will take comfort in knowing that objects were excluded at a very similar rate in both the mouse and human samples (44% vs. 46% for SHAM vs. MOV in mice, and 47% vs. 47% for PRE vs. POST in humans). We realize that this important data should have been included in our original submission and it is now contained with the results section of the revised version of our manuscript. Hopefully the explanation above, along with the inclusion of this data, will alleviate the reviewers concerns that differences between the groups may have been biased by the filtering steps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion.</p><p>1. I think the authors provided a balanced interpretation of the data by acknowledging the limitation of having only one time-point. i.e., not being able to assess the myofibril splitting mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I think a discussion on the important limitation of only quantifying oval-shaped myofibrils should be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our response to comment #4 of the results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors)</bold></p><p>Overall, this is a thoughtful, clear, and impactful manuscript that provides valuable tools and information for the skeletal muscle field. My specific comments are as follows:</p><p>1. In the introduction, I really appreciate the historical aspect provided on myofbrillogenesis. As written, however, I was expecting the authors to tackle the myofibril &quot;splitting&quot; question in greater detail with their experiments given the amount of real estate given to that topic, but this was not the case. Consider toning this down a bit as I think it sets a false expectation.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the study does not directly address the question about myofibril splitting. However, we believe that it is important to highlight the background of this untested theory since it serves as a major part of the premise for the experiments that were performed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the introduction, is it worth worth citing this study? <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rupress.org/jcb/articlepdf/111/5/1885/1464125/1885.pdf">https://rupress.org/jcb/articlepdf/111/5/1885/1464125/1885.pdf</ext-link>.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting study but, despite the title, we do not believe that it is accurate to say that this study investigated myofibrillogenesis. Instead (as illustrated by the author in Fig. 9) the study focused on the in-series addition of new sarcomeres at the ends of the pre-existing myofibrils (i.e., it studied in-series sarcomerogenesis). In our opinion, the study does not provide any direct evidence of myofibrillogenesis, and we are not aware of any studies that have shown that the chronic stretch model employed by the authors induces myofibrillogenesis. However, numerous studies have shown that chronic stretch leads to the in-series addition of new sarcomeres.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Is there evidence for myofbrillogenesis during cardiac hypertrophy that could be referenced here?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great question, and one would think that it would have been widely investigated. However, direct evidence for myofibrillogenesis during load-induced cardiac hypertrophy is just as sparse as the evidence for myofibrillogenesis during load-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the introduction, perhaps mention that prolonged fixation is another disadvantage of EM tissue preparation. This typically prevents the usage of antibodies afterwards, whereas the authors have been able to overcome this using their method, which is a great strength.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. This point has been added the 5th paragraph of the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the introduction, are there not EM-compatible computer programs that could sidestep the manual tracing and increase throughput? Why could software such as this not be used? <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0396-9">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0396-9</ext-link></p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that automated pipelines have been developed for EM, such methods require a high degree of contrast between the measured objects. With EM, the high degree of contrast required for automated quantification is rarely observed between the myofibrils and the intermyofibrillar components (especially in glycolytic fibers). Moreover, one of the primary goals of our study was to develop a time and cost-effective method for identifying and quantifying myofibrils. As such, we developed a method that would not require the use of EM. We only incorporated EM imaging and analysis to validate the FIM-ID method. Therefore, utilizing an EM-compatible program to sidestep the manual tracing would have sped up the validation step, but it would not have accomplished one of the primary goals of our study.</p><p>1. In the results, specifically for the human specimens, were &quot;hybrid&quot; fibers detected and, if so, how did the pattern of SERCA look? Also, did the authors happen to notice centrallynucleated muscle fibers in the murine plantaris after overload? If so, how did the myofibrils look? Could be interesting.</p><p>For the analysis of the human fibers, two distinct immunolabeling methods were performed. One set of sections was stained for SERCA1 and dystrophin, while the other set was stained for SERCA2 and dystrophin. In other words, we did not perform dual immunolabeling for SERCA1 and SERCA2 on the same sections. Therefore, during the analysis of the human fibers, we did not detect the presence of hybrid fibers. Furthermore, while we did not perform nuclear staining on these sections, it should be noted that nuclei do not contain SERCA, and to the best of our recollection, we did not detect any SERCAnull objects within the center of the fibers. Moreover, our previous work has shown that the model of MOV used in this study does not lead to signs of degeneration/regeneration (You, Jae-Sung et al. (2019). doi:10.1096/fj.201801653RR). Therefore, it can be safely assumed that very few (if any) of the fibers analyzed in this study were centrally nucleated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the Results, fixed for how long? This is important since, at least in my experience, with 24+ hours of fixation, antibody reactivity is significantly reduced unless an antigen retrieval step is performed (even then, not always successful). Also, presumably these tissues were drop-fixed? These details are in the Methods but some additional detail here could be warranted for the benefit of the discerning and interested reader.</p></disp-quote><p>For both the mouse and human, the samples were immersion-fixed (presumably the equivalent of “drop-fixed”) in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1M phosphate buffer solution for a total of 24 hours (as described in the Methods section). We agree that prolonged aldehyde fixation can affect antibody reactivity; however, the antibodies used for FIM-ID did not require an antigen retrieval step.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the results regarding NADH/FAD autofluorescence imaging, a complimentary approach in muscle was recently described and could be cited here:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00662.2022">https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/japplphysiol.00662.2022</ext-link>.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s recommendation to add this citation for the support of our method for fiber type classification and have added it to the manuscript in the second paragraph under the “Further refinement and validation of the automated measurements with FIM-ID” subsection of the Results as citation number 57.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the results, &quot;Moreover, no significant differences in the mean number of myofibrils per fiber CSA were found when the results from the FIM-ID and EM-based measurements were directly compared, and this point was true when the data from all analyzed fibers was considered...&quot; Nit-picky, but should it be &quot;were considered&quot; since data is plural?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, this error was corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the discussion, are the authors developing a &quot;methodology&quot; or a &quot;method&quot;? I think it may be the latter.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that “method” is the correct term to use. Instances of the word “methodology” have been replaced with “method.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. In the discussion, since the same fibers were not being tracked over time, I'm not sure that saying &quot;radial growth&quot; is strictly correct. It is intuitive that the fibers were growing during loading, of course, but it may be safer to say &quot;larger fibers versus control or the Pre sample&quot; or something of the like. For example, &quot;all the fiber types that were larger after loading versus controls&quot; as opposed to &quot;showed significant radial growth&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that the fiber size was not tracked over time, the experiments were designed to test for a main effect of mechanical loading. Therefore, we are attributing the morphological adaptations to the mechanical loading variable (i.e., mechanical loadinduced growth). The use of terms like “the induction of radial growth” or “the induction of hypertrophy” are commonly used in studies with the methods employed in this study. Respectfully, we believe that it would be more confusing for the readers if we used the suggested terms like &quot;all the fiber types that were larger after loading versus controls&quot;. For instance, if I were the reader I would think to myself… but there fiber types that were larger than others before loading (e.g., Ox vs. Gly), so what are the authors really trying to talk about?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. I would suggest making a cartoon summary figure to complement and summarize the Methods/Results/Discussion</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We created a cartoon that summarizes the overall workflow for FIM-ID and this cartoon is now presented in Supplemental Figure 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
