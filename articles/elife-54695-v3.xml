While it is long postulated that they originate from mesenchymal stem cells, the true identity of progenitors and their in vivo bifurcated differentiation routes into osteoblasts and adipocytes remain poorly understood. Here, by employing large scale single cell transcriptome analysis, we computationally defined mesenchymal progenitors at different stages and delineated their bi-lineage differentiation paths in young, adult and aging mice. One identified subpopulation is a unique cell type that expresses adipocyte markers but contains no lipid droplets. As non-proliferative precursors for adipocytes, they exist abundantly as pericytes and stromal cells that form a ubiquitous 3D network inside the marrow cavity. Functionally they play critical roles in maintaining marrow vasculature and suppressing bone formation. Therefore, we name them marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs) and conclude that they are a newly identified component of marrow adipose tissue.</p></abstract><kwd-group

characterized by excessive bone loss and structural deterioration until it clinically presents as bone fragility and fracture. While mostly afflicting post-menopausal women and the elderly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">National Osteoporosis Foundation, 2002</xref>), it also manifests in adolescents and adults as a result of endocrine and metabolic abnormalities or medications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mirza and Canalis, 2015</xref>). Osteoporosis is largely or partially caused by diminished bone forming activity and often accompanied by increases in marrow adiposity. Therefore, understanding the nature of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and their differentiation routes into osteoblasts and adipocytes has always been the center of bone research. However, in contrast to the wealth of knowledge regarding hematopoiesis from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orkin and Zon, 2008</xref>), our in vivo knowledge of MSCs and their descendants are largely incomplete, which has greatly limited advances in treating clinical disorders of bone loss.</p><p>It is well-accepted that bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors are heterogeneous, including MSCs and their descendants at various differentiation stages before they reach the terminal states as osteoblasts, osteocytes, and adipocytes. Our current knowledge of those progenitors is mostly dependent on cell expansion in culture for CFU-F, multi-lineage differentiation, and transplantation assays. However, in vitro culture does not necessarily replicate in vivo cell behavior after depleting their environmental cues. Another common approach is lineage tracing that uses a specific promoter-driven <italic>Cre</italic> or <italic>CreER</italic> system to label a portion of mesenchymal lineage cells. However, it generally does not provide information about the specific stage(s) of mesenchymal progenitors that cells start to be labeled. The recently available large-scale single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), which is capable of identifying and interrogating rare cell populations and deducting the course of differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), finally provides an unbiased tool to investigate bone marrow mesenchymal cells in vivo.</p><p>Several recent reports applied this technique on mouse bone marrow mesenchymal cells. Based on previous studies that leptin receptor (Lepr) marks adult bone marrow MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) and Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells serve as niche for hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Comazzetto et al., 2019</xref>), one study used <italic>Lepr-Cre</italic> to label mesenchymal stromal cells and <italic>Col1a-Cre</italic> to label osteoblasts for analyzing HSC niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>). Another one utilized <italic>Cxcl12-CreER</italic> to label bone marrow stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matsushita et al., 2020</xref>). The others depleted hematopoietic cells from bone marrow and analyze the remaining bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baccin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, all those studies identified a large cell cluster expressing many adipocyte markers and in some studies this cluster was annotated as MSC. For our study, we used a different approach by taking advantage of a <italic>Col2-Cre Rosa26 &lt;lsl-tdTomato&gt;</italic> (Col2:Td) mouse model that we and others previously reported to label bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2017</xref>). Since in this model Td labels every osteocyte and every bone marrow adipocyte in vivo and all CFU-F-forming cells, we reason that all bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells, including all mesenchymal progenitors, are included within the Td<sup>+</sup> population. By applying large scale scRNA-seq on this population derived from various age groups, we identified an in vivo the most primitive progenitor population different from previous reports and delineated the in vivo evolvement of early mesenchymal progenitors into mature osteogenic and adipogenic cells through hierarchical differentiation paths. Among newly identified mesenchymal subpopulations, a new type of adipose lineage cells is subsequently validated and investigated for their critical actions in regulating bone marrow vasculature and bone homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single cell transcriptomic profiling of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells</title><p>Consistent with our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandra et al., 2017</xref>), Td labeled the following cells in the long bone of 1-month-old Col2:Td mice: all chondrocytes (1052 out of 1052 chondrocytes counted, n = 4 mice, 100%) in the growth plate, osteoblasts and all osteocytes (3600 out of 3600 osteocytes counted, n = 4 mice, 100%) in trabecular and cortical bone, all CD45<sup>-</sup> stromal cells (2050 out of 2050 cells with stromal morphology counted, n = 4 mice, 100%), all Perilipin<sup>+</sup> adipocytes (5 out of 5 adipocytes counted, n = 4 mice, 100%), and many pericytes throughout the bone marrow from metaphysis to diaphysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

We profiled 13,759 cells with a median of 2686 genes/cell and a median of 12215 UMIs/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Unsupervised clustering of the gene expression profiles using Seurat identified 22 groups, including 9 groups of mesenchymal lineage cells and 11 groups of hematopoietic cells, 1 group of endothelial cells, and 1 group of mural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-D</xref>). For reasons unclear at present, we observed a large number of non-mesenchymal lineage cells, which is confirmed by detectable <italic>Td</italic> and <italic>Col2a1</italic> expression in those cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). tSNE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>) analyses of 7585 mesenchymal lineage cells yielded the same cell cluster pattern containing 9 subpopulations. Cells from two batches of experiments were present at a roughly similar proportion in each subpopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B, C</xref>). Examination of lineage-specific markers identified clusters with gene signatures of osteoblast (cluster 4), osteocyte (cluster 5), adipocyte (cluster 7), and chondrocyte (cluster 8 and 9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Chondrocyte clusters, while unexpected, likely represent growth plate chondrocytes released from bone fragments during enzymatic digestion after we cut off epiphyses at the growth plate site. Since chondrocytes originate from the resting zone progenitors but not bone marrow MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mizuhashi et al., 2018</xref>), they were excluded from subsequent analysis.</p><p>Interestingly, pseudotemporal cell trajectory analysis using Monocle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) placed cells in cluster 1 at one end of pseudotime trajectory and osteocytes (cluster 5) and adipocytes (cluster 7), two terminally differentiated cell types, at the opposite, divergent ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Street et al., 2018</xref>), another method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes, generated a similar trajectory pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data suggested that cluster 1 cells are the ancestor of other mesenchymal cells in the dataset and that they bi-differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic lineage cells. Indeed, cluster 1 expressed several common stem cell markers, such as stem cell antigen 1 (Sca1), Cd34, and Thy1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Hence, we named cluster 1 as early mesenchymal progenitors (EMPs), the most primitive cells in the sequencing dataset. Since these data are derived from <italic>Col2-Cre</italic> labeled cells, we cannot exclude the possibility that the bone marrow contains even more primitive Td<sup>-</sup> cells that give rise to cluster 1 cells. That said, the labelling of essentially all CFU-F forming cells in Col2:Td bone marrow by Td, makes that possibility unlikely. Compared to cluster 1, clusters 2, 3, and 4 (osteoblast) expressed gradually increased levels of osteogenic genes, such as <italic>Sp7, Runx2, Col1a1, Ibsp</italic>, and <italic>Bglap2</italic>. Since clusters 2 and 3 are sequentially located after cluster 1 and before the branch point in pseudotime trajectory, we named cluster 2 as intermediate mesenchymal progenitors (IMPs) and cluster 3 as late mesenchymal progenitors (LMPs). Cells in cluster 6 were distributed around the branch point, indicating that they are lineage committed progenitors (LCPs).</p><p>Computational cell cycle analysis was performed to understand the proliferative status of each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). As a positive control, chondrocyte cluster 9, corresponding to proliferative and prehypertrophic growth plate chondrocytes, had the highest proliferative status. It appeared that within bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells, EMPs are less proliferative than IMPs; LMPs, LCPs, and osteoblasts are the most proliferative; adipocytes and osteocytes are non-proliferative. These results further support our cluster annotation. Hierarchy analysis showed distinct gene expression signatures in each cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>During the past decade, many proteins have been proposed as mesenchymal progenitor markers based on lineage tracing and in vitro culture data, such as Lepr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>), myxovirus resistance-1 (Mx1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2012</xref>), glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (Gli1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), paired related homeobox 1 (Prxx1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Logan et al., 2002</xref>), gremlin (Grem1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Worthley et al., 2015</xref>), platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfrα)/Sca1 (PαS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>), Nestin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010</xref>), Osterix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizoguchi et al., 2014</xref>), c-x-c motif chemokine 12 (Cxcl12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Omatsu et al., 2010</xref>), integrinαV/OX-2 membrane glycoprotein (Cd200) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2015</xref>), and early B cell factor 3 (Ebf3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seike et al., 2018</xref>). However, our data suggested that among them, only Sca1 preferentially marks cluster 1. <italic>Pdgfra, Itgav, Gli1,</italic> and <italic>Prrx1</italic> are broadly expressed across all mesenchymal lineage cells; <italic>Sp7 (Osterix)</italic> and <italic>Cd200</italic> are expressed at a higher level in LMPs and LCPs than in EMP; <italic>Grem1, Lepr, Cxcl12</italic> and <italic>Ebf3</italic> are highly expressed in adipocytes but also have expression in other mesenchymal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>); <italic>Nestin</italic> and <italic>Mx1</italic> are mainly expressed in endothelial/mural cells and hematopoietic cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). Their expression patterns were further confirmed by UMAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C, D</xref>). Hence, the in vivo EMPs we computationally identified here are similar to the previously proposed PαS cells but different from other proposed MSCs.

Some pathways, such as PI3K-Akt, TGFβ, and FoxO signaling pathways, were altered in both lineages, implying their general role in regulating mesenchymal differentiation. Accompanied by downregulation of translation, ribosomal genes were down-regulated in both osteocytes and adipocytes, confirming that they are terminally differentiated, highly specialized cells. The unique features of osteogenic differentiation include extracellular matrix (ECM) organization, ECM-receptor interaction, axon guidance, actin cytoskeleton, and biomineral tissue development, all of which reflect their bone building function. Interestingly, the unique features of adipogenic differentiation include cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, immune system process, circadian rhythm, osteoclast differentiation, TNF, HIF-1, chemokines signaling pathways, among others. Considering that adipocytes reside in a hematopoietic environment with affluent blood vessels, these features suggest an important regulatory role of adipocytes on its marrow environment.</p><p>To validate the lineage differentiation routes predicted by our Seurat and Monocle data, we chose two genes, <italic>Dmp1</italic> and <italic>Acta2 (αSMA</italic>), for further investigation.

This unidirectionality guarantees that different cell types in an organ have distinct identities and play specialized functions. Our proposed mesenchymal progenitors at different stages and their bi-lineage differentiation routes based on scRNA-seq analysis are consistent with the above concept. Specifically, at various ages, the EMPs cluster always has the least number of cells among all mesenchymal cell clusters and is always situated at one end of trajectory. Moreover, it shrinks in size during aging. Compared to other progenitors, they are less proliferative and they do not express lineage master regulators, such as <italic>Runx2</italic>, <italic>Sp7</italic>, <italic>Cebpa</italic>, or <italic>Pparg</italic>. Instead, they express constellation of group-defining genes, including <italic>Ly6a</italic>, <italic>Cd34</italic>, and <italic>Thy1</italic>, which have been shown to mark other adult stem cells, such as HSCs, keratinocyte stem cells, cancer stem cells, muscle stem cells etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sidney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wilson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shaikh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakamura et al., 2006</xref>).

The EMP cells in our dataset are also consistent with a previous study showing that mouse bone marrow Sca1<sup>+</sup>PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>CD45<sup>-</sup>Ter119<sup>-</sup> cells generate colonies at a high frequency and differentiate into hematopoietic niche cells, osteoblasts, and adipocytes after in vivo transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Nevertheless, future lineage tracing experiments are required to demonstrate that cells in the EMP cluster give rise to cells in LMP and LCP clusters, and resultant terminally differentiated cells in vivo.</p><p>Using a lineage tracing approach (<italic>Lepr-Cre</italic> mice), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) previously showed that Lepr labels bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors in adult mice (6 months of age) but not in young mice. Our study identified Lepr is a marker for MALPs, which are non-proliferative cells expressing adipocyte genes. We also observed that <italic>Lepr</italic> express in EMP cluster at a low level in young and adult mice and at a high level in old mice. The increased <italic>Lepr</italic> expression in EMP cluster during aging might explain the previous observations that Lepr marks MSCs in adult mice but not in young mice and that Lepr labels marrow adipocytes from a young age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>). In the same study, it was reported that Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells constitute 0.3% of bone marrow cells. Since bone marrow CFU-F frequency is less than 0.01% in adult mice, these data clearly indicate that Lepr labels much more cells than progenitors. Our aging sequencing data showing the great expansion of Lepr<sup>+</sup> MALP cluster in 16-month-old mice further excludes the use of Lepr as a mesenchymal progenitor marker because it conflicts with the well-known aging effect on reducing the pool of bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors. Therefore, we believe that Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells in bone marrow are a heterogeneous population whose majority is MALPs and minority is mesenchymal progenitors. This is further confirmed by another scRNA-seq study analyzing <italic>Lepr-Cre</italic> labeled bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tikhonova et al., 2019</xref>) (GSE108892, Portals available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://aifantislab.com/niche">http://aifantislab.com/niche</ext-link>). In that study, two large clusters, <italic>Mgp</italic><sup>High</sup> P1 and <italic>Lpl</italic><sup>High</sup> P2, highly express adipogenesis-associated genes, and two small clusters are similar to our LCP and OB clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). A recent scRNA-seq analysis of Ter119<sup>-</sup>CD71<sup>-</sup>Lin<sup>-</sup>bone marrow cells from <italic>WT</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baryawno et al., 2019</xref>) (GSE128423, Portals available from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/mouse-bone-marrow-stroma-in-homeostasis">https://portals.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/mouse-bone-marrow-stroma-in-homeostasis</ext-link>) generated a similar clustering pattern and gene expression signature as ours, demonstrating the robustness of scRNA-seq methodology of identifying bone marrow mesenchymal populations. The Lepr-MSC cluster identified in that study highly and specifically expresses many known and newly identified adipocyte markers of MALPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Interestingly, among five fibroblast cell clusters identified in that study, 2 of them have a similar set of gene signatures as our EMPs and the other three overlap with LMPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>Bone marrow adipose tissue (MAT) refers to MSC-derived adipocytes located within the bone marrow niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Turner et al., 2018</xref>). Different from their counterparts in white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT), adipocytes in MAT are interspersed at a much lower density by hematopoietic, endothelia, and osteogenic cells. To date, MAT research has focused on LiLAs and their roles in energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lecka-Czernik and Stechschulte, 2014</xref>), energy deficit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghali et al., 2016</xref>), diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim and Schafer, 2016</xref>), and cancer metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2018</xref>). Since LiLAs are rare in the bone marrow of healthy young mice, MAT is mainly studied in the context of diseases and aging. Based on our computational data, we uncovered a novel type of adipogenic lineage cell, MALPs, that expresses many adipocyte markers, but lacks significant lipid stores. Our trajectory analysis, in vitro adipogenic differentiation assay, and in vivo fate mapping data provide strong evidence that MALPs represent a stable transitional cell type along the adipogenic differentiation route after mesenchymal progenitors and before LiLAs. The relationship between MALPs and LiLAs is similar to that between osteoblasts and osteocytes as both MALPs and osteoblasts are functional precursors for terminally differentiated cells. Therefore, our study expands the concept of MAT to include MALP, an abundant cell type, and its regulatory functions in bone.</p><p>In traditional adipose depots, adipogenic differentiation is tightly coupled with lipid accumulation. Single cell analyses of murine or human white fat depots (visceral or subcutaneous) did not identify cell populations analogous to MALPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merrick et al., 2019</xref>). Pre-adipocytes from adult tissues express low levels of <italic>Pparg</italic> but not <italic>Adipoq</italic>, and are also defined by their expression of canonical mesenchymal progenitor markers, including <italic>Sca1</italic> and <italic>Cd34</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berry and Rodeheffer, 2013</xref>). In contrast, MALPs do not proliferate and do not express progenitor markers. Instead, they express many known and newly identified markers of terminally differentiated adipocytes. Therefore, MALPs represent a cell type distinct from traditional pre-adipocytes. Under physiology conditions, MALPs are hundreds to a thousand times more than LiLAs, indicating that they are a stable population rarely converted into LiLAs. Whether they can directly undergo apoptosis without differentiated into LiLAs needs further investigation. It will also be interesting to identify the molecular mechanism that blocks a large number of cells at MALP stage without becoming LiLAs. We speculate that MALPs are poised to accumulate lipid and become LiLAs in response to metabolic or other cues, such as radiation injury and the availability of fatty acids. Overall, we conclude that MALPs represent a marrow-specific type of adipose cell that plays unique roles in regulating their bone environment. One limitation of our study is that we do not have a <italic>Cre</italic> specific for MALPs. Therefore, we could not rule out the potential influence of LiLAs in cell ablation experiments. Since MALPs are hundreds times more than LiLAs in young mice, we believe that the later one has a minor role compared to the former one.</p><p>Morphologically and functionally, MALPs are also different from traditional round shape adipocytes. Even in young mice, MALPs exist in abundant amount as marrow stromal cells or pericytes. Importantly, their cell processes form a vast 3D network structure inside bone marrow, making numerous contacts among themselves and with the rest of bone marrow components. Most likely through secreting factors into their marrow environment, they play pivotal roles in maintaining marrow vasculature and suppressing osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal progenitors. Although we did not detect any changes in hematopoietic components shortly after ablation of MALPs, we still believe that they have the ability of controlling hematopoiesis because of several reasons. First, Cxcl12, a chemokine responsible for the retention of hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Peled et al., 1999</xref>), is the 2<sup>nd</sup> most expressed genes in MALPs. Previous studies have shown that Cxcl12-abundant reticular (CAR) cells act as a niche for HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sugiyama and Nagasawa, 2012</xref>). Indeed, due to their high Cxcl12 expression and reticular morphology, MALPs likely constitute a significant portion of CAR cells. Second, it has been shown that Scf from <italic>Adipoq-CreER</italic> or <italic>Lepr-Cre</italic> labeled bone marrow cells promotes hematopoietic regeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). According to our datasets, Scf is highly and specifically expressed in MALPs. Hence, a prolonged cell ablation period or an injury might be required to detect the regulatory action of MALPs on hematopoiesis inside the bone marrow.</p><p>In the literature, pericytes are commonly refer to cells embedded within the basement membrane of microvessels, including capillaries, postcapillary venules, and terminal arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Armulik et al., 2011</xref>). Our study of MALPs challenges the concept that pericytes must be tightly associated with endothelial cells. In the 3D bone marrow images of Adipoq:Td mice, while many Td<sup>+</sup> cells display a typical pericytic morphology with extensive cell body attachment to endothelial cells, there were also Td<sup>+</sup> cells that did not have this canonical morphology. Instead, they have a stromal cell morphology and contact endothelial cells through a small portion of their cell bodies as well as through extended processes. Moreover, many Td<sup>+</sup> stromal cells with no cell body contact with endothelial cells extend their cell processes to wrap around capillaries walls. Therefore, these observations indicate that both pericytes and stromal cells wrap around vessels and contribute to vessel stabilization and maintenance.</p><p>The main functions of currently known adipocytes are lipid storage, thermogenesis, and regulation of nutrient homeostasis. Apparently, MALPs are unconventional possessing a completely different set of functions. Why bone marrow mesenchymal progenitors need to turn on adipocyte transcriptome in order to become a central regulator of bone marrow environment is an interesting question. Furthermore, future studying the underlying molecular mechanisms by which they regulate their environment will shed light on identifying new drugs for treating bone diseases such as osteoporosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Briefly, the outer surfaces of long bones were scraped and digested to remove the periosteum. After cutting off the epiphyses and flushing out the central bone marrow, metaphyseal bone fragments were longitudinally cut into two halves and digested by proteases to collect endosteal bone marrow cells. Freshly isolated endosteal bone marrow cells were resuspended into FACS buffer containing 25 mM HEPES (Thermofisher scientific) and 2% FBS in PBS and sorted for top 1% Td<sup>+</sup> cells if a Td peak was not obvious or Td<sup>+</sup> cells if a Td peak was obvious using Influx B (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) or Aria B (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing of endosteal bone marrow cells</title><p>We constructed 4 batches of single cell libraries for sequencing: endosteal Td<sup>+</sup>bone marrow cells from 1-month-old (n = 2), 1.5-month-old (n = 3), 3-month-old (n = 3) and 16-month-old (n = 3) male Col2:Td mice. 20,000 cells were loaded in aim of acquiring one single library of 10,000 cell for each age group by Chromium controller (V3 chemistry version, 10X Genomics Inc, San Francisco, USA), barcoded and purified as described by the manufacturer, and sequenced using a 2 × 150 pair-end configuration on an Illumina HiSeq platform at a sequencing depth of ~400 million reads. Cell ranger (Version 3.0.2, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-geneexpression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger">https://support.10xgenomics.com/single-cell-geneexpression/software/pipelines/latest/what-is-cell-ranger</ext-link>) was used to demultiplex reads, followed by extraction of cell barcode and unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). The cDNA insert was aligned to a modified reference mouse genome (mm10). Doublets or cells with poor quality (genes &gt; 6000, genes &lt; 200, or &gt;5% genes mapping to mitochondrial genome) were excluded. Expression was natural log transformed and normalized for scaling the sequencing depth to a total of 1 × 10<sup>4</sup> molecules per cell, followed by regressing out the number of UMIs and percent mitochondrial genes using Seurat V2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Satija et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>For the integrated dataset, canonical component analysis (CCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butler et al., 2018</xref>) was performed using the union of the top 2000 genes with the highest dispersion from both datasets and to determine the common sources of variation between 1- and 1.5 month datasets. A CCA dimensional reduction was subsequently generated on the basis of the first 30 canonical correlation vectors. T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) plots were used to visualize the data based on the CCA alignment. Cluster specific markers for each cluster, relative to the remaining population, were conducted using the FindMarkers to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Sub-clustering was performed by isolating the mesenchymal lineage clusters identified from the remaining bone marrow cells using known marker genes, followed by reanalysis as described above. This resulted in the generation of 9 clusters. Because chondrocytes are derived from the growth plate, not bone marrow, these chondrocyte clusters were excluded from further analyses. DEGs between these clusters were generated as described above. GO terms and KEGG pathway enrichment, were identified using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>For individual analysis of the 3- and 16-month-old dataset, Seurat package V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) was used for filtering, variable gene selection, dimensionality reduction analysis and clustering standardly. Poor quality cells or doublets were first filtered as described above, followed by identifying the variable genes by default FindVariableFeatures function. Next, we performed principal component analysis (PCA) using the JackStraw function. Statistically significant PCs were selected as input for tSNE or uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) plots. For sub-clustering, we repeated the same procedure of ﬁnding variable genes, dimensionality reduction, and clustering. Different resolutions for clustering have been tested to demonstrate the robustness of clusters.</p><p>To analyze 4 datasets from different age group, we applied Seurat V3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) for performing integrated analyses to identify common cell types. 1-month-old and 1.5-month-old dataset were combined as 1M data, 3-month-old and 16-month-old dataset were input as 3M/16M data. Anchors from different dataset were defined using the FindIntegrationAnchors function, then use these anchors to integrate all datasets together with IntegrateData. This integrated data was further analyzed and subclustered for mesenchymal lineage cells as described above.</p><p>For cell cycle analysis, we used a core set of 43 S and 54 G2/M genes defined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tirosh et al., 2016</xref>). First, the genes that are expressed in less than 5% of total cells were removed, resulting in 34 S and 45 G2/M genes for the following cell cycle analysis. Second, we define proliferative cells if the cell express one gene set significantly more than the other. Since the null distribution for the S gene set and G2/M gene set is unknown, we designed a nonparametric permutation test. To be more specific, for each cell, we resampled 34 genes from the 79 genes (34+45) as ‘S genes’ and the rest 45 genes as ‘G2/M genes’. This resampling was repeated 5000 times and each time, we calculate the difference between the mean expression value of ‘S genes’ and the mean expression values of ‘G2/M genes’. The original difference between the mean expression value of S genes and the mean expression value of G2M was compared with the difference between resampling results to get a significant score (p-values). To correct for multi-test, FDR corrections were applied to each cluster. At last, FDR p-value&lt;0.05 was used as a cutoff for distinguishing proliferative or non-proliferative cells.</p><p>To computationally delineate the developmental progression of bone marrow mesenchymal cells and order them in pseudotime, we used the algorithms implemented in the Monocle V2 package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>). We include the mesenchymal lineage cells with no chondrocytes from separated or integrated dataset of different age (1, 3 and 16 month old) mice for the analysis. We ordered cells by selecting genes with high dispersion across cells, using a parameter of ‘mean_expression &gt;= 0.05 and dispersion_empirical &gt;= 2 * dispersion_fit’, lists of genes were selected for dimensional reduction to generate the trajectory reconstruction using the nonlinear reconstruction algorithm DDRTree. Branched expression analysis modeling, or BEAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapnell et al., 2014</xref>) was used to determine the genes that are differentially expressed between the osteogenic or adipogenic branches. A mouse transcript factors (TF) list (TFdb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanamori et al., 2004</xref>) were used to detect 385 TFs among the differential expressed genes.</p><p>We also performed the trajectory analysis using Slingshot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Street et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, UMAP was used as dimensional reduction after the PCA were calculated for individual or integrated datasets. Then Seurat objects were transformed into SingleCellExperiment objects. Slingshot trajectory analysis was conducted using the Seurat clustering information and with dimensionality reduction produced by UMAP.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histology</title><p>To obtain whole mount sections for immunofluorescent imaging, freshly dissected bones (femurs, tibiae, L4/L5 vertebrae) were fixed in 4% PFA for 1 day, decalcified in 10% EDTA for 4–5 days, and then immersed into 20% sucrose and 2% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) at 4°C overnight. Then sample was embedded into 8% gelatin in 20% sucrose and 2% PVP embedding medium. Samples were sectioned at 50 µm in thickness. Sections were incubated with goat anti-LepR (R and D system, AF497), rabbit anti-Laminin (Sigma, L9393), rat anti-CD45 (Biolegend, 103101), rat anti-Endomucin (Santa cruz, sc-65495), rabbit anti-Osterix (Abcam, ab22552), rabbit anti-Perilipin (Cell signaling, 9349), rat anti-mouse PDGFRβ (Biolegend, 136002), rabbit anti-mouse connexin 43 (Cell signaling, 3512) at 4°C overnight followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated donkey anti-goat (Abcam, ab150129), Alexa Fluor 647 anti-rat (Abcam, ab150155) or anti-rabbit (Abcam, ab150157) secondary antibodies incubation 1 hr at RT. For lipid staining, BODIPY dye (ThermoFisher scientific, D3822) was added together with secondary antibody and incubate for 1 hr at RT. For EdU staining, mice received 1.6 mg/kg EdU 1 day and 3 hr before sacrifice and the staining was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher scientific, Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Imaging Kit, D3822). To characterize bone marrow vessels after DT injections, all vessels in a 0.3 mm<sup>2</sup> area in the diaphyseal bone marrow were selected to measure their diameter of semi-minor axis (vessel diameter), area (vessel area), and number (vessel density).</p><p>To reconstruct 3D structure of bone marrow, fluorescence images were captured by a Zeiss LSM 710 scanning confocal microscope interfaced with the Zen 2012 software (Carl Zeiss Microimaging LLC, Thornwood, NY). Confocal image stacks were collected to a depth of ~50 µm and a step size of 1 µm at 63x magnification. Laser power and detector sensitivity were adjusted for z-correction to compensate for signal dissipation at greater imaging depths. Detector gain and offset were adjusted according to the most intense regions to ensure minimal saturation of the signal over the entire imaging area. Imaris 9.2 software (Oxford instruments, Switzerland) was used for processing z-stack and generating movies. The number of cell processes per cell was manually quantified.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell culture</title><p>For CFU-F assay, unsorted endosteal bone marrow cells were plated at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/T25 flask.

At the femoral midshaft, a total of 100 slices located 4.8–5.4 mm away from the distal growth plate were acquired for trabecular bone and cortical bone analyses by visually drawing the volume of interest (VOI) separately. In the L4/L5 vertebrae, the region (total about 300 slices) 50 slices away from the top and bottom end plates was acquired for trabecular bone analysis. The trabecular bone tissue within the VOI was segmented from soft tissue using a threshold of 487.0 mgHA/cm<sup>3</sup> and a Gaussian noise filter (sigma = 1.2, support = 2.0). The cortical bone tissue was using a threshold of 661.6 mgHA/cm<sup>3</sup> and a Gaussian noise filter (sigma = 1.2, support = 2.0).

A major population of adipocyte lineage cells is found that functions to stabilize blood vessels and suppress bone formation.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including J Gage Crump as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting study that uses single-cell RNA sequencing to dissect heterogeneity of the bone marrow mesenchyme from young to adult stages in mouse. The authors report a new pre-adipocyte-like bone marrow cell population named MERA, which they define as a downstream population of MSCs by single cell RNA-seq analysis. In the first part of the paper, they computationally redefine MSCs as Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells based on large-scale stromal scRNA-seq datasets. In the second part, they report that ablation of MERAs by <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> causes disruption in marrow vasculature and an increase in bone formation. Together this study is significant in clarifying the cell types in the marrow that give rise to adipocytes and osteocytes, as well as revealing a type of stromal cell with adipocyte potential that restricts bone formation and ensures proper marrow structure. What sets this study apart from preceding single-cell RNA sequencing studies is that it provides functional validation of the computational discoveries.</p><p>While the reviewers recognize the potential significance of the study, there were major concerns that would need to be addressed before it is suitable for publication.</p><p>1) The authors need to deposit their sequencing data in GEO. The data could be password protected and only accessible to the reviewers. Four out of six figures contain computational data. The reviewers found it difficult to assess the bioinformatic analysis without this raw data access.</p><p>2) Use of a new acronym &quot;MERA&quot; appears unwarranted as these cells have many features of previously published CXCL12 abundant reticular cells (CAR cells). Along these lines, the Morrison group described Lepr<sup>+</sup> perivascular stromal population back in 2012 (Ding et al.). In 2014 Zhou et al., again from Morison's group, demonstrated that Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells gave rise to adipocytes and osteoblasts. In 2019 both Baryawno et al. (Figure 2C) and Tikhonova et al. (Sub Figure 4A) reported that a Lepr-high mesenchymal population expresses high levels of Adipoq, Cxcl12, Lpl, etc. Validation of previously published data using Adipoq-Cre-TdT system does not substantiate a discovery of a novel population. Furthermore, Lepr-high cells are pericytes, which by definition are cells that wrap around the endothelial cells, and maintain homeostasis of blood vessels. The authors should better relate their findings to these previous studies, and clarify if &quot;MERA&quot; cells are equivalent to CAR cells or a specific CAR cell subtype. The term &quot;MERA&quot; should be dropped unless they clearly demonstrate why this is a previously unreported population.</p><p>3) The authors used Monocle and Slingshot to infer the ancestor of adipocytes and osteoblasts. They identified markers Sca1, Cd34, and Thy1 specific to that population. As correctly state those tools are used to infer differentiation trajectory and without convincing functional biological data MSC identification is an overstatement and should be greatly toned down. Can the authors identify Sca1+CD34+Thy1+ population by imaging? What is the location of that MSC population relative to the bone marrow? The authors should also reanalyze their datasets with UMAP-based dimensionality reduction to redefine the position of this 'MSC' cluster as tSNE is not considered a good way to visualize inter-cluster relationships. An updated version of Seurat and Monocle has this function readily available in the package. In addition, the authors might consider avoiding the use of the term &quot;MSC&quot; to describe cells in vivo. MSC is a historical term largely used to describe in vitro cultured cells.</p><p>4) The authors should more carefully validate the specificity of <italic>Adipoq-CreER</italic>. This line could accidentally mark 'MSCs' as defined in their scRNA-seq analysis. Further, as pointed out by the authors, this line also labels subcutaneous adipocytes, which can exert non-cell autonomous effects on bone formation. The study using the same <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic>; DTA 'fatless' mice showed that circulating adiponectin and leptin released by subcutaneous adipocytes negatively regulate bone formation (Zou et al., 2019). The authors should highlight the caveats of this study better.</p><p>5) The definition of pericytes and stromal cells of this study is not accurate. The authors use the term pericytes to refer to the entire perivascular stromal cell populations. The general consensus is that pericytes specifically refer to a subset of perivascular stromal cells surrounding small arteries, arterioles. What they refer to as pericytes in this study are reticular cells surrounding sinusoidal vessels. Pericytes and perisinusoidal reticular cells have different morphologies and functions. The authors should clarify the characteristics of <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> labeled cells in the revised manuscript.</p><p>6) Rather than disputing the Aifantis and Scadden annotations, a suggestion would be to correlate their clusters in a more balanced way with these previous studies.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Single cell transcriptomics identifies a unique adipose cell population that regulates bone marrow environment&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including J Gage Crump as the guest Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Clifford Rosen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Iannis Aifantis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>The reviewers agree that this is a beautiful manuscript that details a number of novel computational and biological findings that fit well to a number of closely related datasets. While the majority of issues have been addressed in this revision, I ask that you address the following concerns before we can formally accept your manuscript.</p><p>1) The reviewers all agree that use of the term MSC is problematic, especially given the lack of direct lineage data supporting the Sca1<sup>+</sup> population behaving as stem cells in this study. The term &quot;MSC&quot; should be dropped and replaced by a more neutral term such as &quot;mesenchymal progenitor&quot;. Perhaps &quot;early mesenchymal progenitor&quot; and &quot;late mesenchymal progenitor&quot; and stress that early/late refers to interpretation of scRNA-seq analysis rather than direct lineage tracing. Discussion of these populations as &quot;stem cells&quot; should also be removed throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2) Some additional language highlighting similarities of MALP cells to previously reported CAR cells should be provided.</p><p>3) The simple lineage diagram provided in the response letter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) would be good to include in the main Figure 1. I would also suggest using LiLA instead of Ad to denote mature adipocytes in Figure 1 and beyond.</p><p>4) I would show <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> in the paper – potentially as supplementary data. This is a nice image and confirms the presence of rare Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells.

Along these lines, the Morrison group described Lepr<sup>+</sup> perivascular stromal population back in 2012 (Ding et al). In 2014 Zhou et al., again from Morison's group, demonstrated that Lepr<sup>+</sup> cells gave rise to adipocytes and osteoblasts. In 2019 both Baryawno et al. (Figure 2C) and Tikhonova et al. (Sub Figure 4A) reported that a Lepr-high mesenchymal population expresses high levels of Adipoq, Cxcl12, Lpl, etc. Validation of previously published data using Adipoq-Cre-TdT system does not substantiate a discovery of a novel population. Furthermore, Lepr-high cells are pericytes, which by definition are cells that wrap around the endothelial cells, and maintain homeostasis of blood vessels. The authors should better relate their findings to these previous studies, and clarify if &quot;MERA&quot; cells are equivalent to CAR cells or a specific CAR cell subtype. The term &quot;MERA&quot; should be dropped unless they clearly demonstrate why this is a previously unreported population.</p></disp-quote><p>The concern raised by the reviewers is whether MERA is a previously unreported population. Based on our data and previous publications, we believe that MERAs are a major component of LepR<sup>+</sup> and CAR cells, bearing resemblance to Adipo-CAR cells proposed in a recent publication (Baccin et al., 2020). Initial reports of LepR<sup>+</sup> cells and CAR cells emphasized their stem cell/progenitor nature but ignored their heterogeneity (Omatsu et al., 2010, Zhou et al., 2014). Hence, many of their properties, such as perivascular residence and regulatory actions on hematopoiesis, were attributed to MSCs. Our study demonstrated that MERAs are neither MSCs nor progenitors with bi-lineage differentiation ability. Indeed, they are a novel adipose cell population not identified in the previous studies of LepR<sup>+</sup>/CAR cells. Recent studies using single cell RNA-seq confirmed that both LepR<sup>+</sup> cells and CAR cells are heterogeneous, containing a large cell population with high adipocyte gene expression (Matsushita et al., 2020, Tikhonova et al., 2019). Functionally, we reported that MERAs regulate marrow vessels and bone formation as adipose cells but not as MSCs, which has never been reported for LepR<sup>+</sup> cells and CAR cells.</p><p>During the Gordon Research Conference (Bones and Teeth) and ORS 2020 Annual Meeting last month, we consulted several bone and stem cell experts about the proper name for this novel cell population. We all agreed that these cells are located between mesenchymal progenitors and lipid-laden adipocytes (LiLAs) on the adipogenic differentiation route of bone marrow MSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). One suggestion is to name them Adipoq<sup>+</sup> cells. However, we strongly disagree with the idea of using a marker to name a subpopulation that can be hierarchically defined in a lineage. In the past, researchers have used markers, such as PaS, LepR, Cxcl12, Osterix etc., to refer to the cells they are interested in. However, this type of nomenclature is misleading in many circumstances. For example, Zhou et al. 2014 reported that LepR<sup>+</sup> cells are mesenchymal progenitors with CFU-F forming and bi-lineage differentiation abilities. Thus, they concluded that LepR<sup>+</sup> cells represent the main source of bone formed by adult bone marrow. Accordingly, Baryawno et al. 2019 interpreted their LepR<sup>+</sup> cell cluster as MSC. However, our data and Tikhonova et al. 2019 data clearly show that LepR<sup>+</sup> cells are heterogeneous covering a wide range from MSCs to adipocytes. According to our sequencing data, LepR is expressed at a much higher level in the adipocyte cluster than in the MSC cluster. Similarly, Cxcl12+ cells are also heterogeneous covering the entire mesenchymal lineage cells with a highest level of expression in the adipocyte cluster. In addition, marker expression is often fluid and dynamic among subpopulations. For example, sequencing data revealed that LepR expression in MSC cluster increases from a very low level in young mice to a substantially high level in aging mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 2D), which fits well with the conclusion from Zhou et al. 2014 that LepR<sup>+</sup> cells marks MSCs only during the adult stage but not the adolescent stage. Now with more knowledge of mesenchymal subpopulations, we believe that the hierarchical location is a better way to name a subpopulation than markers.</p><p>Another suggestion is to name them adipoblast because of the analogy between these cells and osteoblasts. Interestingly, osteoblasts are located at a similar hierarchical location as our cells in the differentiation route: between mesenchymal progenitors and osteogenic terminally differentiated osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Also similar to our cells, osteoblasts are abundant and have important functions different than osteocytes.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Large scale scRNA-seq identifies subpopulations of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells from MSCs to mature cells.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-54695-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><p>The third suggestion is to drop the function-related terms and simply name them based on their hierarchical location: marrow adipogenic lineage precursors (MALPs). We adopted this suggestion and revised our manuscript accordingly. However, we also favor “adipoblast”. If the Editors/reviewers have a recommendation, we will be glad to modify our manuscript again. For now, we refer our cells as MALPs in this rebuttal letter and manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors used Monocle and Slingshot to infer the ancestor of adipocytes and osteoblasts. They identified markers Sca1, Cd34, and Thy1 specific to that population. As correctly state those tools are used to infer differentiation trajectory and without convincing functional biological data MSC identification is an overstatement and should be greatly toned down. Can the authors identify Sca1+CD34+Thy1+ population by imaging? What is the location of that MSC population relative to the bone marrow? The authors should also reanalyze their datasets with UMAP-based dimensionality reduction to redefine the position of this 'MSC' cluster as tSNE is not considered a good way to visualize inter-cluster relationships. An updated version of Seurat and Monocle has this function readily available in the package. In addition, the authors might consider avoiding the use of the term &quot;MSC&quot; to describe cells in vivo. MSC is a historical term largely used to describe in vitro cultured cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments and agree that MSC is not the best term for cluster 1 cells. We added several sentences in the Results to explain that those cells are likely the most primitive cells of bone marrow mesenchymal lineage cells. We cannot exclude the possibility that there are more primitive cells that are not labeled by <italic>Col2-Cre</italic> but give rise to cluster 1 cells. But this possibility is low because Td expression starts from the mesenchymal condensation stage and Td labels all CFU-F colonies in Col2/Td mice. In the hematopoiesis field, HSC is defined that a single cell can re-constitute the entire blood system. Unfortunately, we do not have a similar assay in the bone field demonstrating that a single cell can generate an entire bone. Therefore, we are unable to biologically demonstrate the MSC nature of cluster 1 cells.</p><p>We also agree with the reviewers that MSC is a historical term for cultured cells. However, similar to HSC, MSC has been widely used in the literature to refer to in vivo stem cells. The most recent example is the LepR<sup>+</sup> MSC cluster identified by scRNA-seq analysis of non-hematopoietic cells in bone marrow (Baryawno et al., 2019). For simplicity, we use MSCs, late MSCs, MBP, and LCP to name cluster 1, 2, 3, and 6, respectively, in the clustering plots. We will be glad to consider any other suggestions from Editors/reviewers about cluster names.</p><p>Based on the reviewers’ suggestion, we added UMAP plots to the manuscript. Clearly, UMAP generated a similar clustering pattern and gene expression patterns as tSNE, further validating the differentiation trajectory of MSCs and the existence of novel mesenchymal subpopulations we identified by tSNE.</p><p>According to the reviewers’ suggestion, we performed immunostaining of Sca1 and CD34 on 50 µm-thick Col2/Td bone sections. Td+Sca1+ or Td+CD34+ cells are rare with approximate one cell per section. They displayed a reticular stromal shape, which is different from the round shape of Td-Sca1+ or Td-CD34+ hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). They had a stromal location with no direct contact with vessels, so they did not appear to be pericytes. Since this manuscript focuses on MALPs not MSCs and more experiments are required to confirm their MSC nature, we do not include this piece of data in this manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Detection of bone marrow MSCs in vivo.</title><p>Representative images of stromal MSCs in 1-month-old Col2/Td mice.

This line could accidentally mark 'MSCs' as defined in their scRNA-seq analysis. Further, as pointed out by the authors, this line also labels subcutaneous adipocytes, which can exert non-cell autonomous effects on bone formation. The study using the same Adipoq-Cre; DTA 'fatless' mice showed that circulating adiponectin and leptin released by subcutaneous adipocytes negatively regulate bone formation (Zou et al., 2019). The authors should highlight the caveats of this study better.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers might refer to the Adipoq expression in cluster 1 (MSC) of tSNE plot and dropplot. Adipoq expression level is very low in MSC cluster with only 1 transcript/cell detected in 83 cells out of 280 MSCs in 1 month dataset. On the contrary, its expression level is high in the adipocyte cluster with an average 17 transcripts/cell detected in all 1077 adipocytes. It is important to note that the detection threshold of lineage tracing is likely different from that of sequencing. Our lineage tracing data clearly revealed that both <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> and <italic>CreER</italic> do not label CFU-F forming cells and do not incorporate EdU. Thus, they do not mark MSCs at 1 month of age.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the data from fatless mice. Zou et al. 2019 used <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> DTA mice with no fat tissue since development. In our study, we used <italic>Adipoq-Cre</italic> DTR mice with normal fat tissues before DT injections. To understand whether bone phenotypes observed in our cell ablation model are due to the crosstalk from peripheral fat depots, we repeated our experiments with fat transplantation to restore peripheral fat tissues. Interestingly, fat transplants did correct hyperglycemia but did not block the abnormal vessel and bone phenotypes, indicating that MALPs, but not peripheral fat depots, affect bone marrow vasculature and bone formation. These data are now added to the manuscript (Figure 7—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The definition of pericytes and stromal cells of this study is not accurate. The authors use the term pericytes to refer to the entire perivascular stromal cell populations. The general consensus is that pericytes specifically refer to a subset of perivascular stromal cells surrounding small arteries, arterioles. What they refer to as pericytes in this study are reticular cells surrounding sinusoidal vessels. Pericytes and perisinusoidal reticular cells have different morphologies and functions. The authors should clarify the characteristics of Adipoq-Cre labeled cells in the revised manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Mural cells comprise two cell types required to stabilize vascular networks. Pericytes surround smaller caliber vessels, whereas vascular smooth muscle cells surround larger vessels. Also stated in a recent review (Armulik et al., 2011), “the currently accepted definition of a mature pericyte as a cell embedded within the vascular basement membrane (BM) came with the application of electron microscopy. As discussed below, this definition is difficult to apply in situations of active angiogenesis. Another commonly applied defining criterion is the presence in microvessels, i.e., capillaries, postcapillary venules, and terminal arterioles”. Therefore, pericytes refer to cells surrounding capillaries but not large vessels such as arteries and arterioles. In bone, the vast majority of vessels are capillaries. Emcn staining we used here detects capillaries but not arteries.</p><p>In our manuscript, pericytes are specifically referred to cells attached to capillaries via cell body. As shown in Figure 5, pericytes appear as small bulges on the vessels that express basement membrane Laminin. Td+ cells in Adipoq/Td bone marrow exist as pericytes and stromal cells. The later one refers to those cells not attaching to vessels via cell body. However, many of them extend cell processes to wrap around vessels as another way of contact.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion and we revised our manuscript to better reflect our definition of pericytes and stromal cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Rather than disputing the Aifantis and Scadden annotations, a suggestion would be to correlate their clusters in a more balanced way with these previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and we modify the Discussion accordingly.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The reviewers agree that this is a beautiful manuscript that details a number of novel computational and biological findings that fit well to a number of closely related datasets. While the majority of issues have been addressed in this revision, I ask that you address the following concerns before we can formally accept your manuscript.</p><p>1) The reviewers all agree that use of the term MSC is problematic, especially given the lack of direct lineage data supporting the Sca1<sup>+</sup> population behaving as stem cells in this study. The term &quot;MSC&quot; should be dropped and replaced by a more neutral term such as &quot;mesenchymal progenitor&quot;. Perhaps &quot;early mesenchymal progenitor&quot; and &quot;late mesenchymal progenitor&quot; and stress that early/late refers to interpretation of scRNA-seq analysis rather than direct lineage tracing. Discussion of these populations as &quot;stem cells&quot; should also be removed throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion. We agree that we cannot biologically demonstrate that Sca1<sup>+</sup> cells are MSCs due to lack of suitable technique.

First, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> is a simplified version of Figure 8. Adding it to Figure 1 will cause redundancy. Second, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> contains MALP, whose name has not been defined in Figure 1 yet. Later, functional studies validate its hierarchical location and reveal its function in bone, leading to the name “MALP”. In Figure 1, we use a general term Adipocyte for MALP due to their adipogenic marker expression. Figure 1 does not contain mature adipocyte LiLA because lipid-laden cells cannot be captured for single cell analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I would show <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> in the paper – potentially as supplementary data.
