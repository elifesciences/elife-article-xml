To determine their role in the molecular organization of synapses in vivo, we studied synapse development and plasticity in hippocampal neuronal circuits in mice lacking both <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic>. We found that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate the density and morphological integrity of excitatory synapses on CA1 pyramidal neurons in the developing brain but are not essential for these roles in the mature circuit. Further, they are required for long-term-potentiation in the CA3-CA1 pathway and the dentate gyrus, and for enduring fear memory in both the developing and mature brain. Our data show that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 regulate synapse development and function in a cell-type and developmental-stage-specific manner, and thereby contribute to the fine-tuning of hippocampal circuit connectivity and plasticity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>LRRTMs</kwd><kwd>synapse organization</kwd><kwd>synaptic

differentiated synaptic junctions. Synapse organizing proteins coordinate the precise alignment of pre- and post-synaptic components of a synapse and impart them with distinct physiological properties necessary for neuronal circuits to function and control behavior. Presynaptic neurexins, arguably the best characterized synapse organizers, bind to multiple postsynaptic ligands, including neuroligins and leucine-rich-repeat transmembrane neuronal proteins (LRRTMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>), and act as hubs for presynaptic development and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reissner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>).</p><p>The LRRTMs are a family of four postsynaptic transmembrane proteins that instruct presynaptic differentiation in contacting axons, and mediate postsynaptic recruitment of scaffold proteins and transmitter receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Roppongi et al., 2017</xref>). In cell culture studies, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 exhibited similar synaptogenic activities through dual binding to the heparan sulfate modification and splice variants of neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roppongi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) indicating that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 likely have overlapping functions. In contrast to neuroligins, which have broad expression profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>), individual LRRTMs are expressed in a region-restricted manner in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaurÃ©n et al., 2003</xref>). Within the hippocampus, for instance, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are the only family members expressed in the CA1 region ,whereas all LRRTMs are expressed in the dentate gyrus (DG).</p><p>Accordingly, LRRTMs are thought to function as cell-type selective synapse organizers, but the exact roles of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in synapse development have remained unresolved as corresponding studies yielded divergent and partially contradictory results. ShRNA-based knock-down (KD) studies in cultured neurons or brain slices produced differing results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soler-Llavina et al., 2011</xref>), where KD of LRRTM2 alone reduced the numbers of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>) whereas combined KD of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 did not affect synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). Further, KD or genetic knock-out (KO) of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> in mice causes a~10% loss of excitatory synapses and a redistribution of synaptic vesicles in certain sublaminae of the hippocampal CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroeder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takashima et al., 2011</xref>). These subtle alterations are likely due to functional compensation by LRRTM2, which is co-expressed with LRRTM1 in the CA1 region. Finally, it is unclear whether the synapse loss caused by <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> deletion is due to a role of LRRTM1 in synapse formation or the prevention of their elimination. While the reasons for the multiple discrepant data on LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are not known, it is likely that the well-known confounds of KD approaches, overexpression artifacts, and ectopic synaptogenic activity have played a major role in in vitro studies but less so in experiments involving in vivo models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">SÃ¼dhof, 2018</xref>).</p><p>Due to their role in synapse formation, maturation, and function, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are critical players in multiple aspects of circuit and brain function. Most notably, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 contribute to long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 pyramidal neurons. This is likely due to their ability to anchor AMPA receptors at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhouri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramsey et al., 2021</xref>), but what is not known in this context is whether LRRTMs are required for LTP in other cell-types that express them.

These cues are acquired by exploratory behavior encoded in cortical structures, such as subiculum, and nucleus accumbens which send projections to the dorsal hippocampus and are consolidated in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fanselow, 2000</xref>). In both, LRRTM1/2-DKO and -cDKO mice, LTP is impaired in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8B</xref>).

Therefore, we examined hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning to assess long term memory encoding in LRRTM1/2-cDKO and control mice.

For comprehensive analysis, we generated and analyzed three models: (1) Global early deletion model (LRRTM1/2-DKO); (2) Local early deletion (P0-LRRTM1/2-cDKO) and; (3) Local late deletion (LRRTM1/2-cDKO).</p><p>Our investigations led us to the following conclusions. First, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are important for the normal development of excitatory synapses, selectively in the hippocampal CA1 region. Second, inhibitory synapses throughout the hippocampus and are not affected by the loss of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2. Third, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are dispensable for the maintenance of normal numbers of excitatory synapses in mature neurons. Fourth, synaptic deficits due to LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 deletion are postsynaptic in origin. Fifth, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are required for LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in both developing and mature neural circuits. Surprisingly, in this context, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are also required for LTP at dentate gyrus synapses. These results indicate that the roles of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in synapse development and plasticity are functionally dissociable. Finally, our results show that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are essential for enduring hippocampus-dependent long-term contextual memory.</p><p>There is substantial discord in the LRRTM literature due to conflicting data obtained in LRRTM KD experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soler-Llavina et al., 2011</xref>). Whereas in one study, shRNA-mediated KD of LRRTM2 in hippocampal neuron cultures was shown to significantly reduce synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>), a different study indicated that shRNA-mediated KD of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in hippocampal cultures does not alter synapse numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ko et al., 2011</xref>). When combined with neuroligin-3 KD in neuroligin-1 KO neurons, however, shRNA-mediated KD of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 caused reductions in the number of excitatory synapses in hippocampal cultures but did not reduce spine density in CA1 neurons in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Soler-Llavina et al., 2011</xref>). Our findings provide clarity and resolve some of these discrepancies. In contrast to previous studies, we found that constitutive deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> causes significant reductions in the numbers of asymmetric synapses, VGlut1 puncta fluorescence, spine density, and mEPSC frequency in CA1 neurons in vivo. Likely reasons for these discrepancies include differences between in vitro and in vivo settings and problems with the specificity, efficacy, and timing of KD approaches. As opposed to our constitutive deletion approach, acute deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> in mature neurons did not alter the number of synapses but led to significantly reduced mEPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhouri et al., 2018</xref>). However, consistent with the constitutive deletion approach, local early deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> in the CA1 (P0-LRRTM1/2-cDKO) significantly reduced mEPSC frequency, and was accompanied with modest decrease in mEPSC amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results indicate that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 mediate distinct functions in developing and mature neurons. Specifically, during development, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 contribute to synapse development whereas in the mature brain, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhouri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karimi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ramsey et al., 2021</xref>), they contribute to maintaining the complement of AMPARs at synapses.</p><p>A key open question in our understanding of neural circuit formation concerns the molecular factors that determine the regional, or cell-type specificity of synapse formation. We show that the constitutive loss of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> leads to reduced synapse numbers selectively in the CA1 region. Our results are in agreement with previous studies showing dispersed synaptic vesicles or slightly reduced synapse numbers in specific laminae of CA1 in mice lacking <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Schroeder et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takashima et al., 2011</xref>). Loss of <italic>Lrrtm3</italic> or <italic>Lrrtm4</italic>, or a knock-in mutation in <italic>Lrrtm4</italic> that blocks its interaction with heparan sulfate, selectively reduce synapse numbers in the dentate gyrus but not in the CA1 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Wit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roppongi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Um et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, deletions of several other organizers of excitatory synapses have either no or much more widespread effects on synapse numbers. Synapse numbers in mice lacking neuroligin 1 or neuroligin 3 are not altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blundell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>), and even in cultured neurons and the brain of newborn neuroligin 1â3 triple KO mice, synapse numbers are unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varoqueaux et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, neuroligins are thought to function in synapse maturation and plasticity but not in initial synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">SÃ¼dhof, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, mice lacking IL1RacP, for instance, have reduced numbers of excitatory synapses and reduced spine density in all brain regions analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 2012</xref>), and EphB1-3 triple KO mice exhibit widespread reductions in the numbers of excitatory synapse numbers and dendritic spines, for example in cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Henkemeyer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kayser et al., 2006</xref>). These more widespread functions of IL1RacP and EphB1-3 contrast with the cell selective functions of LRRTMs.</p><p>LRRTMs are co-expressed with multiple other synapse organizers in both pyramidal neurons and granule cells. In the developing hippocampus (Global DKO), we observed a 25â30% loss of excitatory synapses in the CA1 indicating that in pyramidal neurons, LRRTM1/2 are important drivers of synapse development. However, CA1 pyramidal neurons express multiple other postsynaptic organizers, including neuroligins, which likely account for significant functional compensation for the loss of LRRTMs in these cell types.</p><p>LRRTMs have discrete expression profiles, and levels of individual LRRTMs in different brain regions and cell types vary substantially. In the hippocampus, LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are the only LRRTM family members expressed in CA1, whereas all LRRTMs are expressed in the dentate gyrus, with LRRTM4 expression exhibiting a particularly high level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">LaurÃ©n et al., 2003</xref>). Given their sequence homology and common associations with AMPA receptors and PSD-95 family scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de Wit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linhoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soler-Llavina et al., 2013</xref>), it is likely that in developing dentate gyrus neuronal circuits, LRRTM3 and LRRTM4 can compensate for the loss of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2. Indeed, loss of LRRTM3 or LRRTM4 substantially reduces synapse numbers in the dentate gyrus, without affecting synapse development in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">de Wit et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Roppongi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Siddiqui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Um et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we discovered now that loss of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in the CA1 pyramidal neurons and dentate gyrus granule cells have differential effects on synapse numbers and synaptic transmission. Outside the hippocampus, LRRTM1 is important for complex retinogeniculate synapse development and retinal convergence in visual thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Monavarfeshani et al., 2018</xref>) and for controlling excitatory synaptic function in the mediodorsal thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karimi et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, LRRTMs are necessary cell-type selective mediators of synapse development and function. Additionally, NGL-2 and Latrophilin2 regulate synapse development specifically in the stratum radiatum and stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeNardo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sando et al., 2019</xref>). In more general terms, synaptic specificity in the mammalian central nervous system may be conferred not by a single synapse organizer but by a set of factors that define a combinatorial code such as those contributed by cell types, subcellular compartments, and dendritic domains. Careful parsing of the roles of individual proteins or subsets of proteins will help us to devise a comprehensive catalog of the molecular factors that contribute to the development of synaptic connectivity in specific brain circuits.</p><p>Interestingly, both constitutive and adult deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> led to a robust impairment of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses in the stratum radiatum, accompanied by a deficit in hippocampus-dependent long-term contextual memory. These results are consistent with previous KD studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Soler-Llavina et al., 2013</xref>), with behavioral studies on <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Karimi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takashima et al., 2011</xref>), and with the growing evidence of a key role of synapse organizing proteins in synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bhouri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, we found that acute deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> in the dentate gyrus caused a similar LTP impairment as in the CA1 region. Although the role of LRRTM3 and LRRTM4 in synaptic plasticity remains untested, our results demonstrate that LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 contribute to LTP through mechanisms that do not require other LRRTMs.</p><p>Our results provide a causal link between the role of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in the control of synapse function in the dorsal hippocampus and long-term contextual memory. The region selective functions of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are further demonstrated by the lack of effect of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>Lrrtm2</italic> deletion in the dorsal hippocampus on social interaction or avoidance-related anxiety, which have been linked to the ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>). Future studies could address the functional contributions of the LRRTMs in the ventral hippocampus and other brain regions where they are expressed.</p><p>In conclusion, the present study emphasizes the importance of studying brain-region-specific and developmental-stage-specific roles of synaptic adhesion molecules in synapse development and function. As is the case with their ligands of the neurexin family, alterations in <italic>LRRTM</italic> genes increase the risk for neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Francks et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Malhotra et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pinto et al., 2010</xref>). Based on the present data, we propose that regional and temporal variations in synaptic development, transmission, and plasticity due to alterations in <italic>LRRTM1</italic> or <italic>LRRTM2</italic> contribute to these disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of LRRTM1/2-DKO mice</title><p>All animal experiments complied with government and institutional guidelines.

After deep plane of anesthesia is obtained, the mice were administered 0.5% Bupivacaine (8 mg/kg) to intended area of incision subcutaneously and Meloxicam (2 mg/kg) subcutaneously. The mice were kept immobilized using Kopf stereotaxic apparatus. Bilateral craniotomy was made in the skull using co-ordinates for dorsal hippocampus (AP â2.1; ML Â±1.4; DV â2.0). Glass pipette containing viral solution was inserted and the virus was delivered at a flow rate of 0.1 Î¼l/min through a picospritzer. The skin was then sutured, and the mice were allowed to recover for 3 weeks.</p><p>For P0 injections, the virus was mixed with Trypan blue to obtain a final concentration of 0.1% Trypan blue. The virus mixture was then loaded in a 5 Âµl Hamilton syringe. For injections, a stage was made manually according to the dimensions used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathon et al., 2015</xref>). The stage was then placed in a petri dish filled with ice on the stereotaxic frame. LRRTM1/2<italic><sup>floxed/floxed</sup></italic> P0 pups were anesthetized by placing the pups on ice for 2 min. Anesthesia was confirmed by gently squeezing the paws or tail of the pup and monitored lack of movement.

These neuronal proteins are organizing proteins in the synapse and known to play a role on development and plasticity. The current literature in unclear on the exact role these proteins play due to the diverse technical approaches used in previous studies which often led to contradictory findings. The current study aims to clearly identify the roles of these proteins by using a thorough experimental design. The reviewers were positive about the prospect of the current study offering clarity on previously disputed questions. They found that the data quality is high, and the mains conclusions are well supported, and this work is important contribution to the field. At the same time, it was noted that this study does not offer substantially novel functional insights into the mechanism by which LRRTM1/2 contributes to synaptic functions. In the absence of these novel insights, the clear strength of the study is in the systematic and careful comparison between various approaches that aim to eliminate LRRTM1/2 from the synapses and the thorough examination of several parameters under these different conditions. For this reason, the authors need to significantly improve this angle of their study so that it can stand as a critical work that sheds light on previously contradictory findings. The reviewers identified several key areas that would need to be implemented with additional data. These are listed below and the rationale for these experiments is explained in the reviewer's individual reports.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Linking the 2 parts of the study together through a more consistent experimental design that allows the authors to property differentiate between the effects of local vs global and developmental changes in LRRTM1/2 levels.</p><p>2. Assessment of KD with WB or IHC.</p><p>3. Consistent parallel measurements from DG and CA1.</p><p>4. Evaluation of presynaptic function, mini analysis from cDKO CA neurons.</p><p>5. Synapse density from all dendritic layers in the DG.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Important take aways from this study include: (1) the global loss of LRRTM1/2 results in a ~30% loss of excitatory synapses in the CA1 region of hippocampus; (2) the global loss of LRRTM1/2 results in impaired LTP and contextual fear conditioning; (3) the postnatal (post developmental) loss of LRRTM1/2 does not lead to a loss of synapses in CA1 but does impair LTP and contextual fear conditioning.</p><p>This is an important contribution to the field.</p><p>However, I do have a few concerns.</p><p>Most importantly, the link between the two halves of the study (global LRRTM1/2 loss versus temporal/regional deletions) could be strengthened. As it stands now, distinct methods were used to generate these two models of LRRTM loss and that could lead to over interpretation of the results. In the first half of the paper LRRTM1/2 are lost globally which means that they are lost from both the pre- and postsynaptic partners in CA1 (as well as everywhere else in the brain). In the second half, the loss of LRRTM1/2 is driven by regional, viral administration of Cre into dorsal hippocampus after developmental synaptogenesis. One interpretation is that the loss of these adhesion molecules after developmental synaptogenesis does not impair synapse number as the developmental roles for these molecules have already passed. However, an alternative is that the regional delivery is not removing LRRTMs from the necessary cells. While LRRTMs are well established for roles in postsynaptic cells, it remains possible that they have yet to be defined non-synaptic or even presynaptic roles. To better compare the phenotypes in the first and second halves of this study I see two approaches. One could be to use a global CreER rather than viral delivery. I understand what a pain that would be and how much time it would take. The alternative could be to use viral administration of Cre into the P0 dorsal hippocampus. Based on how they describe the turnover of LRRTMs this should delete these adhesion molecules well before synaptogenesis (and well before there analysis which was at 6 weeks) and could better link the two halves of the study.</p><p>Another concern that I had involves the assessment of KD of LRRTMs after viral administration of Cre. The authors cite Fornasiero et al. 2018 that the turnover of LRRTMs is quite rapid. While I could not find this in the manuscript, I assume it is in the data deposited elsewhere. Its actually quite a bit faster than the turnover for most of the other synaptic cell adhesion molecules studied in that paper. For this reason, it seems critical to assess the knock down of LRRTMs (by WB or IHC), not just by assessing the number of cells infected. This seems especially important because one of the takehome messages from Fornasiero et al. 2018 was that different brain regions and different synaptic molecules have unique half lives.</p><p>A concern with the methods for IHC analysis involved how images were processed before they were quantified. The authors state that &quot;images were thresholded manually&quot;. So similar thresholds were not used for images that were compared (i.e. control versus dKO)? How were such thresholds selected? Did the authors assess whether varying the thresholds impacted the values of the quantified data? There is data out there that manual thresholding can impact values.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors' key conclusion is that the LRRTM1 and 2 molecules play different roles in different places at different times. This is an important conclusion, though most of the observations here are not very surprising based on the existing literature.</p><p>With early and widespread knockout, synapse numbers (spines, PSDs, mini frequency) are reduced in CA1 but not dentate gyrus. This is not surprising given that we know LRRTM3/4 play important roles in DG and thus are available to compensate there, but are not expressed significantly in CA1.</p><p>â It is confusing to describe the DKO mice from start to finish in the methods without reference to the previous cDKO mice. My impression is that the mice line used in Bhouri 2018 was crossed with Ella-Cre mice here. Is that correct, or were they regenerated with the same tools as the mice described in Bhouri 2018?</p><p>â Parallel measurements in DG and CA1 would strengthen the argument that this paper provides the definitive demonstration of unique and separable roles in the two cell types. Importantly, excluding all detail from analysis of DG synapses in the cDKO animals not only provides a stark contrast with the extensive analysis in the DKO animals but will make for a difficult time interpreting the effects on LTP. Ideally, the analyses in Figure 1S2, 2, 3, and 4 would be carried out in granule cells and their perforant path synapses, though rather than repeating this battery to search for negative effects, it might be sufficient merely to provide a more specific measure of synapse number and a representative measure of synapse function.</p><p>â The effect on post-tetanic potentiation following the stimulus appears strikingly different in Figure 4A and 6B, perhaps suggestive of differential presynaptic effects during the tetanic stimulus, but no assessment of presynaptic function is provided.</p><p>â The LTP experiments in Figure 4 begin with an unbalanced synaptic drive. If 20% of the synapses are lacking, then delivering the stimulus at the same proportion of the maximal response will also be presumably driving the cells with 20% less input. This could cause a difference in the magnitude of LTP. The comparison thus appears a bit unfair, particularly without any assessment of presynaptic function e.g. during the train induction where the remaining DKO synapses could have more quickly decrementing release. (The authors may point out that no difference in PTP magnitude in Figure 4 indirectly argues against this possible difference in presynaptic function.)</p><p>There is further no attempt at discerning a behavioral role for the LTP deficit in DG.</p><p>Some clarification on staining and synapse counting would be useful. It seems that the only analysis of synapse numbers with the late cKO is VGlut or VGAT staining. Are AMPARs lost from the remaining synapses in the early or late DKO neurons?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Dhume and colleagues investigate the contribution of the postsynaptic adhesion molecules LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 to hippocampal circuit function. By crossing floxed LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 mice with the EIIa Cre line, they generate double knockout (DKO) mice. By broadly infecting floxed LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 mice with Cre recombinase expressing AAV, they generate conditional DKO (cDKO) mice. These strategies allow the authors to compare the effects of chronic LRRTM1/2 deletion in DKO mice vs. the effects of LRRTM1/2 deletion in cDKO mice after synapse development has largely completed. The authors find reduced excitatory synapse density in the CA1 region of LRRTM1/2 DKO mice but not cDKO mice. LTP is impaired in both DKO and cDKO mice, confirming previous results (Bhouri et al., PNAS 2018).

The study is a follow up to the previously published work by Bhouri et al., but uses two different deletion strategies and adds data on synapse density and behavioral paradigms. The LTP experiments presented are similar to that study, with the difference that Bhouri et al. recorded LTP in sparsely infected CA1 neurons from LRRTM1/2 cDKO mice compared to the population measurements in this study, and the additional analysis of LTP in cDKO DG in this study.</p><p>1) Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1 panels B and C appear to show western blot analysis of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 levels in different LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 genotypes, but the figure legend mentions PCR.

The band pattern also appears different from what was reported before in Bhouri et al., PNAS 2018. Please explain.</p><p>2) Figure 1B, C: what was the rationale for only analyzing synapse density in the medial molecular layer in DG? Linhoff et al., Neuron 2009 showed prominent LRRTM2 immunoreactivity in the outer molecular layer of the DG. Analyzing synapse density in all dendritic layers in DG should be performed, also to allow comparison with the data presented in Figure 5 (analysis of synapse density in all layers of DG in LRRTM1/2 cDKO).</p><p>3) The cDKO strategy should be validated, using western blot analysis of dorsal hippocampal lysate.</p><p>4) Using the cDKO strategy but sparser deletion of LRRTM1/2, Bhouri et al. showed a decreased mEPSC amplitude (but not frequency) in CA1 neurons. It would be informative to analyze mEPSC frequency and amplitude in LRRTM1/2 cDKO CA1 neurons in this study, to compare to the synapse density data shown in Figure 5.</p><p>5) As a suggestion, the Results section might benefit from a more explicit comparison in the text between the two strategies used by the authors (i.e. chronic LRRTM1/2 deletion in Figures 1-4 vs broad viral vector-mediated deletion of LRRTM1/2 in 3 week-old animals after synapse development has completed in Figure 5-7). Now the text for the cDKO mice section emphasizes analysis in the mature brain (page 11), whereas the timepoint of analysis (injection in 3 week-old mice + 3 weeks for analysis) does not differ much from the DKO mice (6-7 weeks old). As another example, the description of the contextual fear memory experiment in Figure 7 is more elaborate than the description for (what appears to be) the same experiment in Figure 4. The findings from the two genetic strategies could be contrasted more clearly, and in some cases, such as the fear memory experiment, even be presented side-by-side for example.</p><p>Experiments to address my points 2 and 3 are needed to strengthen the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64742.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Linking the 2 parts of the study together through a more consistent experimental design that allows the authors to property differentiate between the effects of local vs global and developmental changes in LRRTM1/2 levels.</p></disp-quote><p>The original study had two experimental models: (1) global deletion of LRRTM1 and 2 from birth and analysis at 6-7 weeks of age (Global DKO); and (2) conditional deletion of LRRTM1 and 2 in the dorsal hippocampus and analysis at 6-7 weeks of age (Local late cDKO). For a more consistent study design and to properly differentiate between the effects of local vs global and developmental changes in LRRTM1 and 2 levels, we added several new experiments. The new experiments are now included in Figures 1, 3, 5, 7, Figure 1âfigure supplement 3, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1, Figure 8âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>To better link the two parts of the study, we analysed a third model â deletion of LRRTM1 and 2 in the CA1 at postnatal day 0 (P0) and analysis at 6-7 weeks of age. Thus, the revised manuscript now includes three distinct deletion models to comprehensively understand the contributions of LRRTM1 and 2 to synapse development and function: (1) <italic>Global DKO</italic>, (2) <italic>Local early cDKO (P0),</italic> and (3) <italic>Local late cDKO</italic>. For consistency, all analyses were done at 6-7 weeks of age. This design allowed us to cleanly and comprehensively differentiate between the effects of local versus global knockout and early versus late knockout. The new experiments strengthened our original conclusions about the context-dependent functions of LRRTM1 and 2 in the CA1 where LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 are the only family members expressed and, in the DG, where all LRRTM family members (LRRTM1-4) are expressed. The summary of our findings are as follows.</p><p>i) In the CA1 of Global DKO, excitatory synapse numbers were reduced in all layers of the CA1 as assessed by reduced VGlut1 synaptic puncta immunofluorescence (Figure 1B and C). Accordingly, ultrastructural studies revealed reduced excitatory synapse numbers and reduced spine density in Global DKO (Figure 2). Consistent with these findings, mEPSC frequency was reduced but mEPSC amplitude was unaffected (Figure 3A-C).</p><p>As advised by the reviewers, the Global DKO model does not allow us to distinguish whether the effects of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> deletion is pre- or postsynaptic. Therefore, we developed and assessed synaptic function in a new deletion model â the <italic>Local early cDKO (P0)</italic> model. Consistent with the Global DKO, we found that local early deletion of <italic>Lrrtm1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> in the CA1 significantly reduced mEPSC frequency (Figure 5). A modest reduction in the mEPSC amplitude was also observed. These results indicate that LRRTM1 and 2 mediate postsynaptic functions in the CA1. The <italic>Local early cDKO (P0)</italic> model did not, however, allow us to reliably measure VGluT1 and GAD65 synaptic puncta immunofluorescence because to selectively target the CA1, we could only obtain partial infection of CA1 using a reduced viral load. Increasing the viral load could target more CA1 neurons but caused spillover in the CA3 and dentate gyrus, and would thus not be an appropriate experimental design. Therefore, in the <italic>Local early cDKO (P0)</italic> model, we focused on mEPSCs from individual infected neurons, which is a reliable measure of synaptic function.</p><p>In the CA1 of Local late cDKO, VGlut1 synaptic puncta immunofluorescence was indistinguishable from that in control mice (Figure 6D and E). Accordingly, mEPSC frequency was unaltered. Consistent with our previous report (Bhouri et al., 2018), mEPSC amplitude was reduced in the CA1 of Local late cDKO (Figure 7A-C).</p><p>ii) LTP deficits are apparent in both Global DKO (Figure 4A and B) and Local late cDKO (Figure 8). However, the locus of these deficits appears to be mechanistically diverse. Impairments in LTP in Global DKOs are restricted to the maintenance phase (Figure 4A and B), suggesting that presynaptic plasticity in response to high frequency stimulation is intact. We observed modest change in paired-pulse facilitation, limited to delayed interstimulus intervals (ISIs) of 100 and 200 ms, suggesting minimal consequence of Global DKO on presynaptic short-term plasticity. The locus of the deficits is likely postsynaptic, due to impaired stabilization of synaptic AMPARs in the absence of LRRTMs, as we have shown earlier (Bhouri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). In contrast, the Local late cDKOs demonstrate marked reductions in the extent of post-tetanic potentiation following HFS (Figure 8). Note, that a similar PTP deficit in response to late cDKO has been reported previously (Bhouri <italic>et al.</italic>, 2018). As suggested by Reviewer 2, we have assessed pre-synaptic function by examining paired-pulse facilitation (Figure 8 âfigure supplement 1). We now show that there is no difference between control and Local late cDKOs suggesting that mechanisms underlying shortterm facilitation are not impacted by Local late cDKO. We speculate that presynaptic mechanisms distinct from the paired-pulse facilitation may underlie the PTP deficits in the Local late cDKO. Alternatively, the complement of postsynaptic glutamatergic receptors or their retention in the postsynaptic membrane following LTP may be altered in the absence of LRRTM1/2, shifting the induction threshold for LTP, as we have shown earlier (Bhouri et al., 2018). Investigations into these possibilities are beyond the scope of the current manuscript but could be pursued in future studies.</p><p>iii) In the DG, effects of Local late cDKO of LRRTM1 and 2 was similar to that observed in the CA1 â no changes in VGlut1 puncta immunofluorescence (Figure 6F and G) or mEPSC frequency but reduced mEPSC amplitude (Figure 7D-F) and impaired LTP (Figure 8D-F). These results suggest that in the DG, LRRTM1 and 2 contribute to synaptic transmission and LTP through mechanisms that are distinct from that of LRRTM3 and LRRTM4, that are co-expressed in the DG. However, in the DG of Global DKO, whereas VGlut1 puncta immunofluorescence was unchanged in the inner and medial molecular layers, it was increased in the outer molecular layer (Figure 1D and E), and was accompanied by increased mEPSC frequency (Figure 3D-F). These results point to a possible compensatory mechanism within this circuit, by other dentate gyrus resident synapse organizers, requiring further investigation in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Assessment of KD with WB or IHC.</p></disp-quote><p>As advised, we confirmed effective depletion of LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in the Local late cDKO using immunocytochemistry of brain sections (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). LRRTM1 is enriched in the stratum radiatum whereas LRRTM2 is enriched in the stratum lacunosum moleculare of CA1 and outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1). AAV-Cre delivery selectively to the CA1 of LRRTM1/2 floxed mice depleted LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 immunofluorescence intensity in the CA1 but not in the DG. Thus, our approach using viral methods was effective in ablating LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 in targeted regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Consistent parallel measurements from DG and CA1.</p></disp-quote><p>For consistent parallel measurements from DG and CA1, we added several new experiments for a total of nine parallel measurements. Thus, as advised by the reviewers, we assessed synapse numbers, function and plasticity in both CA1 and DG of Global DKO and Local late cDKO. The nine parallel measures include:</p><p>1.

No change in paired pulse facilitation was observed in Local late cDKOs when compared to controls (Figure 8 âfigure supplement 1). Additionally, we observed change in paired pulse facilitation in Global DKO at delayed (100 and 250 ms), but not early (20 and 50 ms), interstimulus intervals (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). Further, as advised, we completed mini analysis from LRRTM1/2-cDKO CA1 neurons (Figure 7A-C), and to strengthen the study, we also did parallel mEPSC measurements from LRRTM1/2-cDKO DG granule cells (Figure 7D-F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors state that &quot;images were thresholded manually&quot;. So similar thresholds were not used for images that were compared (i.e. control versus dKO)? How were such thresholds selected? Did the authors assess whether varying the thresholds impacted the values of the quantified data? There is data out there that manual thresholding can impact values.</p></disp-quote><p>We prefer manual thresholding because the optimal threshold for selecting puncta varies according to the local background which is not uniform. An absolute intensity threshold does not always work very well. The human eye is good at detecting puncta from local background and the process can be made relatively objective by performing all analysis blind to the experimental group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors' key conclusion is that the LRRTM1 and 2 molecules play different roles in different places at different times. This is an important conclusion, though most of the observations here are not very surprising based on the existing literature.</p><p>With early and widespread knockout, synapse numbers (spines, PSDs, mini frequency) are reduced in CA1 but not dentate gyrus.

The reviewer is correct that the mice line used in Bhouri et al., 2018 was crossed with Ella-Cre mice in this study. We have revised the methods section to correctly reflect this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â Parallel measurements in DG and CA1 would strengthen the argument that this paper provides the definitive demonstration of unique and separable roles in the two cell types. Importantly, excluding all detail from analysis of DG synapses in the cDKO animals not only provides a stark contrast with the extensive analysis in the DKO animals but will make for a difficult time interpreting the effects on LTP. Ideally, the analyses in Figure 1S2, 2, 3, and 4 would be carried out in granule cells and their perforant path synapses, though rather than repeating this battery to search for negative effects, it might be sufficient merely to provide a more specific measure of synapse number and a representative measure of synapse function.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we focused on cognitive assessment because we observed reduced synaptic function as well as plasticity in dorsal hippocampus when LRRTM1/2 was deleted (both Global DKO and Local late cDKO). Hippocampus-dependent long-term contextual learning is encoded primarily by the dorsal hippocampus and its associated structures (Dong et al., 2009; Fanselow and Dong, 2010). Both the CA1 and the DG play central roles in encoding context-dependent long-term memories in the brain (Frank et al., 2004; Hainmueller, 2020; Stefanelli et al., 2016; Wiltgen et al., 2006). Therefore, our study design only allowed us to focus on the role of LRRTM1/2 in dorsal hippocampal (CA1+DG)-dependent cognitive function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The effect on post-tetanic potentiation following the stimulus appears strikingly different in Figure 4A and 6B, perhaps suggestive of differential presynaptic effects during the tetanic stimulus, but no assessment of presynaptic function is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>This was addressed in Essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â The LTP experiments in Figure 4 begin with an unbalanced synaptic drive. If 20% of the synapses are lacking, then delivering the stimulus at the same proportion of the maximal response will also be presumably driving the cells with 20% less input. This could cause a difference in the magnitude of LTP. The comparison thus appears a bit unfair, particularly without any assessment of presynaptic function e.g. during the train induction where the remaining DKO synapses could have more quickly decrementing release. (The authors may point out that no difference in PTP magnitude in Figure 4 indirectly argues against this possible difference in presynaptic function.)</p></disp-quote><p>This was addressed in Essential revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is further no attempt at discerning a behavioral role for the LTP deficit in DG.</p><p>Some clarification on staining and synapse counting would be useful.

With sparser neurons, it was technically feasible for us to assess synaptic levels of AMPAR subunits in the mediodorsal thalamus. This measure is a bit more unreliable in the hippocampus because of the higher synaptic density. In future studies, we plan to use expansion microscopy to accurately assess synaptic surface levels of AMPARs in hippocampal subregions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Dhume and colleagues investigate the contribution of the postsynaptic adhesion molecules LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 to hippocampal circuit function. By crossing floxed LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 mice with the EIIa Cre line, they generate double knockout (DKO) mice. By broadly infecting floxed LRRTM1 and LRRTM2 mice with Cre recombinase expressing AAV, they generate conditional DKO (cDKO) mice. These strategies allow the authors to compare the effects of chronic LRRTM1/2 deletion in DKO mice vs. the effects of LRRTM1/2 deletion in cDKO mice after synapse development has largely completed.

However, without their signal peptides, the molecular weights of mouse LRRTM1 and 2 are 54.9 kDa and 55.3 kDa, respectively. The band sizes in the Western blotting therefore are correct. The difference in band pattern is likely due to different sample preparation methods, boiling versus heating at 55 degrees.

The revised manuscript now contains results from three different deletion models (Global DKO, Local early cDKO and Local late cDKO) of LRRTM1/2 in the hippocampus rather than the previous two deletion models (Global DKO and Local late cDKO). Although, the models have many parallel measurements (discussed in Essential revision 3), we believe that presenting results from each deletion model individually would help with the flow of the revised manuscript. The results from parallel measurements are discussed more thoroughly in the Discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>References</p><p>Bhouri, M., Morishita, W., Temkin, P., Goswami, D., Kawabe, H., Brose, N., Sudhof, T.C., Craig, A.M., Siddiqui, T.J., and Malenka, R.
