pathophysiological disturbance in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), known to be independently associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the effect of IH on cardiac fibrosis and molecular events involved in this process are unclear. Here, we tested IH in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced cardiac fibrosis and signaling linked to fibroblast activation. IH triggered cardiac fibrosis and aggravated Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice. Plasma thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) content was upregulated in both IH-exposed mice and OSA patients. Moreover, both in vivo and in vitro results showed IH-induced cardiac fibroblast activation and increased TSP1 expression in cardiac fibroblasts. Mechanistically, phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 mediated the IH-induced TSP1 expression and fibroblast activation. Finally, STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 or AAV9 carrying a periostin promoter driving the expression of shRNA targeting Stat3 significantly attenuated the synergistic effects of IH and Ang II on cardiac fibrosis in mice. This work suggests a potential therapeutic strategy for OSA-related fibrotic heart disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>intermittent hypoxia</kwd><kwd>cardiac fibrosis</kwd><kwd>cardiac fibroblast activation</kwd><kwd>STAT3</kwd><kwd>TSP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81800251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Qiankun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81570304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Guangping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81800297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Targeting STAT3 provides a potential therapeutic strategy for obstructive sleep apnea-related fibrotic heart disease mediated by TSP1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The prevalence of sleep apnea is high in patients with cardiovascular disease, which could be caused by multiple risk factors including respiratory instability, obesity and upper airway dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Javaheri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasai et al., 2012</xref>). Sleep apnea, classified as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and central sleep apnea, affects or covaries with numerous health outcomes and physiological processes, particularly cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Javaheri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Somers et al., 2008</xref>). A recent prospective study of OSA found it associated with increased risk of incident heart failure in community-dwelling middle-aged and older men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gottlieb et al., 2010</xref>). OSA is associated with a profile of perturbations that include sympathetic nerve activity, metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, vascular endothelial dysfunction, and intermittent hypoxia (IH), all of which are critical for the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Javaheri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kasai et al., 2012</xref>). IH is a hallmark of OSA and initiates several mechanisms that lead to cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wei et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins by cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), which respond to pathological stress and environmental stimuli by transforming into myofibroblasts. Activated CFs express elevated levels of various proinflammatory and profibrotic factors causing fibroblast proliferation, migration and scar formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>). The persistence of myofibroblasts eventually results in adverse changes in ventricular structure and compliance, thereby leading to heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>). However, the effect and mechanism of CF activation in IH-induced cardiac remodeling remain unclear.</p><p>One central cytokine linked to cardiac fibrosis is transforming growth factor Î² (TGFÎ²), which is highly regulated at the level of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meng et al., 2016</xref>). The activation of latent pro-TGFÎ² requires thrombospondin-1 (TSP1, encoded by <italic>Thbs1</italic> gene), which is a matricellular glycoprotein and can be secreted by various cell types, to remove its latency-associated propeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Meng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crawford et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and Lawler, 2011</xref>). Myocardial TSP1 expression was increased in a mouse model of pressure overload because of transverse aortic constriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xia et al., 2011</xref>), and blocking TSP1-dependent TGFÎ² activation prevented cardiac fibrosis progression and improved cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belmadani et al., 2007</xref>). However, the role and underlying mechanism of TSP1 in IH-induced CF activation and cardiac fibrosis remain to be elucidated.</p><p>As a member of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein family, STAT3 was originally identified as an interleukin-6âactivated transcription factor. It can also be phosphorylated by receptor-associated Janus kinase (JAK) in response to growth factor and hemodynamic stress, thus acting as a regulator in fundamental cellular processes including inflammation, cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2018</xref>). Emerging evidence demonstrates that STAT3 signaling is hyperactivated in fibrotic diseases, which may be an important molecular checkpoint for tissue fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chakraborty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Recent study demonstrated that STAT3 can drive TSP1 expression in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tyzack et al., 2014</xref>). Given the integrated function of STAT3 activation in inflammation and fibrosis, we hypothesized that IH-induced STAT3 activation might play a crucial role in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis by increasing TSP1 expression.</p><p>In the present study, we investigated the effect of IH exposure on cardiac fibrosis in response to angiotensin II (Ang II) in mice and the potential underlying mechanism. TSP1 expression induced by IH in CFs, mediated by phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, was involved in CF activation and cardiac fibrosis. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of STAT3 restrained IH-induced CF activation and cardiac fibrosis and ameliorated IH-induced cardiac dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IH induced cardiac fibrosis and aggravated Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction in mice</title><p>Most respiratory events of patients with OSA result in desaturationâreoxygenation sequences that cause IH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baguet et al., 2012</xref>).

Consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schafer et al., 2017</xref>), Ang II treatment induced cardiac fibrosis with increasing the ratio of heart weight to tibial length and fibrosis area and impaired EF and FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>). Strikingly, IH exposure further impaired cardiac function, with increasing the ratio of heart weight to tibial length and decreasing EF and FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1BâD</xref>). IH exposure significantly enlarged the fibrotic area of heart as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1EâF</xref>). IH exposure had little effect on myocyte size or ratio of apoptotic cells in the left ventricle with or without Ang II challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâC</xref>). These results indicated that IH could induce cardiac fibrosis both at the basal level and in response to Ang II and also aggravated Ang II-induced cardiac dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IH induced fibroblast activation in myocardial interstitium</title><p>CFs are now recognized for their fundamental contributions to the heartâs response to various forms of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>). To investigate the effect of IH on fibroblast activation, we analyzed the expression of Î±-SMA, collagen I and periostin in the left ventricle of mice after IH exposure. First, immunofluorescence staining showed strongly Î±-SMA signaling in vimentin-positive CFs in the IH group. IH-induced Î±-SMA expression in CFs was further enhanced under the Ang II-induced cardiac pathologic condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâH</xref>). Meanwhile, the expression of collagen I and periostin showed a similar trend as Î±-SMA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1GâH</xref>). In addition, IH exposure slightly increased the mRNA and protein levels of Î±-SMA, collagen I and periostin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâK</xref>) in the mouse left ventricle and significantly elevated the levels in the left ventricle of Ang II-infused mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâK</xref>). These results suggest that IH can activate CFs at the basal level and under the Ang II-induced injury condition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IH exposure promoted TSP1 expression in CFs</title><p>To test whether TSP1 plays an important role in the progression of cardiac fibrosis induced by IH, we next detected TSP1 expression in mice after IH exposure. As compared with normoxia, IH exposure significantly increased plasma TSP1 content and mRNA level in the mouse left ventricle, especially in Ang II-infused mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AâB</xref>). The protein level of TSP1 in the left ventricle showed a similar trend to that of collagen I and periostin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>). Given that TGFÎ² and its downstream Smad signaling critically modulate the fibroblast phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cucoranu et al., 2005</xref>), we assessed Smad2/3 phosphorylation in the mouse left ventricle. The phosphorylation of Smad2/3 was slightly increased after IH exposure but greatly increased after IH exposure in the Ang II-induced injury condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2CâD</xref>), which is consistent with TSP1 expression. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining showed elevated signaling of TSP1 in the left ventricle after IH, especially in the Ang II-induced condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2EâF</xref>).

We tested whether TSP1 plays an important role in fibroblast activation and found the mRNA expression of <italic>Thbs1</italic> significantly increased by IH as compared with normoxia in mPCFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In addition, IH significantly increased the protein level of TSP1 beginning from 2 hr and sustained until 8 hr in mPCFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâG</xref>). Furthermore, shRNA lentivirus used to produce TSP1 deficiency in PCFs attenuated IH-induced mRNA and protein levels of Î±-SMA, collagen I and periostin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâK</xref>). TSP1 deficiency in PCFs also blocked inflammatory gene Tnfa expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>) induced by IH exposure.

Here, we hypothesized that STAT3 might play a vital role in IH-induced TSP1 expression and cardiac fibrosis. Since the phosphorylation status of STAT3 is related to its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ihle, 1995</xref>), we determined the phosphorylation of STAT3 at multiple sites as well as the phosphorylation of JAKs in mPCFs under IH. STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 was significantly increased by IH from 0.5 to 2 hr, but STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 or total STAT3 was not altered by IH exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâB</xref>). Meanwhile, IH exposure significantly induced the phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr1008 without affecting that of JAK1 or JAK3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâB</xref>). A JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, abolished the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 induced by IH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4CâD</xref>), so IH-induced STAT3 phosphorylation might be mediated by JAK2. Phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 was reported to be crucial to STAT3 nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Darnell et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ihle, 1995</xref>), so we next analyzed the STAT3 subcellular localization. STAT3 nuclear translocation was significantly increased by IH on immunofluorescent staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâF</xref>). Moreover, in the mouse left ventricle after IH exposure, consistent with results in vitro, IH exposure induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705 but not Ser727 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4GâH</xref>). Also, IH exposure or together with Ang II markedly increased STAT3 nuclear localization in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>).

In individuals with end-stage PH, both protein and mRNA levels of TSP1 are elevated in the lung parenchyma and pulmonary artery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rogers et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, TSP1 blockade protected against Schistosoma- and hypoxia-induced PH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, TSP1 protein expression was significantly elevated in patients with OSA as compared with healthy controls. Strikingly, OSA incidence is high in patients with PH, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and other cardiac diseases, which suggests that TSP1 might be the common pathologic mechanism in OSA-associated cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, TSP1 might be a biomarker for diagnosis of OSA-related cardiac dysfunction, and reducing IH-upregulated TSP1 expression might be crucial to protect the cardiac function of patients with sleep apnea.</p><p>TGFÎ², perhaps the most extensively studied mediator of fibroblast activation and having the greatest role in pathological fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Travers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Leask and Abraham, 2004</xref>), can be activated by TSP1 binding to a defined site on latency-associated propeptide and inducing a conformational change in the latent complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Murphy-Ullrich and Poczatek, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ribeiro et al., 1999</xref>). The kinetics of its gene expression, along with its independence from de novo protein synthesis, led to classifying TSP1 as an immediate early-response gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Majack et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Patel et al., 1997</xref>).

Consistently, we found that IH upregulated <italic>Thbs1</italic> continuously from 2 to 8 hr. However, IH-induced TSP1 protein expression in PCFs peaked at 2 hr and decreased from 4 to 8 hr. The concentration of TSP1 in culture medium was still increased from 4 to 8 hr, which suggests that IH might promote TSP1 secretion as well. However, the mechanism underlying TSP1 secretion needs further elucidation.</p><p>STAT3, as a multifaceted molecule, plays a central role in organic fibrogenesis and cardiac hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Hypoxic stress can induce phosphorylation of STAT3 and its simultaneous nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Noman et al., 2009</xref>). Here we found that STAT3, as a TSP1 transcription factor, was phosphorylated at Tyr705 and translocated into the nucleus after IH exposure, then promoted fibroblast activation. In addition, STAT3-null mice showed severe fibrosis with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jacoby et al., 2003</xref>), but in transaortic constriction-induced cardiac remodeling, selective inhibition of STAT3 by S3I-201 significantly improved EF and decreased the left ventricle chamber dilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Unudurthi et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, we found that S3I-201 treatment reduced the pathologic upregulation of TSP1 and ameliorated the cardiac fibrosis of IH-exposed mice with or without Ang II infusion. Importantly, these results were further confirmed by using AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3. Direct blockade of TSP1/TGFÎ² signaling is a major therapeutic challenge because of its ubiquitous nature and localized signaling effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). Our results indicated that targeting the pathologic activation of STAT3 might hold promise as a potentially safe approach in preventing IH-induced cardiac fibrosis.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrated that IH upregulated the expression of TSP1 in both mice and humans, and TGFÎ² pathway activation induced by JAK2/STAT3/TSP1 signaling played a vital role in IH-induced fibroblast activation and cardiac fibrosis.

All mice were housed in a controlled environment (20Â Â±Â 2Â°C, 12 hr/12 hr light/dark cycle) and maintained on a standard chow diet with free access to water. Intermittent hypoxia (IH) was induced as described previously by using an automated system to control ambient oxygen concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Savransky et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). Briefly, O<sub>2</sub> concentration was decreased to 4â6% approximately every 60 s. IH mice were exposed to IH for 8 hr/day in the light time for 28 days. In the pathologic cardiac fibrosis model, mice were subcutaneously implanted with an osmotic minipump (2004 model, Alzet, CA) containing Ang II (1 mg/kg/day) in saline (0.9% w/v) or an identical volume of saline. After the surgery, all mice were exposed to IH for 28 days. In rescue experiments, S3I-201 (5 mg/kg) was given by intraperitoneal injection every 2 days during or after the IH exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Adeno-associated virus (AAV) construction and infection</title><p>The AAV used in this study was constructed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Piras et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, AAV9 carrying a periostin promoter driving the expression of shRNA targeting Stat3 (AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3) was constructed by Shanghai Genechem Co. (Shanghai). The sequences of the shRNAs were for shStat3, <named-content content-type="sequence">GTCACACAGATGAACTTGGTCTTCAGGT</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">GCATCAATCCTGTGGTATA</named-content>. The periostin AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3 or AAV9-periostin promoter-shScramble (1.5Â ÃÂ 10<sup>11</sup> v.g) was injected into the tail vein of mice. At 1 week post-injection, mice were exposed to IH with or without Ang II infusion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>Trans-thoracic echocardiography was performed on all mice by using a Vevo 2100 system with a MS400 linear array transducer (VisualSonics, ON, Canada) as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, mice were anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and kept warm on a heated platform (37Â°C). The chest hairs were removed by using depilatory cream, and a layer of acoustic coupling gel was applied to the thorax. An average of 10 cardiac cycles of standard 2-D and m-mode short axis at mid-papillary muscle level were analyzed. Left ventricular ejection fraction and dimensions were calculated by using a modified Quinone method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Histology</title><p>Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for 24 hr at room temperature and embedded in paraffin. Hearts were sectioned at 5 Î¼m for staining. Collagen deposition was stained with Massonâs trichrome (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and Sirius red (Solarbio Life Sciences, Beijing) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Images of sections were captured under an Olympus inverted microscope (IX53, Tokyo) and fibrotic areas were semi-quantitatively determined by using ImageJ 1.52.</p><p>For immunofluorescence staining, harvested hearts were fixed and embedded in OCT (VWR, PA) and sectioned at 5 Î¼m. Then, sections were stained with primary antibodies for TSP1, Collagen I, periostin, Î±-SMA and vimentin overnight at 4Â°C. Alex 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alex 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies were used as secondary antibodies. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. TUNEL staining kit (KGA7073-1, KeyGEN BioTECH, Nanjing) was used for analyzing apoptotic cells in cardiac tissue. Images were acquired under an Olympus inverted microscope (IX81, Tokyo). Fluorescent intensity was quantified by using ImageJ. Colocalization of Î±-SMA and vimentin was quantified by using the Image J with colocalization plugin. Briefly, the plugin initially generates an 8-bit image with only the colocalized points, then it combines the three 8-bit images in an RGB image. Two points are considered as colocalized if their respective intensities are strictly higher than the threshold of their channels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>RTâqPCR</title><p>RNA was extracted by using the Eastep Super Total RNA Extraction Kit (LS1040, Promega, WI). cDNA was synthesized by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad, CA). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed with gene-specific primers shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Proteins were isolated from snap-frozen heart tissue and cultured cardiac fibroblasts (CFs), which were extracted in RIPA solution with a protease inhibitor cocktail (#4693132001) and PhosSTOP (#04906845001, both Roche, IN). Proteins were quantified by using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Then, 20 Î¼g each protein was separated on SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred onto PVDF membranes, blocked with TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin, and blots on membranes incubated with antigen and antibody complexes were detected by an ECL protocol with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG as secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were quantified by using ImageJ 1.52.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Isolation and culture of primary CFs (PCFs)</title><p>Isolation of mouse primary CFs (mPCFs) was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Briefly, mouse hearts from freshly euthanized C57BL/6 mice were harvested and minced to 1 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Somers et al., 2008</xref>) in cold phosphate buffered saline. Minced tissue was subsequently digested with buffer containing collagenase II (#V900892, Sigma-Aldrich, MO) and trypsin (Solarbio life Sciences, Beijing) under constant stirring at 37Â°C for 60 min. The supernatants were spun to collect cells. Then cells resuspended in DMEM/F12 (#11320033, Gibco, MA) were plated into dishes and incubated for 2 hr. Supernatant was discarded and dishes were replenished with fresh medium. mPCFs were incubated at 37Â°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and grown to 70â80% confluence. Cells at passages 2 to 3 were used in experiments. Cells exposed to IH were maintained in a hypoxia chamber (5% CO<sub>2</sub>; balance N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub> from 5% to 21%) for the indicated times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Flow cytometry was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2014</xref>). Digested cells from mouse hearts were suspended in staining buffer containing the relevant surface marker antibodies (PE/Cy7 anti-mouse CD45, CD31, CD11b, Ter119, and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse Thy1) in the dark for 30 min at room temperature. Then, for intracellular staining, cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10 min at â20Â°C, then incubated with a stain buffer containing TSP1 or STAT3 antibody. After three washing steps, a secondary antibody conjugated to PE was added. The cells were then washed and ready for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell immunofluorescence staining</title><p>Mouse primary CFs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Then cells were stained with antibodies against Î±-SMA (1:100), STAT3 (1:100) or Ki67 (1:100). Alexa Fluor antibodies (1:200) were used as secondary antibodies. Stress fibers were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Images were acquired under an Olympus laser scanning microscope (IX81, Tokyo).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Collagen gel contraction assay</title><p>The collagen contraction assay was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pincha et al., 2018</xref>).

the impact of intermittent hypoxia (IH), as found in sleep apnea, on fibotic signalling through activation of JAK2, STAT3 and TSP1, leading to expression of SMA, Col1 and periostin reflecting fibroblast activation. A nice feature of this study is that the relatively mild effects of short term IH alone, significantly aggravate the pro-fibrotic effects of Ang II, allowing greater dynamic range for demonstration of its molecular and functional impact on the heart. Significantly, inhibition of STAT3 signaling reverses this impact, pointing to a possible new therapeutic approach for sleep apnea. The study effectively combines in vivo and in vitro evidence for molecular mechanism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Intermittent hypoxia mediated by TSP1 dependent on STAT3 induces cardiac fibroblast activation and cardiac fibrosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Barry Fine (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study proposes a novel mechanism for the induction of cardiac fibrosis in patients suffering obstructive sleep apnea, which involves body-wide exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH). A mouse model was established of IH in the context of a pro-fibrotic stimulus provided by Angiotenin II (Ang II). Cardiac functional outputs were explored in the various treatment groups comparing normoxia and IH. Developed fibrosis (sirius red staining) and induction of signaling pathways (western blotting, qRT-PCR, IF) were also explored. Through a series of in vivo and in vitro studies, the authors find that IH enhances the cardiac fibrosis, HW/BW changes and compromised cardiac outputs induced by Ang II. IH alone had weaker and non-significant effects. They define a pathway for the IH/Ang II interaction involving activation of the transcription factor STAT3 (through phosphorylation at position Y705), leading to induction of TSP1 (an inducer of latent TGFÎ²) and TGFÎ²/Smad2/3 signaling pathway, the main known inducer of cardiac fibrosis in different injury situations. siRNA and chemical inhibitors of STAT3 and TSP1 were used in vivo and/or in vivo to confirm the pathway links. Inhibition of STAT3 using S3I-201 significantly restored cardiac ejection fraction and reduced scar size, accompanied by changes in the proportion SMA+ fibroblasts, STAT3 activating phosphorylation, TSP1 protein levels.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is extensive and novel, and the data are generally clean with a clear message. However the reviewers have identified a number of significant issues that need to be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. In particular, the characterisation of fibrosis using just SMA staining or gene expression in vitro and in vivo is insufficient (SMA is a poor marker of myofibroblasts), and the rapid induction of TSP1 and SMA in vitro within 2 hours begs the question of the validity of the mechanism of activation of fibrosis promoted. We would specifically like to see data on the mechanism of activation of STAT3 and via which JAKs if possible, stronger evidence for STAT3 activation in vivo, and determination that TSP1 is a direct target of STAT3. Strengthening the assessment of fibrosis and accompanying inflammation could be achieved by analysis of collagen and other ECM components directly, and inflammatory markers. Use of genetic markers such as Postn-Cre would be desirable but not essential. Also, many of the other questions and comments should be addressed, although we don't consider human data to be an essential revision.</p><p>1) The concept of Stat3-TSP1-TGFÎ² signaling pathway in cardiac fibrosis activation is interesting. However, the traditional signaling involved in ischemia/hypoxia mediated cellular signaling often leads to cellular injury and death. This study offers a potential opportunity to illustrate if Stat3 activation in cardiac fibroblasts is a specific and unique signaling event for IH vs. ischemia/hypoxia injury. It is also important to investigate the molecular mechanism involved in Stat3 activation under IH and Ang II stimulation. Which JAK molecule is involved? How was Stat3 selected to study among other possible signaling pathways?</p><p>2) Cellular specificity of the Stat3 signaling in cardiac fibrosis should be better demonstrated. Stat3 mediated signaling has a significant impact on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and survival. Much of the in vivo characterization, including Stat3 measurement or inhibitor treatment, can potentially be contributed by myocytes rather than fibroblasts. Their interaction could also be an important contributor to the hypertrophic remodeling and contractile dysfunction. Therefore, authors should recognize the limitation of these data and their in vivo experimental approaches. They should carefully determine the myocyte morphology, apoptotic status and function in conjunction with fibrosis analysis. It is also important to recognize that the IH effect is global to all tissues. Overall, the lack of fibroblast specific manipulation of Stat3 or TSP1 in vivo appears to be a significant limitation of the current study.</p><p>3) In characterization of the relevance of TSP1 induction among OSA patients, there was no data demonstrating potential spectrum of cardiac function among the OSA patients (their Echo parameters) which could be a major support for the functional relevance of the elevated plasma TSP1 in the cardiovascular complications among OSA patients.</p><p>4) The use of human serum samples is quite intriguing and hypothesis generating and unfortunately not very well developed. Clinical relevance and human applicability is always suspect in terms of mouse models so it is quite refreshing that it appears there is some signal of TSP1 in human serum â though this is not well fleshed out by further experiments. The paper, specifically Figures 1 and 2, are very reliant on finding a phenotype that reaches significance thresholds by overlaying with a model of hypertrophy using angiotensin II. The interaction between OSA and hypertension and heart failure is a very hot topic and I think that the authors here really missed a significant opportunity to make a clinical leap. They showed conclusively an additive interaction between IH and angiotensin. What would have really elevated this paper into clinical relevance is treating their mouse model somewhere with an ARB to see if they can mitigate either some of the signaling or mouse phenotype. That could have then been further investigated in their human samples, specifically the TSP1 levels stratified by whether the patient is on an ACEi or ARB. This could have been a real nidus for a clinical trial in terms of treating OSA induced hypertension with RAAS blockade.</p><p>5) The authors use a published intermittent hypoxia model but do not show any indication that the hearts are hypoxic. Based on the mechanism proposed, it is important to distinguish between a direct impact of hypoxia on cardiac fibroblasts (CF) as implied from in vitro data, from myriad other mechanisms that may impact cardiac function including kidney dysfunction and inflammation, to name just two. Showing hypoxia with a hypoxia probe such as pimonidazole is important.</p><p>6) The authors have superficially evaluated the impact of IH and Ang II by evaluating only Î±-SMA expression as a readout of myofibroblast activity. The authors do not evaluate collagen or other ECM genes and do not evaluate the contribution of CF proliferation to the phenotype. Do CF proliferate (e.g. BrdU incorporation, Ki67 or Phospho-histone H3)? Are the CF secreting ECM or other inflammatory cytokines? Are CF contractile? What is the impact on inflammation (TSP1 has been shown to induce inflammation in other heart disease models)? There are also a number of genetic markers of fibroblasts that might complement this study or allow the authors to isolate fibroblast populations by flow cytometry (Tcf21-MerCreMer, Postn-MerCreMer, Col1-CreERT2, Pdgfralpha-MerCreMer).</p><p>7) The authors also rely heavily on co-localization of SMA and vimentin and TSP1 and vimentin by Immunofluorescence. How is co-localization defined (the methods only state fluorescence intensity was quantified by image J)? How is a secreted factor (TSP1) co-localized with an intracellular CF marker? There seems to be considerable background expression of TSP1, perhaps in cardiomyocytes, and very little seems to be specific for CF.</p><p>8) The authors have not shown the mechanism whereby IH induces Stat3 dependent phosphorylation and activity, nor have they demonstrated Stat3 occupancy of a relevant binding site that regulates Tsp1 gene expression with IH. The authors have also not shown Stat3 nuclear accumulation in IH treated mice in vivo, either by immunostaining or nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation and Western. Many of the observed results thus could be true-true and unrelated.</p><p>9) Figure 3D shows a very rapid induction of Tsp1 and SMA protein following IH (2 hrs). This is extremely rapid to see SMA induction even by exogenous TGF-Î² administration, which typically works on the order of days. Furthermore, the finding that TSP1 and SMA are both induced at 2 hrs of IH seems to argue against a linear IH-Stat3-Tsp1-SMA/myofibroblast model as proposed. It seems equally plausible that (If SMA is indeed induced within 2 hrs) that Stat3 or another mechanism acts independently of TSP1 on myofibroblast activation.</p><p>10) The authors treat mice with a Stat3 inhibitor and show it can block fibrosis and functional decline. Can this drug reverse damage already developed by IH?</p><p>11) Figure 2B refers to a significant induction of Tsp1 mRNA by IH alone, which is not true (mRNA is only induced by Ang II alone, or IH plus Ang II). This is surprising, considering the rapid and robust induction of TSP1 protein shown after only 2 hrs of IH in Figure 3D. What is the cause of this discrepancy? Perhaps looking at more acute timepoints would be useful in the mouse model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49923.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The paper is extensive and novel, and the data are generally clean with a clear message.

These comments are valuable for us and we have performed several experiments to address all the concerns. We have added more than 30 novel figure panels that represent new experiments or contain additional experiments. In the revised manuscript, we included more reparative myofibroblast markers (collagen I and periostin). We prolonged the treatment time of IH and looked at more acute timepoints for primary cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation in vitro. Upstream signaling of STAT3 was assessed and we found that JAK2 phosphorylation mediated IH-induced STAT3 activation. Evidence of IH-induced STAT3 activation was also observed in vivo. ChIP assay proved that TSP1 was a direct target of STAT3 in CFs. Assessment of fibrosis and accompanying inflammation were also strengthened with new experiments. Moreover, we determined the effect of AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3 upon IH-induced fibrosis and further confirmed the vital role of fibroblast STAT3 in the process. Below please find our response to each of these comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The concept of Stat3-TSP1-TGFÎ² signaling pathway in cardiac fibrosis activation is interesting.

To address the reviewerâs concern about the upstream of STAT3, we detected phosphorylation of JAK1-3 under IH. As shown in Figure 4A-B, we found that IH induced phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr1008 site time-dependently without altering the phosphorylation of JAK1 or JAK3. In addition, a JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, significantly abolished IH-induced STAT3 activation (Figure 4C-D). These results indicated that JAK2 is involved in IH-induced STAT3 activation.</p><p>TSP1 has been reported to be transcriptionally regulated by STAT3 in astrocytes (Tyzack et al., 2014). Also, STAT3 has been found involved in other fibrosis diseases including skin fibrosis (Chakraborty et al., 2017) and liver fibrosis (Wang et al., 2018). These studies led us to hypothesize that STAT3 might mediate IH-induced TSP1 expression and cardiac fibrosis. We have cited these studies and added a brief introduction: âTSP1 was reported to be transcriptionally regulated by STAT3 in astrocytes, and emerging evidence has indicated that STAT3 is involved in fibrosis diseases. Here, we hypothesized that STAT3 might play a vital role in IH-induced TSP1 expression and cardiac fibrosis.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Cellular specificity of the Stat3 signaling in cardiac fibrosis should be better demonstrated.

Indeed, both STAT3 inhibitor treatment and IH challenge are global to all tissues, although we have demonstrated their roles in vitro. As the reviewer suggested, we assessed effects of IH on cardiomyocyte morphology and apoptotic status (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B-C) in the revised manuscript. Nuclear translocation of STAT3 induced by IH was also observed in CFs in vivo (Figure 4I). In addition, we performed new in vivo experiments with AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3 to knockdown STAT3 in fibroblasts. In line with the STAT3 inhibitor experiments, STAT3 knockdown in CFs significantly attenuated IH and Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and improved cardiac function (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F-K). The new added experiments together with other results further demonstrated that CF STAT3 might mediate IH-induced cardiac fibrosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In characterization of the relevance of TSP1 induction among OSA patients, there was no data demonstrating potential spectrum of cardiac function among the OSA patients (their Echo parameters) which could be a major support for the functional relevance of the elevated plasma TSP1 in the cardiovascular complications among OSA patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments. It is indeed helpful to analyze whether the plasma TSP1 level is associated with cardiac function of OSA patients. Unfortunately, we did not find echocardiography records for the patients and healthy subjects. Since the plasma concentration of NT-proBNP is raised in cardiac impairment (Clin Endocrinol (Oxf). 1997 9;47(3):287-96.), we determined the NT-proBNP concentration in plasma of patients and analyzed the correlation of NT-proBNP and TSP1 concentrations, instead. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the two indexes did not show a significant correlation, which might be due to limited sample number. Another reason might be that the NT-proBNP level could be affected by multiple factors. Considering that the uncertain conclusion might mislead readers, we only present the result in the response letter.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Correlation between NT-proBNP and TSP1 level.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Plasma concentration of TSP1 and NT-proBNP in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), detected by ELISA and fluorescent immunochromatography.

To investigate whether ACEi or ARB might have an effect on IH-induced TSP1 expression, we first performed in vitro experiments in primary CFs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>, valsartan treatment had little effect on IH-induced TSP1 expression and STAT3 activation. This result might be explained in part by our new added results (Figure 4A-D). We found that JAK2 phosphorylation mediated IH-induced STAT3 activation. Hence, our in vitro results indicated that JAK2/STAT3 signaling rather than Ang II/AT1R signaling might play a predominant role in mediating IH-induced cardiac fibrosis. Although ACEi or ARB treatment in the mouse model might have beneficial effects and showed promise for clinical application, the global effects of RAAS blockade and the direct effect on blood pressure could not provide direct evidence to support our hypothesis. For the above reasons, we would like to focus on the potential targets found in the present study. In light of this, we hope that the reviewer will agree that in vivo analysis of the effect of ACEi/ARB is outside the scope of the current manuscript. Here, in the revised version, we have provided two potential therapeutic strategies for the IH-induced cardiac fibrosisin vivo. First, we used the STAT3 inhibitor as a pharmaceutical therapeutic strategy to rescue the IH-induced cardiac fibrosis. Second, STAT3 was knocked down in CFs by using AAV9-periostin promoter-shStat3. In line with the STAT3 inhibitor, STAT3 knockdown also showed impressive restorative effects in IH-induced cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F-K).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of valsartan on IH-induced TSP1 expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mPCFs were cultured under normoxia and IH for 24 hr with or without S3I-201 (S3I, 100 ng/mL) or valsartan (Val, 200 Î¼M).

Several new experiments were performed to address the concerns. First, we agree that Î±-SMA expression as a only readout of myofibroblast activity is insufficient. So, we observed the other two markers (collagen I and periostin) in most experiments for the revised manuscript (Figure 1, Figure 3, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Second, for the in vitro analysis, we observed the expression of collagen I and periostin in CFs (Figure 3I-K), CF proliferation (Figure 3C), CF contraction (Figure 3D) and expression of inflammatory cytokine (Figure 3I). Finally, following the suggestion of the reviewer, we sorted CF populations by flow cytometry and further confirmed the TSP1 upregulation in CFs of IH-treated mice (Figure 2G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors also rely heavily on co-localization of SMA and vimentin and TSP1 and vimentin by Immunofluorescence.

We quantified the colocalization of dual-color immunofluorescence images by using Image J with the colocalization plugin. Briefly, the plugin initially generates an 8-bit image with only the colocalized points, then it combines the three 8-bit images in an RGB image. Two points are considered colocalized if their respective intensities are strictly higher than the threshold of their channels. We detailed the quantification method in the subsection âHistologyâ.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that TSP1 acts as a secretion protein and its localization with vimentin might not be convincing.

To address the reviewerâs concerns about STAT3, we performed new experiments for the resubmitted manuscript. First, we detected the upstream factors of STAT3 and demonstrated that JAK2 but not JAK1 or JAK3 mediated IH-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. IH strongly induced phosphorylation of JAK2 at Tyr1008 but barely had an effect on phosphorylation of JAK 1 or JAK3 (Figure 4A-B). Additionally, a JAK2 inhibitor, TG101209, blocked the IH-increased levels of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 in vitro (Figure 4C-D). These results are consistent with a previous report that JAK2-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation played a critical role in fibroblast activation in systemic sclerosis (Chakraborty et al., 2017.). Second, to investigate whether STAT3 could transcriptionally regulate the expression of TSP1 in CFs directly, we used ChIP assay and found that IH enhanced the enrichment of STAT3 at the TSP1 promoter in PCFs as compared with the control (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A). Finally, we also observed STAT3 subcellular localization in vivo. In line with our in vitro results, IH markedly induced STAT3 nuclear accumulation in CFs (Figure 4I).

To investigate whether IH could really induce primary CF activation rapidly, we detected the expression of collagen I and periostin, which are more promising markers for myofibroblasts, in primary CFs after IH treatment for 2 hr. IH failed to alter their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). Therefore, although IH induced a transient change of Î±-SMA level, IH might not induce primary CF activation in 2 hr. As mentioned by the editor and reviewers, Î±-SMA might be a poor marker to indicate myofibroblasts. In the revised manuscript, we prolonged the stimulation time and included more reparative CF activation markers (collagen I and periostin). Collagen I and periostin expression was significantly increased from 24 to 48 hr (Figure 3I-K), which was consistent with the results observed in vivo.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Effect of Intermittent hypoxia (IH) on the expression of collagan I and periostin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Expression of TSP1, collagen I (Col1) and periostin in mPCFs exposed to IH for the indicated time detected by western blot analysis.

To investigate whether the STAT3 inhibitor could reverse the damage already induced by IH, we treated mice with IH and Ang II for 4 weeks, then treated these mice with S3I-201 (5 mg/kg) for another 2 weeks. We detected the cardiac function index and fibrosis area. As shown in Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A-E, the groups did not significantly differ in the indices, so STAT3 inhibition might not have beneficial effects on damage already induced. One of the possible reasons might be that although fibroblasts are the main effector cells in the pathogenesis of cardiac fibrosis, reversing fibrosis is an active process that may require co-operation of interstitial cell subsets, immune cells, vascular cells, and cardiomyocytes (J Am Coll Cardiol. 2019;73 (18): 2283-2285.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Figure 2B refers to a significant induction of Tsp1 mRNA by IH alone, which is not true (mRNA is only induced by Ang II alone, or IH plus Ang II).

Perhaps looking at more acute timepoints would be useful in the mouse model.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. IH-induced TSP1 expression is a rapid process and we may have missed the peak time point to observe the change of TSP1 mRNA level.
