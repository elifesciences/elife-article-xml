their membranes is incompletely understood. Previously, we have shown that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> broadly re-configures the nutrient transporters at the plasma membrane in response to amino acid availability, through endocytosis of sugar- and amino acid transporters (AATs) (Müller et al., 2015). A genome-wide screen now revealed that the selective endocytosis of four AATs during starvation required the α-arrestin family protein Art2/Ecm21, an adaptor for the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, and its induction through the general amino acid control pathway. Art2 uses a basic patch to recognize C-terminal acidic sorting motifs in AATs and thereby instructs Rsp5 to ubiquitinate proximal lysine residues. When amino acids are in excess, Rsp5 instead uses TORC1-activated Art1 to detect N-terminal acidic sorting motifs within the same AATs, which initiates exclusive substrate-induced endocytosis. Thus, amino acid excess or starvation activate complementary α-arrestin-Rsp5-complexes to control selective endocytosis and adapt nutrient acquisition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutrient aquisition</kwd><kwd>alpha-arrestin</kwd><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>starvation response</kwd><kwd>amino acids</kwd><kwd>amino acid transporter</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 642-2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EMBOCOFUND2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GA-2010-267146</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010591</institution-id><institution>Tiroler Wissenschaftsfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Oliver</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF-Y444-B12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teis</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teis</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P29583</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teis</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-16-CE13-0002-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Leon</surname><given-names>Sebastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>MCBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W1101-B18</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Teis</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic cues enlist ubiquitin ligase adaptors for the selective control of cellular nutrient acquisition strategies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells regulate the import of amino acids, glucose, and other nutrients to fuel metabolism, sustain growth or maintain homeostasis. For the selective transport of amino acids across the plasma membrane (PM) and other cellular membranes, the human genome encodes more than 60 known amino acid transporters (AATs). Mutations in AATs cause severe defects of amino acid metabolism, and the deregulation of AATs is linked to a range of human pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kandasamy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McCracken and Edinger, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>AATs belong to the family of solute carriers (SLCs) and form selective pores that change from an outward- to an inward-facing conformation and thereby transport their amino acid substrates across membranes. Hence, the addition of AATs to the PM or their selective removal by endocytosis determines quantity and quality of amino acid transport. In human cells, the molecular mechanisms leading to the selective endocytosis of AATs are largely unclear.</p><p>The mechanisms for the endocytic down-regulation of AATs are beginning to emerge in the budding yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Yeast cells frequently experience acute fluctuations in amino acid availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Broach, 2012</xref>) and can rapidly remodel their 21 PM-localized AATs to optimize the import of amino acids with regard to the quantity and quality of the nitrogen source available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grenson et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grenson, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">André, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van Belle and André, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bianchi et al., 2019</xref>). The selective, ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis of AATs and other integral PM proteins frequently requires the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Rsp5, the orthologue of human Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hein et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dupré et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Belgareh-Touzé et al., 2008</xref>). To specifically recognize and ubiquitinate PM proteins, Rsp5 interacts with the α-arrestin proteins, a family of ubiquitin ligase adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nikko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). The budding yeast genome encodes 14 α-arrestin proteins (arrestin-related trafficking adaptors, ARTs; Art1-10, Bul1-3 and Spo23), which function in a partially redundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becuwe et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">MacGurn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Babst, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">O'Donnell and Schmidt, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>). Six α-arrestins have been identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez, 2008</xref>). α-Arrestin proteins use PPxY (PY) motifs to interact directly with the three WW domains of Rsp5/Nedd4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becuwe et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rauch and Martin-Serrano, 2011</xref>). How α-arrestins recognize their cargoes in general, and more specifically AATs, is only partially understood, but appears to involve their arrestin domains. These domains have large, disordered loop- and tail-like insertions that contribute to the function of ARTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baile et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The activity of α−arrestins is controlled by complex post-translational modifications (PTMs) involving (de-)ubiquitination and (de-)phosphorylation. In several cases, the binding of α−arrestins to Rsp5 results in their ubiquitination, which is required for function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>). In case of Art1, ubiquitination determines its localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2008</xref>). Additional ubiquitination of ARTs can target them for proteasomal degradation, which is counteracted by deubiquitinating enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ho et al., 2017</xref>). Several α−arrestins are activated by dephosphorylation events in response to nutrient availability or other cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Becuwe et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvaro et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Becuwe and Léon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>). One example are high levels of amino acids, which activate the target of rapamycin complex 1 (TORC1). This leads to inhibition of the kinase Npr1 and thereby promotes the activity of Art1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>). At the PM, Ppz phosphatases activate Art1 by dephosphorylation of its Npr1-dependent phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) and thereby stimulate ubiquitination and endocytosis of the Art1 cargoes Mup1 (methionine transporter), Can1 (arginine transporter), Tat2 (tyrosine and tryptophan transporter) and Lyp1 (lysine transporter) in response to substrate excess. Similarly, TORC1 signaling also promotes endocytosis of the general amino acid permease (Gap1) via the ARTs Bul1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>). It seems that nutrient-dependent TORC1 activation controls α−arrestin-mediated ubiquitin-dependent AAT endocytosis to adjust amino acid influx to metabolic needs.</p><p>Activated Art1 recognizes specific sorting signals in AATs. The flux of methionine through Mup1 or arginine through Can1 requires conformational changes into the inward-facing conformation, which probably dislodge a C-terminal plug that otherwise ‘seals’ the pore. At the same time, it exposes an N-terminal acidic patch that is recognized by activated Art1. Art1 interacts with this acidic patch and then orients Rsp5 to ubiquitinate nearby lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghaddar et al., 2014</xref>). Similar results have been obtained for the uracil transporter Fur4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keener and Babst, 2013</xref>). A further layer of complexity may be added by stimulus-induced phosphorylation of nutrient transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marchal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paiva et al., 2009</xref>), akin to the recognition of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) by β–arrestins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nikko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nobles et al., 2011</xref>). Hence, a molecular basis of α−arrestin-dependent nutrient transporter endocytosis in response to excess nutrients is emerging. We refer to this process as substrate-induced endocytosis.</p><p>Yet, not only substrate transport can induce nutrient transporter endocytosis, but also nutrient limitation, acute starvation or rapamycin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crapeau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laidlaw et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schmidt et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Starvation-induced endocytosis is part of a coordinated catabolic cascade. Together with proteasomal degradation and with macro- and micro-autophagy, it maintains amino acid homeostasis to allow entry into quiescence for cell survival during nutrient limitation. This catabolic cascade at the onset of starvation appears to be conserved in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mejlvang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edinger and Thompson, 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edinger and Thompson, 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vabulas and Hartl, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Suraweera et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms of starvation-induced endocytosis are not clear. Hence, there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding how cells control nutrient transporter abundance upon amino acid and nitrogen scarcity. Here, we have characterized how amino acid abundance alters several nutrient transporters at the PM of the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We find that TORC1 signaling and the general amino acid control (GAAC) pathway toggle Art1- or Art2-Rsp5 complex activities to induce endocytosis of the same set of four different AATs depending on amino acid availability. In these AATs, activated Art1- or Art2-Rsp5 complexes recognize distinct acidic sorting signals in the N-terminal (Art1 sorting signal) or C-terminal (Art2 sorting signal) regions to initiate Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent endocytic down-regulation. Using such complementary α−arrestin switches in combination with distinct acidic sorting motifs in a single nutrient transporter could represent a more general mechanism to adjust transport across cellular membranes and thereby to meet metabolic demands.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Amino acid availability induces selective endocytosis of nutrient transporters</title><p>We employed <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a model system to address how eukaryotic cells adjust their nutrient transporters at the plasma membrane (PM) to nutrient availability.

Consistently, in response to starvation 15 (out of 50) different PM proteins were selectively removed and transported into the vacuole, including four AATs (Mup1, Can1, Lyp1, Tat2) and four carbohydrate transporters (Hxt1, Hxt2, Hxt3, Itr1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The general amino acid permease Gap1 and the ammonium permease Mep2 were up-regulated and now localized to the PM. The localization of 35 GFP-tagged proteins to the PM remained largely unchanged, although in some instances the vacuolar GFP fluorescence was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Therefore, we used the high-affinity methionine transporter Mup1 as a model cargo because its regulation in response to nutrient excess is well characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baile et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, Mup1 is one of the most abundant PM proteins and it is easy to follow its endocytosis and subsequent transport into the vacuole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>). In absence of methionine Mup1-GFP localized to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Low levels of methionine in the growth medium did not efficiently trigger its endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Yet, above a critical methionine concentration the vast majority of Mup1-GFP was removed from the PM by endocytosis and was subsequently transported to the vacuole via the multivesicular body (MVB) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). This was confirmed by western blot (WB) analysis from total cell lysates. Without methionine or with low levels of methionine in the growth medium only full-length Mup1-GFP was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lanes 1+2). Once the critical methionine concentration was surpassed, Mup1-GFP was delivered into the vacuole. The proteolytic degradation of Mup1-GFP inside the vacuole then released free GFP, which remained stable and could be monitored by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>, lane 4). Substrate-induced endocytosis was rapid and efficient: within 60–90 min after methionine addition Mup1 was almost quantitatively delivered to the vacuole. Excess methionine appeared to exclusively induce endocytosis of Mup1 since all other tested PM proteins remained at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This exclusive substrate-induced endocytosis of Mup1 was also dependent on its methionine transport activity as shown by using the Mup1-G78N mutant, which cannot transition to the open-inward conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results are consistent with earlier reports showing that the high-affinity AATs Mup1, Can1, Tat2 and Lyp1 undergo exclusive endocytic down-regulation in response to excess of their respective substrates but remained stable at the PM when the substrate of another permease was present in excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gournas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1 was independent of its capability to transport its substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and was also observed upon starvation for individual essential amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

In contrast, substrate-induced endocytosis of AATs was quick and exclusive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Earlier work showed that substrate-induced endocytosis of the AATs Mup1, Can1 and Lyp1 required TORC1 signaling to allow ubiquitination of the transporters by the HECT-type ubiquitin ligase Rsp5 in complex with the α-arrestin Art1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>).

Class one mutants retained Mup1-pHluorin at the PM after starvation (105 mutants, e.g. <italic>apm2Δ</italic> mutants).

It seemed that the phosphorylation of C-terminal threonine residues (T552, 560) contributed to the starvation-induced Art2-Rsp5 ubiquitination of Mup1 and thus might add an additional layer of regulation, similar to the recognition of GPCRs by β–arrestins in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shukla et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nikko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Marchal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hicke et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>An extended acidic Art1 sorting motif at the N-terminus of Mup1 is required for ubiquitination of K27,28 and subsequent Mup1 endocytosis in response to methionine excess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>).

During amino acid and nitrogen starvation, the general amino acid control (GAAC) pathway upregulates the ubiquitin ligase adaptor Art2 via the transcriptional regulator Gcn4. The ensuing Art2-Rsp5 complex binds with its basic patch to the acidic patch 2 of Mup1 leading to the ubiquitination of K567 and K572 and degradation of Mup1 (right).

The model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> provides the conceptual framework for the mutually exclusive but complementary action of Art1-Rsp5 and Art2-Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase complexes for mediating the selective endocytosis of the methionine transporter Mup1 in response to changes in amino acid availability. Similar concepts may apply for the arginine transporter Can1, the lysine transporter Lyp1 and the tryptophan and tyrosine transporter Tat2. Based on our results and work from others, the endocytic down-regulation of these AATs can be described by the following set of rules: (1) Reciprocal (de-)activation of the α−arrestins Art1 and Art2. (2) Art1 or Art2 each recognize different acidic sorting signals on their client AATs that may require additional phosphorylation. (3) To do so, they employ basic patches in their extended arrestin C-domains and defined PY motifs to orient Rsp5 with high specificity toward proximal lysine residues. These rules satisfy the plasticity required for different α−arrestin and AAT interactions that drive exclusive or relatively broad substrate specificity depending on the metabolic context.</p><p>While both Art1 and Art2 lead to the degradation of AATs, they answer to distinct metabolic cues and are thus wired into distinct signaling pathways. Activation of Art1 by amino acid influx requires the coordinated interplay of TORC1 signaling to inactivate Npr1 (a kinase that negatively regulates Art1) and the action of phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gournas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tumolo et al., 2020</xref>). In response to amino acid limitation, TORC1 is no longer active. This will activate Npr1 to phosphorylate Art1, thereby inactivating it. At the same time, the lack of amino acids will activate the eIF2α kinase Gcn2. Gcn2 will phosphorylate eIF2α, which leads to the global down-regulation of translation, but enables specific translation of the transcription factor Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). Gcn4 then induces transcription of genes required for amino acid biosynthesis and of <italic>ART2</italic>, which causes an increase in Art2 protein levels and thus formation of Art2-Rsp5 complexes. This appears as primary means to activate Art2, since unscheduled increase in Art2 protein levels was sufficient to drive Art2-dependent nutrient transporter endocytosis already in cells growing under rich conditions. When amino acids become available again, the system can efficiently reset. TORC1 is reactivated resulting in Art1 reactivation. Conversely, Gcn4 will become instable and rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kornitzer et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Meimoun et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Irniger and Braus, 2003</xref>), and thus, the transcription of <italic>ART2</italic> will cease. Interestingly, two de-ubiquitinating enzymes (Ubp2, Ubp15) de-ubiquitinate Art2 to influence its protein stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kee et al., 2006</xref>). Inhibiting their activity could provide additional control to repress Art2-dependent endocytosis in cells growing under rich conditions. Our screen identified also two de-ubiquinating enzymes, Doa4 and Ubp6 to be specifically required for starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1. They could act directly on Art2 or Mup1 or help to maintain homeostasis of the ubiquitin pool during starvation.</p><p>Art2 is subject to extensive post-translational modification, including ubiquitination and phosphorylation. Database searches and our own proteomic experiments identified 68 phosphorylation sites and 20 ubiquitination sites in Art2 (data not shown) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Swaney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuquerque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Holt et al., 2009</xref>). How these modifications help to control the activity of Art2 remains a complex and open questions. Several arrestins were found to be phospho-inhibited in specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">MacGurn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Becuwe et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Merhi and André, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Llopis-Torregrosa et al., 2016</xref>), the common molecular basis of which is unknown. An exciting hypothesis would be that α-arrestin hyper-phosphorylation would add negative charges, and thereby prevent the recognition of acidic patches on transporters through electrostatic repulsion. Interestingly, our screen identified the pleitropic type 2A-related serine-threonine phosphatase Sit4 as a class one hit. Hence, Sit4 may be linked directly or indirectly to de-phosphorylation of Art2 and controlling its activity as reported recently for the Art2-dependent regulation of vitamin B1 transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Savocco et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Through the complementary activation of Art1 and Art2, cells can coordinate amino acid uptake through at least four high-affinity amino acid transporters with amino acid availability. The regulation of hexose transporters by glucose availability appears to be conceptually related, with distinct α−arrestin-Rsp5 complexes in charge of down-regulating the same transporters at various glucose concentrations with distinct mechanisms and kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>). In particular, the endocytosis of high-affinity hexose transporters during glucose starvation involves Art8, the closest paralogue of Art2, whose expression is also controlled by nutrient-regulated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hovsepian et al., 2017</xref>). Altogether, a picture emerges in which the transcriptional control of α−arrestin expression by nutrient-signaling pathways is critical to cope with nutrient depletion. This becomes part of the complex regulation of the ART-Rsp5 ubiquitin ligase network.</p><p>Our work also extends on previous findings regarding the determinants of α−arrestin/transporter interaction, indicating communalities between starvation- and substrate-induced endocytosis. Art1-Rsp5 and Art2-Rsp5 complexes both recognize specific acidic sequences on Mup1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Activated Art1-Rsp5 complexes recognize an acidic stretch in the N-terminus of Mup1 and Can1, close to the first transmembrane domain. The exposure of these N-terminal acidic patches is linked to substrate transport and conformational transitions in the transporters from the outward-open to the inward-open conformation, which in Mup1 also includes the so-called ‘C-plug’ (aa 520–543) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guiney et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gournas et al., 2017</xref>). This conformational switch drives lateral re-localization of Mup1 and Can1 into a disperse PM compartment, where they are ubiquitinated by Art1-Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gournas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Busto et al., 2018</xref>). Art2 recognizes specifically an acidic patch in the C-terminal tail of Mup1, and thereby directs Rsp5 to ubiquitinate two juxtaposed C-terminal lysine residues. The C-plug is very close to the C-terminal acidic patch but is not part of the C-terminal Mup1 degron. We speculate that in the absence of nutrients AATs will spend more time in the outward open state with the C-Plug in place. In this state, activated Art2-Rsp5 complexes can still engage the C-terminal acidic patches. Hence, toggling Art1/Art2 activation in combination with accessibility of N- or C-terminal acidic sorting signals in AATs, in part regulated by their conformational state, must fall together to allow selective endocytosis.</p><p>An additional layer of regulation for endocytosis is provided by phosphorylation of AATs close to the acidic sorting signal. At the moment, we can only speculate about the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the C-terminal serine or threonine sites of Mup1. Perhaps, constitutive PM-associated kinases such as the yeast casein kinase one pair (Yck1/2) are involved, which are known to recognize rather acidic target sequences and to regulate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hicke et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paiva et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nikko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Marchal et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>α-Arrestins lack the polar core in the arrestin domain that is used for cargo interactions in β-arrestins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aubry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Polekhina et al., 2013</xref>). Instead Art1-Rsp5 and Art2-Rsp5 complexes each use a basic region in their arrestin C-domain to detect the acidic sorting signal in their client AATs. Studies on the interaction between GPCRs and β-arrestins revealed a multimodal network of flexible interactions: The N-domain of β-arrestin interacts with phosphorylated regions of the GPCR, their finger loop inserts into the transmembrane domain bundle of the GPCR and loops at the C-terminal edge of β-arrestin engage the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Staus et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Huang et al., 2020</xref>). Perhaps, a similar concept also holds true for α-arrestins. This is not unlikely given that their arrestin fold appears to be interspersed with disordered loops and very long, probably unstructured N- and/or C-terminal tails, some of which participate in cargo recognition or membrane interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baile et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite the possible plasticity in substrate interactions, the selectivity of Art1-Rsp5 and Art2-Rsp5 complexes in ubiquitinating lysine residues proximal to the acidic patches of Mup1 is remarkable. Mup1 has 19 lysine residues at the cytoplasmic side: four at the N-terminal tail, six in the C-terminal tail and nine in the intracellular loops of the pore domain. Yet, Art1-Rsp5 complexes only ubiquitinate K27 and K28, whereas Art2-Rsp5 complexes only ubiquitinate K567 and K572. Even in the Hxt3-Mup1-C chimeric protein, Art2-Rsp5 complexes ubiquitinated only the lysine residues close to the acidic patch, despite six further lysine residues in the directly adjacent C-terminal tail of Hxt3. How is this possible? We speculate that these two α-arrestin-Rsp5 complexes orient the HECT domain of Rsp5 with high precision toward the lysine residues that are spatially close to the acidic patches. Once ubiquitinated, the AAT can engage the endocytic machinery to be removed from the PM.</p><p>In conclusion, Art1-Rsp5 complexes act rapidly to prevent the accumulation of excess amino acids, whereas the Art2-Rsp5 complexes help to degrade idle high-affinity amino acid transporters over longer periods of starvation to recycle their amino acid content. Starvation-induced endocytosis and the subsequent degradation of membrane proteins is required to maintain intracellular amino acid homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Müller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). As such, it is well suited that Art2 activity and thus starvation-induced endocytosis of AATs is co-regulated and coordinated with de novo amino acid biosynthesis via the GAAC pathway. The down-regulation of AATs together with glucose transporters and further PM proteins could also free up domains at the PM that are populated by selective nutrient transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Spira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grossmann et al., 2008</xref>) for transporters with broader substrate specificity such as the general amino acid permease Gap1 and the ammonium transporter Mep2, which are strongly up-regulated during starvation. Hence starvation-induced endocytosis could prepare cells – anticipatory – for non-selective nutrient acquisition, as soon as nutrients become available again. Consistent with this notion and a role of Art2 during starvation, yeast cells with mutations in <italic>ART2</italic> show an altered adaptation to repetitive cycles of starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wloch-Salamon et al., 2017</xref>). However, at the moment, it is not clear how these physiological defects are linked to the role of Art2 in starvation-induced endocytosis. Hence, despite the emergence of regulatory mechanisms, we are still far from understanding how each individual ART-Rsp5 complex controls nutrient acquisition and how this process translates into fine-tuning of metabolism, cell growth and survival. Even more unclear is how the activities of the entire ART-Rsp5 network are harmonized to achieve a coordinated cellular response to nutrient availability. Since a more global disruption of the ART-Rsp5 network causes proteotoxic stress with strong growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nikko and Pelham, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hein et al., 1995</xref>), addressing these important questions will require new approaches.</p><p>Altogether, our results provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that couple metabolic signaling and nutrient availability to nutrient transporter endocytosis in budding yeast. This might provide basic insights and principles for the vastly more complex regulation of the nutrient transporter repertoire in human cells under normal as well as pathophysiological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

The flow cytometry screen for genes affecting the starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1-pHluorin was performed using the non-essential gene deletion strain collection purchased from Open Biosystems (<italic>BY4742: MATα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0</italic>) transformed with pRS416 expressing Mup1-pHluorin. For all other experiments, the SEY6210 parental strain was used (see key resources table).</p><p>In all experiments, except the genome-wide flow cytometry screen, cells were cultivated in rich medium containing: 6,7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids (#HP26.1, Roth, Germany), 20 mg/L adenine hemisulfate (#A3159-25G, Sigma, Austria), 20 mg/L arginine (#1655.1, Roth, Germany), 230 mg/L lysine monohydrate (#4207.1, Roth, Germany), 300 mg/L threonine (#T206.2, Roth, Germany), 30 mg/L tyrosine (#T207.1, Roth, Germany), 2% glucose (#X997.5, Roth, Germany). The rich medium was supplemented when required for the auxotrophic strains with: 20 mg/L histidine (#3852.1, Roth, Germany), 60 mg/L leucine (#3984.1, Roth, Germany), 20 mg/L tryptophan (#4858.2, Roth, Germany), 20 mg/L uracil (#7288.2, Roth, Germany), 20 mg/L methionine (#9359.1, Roth, Germany). Starvation medium contained 1,7 g/L Yeast Nitrogen Base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate (#J630-100G, VWR, USA) and 2% glucose (#X997.5, Roth, Germany).</p><p>Yeast cells were cultivated in rich medium and kept for at least 24 hr in exponential growth phase by dilution into fresh medium before onset of all experiments at mid-log phase. All cultivations were done at 26°C. Substrate-induced endocytosis of Mup1 was triggered by the addition of 20 mg/L methionine (#9359.1, Roth, Germany) and, unless otherwise stated, analyzed 1.5 hr after the treatment. For starvation experiments, exponentially growing cells (0.4–0.6 OD<sub>600</sub>/ml) were washed twice with and resuspended in starvation medium (1 OD<sub>600nm</sub>/ml) and incubated for the indicated times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Genetic modifications and cloning</title><p>Genetic modifications were performed by PCR and/or homologous recombination using standard techniques. All chromosomal tags were introduced at the C-terminus of the target ORFs to preserve the endogenous five prime regulatory sequences. Chromosomally modified yeast strains were analyzed by genotyping PCR and/or DNA-sequencing. Plasmid-expressed genes including their endogenous or heterologous promoters were amplified from yeast genomic DNA and cloned into centromeric vectors (pRS series). All plasmids were analyzed by DNA-sequencing. Standard techniques were used for yeast transformation, mating and tetrad analysis or haploid selection. Yeast stains and plasmids are listed in the key resources table and primer in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Flow cytometry screen</title><p>The yeast non-essential knock out collection (YSC1054; Open Biosystems) was transformed in 96-well format using a standard lithium acetate/PEG-4000 yeast transformation protocol with a pRS416 plasmid encoding Mup1-pHluorin. Transformants were selected on agar plates, inoculated into 160 μl of rich medium (YNB medium lacking uracil as specified above containing 1.5x of all amino acids) and incubated for 14 hr shaking (180 rpm) at 26° in 96-well plates (#83.3924, Sarstedt, Germany). Each plate also contained the WT BY4742 parental strain and <italic>art2∆</italic> as negative and positive controls. 60 μl of the overnight cultures were transferred to 96-deep-well plates (#951033405, 96/2000 µl, white border, Eppendorf, Germany) containing 600 μl rich medium and further incubated for 5 hr. At this point, 120 μl of culture referred to as ‘exponentially growing’ were transferred to standard 96-well plates and analyzed by flow cytometry. The remaining culture was harvested by centrifugation (1807 g; 3 min), the medium was aspirated, cells were washed twice with 600 µl starvation medium and recovered by centrifugation. Subsequently, cells were resuspended in 600 μl starvation medium and incubated shaking (180 rpm) for 18–22 hr. 200 μl nitrogen-starved culture were transferred to standard 96-well plates and analyzed by flow cytometry. All pipetting steps were performed using the MEA Robotic System (PhyNexus, USA). Flow cytometry was performed in 96-well format using the Guava easyCyte 8HT-System (Sr.No. 6735128143), EMD Millipore, Merck, Germany) with the following settings: Energy GRN: 72 plus (YEL = 8; RED = 8; NIR = 8; RED2 = 8; NIR2 = 8), green channel, forward scatter FSC = 14; sideward scatter SSC = 28; 15.000–20.000 counts/sample, acquire: 40 s, 3 s mix prior to acquisition. GuavaSoft 2.7 software was used for data analysis. The positive/negative cut-off was set for each plate empirically at the intercept of the log/starvation histograms of the WT and <italic>art2∆</italic> controls (<italic>art2∆</italic>, which emerged as a well-reproducible hit early in the screen, was included as a negative control in all further plates). All potential hits were re-examined by fluorescence microscopy. To this end, at least 100 starved cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy after starvation and the percentage of cells showing a degradation-deficient phenotype (Mup1-pHluorin at the plasma membrane, in small cytosolic objects, class E-like objects or small objects within vacuoles) of the total number of cells counted was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Strains with more than 45% cells with retained fluorescence after at least 18 hr of starvation were considered as hits. For a stringent final selection, we compared those hits to the original flow cytometry screen and finally only considered those in which at least once more the 30% Mup1-pHluorin fluorescence was also retained after starvation in the flow cytometry screen. In addition, most hits were also scored for methionine-induced endocytosis of Mup1-pHluorin. Hits were considered starvation-specific if the fluorescence was quenched in more than 67% of cells after 90 min of methionine treatment (20 µg/ml).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene ontology analysis</title><p>Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 2004</xref>) was performed using 128 genes listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Lysates were incubated 30 min on ice and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min to remove debris. 80 ul of equilibrated GFP-trap beads were added to the supernatant and incubated rolling for 16 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed at 4°C 3 × 15 min with RIPA buffer supplemented with 500 mM NaCl and then 3 × 15 min with urea wash buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 4M Urea). Mup1-GFP was eluated from beads using urea sample buffer as described above. Eluates were separated via SDS-PAGE and Mup1-GFP was visualized by Coomassie staining. Slices were cut from the gel (including the visible Mup1-GFP protein bands and the region above containing ubiquitinated Mup1-GFP) and subjected for further mass spectrometry sample preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mass spectrometry sample preparation and analysis</title><p>Coomassie-stained gel bands were excised from SDS-PAGE gels, reduced with dithiothreitol, alkylated with iodoacetamide and digested with trypsin (Promega) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faserl et al., 2019</xref>). Tryptic digest were analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 RSCLnano-HPLC system coupled to a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer (both Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a Nanospray Flex ionization source. The peptides were separated on a homemade fritless fused-silica micro-capillary column (75 µm i.d. x 280 µm o.d. x 10 cm length) packed with 3.0 µm reversed-phase C18 material. Solvents for HPLC were 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in 85% acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient profile was as follows: 0–4 min, 4% B; 4–57 min, 4–35% B; 57–62 min, 35–100% B, and 62–67 min, 100% B. The flow rate was 250 nL/min.</p><p>The Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer was operating in the data dependent mode selecting the top 20 most abundant isotope patterns with charge &gt;1 from the survey scan with an isolation window of 1.6 mass-to-charge ratio (m/z). Survey full scan MS spectra were acquired from 300 to 1750 m/z at a resolution of 60,000 with a maximum injection time (IT) of 120 ms, and automatic gain control (AGC) target 1e6. The selected isotope patterns were fragmented by higher-energy collisional dissociation with normalized collision energy of 28 at a resolution of 30,000 with a maximum IT of 120 ms, and AGC target 5e5.</p><p>Data analysis was performed using Proteome Discoverer 4.1 (Thermo Scientific) with search engine Sequest. The raw files were searched against yeast database (orf_trans_all) with sequence of Mup1-GFP added. Precursor and fragment mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respectively, and up to two missed cleavages were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as static modification. Oxidation of methionine, ubiquitination of lysine, and phosphorylation of serine threonine, and tyrosine were set as variable modifications. Peptide identifications were filtered at 1% false discovery rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RNA isolation and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)</title><p>Exponentially growing or starved cells (40 OD<sub>600nm</sub>) were harvested by centrifugation and immediately frozen in lq. N<sub>2</sub>. Cell pellets were lysed with 1 mm glass beads in a FastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP biosciences) in Qiagen RLT buffer, and RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (#74104, Qiagen, Germany). Yield and purity were determined photometrically. cDNA was prepared from 5 µg DNAse I-treated RNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (#K1622, Thermo Fisher, USA) with oligo-dT primer according to the standard protocol. qPCR was performed in 10 µl scale with 4 µl of cDNA, 5 µl TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (#4369016, Thermo Fisher, USA) and 0.5 µl TaqMan probe on a PikoReal 96 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher, USA) with 7 min initial denaturation (95°C) and 40 cycles of 5 s 95°C and 30 s 60°C. TaqMan gene expression assays were from Thermo Fisher (<italic>PGK1</italic>: Sc04104844_s1; <italic>ECM21/ART2:</italic> Sc04099967_s1). All probes and primer anneal within coding sequences. Each RT-qPCR analysis was done from two to three independent biological samples in 3–4 technical replicates. Data were analyzed with the PikoReal software (version 2.2; Thermo Fisher) with manual threshold adjustment, and relative mRNA abundance was calculated in Microsoft Excel using the ∆∆C<sub>T</sub> method. Statistical comparisons were calculated using the Student t-test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Roland Wedlich-Söldner, Claudine Kraft, Pierre Morsomme and Scott Emr for reagents.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Editorial summary and revision requests:</p><p>The manuscript by Ivashov et al. explores the molecular mechanisms leading to the selective endocytosis of amino acid transporters (AATs) in the baker's yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> during starvation. It was known that AATs on the membrane need to be ubiquitinated by Rsp5 through adaptors called ARTs. While some insights into the substrate induced endocytosis (activated by enhanced substrate flux) have already emerged, it is unclear how endocytosis of AATs occurs during acute starvation. This manuscript is the first to characterize the signaling and regulatory pathway guiding endocytosis of an AAT during starvation and discovers a specific role for <italic>Art2</italic> as well as the signals on the substrate and adaptor that are both necessary and sufficient for this process. This paper is deep and mechanistic and uncovers a new regulatory cycle in a novel path of AAT starvation-dependent endocytosis and as such would be valuable to the cell biology community. Please answer the below requests prior to acceptance:</p><p>Experimental requests:</p><p>1) Is the transcriptional regulation enough to explain the differential requirement on ARTs for substrate induced vs. starvation induced endocytosis? I.e., if <italic>Art1</italic> is expressed under the <italic>ART2</italic> promoter in a <italic>∆art2</italic> during starvation – could it rescue the endocytosis of Mup1? This is not essential for publication, but would be a nice and easy experiment to do.</p><p>2) Figures 3B, 4A – how many times were they repeated? Please quantify the changes with SDs. This is true for all western blots whose claim is for a quantitative phenotype (increase or decrease in expression or in free GFP). Specifically, in Figure 4F quantification relative to the PGK control may show a similar increase in <italic>GCN4<sup>C</sup></italic>…In addition, &quot;WB analysis of total cell lysates indicated quantitative band shifts of <italic>Art1</italic>…&quot;. However, no quantification is provided. Please add quantification.</p><p>3) The authors use Mup1 (as one model substrate) and its downregulation as a criterion for adaptation to starvation. Does <italic>Art2</italic> deletion or the mutation in <italic>Art2</italic> (Figure 7B) cause any growth defect or problems with adaptation to starvation? This would be expected if downregulation via <italic>Art2</italic> is a long-term adaptation response.</p><p>4) The authors suggest that <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic> act on different patches and provide convincing data along this line. Is it possible to generate chimeric constructs of <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic> to swap their specificity? Since this may not work given that <italic>Art2</italic> has so many modification sites, this is not essential for resubmission.</p><p>Textual/Figure suggestions:</p><p>1) In the first Results section (subsection “Amino acid availability induces selective endocytosis of nutrient transporters”, first paragraph) when discussing the C' GFP tagging library of yeast please cite the manuscript that generated that library (PMID: 14562095) and not only in the Materials and methods.</p><p>2) The first part of the paper where C' GFP proteins were screened for expression is seems unrelated to the rest of the paper and not necessary for the future experiments. If the authors were interested specifically in AATs why did they not track all yeast AATs? It seems that some of them can be nicely visualized when tagged at their N' (such as Vba5, Thi72) or might need retagging and not to be taken from the library. Having only 7AATs to work with reduces the systematic nature of this study. Moreover, in the end they really only skim through the 4 well studied AATs (Mup1, Can, Lyp1 and Tat2) and really only focus on Mup1. Hence the Introduction is a bit misleading discussing not Mup1 but all AATs and making the first part of the paper quite unnecessary. Please reconsider writing the paper in a way that is more focused on Mup1 as a model and removing the above section.</p><p>3) Subsection “A genome-wide screen identifies regulators of starvation-induced endocytosis of AATs”, first paragraph: please change FACS to Flow Cytometry there and all places thereafter including Figure 2.</p><p>4) Subsection “A genome-wide screen identifies regulators of starvation-induced endocytosis of AATs”, second paragraph: typo.</p><p>5) Discussion, second paragraph: define UPS upon first use.</p><p>6) Figure 1A typo – should be methionine.</p><p>7) Figure 1B – &quot;Ammonium Transporter&quot; should be in color.</p><p>8) Figure 4B – what is n&gt;x means – please write how many times exactly was it repeated.</p><p>9) Figure 6E has a very important piece of information, in that the authors show that the C-terminal segment of Mup1 can be transplanted to Hxt3. Please add the response of the un-modified Hxt3 in the same panel (and not in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A) to have the direct comparison.</p><p>10) The FACS-based screen of Mup1 traffic presented here is really quite nice, and provides a lot of information on proteins that regulate its endocytosis and vacuolar delivery. However, the finding that <italic>Art2</italic> regulates stress-dependent endocytosis of a variety of transporters at the PM is neither surprising nor novel: Nikko and Pelham, 2009, published a key paper that positioned <italic>Art2</italic> as a regulator of stress-dependent internalization of a wide variety of cargos. The stressor in was cycloheximide rather than starvation, suggesting a more general regulation of substrate-independent endocytosis. The Nikko and Pelham paper needs to be cited more prominently through this study. Its findings may not have the level of mechanistic detail presented here, but they do strongly parallel a number of key points.</p><p>11) The authors state that &quot;low levels of methionine in the growth medium did not efficiently trigger its endocytosis.&quot; Supplementary Figure 1B complicates this interpretation, as there is clearly less Mup1 overall in 0.02 ug/ml Met compared to the no Met control. This decrease suggests that the protein indeed is being internalized, albeit at a slower rate. Flux from PM to vacuole could be slow enough that GFP fluorescence does not accumulate in the vacuole. Such a phenomenon was observed for Ptr2-GFP in Apel et al. (Mol Biol Cell 28: 2434-48). Please discuss this further in the manuscript.</p><p>12) Subsection “A genome-wide screen identifies regulators of starvation-induced endocytosis of AATs”, second paragraph: identify <italic>pep4∆</italic> as the sole &quot;class 4&quot; mutant, where Mup1-pHluorin accumulates in the vacuole, but remains fluorescent. This is unexpected, since Prosser et al., 2010, showed that Ste3-pHluorin is efficiently transported to the vacuole in <italic>pep4∆prb1∆ prc1∆</italic> cells, where fluorescence is still fully quenched. How might this discrepancy be explained?</p><p>13) The first paragraph of the subsection “Up-regulation of <italic>Art2</italic> by the GAAC pathway drives starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1” suggests that the observed bandshift is due to Npr1-dependent phosphorylation. This is an over-interpretation, since no direct evidence of Npr1 involvement is shown. Moreover, since <italic>Art1</italic> is both phosphorylated and ubiquitinated, the band shift may not be due to phosphorylation at all. This should be more carefully interpreted, or more thoroughly investigated.</p><p>14) The first paragraph of the subsection “Up-regulation of <italic>Art2</italic> by the GAAC pathway drives starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1” states that levels of <italic>Art2</italic>-HTF were &quot;comparably&quot; low under rich conditions. What is this compared to? The blot in Figure 4A shows an increase in <italic>Art2</italic> levels upon starvation, but levels of <italic>Art1</italic> appear to decrease. Please clarify.</p><p>15) Subsection “<italic>Art2</italic> directs Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of C-terminal lysine residues in Mup1”, second paragraph: regarding the arrestin fold-localized PY motif, the authors state that it is required for starvation-induced endocytosis. This is an overstatement, since Figure 5E clearly shows Mup1 internalization when this PY motif is mutated, even though the amount of protein internalized is reduced. Please rephrase.</p><p>16) The first paragraph of the subsection “Up-regulation of <italic>Art2</italic> by the GAAC pathway drives starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1” states that <italic>Art1/2</italic> regulate AAT endocytosis in a mutually exclusive manner, but this is not true for Tat2 based on Nikko and Pelham, 2008, where either is sufficient for Trp-induced internalization. Please discuss this.</p><p>17) Subsection “The C-terminal acidic sorting signal of Mup1 is sufficient for <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent starvation-induced endocytosis”, end of first paragraph: the callout for Supplementary Figure 6B should be for Figure 6—figure supplement 2D.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Experimental requests:</p><p>1) Is the transcriptional regulation enough to explain the differential requirement on ARTs for substrate induced vs. starvation induced endocytosis?

We have replaced the <italic>ART1</italic> promoter region with the <italic>ART2</italic> promoter region. The <italic>ART2</italic> promoter region also induced the expression of <italic>Art1</italic> during starvation (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Yet, the upregulation of <italic>Art1</italic> protein levels driven by the <italic>ART2</italic> promoter failed to restore starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1-GFP in <italic>art2∆</italic> cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), whereas the same construct was sufficient for substrate-induced endocytosis of Mup1-GFP in <italic>art1∆</italic> cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B).</p><p>These results are in agreement with our model of the switch from <italic>Art1</italic>-dependent to <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent amino acid transporter endocytosis during starvation. The results further show that the simple upregulation of <italic>Art1</italic> with the <italic>ART2</italic> promoter is not sufficient to initiate Mup1 endocytosis in response to starvation. Rather, the combination of <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic> protein levels, the specific properties of <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic> (e.g. their post-translational regulation, basic patches, etc…) as well as the exposure of the N- and C-terminal acidic patches on Mup1 define the substrate selectivity of endocytosis in response to nutrient availability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figures 3B, 4A – how many times were they repeated?

The results of the WB quantifications (including SD) confirm our original results. For the quantification, all blots have been repeated at least 3 times.</p><p>We agree with reviewers that the WB in Figure 4F was not ideally loaded to allow quantification. Therefore, we have repeated the experiment. The new result (Figure 4F), quantified in Figure 4—figure supplement 1G, confirms that constitutive Gcn4 translation (in <italic>GCN4<sup>C</sup> </italic>mutants) upregulates <italic>Art2</italic> already under rich growth conditions and that there is no further upregulation of <italic>Art2</italic> in <italic>GCN4<sup>C</sup></italic> mutants during starvation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors use Mup1 (as one model substrate) and its downregulation as a criterion for adaptation to starvation.

This would be expected if downregulation via Art2 is a long-term adaptation response.</p></disp-quote><p>Unicellular organisms must efficiently and robustly adjust cell growth and survival to nutrient availability. We have shown earlier that starvation-induced endocytosis and the selective lysosomal membrane protein degradation through the MVB pathway co-operates with autophagy to ensure cell survival during starvation (Müller et al., 2015).</p><p>In our current paper, we have built on this observation and have identified how selectivity of endocytosis is achieved to degrade a defined subset of plasma membrane (PM) proteins during starvation. The genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> encodes 14 different ART proteins that collectively function in the selective degradation of membrane proteins in response to different growth and stress conditions. We demonstrate that <italic>Art2</italic> is required to selectively target 5 different substrates (four amino acid transporters and Ina1) for starvation-induced endocytosis and degradation, out of at least 15 different membrane proteins. Other membrane proteins most likely will depend on other ARTs and will still be degraded in <italic>art2∆</italic> mutants, e.g. we demonstrate that starvation-induced endocytosis of Hxt3 requires Art4.</p><p>Hence, strong effects on starvation survival (similar to ESCRT mutants that block the lysosomal degradation of all membrane proteins – see Müller et al., 2015) could be expected by simultaneous deletion of multiple ART proteins or of the ubiquitin ligase Rsp5. However, <italic>RSP5</italic> is an essential gene, and mutants in which multiple <italic>ART</italic> genes are deleted display severe growth defects with loss of plasma membrane integrity due to proteotoxic stress (Nikko and Pelham, 2009; Zhao et al., 2013). The contribution of individual α-arrestins to survival might be relatively minor.</p><p>With this in mind, we have very carefully examined the growth and survival properties of <italic>art2∆</italic> mutants and compared them to isogenic WT cells, as well as to autophagy mutants (<italic>atg8∆</italic>) and <italic>atg8∆ art2∆</italic> double mutants. Indeed, the effects of <italic>art2∆</italic> mutants on cell growth are moderate. Under rich growth conditions and in logarithmic growth phase, <italic>Art2</italic> mutants grew slightly faster when compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>), whereas the cell diameter was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Physiological effects of <italic>ART2</italic> deletion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth of isogenic WT (<italic>art2Δ</italic> + <italic>pART2)</italic> and <italic>art2Δ</italic> cells in synthetic auxotrophy medium (YNB) at 26°C.

We believe that these complex physiological experiments would go beyond the scope of the current study, which focuses on the mechanism for selective starvation-induced endocytosis. Therefore, at the moment we think it would be premature to include these new experiments in the paper.</p><p>Consistent with the results presented here, another recent study (Wloch-Salamon DM et al., G3 (Genes, Genomes, Genetics), 2017, PMID: 28450371) found that over many repeated growth-starvation cycles (equivalent to 300 generations) mutations in <italic>Art2</italic> (Ecm21) and Rsp5 affected survival in limiting nutrients. These findings also point to a physiological function of <italic>Art2</italic> during starvation. However, it is not clear how these physiological defects are linked to the role of <italic>Art2</italic> in starvation induced endocytosis and we now discuss this and cite the study by Wloch-Salamon et al., 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors suggest that Art1 and Art2 act on different patches and provide convincing data along this line. Is it possible to generate chimeric constructs of Art1 and Art2 to swap their specificity?

In <italic>Art2</italic>, a clear signature for an arrestin-N domain cannot be detected and the arrestin-C domain is extended to more than twice the length of the arrestin-C pfam model (Baile et al., 2019). In addition, these disordered loops are in the different positions in the arrestin N- and C- domains of <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic>, respectively, and therefore render precise domain swap experiments almost impossible without additional structural information.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Schematic depicting the primary structure of <italic>Art1</italic> and <italic>Art2</italic> with predicted arrestin-N (orange) and arrestin-C (yellow) domains and the position of interspersed, disordered loops (dark grey), basic patches (blue) and PY motifs (red) drawn according to Baile et al., 2019).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58246-resp-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Textual/Figure suggestions:</p><p>1) In the first Results section (subsection “Amino acid availability induces selective endocytosis of nutrient transporters”, first paragraph) when discussing the C' GFP tagging library of yeast please cite the manuscript that generated that library (PMID: 14562095) and not only in the Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out.

If the authors were interested specifically in AATs why did they not track all yeast AATs? It seems that some of them can be nicely visualized when tagged at their N' (such as Vba5, Thi72) or might need retagging and not to be taken from the library. Having only 7AATs to work with reduces the systematic nature of this study. Moreover, in the end they really only skim through the 4 well studied AATs (Mup1, Can, Lyp1 and Tat2) and really only focus on Mup1. Hence the Introduction is a bit misleading discussing not Mup1 but all AATs and making the first part of the paper quite unnecessary. Please reconsider writing the paper in a way that is more focused on Mup1 as a model and removing the above section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the analysis presented in Figure 1 is neither systematic nor comprehensive and we have toned down the results and adapted the text of Figure 1 accordingly.</p><p>Yet, we think that the results of Figure 1 are important (i) because they demonstrate in an unprecedented way the scale and the selectivity of starvation-induced endocytosis towards certain cargoes and (ii) they are important to delineate the specificity of <italic>Art2</italic> for a subset of cargoes including Ina1 (new result Figure 3—figure supplement 1C), and four different amino acid transporters (AAT), but not for all membrane proteins that undergo starvation-induced endocytosis (e.g. the glucose transporters) (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Therefore, we prefer to keep the data of Figure 1 in the paper.</p><p>We have now also identified a further membrane protein (Ina1), which undergoes <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent starvation-induced endocytosis (Supplementary file 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Ina1 is a protein of unknown function with three predicted transmembrane domains and a cytoplasmic C-terminus and not related to AATs, suggesting that the action of <italic>Art2</italic> during starvation is not limited to AATs. The Ina1 sequence also features a putative acidic patch (included in Figure 6D) in its C-terminus, and its starvation-induced endocytosis is impaired in the basic patch mutant <italic>Art2</italic> K664D,R665D,R666D,K667D (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>In Figure 1, we have screened a library containing 149 putative PM proteins that were C-terminally GFP-tagged at their native chromosomal locus. According to a recent and comprehensive review by Bert Poolman and colleagues (Bianchi et al., 2019), the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> S288C genome encodes 21 AATs that have been reported to localize to the plasma membrane (we have corrected the number accordingly in the Introduction). Our library contained 16 of these 21 AATs, and thus covers 76% of all AATs that are reported to localize to the PM and lacks five (Agp3, Alp1, Hip1, Put4, and Vba5) (see modified Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Of the 16 AATs represented in our library, we detect under rich growth conditions (YNB medium, genetic background BY4741) eight different AATs (Mup1, Can1, Tat2, Lyp1, Dip5, Gnp1, Bap2 and Tat1; see modified Supplementary file 1) at the PM. In the original version of the manuscript we have miscounted seven AATs. We apologize for this mistake and have corrected the numbers accordingly. A ninth AAT, Gap1-GFP, was upregulated during starvation. We did not detect GFP signals for Agp1, Agp2, Yct1, Bap3, Mup3 or Mmp1 in our rich and starvation media. The signal for Sam3-GFP was detected but mislocalized to the ER.</p><p>Perhaps it should not come as a surprise that we do not detect all AATs under rich growth conditions. This is exemplified by Gap1 which is only expressed during starvation, or by Put4, which is repressed by ammonium as nitrogen source (Jauniaux, et al.,1987, Eur. J. Biochem.). Earlier studies addressed systematically the localization of N- and C-terminally GFP-tagged proteins expressed from their native promoters to generate the localization and quantitation atlas of the yeast proteome (in the Loqate database) (Breker et al., 2013, J. Cell Biol.; Breker et al., 2013, NAR). Even these studies could not report the localization of all putative AATs at the PM. Agp1, Agp2, Agp3, Alp1, Bap3, Mmp1, Put4, Sam3, Mup3, Ydt1, Vba5 (i.e. 11 AATs out of 21) were either not detected or were localized to punctate structures or the nuclear ER.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge N- or C-terminally tagged versions of Vba5 were over-expressed to detect PM localization (Shimazu et al., 2012, Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem.). The thiamine (vitamin B1) transporters Thi7, Nrt1 (Thi71) and Thi72 have been proposed to be <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent cargoes during substrate excess (Savocco et al., 2019). In this publication, Nrt1 and Thi72 were only detected at the PM when they were expressed under the <italic>THI7</italic> promoter, and remained functional for thiamine transport upon N- or C-terminal tagging.</p><p>Therefore, we tested the role of <italic>Art2</italic> in Thi7-eGFP, Nrt1-eGFP and Thi72-eGFP endocytosis during starvation. In agreement with our initial screen, Thi7-eGFP was not detected at the PM in the majority of cells, presumably because its expression is repressed by thiamine included in our growth medium (Hohmann and Meacock, 1998, BBA).</p><p>Nrt1-eGFP and Thi72-eGFP (both expressed from the <italic>THI7</italic> promoter) localized to the plasma membrane (and vacuole) in growing cells. Both proteins underwent efficient, <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent starvation-induced endocytosis, suggesting that the extent of <italic>Art2</italic>-dependent membrane protein turnover during starvation may also vary with the growth conditions.

However, the finding that Art2 regulates stress-dependent endocytosis of a variety of transporters at the PM is neither surprising nor novel: Nikko and Pelham, 2009, published a key paper that positioned Art2 as a regulator of stress-dependent internalization of a wide variety of cargos. The stressor in was cycloheximide rather than starvation, suggesting a more general regulation of substrate-independent endocytosis. The Nikko and Pelham paper needs to be cited more prominently through this study. Its findings may not have the level of mechanistic detail presented here, but they do strongly parallel a number of key points.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, for finding the results of our screen interesting. We hope that it will represent a new and valuable resource to study how cells changes during nutrient limitation.</p><p>We also agree that the Nikko and Pelham, 2009 paper, was important and we are now citing the paper prominently on six different occasions throughout the paper. Yet, we are equally convinced that our findings on the non-redundant role and the regulation of <italic>Art2</italic> for starvation-induced endocytosis of Mup1, Can1, Lyp1 and Tat2 could not have been predicted based on the Nikko and Pelham paper. This is based on the following arguments:</p><p>1) It is difficult (if not impossible) to compare on a mechanistic and physiological level cellular stress that is induced by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment to amino acid starvation. CHX is a translation inhibitor and therefore indirectly boosts the levels of intracellular amino acids (Beugnet, A., Biochem. J. 2003, Urban J., Mol. Cell 2007). This results in TORC1 hyperactivation (Binda M., et al. Mol. Cell 2009) and in acute growth arrest. In contrast amino acid starvation results in a depletion of free intracellular amino acid pools and in TORC1 inactivation. However, cells starving for amino acid still complete their cell cycle and slowly and ‘orderly’ enter in a G1/G0 cell cycle arrest to survive for several weeks.</p><p>2) In the Nikko paper <italic>Art2</italic> typically has a redundant function with other α-arrestins. Expression of <italic>Art1</italic>, <italic>Art2</italic>, <italic>Art8</italic> and Bsd2 in the 9-arrestin deletion strain partially restored CHX-induced endocytosis of the uracil transporter Fur4 (Figure 4B; Nikko and Pelham, 2009). Expression of <italic>Art2</italic>, <italic>Art8</italic> and Bsd2 partially restored CHX-induced endocytosis of Tat2 in the 9-arrestin deletion strain (Figure 6C Nikko and Pelham, 2009).</p><p>3) The Nikko paper did not address the role of <italic>Art2</italic> for Mup1, Lyp1 and Can1 endocytosis, which is the main focus of our work. In our hands, endocytosis of these AATs in response to CHX treatment was not (Mup1, Can1) or only partially (Lyp1) dependent on <italic>Art2</italic>. Endocytosis of Mup1 in response to CHX was limited (after 6 h + CHX, a large pool of Mup1-GFP still localized to the PM with a fraction detected inside the vacuole) and this was dependent on the presence of <italic>Art1</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4</xref>). Based on these results, it seems that <italic>Art2</italic> has a minor (and potentially redundant) role for the CHX-induced endocytosis of Mup1, Can1 and Lyp1. This is in stark contrast to our results which show a rather stringent <italic>Art1</italic> / <italic>Art2</italic> – switch for AAT endocytosis in response to amino acid excess (<italic>Art1</italic>) or amino acid starvation (<italic>Art2</italic>).</p><p>We prefer not to include these results using CHX as a stressor, since they do not add significant new information on the regulation of nutrient transporter endocytosis in response to nutrient availability.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Life cell fluorescence microscopy of WT, <italic>art2Δ</italic> or <italic>art1Δ</italic> cells chromosomally expressing Mup1-GFP (A), Can1-GFP (B) or Lyp1-GFP (C) during exponential growth and 6 hour after treatment with 50 μg/ml cycloheximide (+CHX) or vehicle (water; -CHX).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58246-resp-fig4-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) The authors state that &quot;low levels of methionine in the growth medium did not efficiently trigger its endocytosis.&quot; Supplementary Figure 1B complicates this interpretation, as there is clearly less Mup1 overall in 0.02 ug/ml Met compared to the no Met control. This decrease suggests that the protein indeed is being internalized, albeit at a slower rate. Flux from PM to vacuole could be slow enough that GFP fluorescence does not accumulate in the vacuole. Such a phenomenon was observed for Ptr2-GFP in Apel et al. (Mol Biol Cell 28: 2434-48). Please discuss this further in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In our original microscopy picture the overall Mup1-GFP fluorescence appeared rather low, with the Mup1-GFP signal mainly detected at the PM. This may have caused the impression that Mup1-GFP may be slowly turned over.</p><p>Therefore, we have carefully re-analyzed the data and performed new experiments. We found that in medium containing 0.02 µg/ml methionine Mup1 endocytosis was not yet triggered, at least on a detectable level. The protein levels of Mup1-GFP were analyzed by Western blot analysis from cells grown in medium without methionine or with different methionine concentrations. Without methionine or with low levels of methionine (0.02 µg/ml) the protein levels of full length Mup1-GFP were similar (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B), whereas only clipped GFP was detected in response 2 µg/ml methionine or starvation (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Our original microscopy picture did not very well represent the data. The overall Mup1-GFP appeared to be low, but localized almost exclusively to the PM. Hence it is likely that its fluorescence intensity of was not well adjusted. We apologize for the mistake and we have exchanged the image in Supplementary Figure 1B (now called Figure 1—figure supplement 2A) for a representative image that also reflects the results of the new western-blot analysis (new Figure 1—figure supplement 2B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Subsection “A genome-wide screen identifies regulators of starvation-induced endocytosis of AATs”, second paragraph: identify pep4∆ as the sole &quot;class 4&quot; mutant, where Mup1-pHluorin accumulates in the vacuole, but remains fluorescent. This is unexpected, since Prosser et al., 2010, showed that Ste3-pHluorin is efficiently transported to the vacuole in pep4∆ prb1∆ prc1∆ cells, where fluorescence is still fully quenched. How might this discrepancy be explained?</p></disp-quote><p>The fluorescence of Mup1-pHlorin is partially quenched inside the vacuoles of <italic>pep4∆</italic> single or <italic>pep4∆ prb1∆ prc1∆</italic> triple mutants in response to starvation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig5">Author response image 5</xref>, this is not a major focus of our work).</p><p>One simple explanation for the difference of Mup1 to Ste3 might be the difference in their abundance. Mup1 is among the most highly expressed PM proteins in medium lacking methionine (Busto et al., 2018, PNAS, Figure 1), and it is probably vastly more abundant compared to Ste3. Hence, ‘unquenched’ Mup1-pHluorin fluorescence could be easily detected. Moreover, during starvation vacuolar enzymes are additionally engaged in the degradation of autophagic cargoes. Therefore, the breakdown of intraluminal vesicles that are delivered via the MVB pathway may become more challenging in <italic>pep4∆</italic> mutants during starvation. Similarly, we also observed earlier that the autophagy protein pHluorin-<italic>Atg8</italic> was not efficiently quenched inside the vacuole in the majority of <italic>pep4∆ prb1∆ prc1∆</italic> cells during nitrogen starvation (Müller et al., 2015, Figure 3E, F).</p><fig id="respfig5"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Impaired pHluorin quenching in <italic>pep4Δ</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometry analysis of BY4742 WT (green histogram), <italic>art2Δ</italic> (yellow) and <italic>pep4Δ</italic> cells (red) after 20h of amino acid and nitrogen starvation.
