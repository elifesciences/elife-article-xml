influenza vaccines. Despite these updates, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against H3N2-associated disease is suboptimal. Seasonal influenza vaccines primarily induce hemagglutinin-specific antibody responses. However, antibodies directed against influenza neuraminidase (NA) also contribute to protection. Here, we analysed the antigenic diversity of a panel of N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. The antigenic breadth of these NAs was determined based on the NA inhibition (NAI) of a broad panel of ferret and mouse immune sera that were raised by infection and recombinant N2 NA immunisation. This assessment allowed us to distinguish at least four antigenic groups in the N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 viruses that circulated between 2009 and 2017. Computational analysis further revealed that the amino acid residues in N2 NA that have a major impact on susceptibility to NAI by immune sera are in proximity of the catalytic site. Finally, a machine learning method was developed that allowed to accurately predict the impact of mutations that are present in our N2 NA panel on NAI. These findings have important implications for the renewed interest to develop improved influenza vaccines based on the inclusion of a protective NA antigen formulation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Two proteins, the hemagglutinin and the neuraminidase, protrude from the surface of the influenza virus. Their detection by the immune system allows the host organism to mount defences against the viral threat. The virus evolves in response to this pressure, which manifests as changes in the appearance of its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. This process, known as antigenic drift, leads to the proteins evading detection. It is also why flu vaccines require frequent updates, as they rely on ‚Äòtraining‚Äô the immune system to recognise the most important strains in circulation ‚Äì primarily by exposing it to appropriate versions of hemagglutinin. While the antigenic drift of hemagglutinin has been extensively studied, much less is known about how the neuraminidase accumulates mutations, and how these affect the immune response.</p><p>To investigate this question, Catani et al. selected 43 genetically distant neuraminidases from human viral samples isolated between 2009 and 2017. Statistical analyses were applied to define their relatedness, revealing that a group of closely related neuraminidases predominated from 2009 to 2015, before they were being taken over by a second group. A third group, which was identified in viruses isolated in 2013, was remarkably close to the neuraminidase of strains that circulated in the late 1990s. The fourth and final group of neuraminidases was derived from influenza viruses that normally circulate in pigs but can also occasionally infect humans.</p><p>Next, Catani et al. examined the immune response that these 43 neuraminidases could elicit in mice, as well as in ferrets ‚Äì the animal most traditionally used in influenza research. This allowed them to pinpoint which changes in the neuraminidase sequences were important to escape recognition by the host. Data obtained from the two model species were comparable, suggesting that these experiments could be conducted on mice going forward, which are easier to work with than ferrets. Finally, Catani et al. used machine learning to build a computational model that could predict how strongly the immune system would respond to a specific neuraminidase variant.</p><p>These findings could help guide the development of new vaccines that include neuraminidases tailored to best prime and train the immune system against a larger variety of strains. This may aid the development of ‚Äòsupra-seasonal‚Äô vaccines that protect against a broad range of influenza viruses, reducing the need for yearly updates.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>neuraminidase</kwd><kwd>H3N2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019944</institution-id><institution>Sanofi</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cortes-Garcia</surname><given-names>Guadalupe</given-names></name><name><surname>Strugnell</surname><given-names>Tod</given-names></name><name><surname>Gomila</surname><given-names>Raul</given-names></name><name><surname>Hamberger</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Catalan</surname><given-names>John</given-names></name><name><surname>Ustyugova</surname><given-names>Irina V</given-names></name><name><surname>Farrell</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><name><surname>Stegalkina</surname><given-names>Svetlana</given-names></name><name><surname>Ray</surname><given-names>Satyajit</given-names></name><name><surname>LaRue</surname><given-names>Lauren</given-names></name><name><surname>Saelens</surname><given-names>Xavier</given-names></name><name><surname>Vogel</surname><given-names>Thorsten U</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Catani</surname><given-names>Jo√£o Paulo Portela</given-names></name><name><surname>Smet</surname><given-names>Anouk</given-names></name><name><surname>Ysenbaert</surname><given-names>Tine</given-names></name><name><surname>Vuylsteke</surname><given-names>Marnik</given-names></name><name><surname>Bottu</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathys</surname><given-names>Janick</given-names></name><name><surname>Botzki</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>N2 neuraminidases from human H3N2 viruses from 2009 until 2017 can be subdivided into four antigenic groups, with amino acid substitutions near the catalytic site more likely impacting neuraminidase inhibition.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin (HA) constitute the two major antigenic proteins at the surface of influenza A and B virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Uyeki et al., 2022</xref>). While HA mediates binding to sialic acids and membrane fusion, NA catalyses the removal of sialic acid residues from sialylated glycoproteins and glycolipids. This complementary role of HA and NA enables influenza virions to penetrate the mucus barrier that lines the respiratory epithelium and newly formed virions to be released from the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Vries et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Matrosovich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palese et al., 1974</xref>). Immunity against influenza is associated with the presence of anti-HA antibodies in serum, as determined by a hemagglutination inhibition assay. In line with this, the composition of licensed influenza vaccines is primarily focused on the antigenic characteristics of HA as the protective vaccine antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox, 2013</xref>). Multiple studies, however, have underscored the protective potential of anti-NA immune responses as determined by NA inhibition (NAI) assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maier et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Memoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monto and Kendal, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Monto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Weiss et al., 2020</xref>). There is also evidence that pre-existing anti-N2 immunity induced by prior exposure to H2N2 viruses that circulated in the population from 1957 to 1968 tempered the impact of the H3N2 pandemic virus that emerged in 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eickhoff and Meiklejohn, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jester et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Monto and Kendal, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Viboud et al., 2005</xref>). Further, the pharmacological inhibition of NA activity is a well-established therapeutic strategy to try to reduce influenza severity and duration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leneva et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yen et al., 2005</xref>). In addition, antibodies with NAI activity can protect against influenza virus infection in pre-clinical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deroo et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wohlbold et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Since its appearance in 1968, human H3N2 viruses have been evolving faster than the co-circulating H1N1 and influenza B viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Potter et al., 2019</xref>). The overall influenza virus vaccine effectiveness varies between seasons and, despite frequent updates of the H3N2 HA component, the effectiveness of influenza vaccines against H3N2-associated disease ranges between 5% and 39%, which is lower than the effectiveness against H1N1 and influenza B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Belongia et al., 2016</xref>). In this context the use of NA as a complementary vaccine antigen might improve influenza vaccine effectiveness, e.g., by compensating for HA-based antigenic mismatches in circulating influenza virus strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Krammer et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Phylogenetic analyses of HA and NA genes of human H3N2 viruses revealed the asynchronous evolution of the two proteins. In addition, the evolutionary rate as determined by the accumulation of mutations over time is estimated to be 1.5 times lower for NA than for HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Westgeest et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the strong evidence that immune responses directed against NA can contribute to protection against influenza, a comprehensive insight in the antigenic breadth and evolution of the H3N2 NA antigen is lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nachbagauer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rajendran et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Westgeest et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here, we determined the antigenic landscape of N2 NAs derived from human H3N2 strains that were isolated between 2009 and 2017.

We first selected 43 H3N2 NA protein sequences obtained via GISAID, derived from viruses that were isolated between 2009 and 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017</xref>). Hierarchical clustering with minimax linkage was employed to ensure the set was representative of overall protein sequence diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bien and Tibshirani, 2011</xref>). Next, 43 recombinant H1N2 viruses were generated that carried the internal and HA genes from PR8 virus and the NA genes of the selected H3N2 viruses. In addition, the corresponding tetrabrachion-stabilised recombinant N2 NA proteins were produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and purified, and are referred to as NACHOs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catani et al., 2022</xref>). All purified NACHOs were tetrameric based on SEC-MALS analysis. The enzymatic activity of the NACHOs was determined based on the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic small molecule substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA). The NACHOs were active with a specific activity ranging from 0.27 to 27.48 nmole/min/¬µg, indicating correct folding and assembly of the NA head domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Immune sera against all 43 H3N2-derived NAs were generated in pairs of ferrets by a primary infection with the respective H1N2 reassortant viruses. This prime by infection was used to avoid the use of an adjuvant upon subsequent boost with the corresponding NACHOs. On day 28 after primary infection, all animals were boosted by intramuscular injection of homologous NACHO, except for the ferrets that had been primed by infection with A/Stockholm/15/2014 and A/Estonia/91621/2015, which were re-inoculated with the same respective H1N2 reassortant viruses. These two pairs of ferrets were not boosted with homologous NACHO because the corresponding NACHOs were not available at the time of the experiment.

The ELLA-based IC<sub>50</sub> NAI titers were normalised by the homologous ELISA titers and then plotted relative to the maximum NAI titer obtained against the respective H6N2 target viruses. The heatmap thus represents, for each H6N2 virus, the normalised ELLA IC<sub>50</sub> titer expressed as log<sub>2</sub> of the fold-difference relative to the serum with the highest IC<sub>50</sub> value against that H6N2 virus (dark red squares indicate high and blue squares low IC<sub>50</sub> values) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, these normalised NAI values were clustered against each of the H6N2s using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA), which is a distance-based method. This clustering allowed to discern at least four major antigenic clusters (AC1 to ‚Äì4) that are depicted at the top of the heatmap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is interesting to note that the H6N2 viruses with NA antigens derived from A/Wisconsin/16/15 and A/Alaska/251/15 do not segregate into AC2, as would be predicted based on the phylogenetic relatedness, but cluster in AC1 based on the UPGMA.

These H6N2 viruses were selected based on their antigenic relatedness as deduced from the ferret immune sera analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) with two representatives from group 1 (Tex12 and Per09) and one each from group 2 (Kan17), group 3 (Hel823), and group 4 (Ind11). The normalised data confirmed the antigenic clustering observed in sera after boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>The NAI titers were also determined in the sera obtained from the 43 groups of NACHO-immunised mice against 7 of the H6N2 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 6a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2‚Äîsource data 2</xref>).

Serum NAI IC<sub>50</sub> values against a given H6N2 virus were normalised against the IC<sub>50</sub> of the mouse serum that had the highest NAI titers against the tested H6N2 virus. UPGMA-based clustering showed that the mouse NACHO immune sera displayed a similar recognition pattern as the ferret immune sera that had been generated by H1N2 priming followed by a NACHO boost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For example, HK14 H6N2 NA activity is strongly inhibited by sera from group 1, is poorly inhibited by most of the sera from group 2, and is hardly inhibited by group 3 and 4 sera from both ferrets and mice. Ind11 H6N2 NA activity, on the other hand, was inhibited by group 1 and 4, and hardly by group 2 and 3 immune sera. Overall, the normalised NAI IC<sub>50</sub> values of the ferret and mouse immune sera correlated very well with coefficients values ranging from 0.33 to 0.78 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 6b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Association analysis reveals amino acid residue substitutions that strongly impact NAI</title><p>NA of human influenza viruses is subject to antigenic drift, predominantly driven by the NAI activity that is detectable in the host serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Air et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yasuhara et al., 2019</xref>).

Then, using the antigenic distances and a random forest (RF) method, a model was built based on amino acid sequence information. A similar model has been used by Yao et al. to predict the antigenicity of H3 HA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yao et al., 2017</xref>). Here, the optimised model was built using a combination of 25 randomly sampled features in 1500 decision trees. The resulting model generates predictive antigenic distances that strongly correlate with the observed values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), with a root-mean-square error (RMSE)/mean = 0.207. The RF also enables scoring of amino acid residues according to their importance in the decision trees. One measure of importance can be defined as how early a change in a position is placed in the generated decision trees (mean minimal depth). Another measure of importance is how much the standard error mean increases when a variable is permuted. Finally, the prevalence of a variable amino acid in nodes of the decision tree can also indicate its importance. Those importance scores were represented in a multi-way plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The importance scores highlighted similar positions as previously determined in the association study. Finally, we used NA sequences of recent seasonal influenza vaccine recommended H3N2 strains to predict their antigenic distance relative to our panel of N2s, including three recent N2 NA components (from A/HongKong/45/2019, A/Tasmania/503/2020, and A/Darwin/6/2021) that were not present in our dataset. The predicted antigenic distances were plotted in the heatmap in a red-to-blue scale, indicating high to low antigenic distance, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). The RF clearly reproduced the drift observed in AC2 versus AC1. The modelling also indicates that the antigenic distance of the three recent N2s to their corresponding group 2 NAs is increasing (represented by the dark blue turning light blue, from the A/Singapore/infimh-16-0019/2016 towards the A/Darwin/6/2021 in G2) whereas their distance to group 4 NAs is decreasing (dark red becoming yellow from the A/Singapore/infimh-16-0019/2016 towards the A/Darwin/6/2021 in G4).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Prediction of N2 antigenicity based on machine learning.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Predicted <italic>vs</italic> observed normalised neuraminidase inhibitions (NAIs) are shown.

Group 1 contains 22 N2 NAs, 4 of which were derived from vaccine recommended H3N2 strains: A/Perth/16/2009, A/Texas/50/2012, A/Switzerland/9715293/2013, and A/Hong Kong/4801/2014. Phylogenetic group 2 comprises 14 N2 NAs, 1 of which is derived from a vaccine H3N2 recommended strain: A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016. The third phylogenetic group contains two NAs that are derived from H3N2 strains that had been isolated in Helsinki in 2013. Remarkably, the NA sequence of these two strains is closely related to that of H3N2s that circulated more than 15 years earlier (e.g. 99% identity with NA of A/Sydney/5/1997). The fourth phylogenetic group is composed of NAs derived from zoonotic cases with swine H3N2 strains isolated between 2012 and 2017. Swine-to-human transmission of H3N2 viruses have occurred multiple times in the USA in 2012 and continue to be detected at low frequency until to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">CDC, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbe and Buckland-Merrett, 2017</xref>).</p><p>We assessed the antigenic diversity of the NA panel by generating 27 recombinant H6N2 viruses and 43 ferret NA immune sera produced by H1N2 priming followed by boosting with homologous recombinant NA (NACHO; <italic>n</italic>=41) or by reinfection with H1N2 (A/Estonia/91621/2015 and A/Stockholm/15/2014). Most of the ferrets had detectable serum anti-N2 antibodies by day 14 after infection with H1N2. Anti-NA antibody titers increased after a boost with non-adjuvanted homologous recombinant CHO-produced soluble tetrameric NA suggesting that the use of recombinant NA may boost naturally acquired anti-NA antibody responses in the human population.</p><p>The NAI activity of the ferret sera against 27 tested H6N2s reassortants revealed a pattern of inhibition that largely coincides with the phylogenetic distances based on the NA head domain sequences. In the tested panel of H6N2s, at least four major antigenic groups were identified. We noted that H6N2 with Kan17 NA had a broader profile of inhibition than other H6N2 viruses from group 2, being also inhibited by serum raised against NA from phylogenetic groups 3 and, to a lesser extent, group 4. Additionally, the H6N2s Wis15 and Ala15 have an antigenic behaviour that is more closely related to antigenic cluster 1, despite belonging to group 2 according to their phylogenetic similarities. Based on the NAI panel, an association analysis was performed to try to identify amino acid changes that affect NAI. It is interesting to note that the amino acid substitutions S245N and S247T, combined with substitution P468H, were identified in this association analysis. Those substitutions were described as major contributors of the NA antigenic drift that occurred in H3N2 in 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). NAs from A/Wisconsin/16/2015 and A/Alaska/251/2015 also have the S245N and S247T substitutions and phylogenetically belong to group 2 NAs. However, those 2 NAs lack the P468H mutation and are antigenically closer to group 1 NAs, confirming the requirement of P468H combined with the S245N and S247T substitutions for this NA antigenic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). This observation suggests that NA antigenic drift may sometimes require a combination of amino acid changes rather than single mutations. Wang and colleagues have very elegantly demonstrated that N2 antigenic evolution is constrained by charge balances in an antigenic region, which can partially explain the observation that NA amino acids can undergo co-evolution to result in antigenic drift (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, NAs originated from H3N2 variants classified in phylogenetic group 4 were antigenically closer to N2s belonging to phylogenetic group 1. This suggest that the antigenic drift of recent NAs from group 2 increases the antigenic distance from the N2s of swine origin.</p><p>Noteworthy, the analysis of the sera obtained from ferrets after infection shows that, despite the lower homologous anti-NA titers, the inhibition pattern evaluated against five distinct H6N2s (composed of at least one representative of each antigenic group) is in accordance with the response obtained after boosting with recombinant protein. This suggests that a boost with homologous recombinant soluble tetrameric NA does not alter the breadth of the antibody response induced by H1N2 infection only. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude a degree of increased cross-reactivity of the sera from NACHO-boosted ferret. It has been reported that repeated H3N2 virus exposure of ferrets affects anti-HA responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kosikova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>NAI was also determined against 7 distinct H6N2 reassortant viruses using a panel of 43 anti-N2 NA sera raised in mice by immunisation with adjuvanted NACHOs. The observed NAI responses again allowed clustering of the N2 NAs into four main antigenic groups, which correlates with data obtained in ferrets. Studies in mice can thus offer a convenient alternative to the use of ferrets in future NA antigenicity studies. This data also supports the hypothesis that there may be universal rules of immunogen antigenicity and immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The determined <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values of the H6N2 viruses used here indicate that substrate affinity tends to vary according to the phylogenetic relatedness of N2s. The N-glycosylation at position 245 was previously described to be responsible for reducing N2 affinity for its substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Powell and Pekosz, 2020</xref>). Unlike group 2, which is primarily characterised by the presence of an N-glycan at position 245, NAs from phylogenetic group 4 have a low <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic>, indicating an increased affinity for substrate. This result suggests that phylogenetic drift can be accompanied by changes in NA enzymatic properties. Curiously, the Ala15, Wis15, and Kan17, despite having antigenic properties closer to group 1, still have <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> values that are comparable to those of group 2 N2 NAs.</p><p>After the determination of NA antigenic distances, we used RF modelling to estimate the impact of amino acid changes on antigenic distances. We obtained a strong correlation of predicted versus observed antigenic distances. However, it is important to note that the training dataset was based on the 102 mutations present in our panel, limiting the predictions for other positions. Furthermore, RF enabled the classification of the variable amino acids according to importance scores. Also, our modelling does not consider that substitution by other amino acids can have a distinct impact on the antigenic distance. As a consequence, predictions based on the model could underestimate the importance of a particular amino acid residue substitution in some cases. It is important to highlight that co-occurring substitutions in our panel (the ones present in the main branches of the phylogenetic tree) cannot be individually assessed by association analysis or the RF model. The individual weight of those mutation on NA drift thus remains to be experimentally demonstrated. Interestingly, the modelling could put in evidence the gradual drift of recent N2s which were not present in the dataset (A/Hong Kong/45/2019, A/Tasmania/503/2020, and A/Darwin/6/2021).</p><p>It has been reported that an N-glycosylation site at position 329 combined with E344 in NA from human H3N2 viruses from 2007 to 2013 was gradually lost in later H3N2 viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ge et al., 2022</xref>). This loss of an N-glycosylation site at position 329 combined with an E344K substitution was associated with a change in NAI reactivity in ferret sera. Three N2 NAs in our panel, derived from A/Victoria/361/2011, A/Hong_Kong/3089/2017, and A/Tennessee/18/2017, lack this N-glycosylation motif. The E344K substitution is present in three other NAs, derived from A/Nagano/2153/2017, A/Minnesota/11/2010, and A/Indiana/08/2011. The importance of those mutations is among the lowest ones predicted by our modelling. However, the differences in NAI reported by Ge et al. are very modest (less than twofold). The experimental variability in our study potentially limits the identification of substitutions with a subtle impact on NAI.</p><p>The protective potential of NA antigen against influenza has been underscored by multiple studies. It is likely that NA will be included as a standard component of next-generation influenza vaccines. The difficulties of producing stable tetrameric NA may be overcome in the future, thanks to protein design or with the advent of mRNA-based vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Catani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chivukula et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellis et al., 2022</xref>). The antigenic modelling associated with sequence surveillance may increase our predictive ability, highlighting major potential drifts and support NA antigen designs that may elicit broader NAI responses compared to natural NA.</p><p>In summary, our study shows that immunisation with recombinant N2 NA immunogen can boost anti-NA serum antibody responses in ferrets that were primed by infection with an influenza virus that carries the homologous NA. At least four major antigenic groups could be distinguished in N2 NA derived from human H3N2 viruses that were isolated between 2009 and 2017, and those antigenic groups predominantly correspond with the phylogenetic relatedness of the N2 head domains. In addition, the amino acid substitutions in close proximity of the NA catalytic pocket are more likely to affect NAI patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

genetics, with each reassortant expressing the targeted NA antigen, internal genes from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8), and the HA from PR8 H1N1 or A/mallard/Sweden/81/2002 H6N1, respectively. Briefly, HA and NA segments including non-coding regions were generated by custom gene synthesis (Geneart AG), while PR8 internal segments were derived from a viral isolate as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Marsh and Tannock, 2005</xref>). All segments were cloned into a bidirectional transcription plasmid derived from pUC57 (Genscript) including polymerase (Pol) I and Pol II promoters, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoffmann et al., 2000</xref>), and the entire set of eight plasmids was used to transfect 293FT cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Lipofectamine 2000 CD (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Twenty-four hours after transfection, Madin-Darby Canine Kidney Cells (MDCK-) ATL cells (ATCC) were added to the transfected cells in the presence of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma) to allow influenza virus propagation. Cell culture supernatants containing influenza virus were harvested 7 days post MDCK addition and blindly passaged in 8- to 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs (Charles River Laboratories, Inc). Inoculated eggs were incubated at 37¬∞C for 48 hr, then cooled to 4¬∞C for 12 hr, prior to allantoic fluid harvest and clarification by low-speed centrifugation (3000 rpm, 20 min). For H6N2 viruses only, high-yield stocks were generated by an additional passage in eggs as described above. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay on MDCK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Design and production of recombinant proteins</title><p>The coding information of the NACHO proteins was cloned under the transcriptional control of the CMV promoter in the pCDNA3.4 plasmid with a CD5 secretion signal, an amino-terminal His-tag and the thrombin cleavage signal followed by tetrabrachion-NA.

The experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Bioqual (reference number 17-021.6). Outbred 18- to 22-week-old na√Øve male and female Fitch ferrets were obtained from Triple F, PA (USA) and housed under specified pathogen-free conditions with food and water ad libitum. Ferrets were primed on day 0 by intranasal challenge with influenza H1N2 reassortant virus (1000 ¬µl/dose, split evenly between nostrils). Four weeks after initial infection (day 28), ferrets were immunised with 45 Œºg of NACHO (500 ¬µl/dose, intramuscularly, split evenly between hind thighs) corresponding to homologous NA used in day 0 prime. Alternatively, and due to low yield of selected recombinant NACHOs, ferrets were boosted on day 28 with 15 Œºg of homologous NACHO (A/Perth/16/2009nib-64, A/Tasmania/1018/2015, A/Utah/11/2011, and A/West Virginia/17/2012) or were inoculated with the same H1N2 reassortant virus used in the prime (A/Estonia/91621/2015 and A/Stockholm/15/2014). Sera from bleeds 2 weeks after the prime (day 14) and booster vaccination (day 42) were tested for immunogenicity and seroconversion in serological assays.</p><p>The mouse immunisation experiments were conducted according to the Belgian legislation (Belgian Law 14/08/1986 and Belgium Royal Decree 06/04/2010) and European legislation on protection of animals used for scientific purposes (EU directives 2010/63/EU and 86/609/EEC). Experimental protocols were all approved by the Ethics Committee of the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie (VIB), Ghent University, Faculty of Science (EC2019-035). Female BALB/c mice, aged 6‚Äì7 weeks, were purchased from Charles River. The mice were housed in a specified pathogen-free animal house with food and water ad libitum. Animals were immunised intramuscularly in the right quadriceps. Immunisation was performed with 50 ¬µl containing 1 ¬µg of recombinant protein (tetrabrachion stabilised NAs, referred to as NACHOs). All, except A/West Virginia/17/2012 NACHOs, were used as immunogens in mice. All immunisations were adjuvanted with a 1:1 volume of AF03 (25 Œºl of antigen in PBS +‚Äâ25 Œºl of AF03 per dose) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caillet et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two or three weeks after the boost immunisation, mice were humanely sacrificed with an anaesthetic overdose of Nembutal (6 mg per mouse) and bled retro-orbitally. The obtained blood samples were incubated for 30 min at 37¬∞C to allow clotting, which was followed by centrifugation at 10,500√ó<italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The supernatant (the serum) was recovered and submitted to a second centrifugation at 10,500√ó<italic>g</italic> for 5 min.

Recombinant proteins were diluted in DPBS (Life Technologies cat. # 14040-182) (tetNA was diluted to 0.5 ¬µg/ml). Then, 50 ¬µl of the coating antigen solutions was added to each well and the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr on a shaking platform. The wells of the plates were then washed three times with PBS-T (Sigma cat. # P3563-10PAK) and blocked for 1 hr with 1% BSA (for the mouse sera) or 10% milk (for the ferret sera) in DPBS. After blocking, the wells of the plates were washed once with PBS-T and incubated with a threefold serial dilution, starting at a 1/100 dilution, of serum in DPBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20 for 2 hr at room temperature on a shaking platform. The wells of the plates were then washed five times with PBS-T and incubated with a 1:5000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG-HRP (GE Healthcare cat. # NA931-1ml), or with a 1:100,000 dilution of anti-ferret IgG-HRP (Abcam cat. # 112770) in DPBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% Tween-20. The 3,3‚Äô,5,5‚Äô-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate (BD cat. # 555214) was added after three washes with PBS-T and the reaction was stopped after 5 min by addition of 50 ¬µl of 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The optical density (OD) in each well was determined at 450 nm and, as a reference, 655 nm using an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad). The end point titer was determined for each serum sample by scoring the dilution that resulted in an OD that was equal to or two times higher than the background OD obtained from pre-immune control sera dilution series.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>ELLA to determine NAI titers</title><p>Fetuin (Sigma cat. # F3385) was diluted into coating buffer (KPL cat. # 50-84-01) to a concentration of 25 ¬µg/ml and 50 ¬µl was added to the wells of Nunc MaxiSorp plates (Thermo Fisher cat. # 44-2404-21), which were incubated overnight at 4¬∞C. The coated plates were then washed three times with PBS-T (Sigma cat. # P3563-10PAK) and incubated overnight with 60 Œºl of a dilution of H6N2 and 60 ¬µl of twofold serial dilution of serum, starting at a 1/20 dilution, in sample buffer (1√ó MES VWR cat. # AAJ61979-AP: 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% BSA, 0.5% Tween-20). These dilutions of the H6Nx viruses correspond to the 70% maximum activity of NA from the respective viruses as determined in the ELLA. Fetuin-coated plates were then washed three times with PBS-T and incubated for 1 hr with a solution of PNA-HRP (cat. # L6135-1MG, Sigma) at 5 Œºg/ml in conjugate diluent (MES pH 6.5, 20 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1% BSA). The plates were washed three times with PBS-T, TMB substrate was added, and then the plates were incubated for 5 min before the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 ¬µl of 1 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. The optical density was measured at 450 nm and, as a reference, 655 nm in an iMark Microplate Absorbance Reader (Bio-Rad). Half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) values were determined by non-linear regression analysis (GraphPad Prism software).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>NA enzyme kinetics assay</title><p>The enzymatic activity of NACHOs and H6N2s was determined with the fluorogenic small substrate MUNANA as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marathe et al., 2013</xref>). First H6N2 dilutions were tested to ensure that MUNANA conversion into 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) generated fluorescence over time at a linear ratio. Ten microliters of 1 ‚ÄâmM of MUNANA (Sigma cat. # M8639) in 200 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) containing 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 1% butanol were incubated with 40 ¬µl of PBS solution containing viral dilution. Conversion to 4-MU was monitored every 2 min for 1 hr using a BMG Fluostar OPTIMA reader (excitation at 365 ‚Äânm and emission determined at 450 nm). Second, using the selected dilution of virus, the assay was repeated with dilutions of MUNANA ranging from 2.5 to 100 ¬µM. A standard curve with 800 to 25 pmoles/well of 4-MU (Sigma cat. # M1508) was used to extrapolate the molar conversion of MUNANA. <italic>K<sub>M</sub></italic> was calculated using GraphPad Prism version 8.4.3.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Antigenic cartography</title><p>Antigenic cartography was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2004</xref>, using the R CRAN package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Racmacs">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Racmacs</ext-link>).

They used 27 viruses and 43 ferret sera and performed NA inhibition. This work was supported by a subset of mouse sera. Clustering analysis determined 4 antigenic clusters, mostly in concordance with the genetic groupings. Association analysis was used to estimate important amino acid positions, which were shown to be more likely close to the catalytic site.

Four antigenic groups were identified, which the authors claimed to be correlated with their respective phylogenic/ genetic groups. Among 102 amino acids differed by the 44 selected N2 proteins, the authors identified residues that differentiate the antigenicity of the four groups and constructed a machine-learning model that provides antigenic distance estimation. Three recent A(H3N2) vaccine strains were tested in the model but there was no experimental data to confirm the model prediction results.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study used N2 protein of 44 selected A(H3N2) influenza A viruses isolated from 2009-2017 and generated corresponding panels of ferret and mouse sera to react with the selected strains. The amount of experimental data for N2 antigenicity characterization is large enough for model building.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One weakness is the use of double-immune ferret sera (post-infection plus immunization with recombinant NA protein) or mouse sera (immunized twice with recombinant NA protein) to characterize the antigenicity of the selected A(H3N2) viruses. Conventionally, NA antigenicity is characterized using ferret sera after a single infection. Repeated influenza exposure in ferrets has been shown to enhance antibody binding affinity and may affect the cross-reactivity to heterologous strains (PMID: 29672713). The increased cross-reactivity is supported by the NAI titers shown in Table S3, as many of the double immune ferret sera showed the highest reactivity not against its own homologous virus but to heterologous strains. In response to the reviewer's comment, the authors agreed the use of double-immune ferret sera may be a limitation of the study.</p><p>Another weakness is that the authors used the newly constructed a model to predict antigenic distance of three recent A(H3N2) viruses but there is no experimental data to validate their prediction (eg. if these viruses are indeed antigenically deviating from group 2 strains as concluded by the authors). Leaving out data from some strains for testing is a useful check, but due to phylogenetic correlations in the data the generalizability of the machine learning is not guaranteed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90782.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Portela Catani et al examines the antigenic relationships (measured using monotypic ferret and mouse sera) across a panel of N2 genes from the past 14 years, along with the underlying sequence differences and phylogenetic relationships. This is a highly significant topic given the recent increased appreciation of the importance of NA as a vaccine target, and the relative lack of information about NA antigenic evolution compared with what is known about HA. Thus, these data will be of interest to those studying the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses. The methods used are generally quite sound, though there are a few addressable concerns that limit the confidence with which conclusions can be drawn from the data/analyses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>-The significance of the work, and the (general) soundness of the methods.</p><p>-Explicit comparison of results obtained with mouse and ferret

They used 27 viruses and 43 ferret sera and performed NA inhibition. This work was supported by a subset of mouse sera. Clustering analysis determined 4 antigenic clusters, mostly in concordance with the genetic groupings. Association analysis was used to estimate important amino acid positions, which were shown to be more likely close to the catalytic site. Antigenic distances were calculated and a random forest model used to determine potential important sites.</p><p>This revision has addressed many of my concerns of inconsistencies in the methods, results and presentation. There are still some remaining weaknesses in the computational work.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>(1) The data cover recent NA evolution and a substantial number (43) of ferret (and mouse) sera were generated and titrated against 27 viruses. This is laborious experimental work and is the largest publicly available neuraminidase inhibition dataset that I am aware of. As such, it will prove a useful resource for the influenza community.</p><p>(2) A variety of computational methods were used to analyse the data, which give a rounded picture of the antigenic and genetic relationships and link between sequence, structure and phenotype.</p><p>(3) Issues raised in the previous review have been thoroughly addressed.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>(1). Some inconsistencies and missing data in experimental methodsTwo ferret sera were boosted with H1N2, while recombinant NA protein for the others. This, and the underlying reason, are clearly explained in the manuscript. The authors note that boosting with live virus did not increase titres. Additionally, one homologous serum (A/Kansas/14/2017) was not generated, although this would not necessarily have impacted the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and this point was addressed in the previous rebuttal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Inconsistency in experimental results</p><p>Clustering of the NA inhibition results identifies three viruses which do not cluster with their phylogenetic group.

In the random forest function in R this is done by setting the mtry argument (number of variables randomly sampled as candidates at each split). R samples variables with replacement (the same variable can be sampled multiple times) of the candidates from the training set. RF will then automatically take the data that is not selected as candidates as test set. Overfit may happen when all data is used for training but the RF method implicitly does use a test set and does not use all data for training.</p><p>Code:</p><p>rf &lt;- randomForest(X,y=Y,ntree=1500,mtry=25,keep.forest=TRUE,importance=TRUE)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p><bold>Summary:</bold></p><p>The authors characterized the antigenicity of N2 protein of 43 selected A(H3N2) influenza A viruses isolated from 2009-2017 using ferret and mice immune sera. Four antigenic groups were identified, which the authors claimed to be correlated with their respective phylogenic/ genetic groups. Among 102 amino acids differed by the 44 selected N2 proteins, the authors identified residues that differentiate the antigenicity of the four groups and constructed a machine-learning model that provides antigenic distance estimation. Three recent A(H3N2) vaccine strains were tested in the model but there was no experimental data to confirm the model prediction results.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study used N2 protein of 44 selected A(H3N2) influenza A viruses isolated from 2009-2017 and generated corresponding panels of ferret and mouse sera to react with the selected strains. The amount of experimental data for N2 antigenicity characterization is large enough for model building.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness is that the strategy of selecting 43 A(H3N2) viruses from 2009-2017 was not explained. It is not clear if they represent the overall genetic diversity of human A(H3N2) viruses circulating during this time. In response to the reviewer's comment, the authors have provided a N2 phylogenetic tree using180 randomly selected N2 sequences from human A(H3N2) viruses from 2009-2017. While the 43 strains seems to scatter across the N2 tree, the four antigenic groups described by the author did not correlated with their respective phylogenic/ genetic groups as shown in Fig. 2. The authors should show the N2 phylogenic tree together with Fig. 2 and discuss the discrepancy observed.</p></disp-quote><p>The discrepancies between the provided N2 phylogenetic tree using 180 selected N2 sequences was primarily due to visualization. In the tree presented in Figure 2 the phylogeny was ordered according to branch length in a decreasing way. Further, the tree represented in the rebuttal was built with PhyML 3.0 using JTT substitution model, while the tree in figure 2 was build in CLC Workbench 21.0.5 using Bishop-Friday substitution model. The tree below was built using the same methodology as Figure 2, including branch size ordering. No discrepancies are observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Phylogenetic tree representing relatedness of N2 head domain. N2 NA sequences were ordered according to the branch length and phylogenetic clusters are colored as follows: G1: orange, G2: green, G3: blue, and G4: purple. NA sequences that were retained in the breadth panel are named according to the corresponding H3N2 influenza viruses. The other NA sequences are coded.</p></disp-quote><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90782-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second weakness is the use of double-immune ferret sera (post-infection plus immunization with recombinant NA protein) or mouse sera (immunized twice with recombinant NA protein) to characterize the antigenicity of the selected A(H3N2) viruses. Conventionally, NA antigenicity is characterized using ferret sera after a single infection. Repeated influenza exposure in ferrets has been shown to enhance antibody binding affinity and may affect the cross-reactivity to heterologous strains (PMID: 29672713). The increased cross-reactivity is supported by the NAI titers shown in Table S3, as many of the double immune ferret sera showed the highest reactivity not against its own homologous virus but to heterologous strains. In response to the reviewer's comment, the authors agreed the use of double-immune ferret sera may be a limitation of the study. It would be helpful if the authors can discuss the potential effect on the use of double-immune ferret sera in antigenicity characterization in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Our study was designed to understand the breadth of the anti-NA response after the incorporation of NA as a vaccine antigens. Our data does not allow to conclude whether increased breadth of protection is merely due to increased antibody titers or whether an NA boost immunization was able to induce antibody responses against epitopes that were not previously recognized by primary response to infection. However, we now mention this possibility in the discussion and cite Kosikova et al. CID 2018, in this context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is that the authors used the newly constructed a model to predict antigenic distance of three recent A(H3N2) viruses but there is no experimental data to validate their prediction (eg. if these viruses are indeed antigenically deviating from group 2 strains as concluded by the authors). In response to the comment, the authors have taken two strains out of the dataset and use them for validation. The results is shown as Fig. R7. However, it may be useful to include this in the main manuscript to support the validity of the model.</p></disp-quote><p>The removal of 2 strains was performed to illustrate the predictive performance of the RF modeling. However, Random Forest does not require cross-validation. The reason is that RF modeling already uses an out-of-bag evaluation which, in short, consists of using only a fraction of the data for the creation of the decision trees (2/3 of the data), obviating the need for a set aside the test set:</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶In each bootstrap training set, about one-third of the instances are left out. Therefore, the out-of-bag estimates are based on combining only about one- third as many classifiers as in the ongoing main combination. Since the error rate decreases as the number of combinations increases, the out-of-bag estimates will tend to overestimate the current error rate. To get unbiased out-of-bag estimates, it is necessary to run past the point where the test set error converges. But unlike cross-validation, where bias is present but its extent unknown, the out-of-bag estimates are unbiased‚Ä¶‚Äù from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Ebreiman/randomforest2001.pdf">https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/%7Ebreiman/randomforest2001.pdf</ext-link></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Portela Catani et al examines the antigenic relationships (measured using monotypic ferret and mouse sera) across a panel of N2 genes from the past 14 years, along with the underlying sequence differences and phylogenetic relationships. This is a highly significant topic given the recent increased appreciation of the importance of NA as a vaccine target, and the relative lack of information about NA antigenic evolution compared with what is known about HA. Thus, these data will be of interest to those studying the antigenic evolution of influenza viruses.

This point was addressed in the previous rebuttal as follows.</p><p>This is a valid remark and indeed we have found a clear correlation between NAI cross reactivity and phylogenetic relatedness. However, besides achieving good prediction of the experimental data (as shown in Figure 5 and in FigureR7), machine Learning analysis has the potential to rank or indicate major antigenic divergences based on available sequences before it has consolidated as new clade.
