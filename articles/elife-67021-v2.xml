Since its discovery, topo VI has been proposed to be a DNA decatenase; however, robust evidence and a mechanism for its preferential decatenation activity was lacking. Using single-molecule magnetic tweezers measurements and supporting ensemble biochemistry, we demonstrate that <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> topo VI preferentially unlinks, or decatenates DNA crossings, in comparison to relaxing supercoils, through a preference for certain DNA crossing geometries. In addition, topo VI demonstrates a significant increase in ATPase activity, DNA binding and rate of strand passage, with increasing DNA writhe, providing further evidence that topo VI is a DNA crossing sensor. Our study strongly suggests that topo VI has evolved an intrinsic preference for the unknotting and decatenation of interlinked chromosomes by sensing and preferentially unlinking DNA crossings with geometries close to 90°.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-molecule</kwd><kwd>magnetic tweezers</kwd><kwd>methanosarcina mazei</kwd><kwd>DNA topology</kwd><kwd>topoisomerase IIB</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIAHL001056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKie</surname><given-names>Shannon J</given-names></name><name><surname>Desai</surname><given-names>Parth</given-names></name><name><surname>Seol</surname><given-names>Yeonee</given-names></name><name><surname>Neuman</surname><given-names>Keir C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKie</surname><given-names>Shannon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P012523/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>110072/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maxwell</surname><given-names>Anthony</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Topoisomerase VI selectively catalyzes strand passage of DNA molecules juxtaposed at close to a right angle, which explains the observed chiral-dependent activity and preferential DNA decatenation versus supercoil relaxation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA topoisomerases (topos), which are fundamental to cellular survival through the maintenance of genome integrity, manipulate DNA topology via the transient cleavage of the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bush et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang, 1996</xref>). This mechanism constitutes a highly vulnerable situation for the duplex; however, topos have evolved exquisite control over this reaction in order to ensure that DNA is cleaved under specific circumstances, then rapidly resealed. There are two topo families: the type I topos, which utilise a transient single-stranded DNA break (SSB), and the type II topos, which utilise a transient double-stranded DNA break (DSB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKie et al., 2021</xref>). These enzymes are vital during DNA metabolism, particularly in the relief of torsional stress built up ahead of and behind the transcription complexes and replication forks, as well as the removal of catenanes and knots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bush et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKie et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pommier et al., 2016</xref>). For this reason, targeting the topos as a means to treat bacterial infections and cancer has had significant and ongoing clinical success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bush et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cuya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hiasa, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pommier, 2013</xref>).</p><p>The type II topos are further subcategorised as type IIA and type IIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadelle et al., 2003</xref>). This separation is based on structural and evolutionary premises; however, the general type II topo reaction, known as strand passage, is believed to be shared amongst all type II topos. Strand passage involves the binding of one DNA duplex, termed the gate segment (G-segment), which is transiently cleaved and opened to allow the passage of a second DNA duplex, the transported segment (T-segment), through the break, thereby changing the topological state of the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roca et al., 1996</xref>). This reaction is integral to DNA topology maintenance through, but not restricted to, the relaxation of positive supercoils generated ahead of separated DNA strands, and the decatenation and unknotting of replicated genomic material. Even though all type II topos have been demonstrated to be active to some extent in both reactions in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bush et al., 2015</xref>), topos seemingly adopt preferential activities in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKie et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DNA gyrase (gyrase) has been shown to be an integral component of the replication and transcriptional machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kreuzer and Cozzarelli, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stracy et al., 2019</xref>), relieving torsional strain caused by positive supercoiling and allowing fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khodursky et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> topoisomerase IV (topo IV), however, is indispensable for the decatenation of the replicated bacterial genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kato et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kato et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2008</xref>), despite the highly processive and efficient relaxation of positive supercoils in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>) and evidence that it can, to an extent, support replication and transcription fork progression in vivo using cells encoding temperature-sensitive gyrase mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khodursky et al., 2000</xref>). The preferential decatenation activity of topo IV in vivo is thought to be a consequence of protein-protein recruitment via the <italic>E. coil</italic> SMC (<italic>s</italic>tructural <italic>m</italic>aintenance of <italic>c</italic>hromosome) complex, MukBEF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayama and Marians, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nicolas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nolivos et al., 2016</xref>), and temporal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Espeli et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>DNA topoisomerase VI (topo VI) is a heterotetrameric, ATP/Mg<sup>2+</sup>-dependent type IIB topo formed from two Top6A and two Top6B subunits, initially isolated from the hyperthermophillic archaeon, <italic>Sulfolobus shibatae</italic> in 1994 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergerat et al., 1994</xref>). It was later demonstrated to be present throughout the archaeal domain, in some bacteria, and in certain eukaryotes, including plants and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadelle et al., 2003</xref>). The Top6A subunit is highly homologous to the eukaryotic meiotic factor, Spo11, crucial for the generation of DSBs during recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>). Top6B structural homologues have also been identified in higher eukaryotes, including mouse and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, and were shown to interact with Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, the purification of the Spo11 core complex was achieved, and structural data indicated a high degree of similarity to the topo VI heterotetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Claeys Bouuaert et al., 2021</xref>). Therefore, despite the archaeal origins of topo VI, its characterisation has been of significant relevance to eukaryotic genome metabolism, particularly in the study of meiosis, and has also shed further light on the evolution of eukaryotic cells as archaeal descendants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gadelle et al., 2003</xref>). Since the discovery of topo VI, its physiological role in the archaea and eukaryotes in which it arises has been unclear. <italic>S. shibatae</italic> topo VI was shown to relax positive and negative supercoils, but decatenated more efficiently, with threefold less enzyme required to decatenate 0.4 μg of kinetoplast (k)DNA than was required to relax 0.4 μg of negatively supercoiled pTZ18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergerat et al., 1994</xref>). It is worth noting, however, that the number of strand passage events required to decatenate kDNA is not necessarily equal to the number required to relax the same amount of plasmid DNA. Nevertheless, this result, along with the discovery that <italic>A. thaliana</italic> topo VI was crucial during endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugimoto-Shirasu et al., 2002</xref>), a mechanism by which plant cells increase in size through multiple rounds of genome replication in the absence of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sugimoto-Shirasu and Roberts, 2003</xref>), led to the hypothesis that topo VI was likely a decatenase, unlinking replicated genomic material in vivo. However, it has also been speculated that topo VI may be involved in positive supercoil relaxation. Exploring the phylogeny of archaeal topos revealed that archaea also encode topo III, known for its role in decatenation and DNA repair, and that in Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota, topo VI was the only encoded topo capable of relaxing positive supercoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forterre and Gadelle, 2009</xref>). This suggested that topo VI must play a role in the removal of transcription- and replication-induced supercoils, particularly in those organisms lacking a DNA gyrase.</p><p>Recent structural and biochemical studies have shed light on the mechanism of topo VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graille et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). Both <italic>Methanosarcina mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Corbett et al., 2007</xref>) and S. <italic>shibatae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Graille et al., 2008</xref>) full length topo VI have been characterised crystallographically, revealing an open and closed conformation, respectively, of a protein with a clamp-like structure forming an interior space large enough to accommodate two DNA duplexes. Top6A harbours the catalytic tyrosine and TOPRIM domain, the dimer of which constitutes a groove of the correct dimensions to bind the G-segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nichols et al., 1999</xref>). Top6B extends from the Top6A dimer to form a cavity that captures the T-segment, and was demonstrated to be extremely important for tightly coupling ATPase activity to strand passage, indicating that topo VI senses and binds to DNA crossings and bends DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). This work also showed that <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI was an extremely slow and highly distributive supercoil relaxase. They calculated that at the rate measured using in vitro approaches, it is unlikely that the enzyme functions fast enough to support replication and transcription within the host organism. Therefore, there are still many unanswered questions surrounding topo VI, including its physiological functions, why topo VI specifically is required during endoreduplication in plants, and why the supercoil relaxation activity of topo VI in vitro seems unable to support DNA metabolism in vivo.</p><p>Here, using topo VI from <italic>M. mazei</italic> as a model, a single-molecule magnetic tweezers technique was employed, in combination with ensemble biochemistry, to gain a deeper insight into the topo VI mechanism, particularly how DNA geometry modulates activity. Previous research, while instructive, has left us with the conundrum that the in vitro activity of topo VI suggests it would be unlikely to support the cell in terms of transcription- and replication-induced supercoil relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). Here, we present a compelling case for the preferential decatenation activity of topo VI as a structural quality of the enzyme, arising from a strong DNA crossing angle preference of 87.5°, which in turn significantly disfavours the removal of supercoils. We further demonstrate that topo VI also behaves as a DNA crossing sensor, with a dramatic increase in ATPase activity, DNA binding and rate of strand passage, with increasing DNA writhe. Moreover, these data provide a potential explanation for why topo VI remains a vital component of some eukaryotic systems, such as during endoreduplication in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugimoto-Shirasu et al., 2002</xref>), as a dedicated decatenase, the activity of which will not be dominated by the necessity to relax transcription- or replication-induced supercoiling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Topo VI is a slow, chirally selective and highly distributive DNA relaxase</title><p>To begin exploring the single-molecule behaviour of <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI, a magnetic tweezers supercoiling assay was employed, described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Seol and Neuman, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seol and Neuman, 2011b</xref>). As opposed to agarose gel analysis of DNA topology, the magnetic tweezers facilitates control over the precise level and chirality of DNA supercoiling, as well as the real-time detection of supercoil relaxation by topo VI with the ability to capture single strand-passage events. At low force (0.2–0.5 pN) right-handed rotation of the magnetic bead positively supercoils the DNA, forming positive writhe (left-handed crossings), and left-handed rotation negatively supercoils the DNA, forming negative writhe (right-handed crossings), both causing the DNA extension to decrease as the plectoneme is formed and extended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). At high force, negative supercoiling causes DNA melting rather than formation of negative writhe, hence the DNA extension does not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Upon addition of topo VI, the DNA extension increases in discrete steps as supercoils are relaxed by topo VI. Therefore, the relaxation reaction can be followed via DNA extension changes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). First, we measured the chirality-dependent relaxation activity of topo VI using a topo VI titration of 0.25–2 nM at 21 °C, under 0.4 pN of force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The observed DNA extension changes revealed that, on average, topo VI relaxed positive supercoils ~2–3 fold faster than negative supercoils. We found that the average relaxation rates for supercoils of either chirality increased as a function of topo VI concentration with the data fitted to a Michaelis Menten-like equation, resulting in an apparent K<sub>d</sub> (K<sub>d,app</sub>) threefold lower for the relaxation of positive DNA writhe. In line with the single-molecule relaxation assay results, the preferential relaxation on positive supercoils by topo VI is also supported by an agarose gel based approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), showing that the relaxation of positively and negatively supercoiled pBR322* was completed by 6 min and 15 min, respectively. Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> suggests that the relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA was more processive than positively supercoiled DNA, which was relaxed in a highly distributive manner. However, previous results using a plasmid competition assay determined that topo VI relaxed negatively supercoiled DNA in a highly distributive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Topo VI relaxation rate depends on the chirality of DNA supercoiling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Magnetic tweezers calibration curves for a 5 kb DNA duplex supercoiled under low (0.2 pN), medium (0.5 pN) and high (1.0 pN) force. DNA extension is plotted as a function of magnet turns. Negative magnet turn values represent the clockwise rotation of the magnets which produces negative, or right-handed DNA crossings. Positive, or left-handed crossings are produced by rotating the magnets anticlockwise. At high force, clockwise rotation promotes DNA melting, rather than negative supercoiling, hence the DNA extension is insensitive to magnet rotation.

This provided preliminary evidence of distributive activity, as many seconds to minutes elapsed between strand-passage events, indicating that topo VI binds and resolves a single crossing before disengaging the G-segment. The analysis was extended to extract each dwell time between strand-passage events and plotting the average as a function of the number of DNA crossings within the plectoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the average relaxation rate analysis described above, automatic recoiling of the DNA was initiated 2–3 DNA crossings from full relaxation as it was evident that topo VI relaxation significantly slowed as the plectoneme was relaxed. Using 0.75 nM topo VI, a concentration determined to be effective for both positive and negative plectoneme relaxation, topo VI was allowed to fully relax the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). This produced characteristic traces in which the dwell times dramatically increased in duration as the DNA approached a fully relaxed state. Plotting these dwell times as a function of the level of DNA supercoiling clearly demonstrated that the reaction rate decreased with decreasing DNA-crossing number. The dwell-time between strand-passage events as a function of plectoneme crossings was well-fitted by an inverse relationship, indicating that the time taken to bind a crossing and perform strand-passage was inversely proportional to the number of DNA crossings present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This finding further supports the distributive nature of topo VI in supercoil relaxation and cements the conclusion described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref> that topo VI specifically recognises and binds DNA crossings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>), making each crossing along the plectoneme a potential site of activity. This specific binding to DNA crossings within the plectoneme is in sharp contrast to topo IV, which relaxed supercoiled DNA independent of the number of crossings, suggesting a single binding site, hypothesised to be the plectoneme end-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Topo VI relaxation rate depend on the level of DNA supercoiling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An example trace of 0.75 nM topo VI fully relaxing negative supercoils in a 5 kb DNA duplex at a force of 0.4 pN, at 21 °C.

Using a radioactive ATPase assay, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was observed to be dramatically stimulated in the presence of negatively-supercoiled pBR322*, in comparison to either relaxed or linearised pBR322*, and tightly coupled to the level of DNA supercoiling, with ATP hydrolysis decreasing once the DNA was relaxed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This was supported by a gel-based relaxation time-course performed in tandem under analogous conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). With positively-supercoiled DNA, we found that the rate of ATP hydrolysis, measured using a PK/LDH coupled assay, was ~2 fold faster than with negatively-supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This difference is consistent with the relaxation rates measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. DNA binding by topo VI in the absence of ATP, assayed using a nitrocellulose-membrane capture technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litwin et al., 2015</xref>), also indicates increased topo VI binding with increasing levels of supercoiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). However, whereas relaxation and ATPase activity was ~2–3 fold higher for positive writhe than negative, topo VI preferentially bound negatively supercoiled DNA in the absence of ATP. This suggested that the topo VI preference for relaxing positive writhe may be facilitated during a stage post DNA binding, potentially DNA-gate opening or strand passage. Unfortunately, the nitrocellulose-membrane capture technique cannot differentiate between productive and non-productive binding modes, so the results may indicate that more non-productive, such as G-segment-only, DNA binding occurs on negatively supercoiled DNA. However, DNA binding is extremely low in the presence of linearised pBR322*, which suggests G-segment only binding is not the cause of increased binding to negative writhe. Furthermore, the amount of DNA cleavage, as measured using an agarose gel-based assay, also indicates that negatively-supercoiled DNA supports higher levels of ADPNP-dependent cleavage by topo VI than positively-supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that topo VI’s preference for relaxing positive DNA-crossings may occur at a stage post DNA binding and cleavage, potentially DNA-gate opening and/or strand-passage. Alternatively, it is possible that negatively supercoiled DNA, while bound and cleaved more efficiently, is mildly inhibitory to strand passage. The current data cannot unambiguously differentiate among these possibilities.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>ATPase activity and DNA binding of topo VI are stimulated by supercoiled DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ATPase activity of topo VI over time, measured using radioactive ATP.

Even at high concentrations (e.g. 2 nM topo VI), the maximum rate measured for positive and negative supercoil relaxation was only 6.4 ± 0.6 and 3.5 ± 0.5 strand-passage events min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively. As detailed in the subsequent section, these rates are 10–50-fold slower than rates measured for the type IIA topos, gyrase and topo IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Duderstadt, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref> found the maximal topo VI ATP hydrolysis rate, using the PK/LDH assay, to be ∼3 ATP min<sup>–1</sup> during relaxation of negatively supercoiled plasmids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). Here, the ATPase rate was determined to be ∼5 ± 0.9 ATP min<sup>–1</sup>, using a radioactive ATPase assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). If 2 ATP molecules are hydrolysed during each strand-passage cycle, both these values correspond well with a rate of ∼1.5–3.5 strand passage events min<sup>–1</sup> on negative supercoils, attained using the magnetic tweezers, between 0.25–2 nM topo VI (3–7 ATP hydrolysed min<sup>–1</sup>). As discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>, this rate is a fraction of typical type IIA topo rates, suggesting that topo VI is unlikely to function efficiently enough to support cellular DNA metabolism as a DNA relaxase in <italic>M. mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Topo VI is more active in DNA braid unlinking than supercoil relaxation</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, topo VI relaxation activity was highly distributive, independent of the supercoil chirality, yet topo VI preferentially relaxed positive writhe. Interestingly, other type IIA topos including <italic>E. coli</italic> topo IV and human topo IIα also demonstrate preferential relaxation of positive writhe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seol et al., 2013</xref>). The detailed basis for chiral preference varies amongst type II topos, however one commonality was that enzymes preferentially act on a particular DNA crossing geometry for either G-segment binding or T-segment capture. In order to explore how DNA-crossing geometry and twist play a role in chirality sensing by topo VI, we employed a magnetic tweezers-based DNA-braiding assay. In this assay, rather than tethering a single torsionally-constrained duplex, two torsionally-unconstrained DNA duplexes are attached to a single magnetic bead, which, upon rotation of the magnets, were wrapped around one another to create writhe without changing twist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Charvin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast to the supercoiled substrate, DNA writhe is created directly in the braiding system (rather than via the conversion of twist to writhe); therefore left-handed magnet rotation forms positive writhe (left-handed DNA crossings) and right-handed rotation forms negative writhe (right-handed DNA crossings). The braided DNA substrate is more akin to catenated rather than supercoiled DNA, and allows the exploration of how writhe affects enzymatic behaviour in the absence of twist. In the case of topo VI, the braided DNA substrate had a surprising effect on activity. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the example trace of braided DNA relaxation by 0.1 nM topo VI (0.5 pN), demonstrates that the braid was relaxed in three rapid bursts, at an average rate of ~0.5 strand-passage event s<sup>–1</sup>. This is an example of a trace where the braid was relaxed very quickly, however, even on average the rate of braid unlinking measured over a range of topo VI concentrations (0.05–0.9 nM) increased ~5 fold above that of supercoil relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For example, 0.5 nM topo VI relaxed positive supercoils at a rate of 3.5 ± 0.8 strand-passage events min<sup>–1</sup>, and positive braids at a rate of 18.9 ± 2.3 strand-passage events min<sup>–1</sup>. Moreover, topo VI exhibited robust unlinking activity at concentrations ∼10-fold lower than was achievable in supercoil relaxation, and with a limited processivity, passing consecutive T-segments while remaining bound to the initial G-segment. Rates for topo VI processive activity (dwell times between events not included in the average) approach ~0.8 strand-passage events s<sup>–1</sup> on average (during positive braid unlinking using 0.9 nM topo VI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is ~10 fold higher than the rate of positive supercoil relaxation at comparable topo VI concentrations (~0.08 strand-passage events s<sup>–1</sup> using 1 nM topo VI). In line with this, when topo VI activities were assayed using a singly-catenated, supercoiled DNA substrate, the decatenation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, left-hand agarose gel) occurred at topo VI concentrations 10-fold lower than for supercoil relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, right-hand agarose gel). A similar result was also seen for topo IIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waraich et al., 2020</xref>). This demonstrates that DNA braids and catenanes likely share a common geometry favourable for topo VI activity that is not as prevalent in supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (left-hand side) the appearance of supercoiled, decatenated products also occurs at a ~10 fold lower concentration than the fully relaxed, decatenated products. Overall, the rate of braid unlinking by topo VI is on par with those of other type IIA topos on their preferred substrates. For instance, <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase, measured using a rotor bead tracking technique, showed one strand-passage event s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Basu et al., 2012</xref>), or using magnetic tweezers, 1.26 strand-passage events s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal and Duderstadt, 2020</xref>), and <italic>E. coli</italic> topo IV was demonstrated to relax positively supercoiled DNA at 2.5 strand-passage events s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Topo VI activity on braided DNA substrates.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Calibration curve for a DNA braid formed from two 5 kb DNA duplexes tethered to a single magnetic bead.

The first positive or negative 360° turn results in a sharp decrease in DNA extension as a single crossing is input. This is followed by a gradual decrease in extension with rotation, representing the formation of a DNA braid.

The chiral preference remains, with the V<sub>max</sub> ~2 fold higher, and the K<sub>d,app</sub> ~2.5 fold lower, for positive-braid unlinking in comparison with negative. This further suggests that the chiral selection originates from a DNA-crossing-geometry sensitive step that occurs between DNA binding and strand-passage. Based on DNA binding and cleavage experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>), the chiral selection potentially occurs after G-segment binding and cleavage as topo VI exhibits tighter binding and higher levels of cleavage in the presence of negative writhe than positive. This suggests that DNA-gate opening and/or strand passage is sensitive to the crossing angle, with a preference for angles more commonly found in positive writhe.</p><p>The average rate of unlinking by topo VI (rate including dwell times) was approximately threefold higher than for supercoil relaxation, largely due to bursts of two or more unlinking events in rapid succession. This rapid unlinking could be due to either simultaneous binding and unlinking by multiple enzymes, or a processive unlinking by a single enzyme, which can be distinguished based on the enzyme concentration dependence. While the processive rate modestly increased over large changes in topo VI concentration (~1.5 fold increase for positive, ~2fold increase for negative) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the size of the processive bursts remained constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and the duration of the dwell times between events decreased to a minimum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Together these results support the hypothesis that the burst activity is due to processive unlinking by a single enzyme. This conclusion is further supported by a comparison of the experimental braid unlinking results with simulations of perfectly distributive braid relaxation occurring with the same average rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). The experimental average step-sizes, probabilities of processive bursts, and average dwell times between relaxation events, are substantially larger than the values from the simulations analysed in with the same t-test step fitting routine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>), consistent with a model in which topo VI relaxes braided DNA in short processive bursts between which the enzyme dissociates. This striking outcome suggests that a unique geometric property more common in DNA braids than supercoils allows topo VI to rapidly catalyse multiple strand-transfer cycles before detaching. DNA binding and ATPase experiments show that topo VI inefficiently binds linear DNA, and the presence of this substrate does not greatly stimulate ATPase activity, indicating that topo VI does not bind well to the G-segment alone. This suggests that during the topo VI strand-passage reaction there is competition between the capture and passage of a T-segment at the correct geometry and the rate of topo VI dissociation from the DNA, with the former likely being accelerated in the case of DNA braids.</p><p>Additional experimental data exploring the effects of force on braid unlinking and supercoil relaxation are broadly consistent with a model of topo VI preferentially catalysing strand-passage on two segments juxtaposed at larger crossing angles. Calculations of the average braid and supercoil angles as a function of force, corresponding to the experimental configurations of DNA length, buffer conditions, and spacing between braided DNA molecules, suggest that DNA crossing-angles in braids were closer to 90° than those in supercoils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and that this may be the critical geometric factor promoting DNA unlinking by topo VI. This is particularly true for braids with a larger DNA spacing ( &gt; 500 nm), which favours larger crossing angles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charvin et al., 2005</xref>). It is also intriguing that topo VI transitioned from being highly distributive on supercoils to somewhat processive on braids. Positing a crossing angle-dependent strand-passage rate offers a potential explanation for this observation. Specifically, the diffusion of the T-segment into the topo VI cavity appropriately juxtaposed to the G-segment for strand-passage may occur frequently in braids, but rarely in supercoils. Measurements of the supercoil and braid relaxation rate as a function of applied force lend support to this proposal that the DNA-crossing angle may be the key determinant of the strand-passage rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). With increasing force, the average rate of braid unlinking drops significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), for both positive and negative writhe, mainly through an increase in dwell times between events with increasing force, although there is also a slight decrease in the rate and extent of the processive bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This force-dependent rate reduction could be the result of two different factors. It may be due to a force-dependent step in the catalytic cycle that becomes rate limiting, for example, bending the gate segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Thomson et al., 2014</xref>), or closing the DNA gate against the applied tension. However, it is more likely due to the deviation of the DNA-crossing angle away from the preferred angle, which decreases strand-passage rate. This interpretation is bolstered by the supercoil relaxation rate of topo VI as a function of force; the rate initially increased as the force was increased, but then rapidly decreased at higher forces ( &gt;1 pN for positive and &gt;0.6 pN for negative). These results suggested that two competing factors were affecting the rate of relaxation with increasing force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). Consistent with the calculations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the initial increase in rate could be due to the DNA-crossing angle getting closer to 90° with increasing force. The cause of the subsequent decrease in activity, particularly for positive supercoil relaxation above 1 pN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>) is less clear. Potential explanations include inhibition of DNA gate closing, or G-segment bending against high force. Alternatively, an increase in DNA twist, which also increases with increasing force, may inhibit DNA binding or cleavage. Whereas the data is largely consistent with a model in which topo VI requires the T- and G-segments to be juxtaposed at a crossing angle close to 90°, directly measuring the preferred crossing angle would provide definite support for this model.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Calculated average DNA-crossing angles for supercoils and braids, as a function of force.</title><p>The average DNA-crossing angle in positive and negative supercoils (+ sc [ink] and -sc [light blue], respectively) were calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neukirch and Marko, 2011</xref>.

This method was first described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref> and applied to <italic>E. coli</italic> topo IV. Here, a single-crossing is defined as the interlink between the two DNA duplexes formed by one full magnet rotation (360°) corresponds to a change in linking number of 2. Shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, when the braid goes from fully relaxed to a single crossing, there is a distinct drop in DNA extension. This allows straightforward measurement of the unlinking rate of a single DNA-crossing of either chirality. These measurements can be conducted at high topo VI concentration, as they are complete in a single catalytic event, so as to ensure T-segment binding, rather than G-segment binding, is rate limiting. This, when combined with Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulation-derived DNA crossing-angle distributions, allowed determination of the topo VI DNA crossing-angle preference. This is facilitated as single-positive and -negative crossings are identical in every respect, aside from the crossing angle distributions. An enzyme with a preference for a crossing angle below 90° will have increased activity on positive crossings, as is true for topo IV, whereas if the enzyme binds preferentially to perfectly symmetric DNA-crossings (90°), there would be no difference between the rate of relaxation on positive and negative crossings, as is seen for yeast topo II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To begin, the braid being assayed requires precise calibration of the first crossing, which is then fitted to a geometric function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This allows the calculation of both the length and spacing of the DNA attached to the bead. This information, along with the magnetic force applied to the bead and temperature, is integral to executing the DNA-crossing angle simulations. Once calibration was complete, data collection in the presence of topo VI was performed, imposing a DNA crossing of one chirality, allowing topo VI to unlink the DNA-crossing, before imposing one of the opposite chirality and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). Not all braid geometries were unlinked by topo VI, in particular the more acute crossing angles, determined by assaying the braid for up to an hour without a single event, or until the braid became unattached from the slide surface. The distribution of times taken to relax either positive (left-handed) or negative (right-handed) crossings were plotted as histograms and fitted with single exponentials to attain the characteristic unlinking times for the DNA-crossing geometry being assayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). In agreement with results from DNA braids and supercoils, the characteristic unlinking time from the fitting on positive crossings (τ<sub>L</sub>) for the particular braid assayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> was 8.4 ± 1.4 s, which was 4.7-fold faster than that of negative crossings (τ<sub>R</sub>) (43.8 ± 6.9 s), suggesting that a positive crossing geometry facilitates topo VI activity through the higher probability of forming the preferred crossing angle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Topo VI unlinking single DNA crossings.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single crossing assay schematic with DNA crossing geometry for positive (left-handed, red) and negative (right-handed, blue) DNA writhe.

For positive crossings this is an acute angle (α); for negative crossings the obtuse angle is the supplement (π-α) of the positive angle.

The crossing angle distribution is attained by simulating the thermal fluctuations of two DNA molecules, the movements of which are dependent on DNA length, the tension applied to the DNA, temperature, and the spacing between the DNA duplexes. So, even though the average crossing angle is not necessarily the preferred crossing angle (α<sub>0</sub>), this fluctuation results in α<sub>0</sub> being formed at a certain frequency, which is related to the measured unlinking rate of a single DNA-crossing (assuming that achieving α<sub>0</sub> is rate-limiting). The MC and BD simulations can predict how probable α<sub>0</sub> is under the given DNA-crossing geometry for positive and negative crossings. If the assumptions that the time taken to unlink the crossing is dependent on a single rate-limiting step, which is likely as the unlinking times are exponentially distributed, and that this step is dependent on the DNA-crossing angle, then τ<sub>L</sub>/ τ<sub>R</sub> is equal to the ratio of negative and positive DNA-crossing angle probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

From a technical perspective, simulating the crossing angle distributions using two distinct simulation techniques and attaining strikingly similar values for topo VI α<sub>0</sub>, not only adds confidence to the accuracy of this value but also supports the use of either simulation technique in measuring DNA-crossing angle distributions. Supported by MC simulations done by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>, the topo VI angle preference can account for the consistent twofold difference in rate between the positive and negative supercoil relaxation and braid unlinking assays. Furthermore, combining the ATPase measurements of topo VI relaxing positively and negatively supercoiled DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) with crossing angle distributions of supercoiled plasmid DNA obtained from MC simulations performed by Vologodskii and Cozzarelli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1994</xref>) permits an independent estimate of the preferred crossing angle of topo VI. This analysis returns a preferred crossing angle in the range of 83° to 87° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), in excellent agreement with the value of 87.6° obtained from the more precise single molecule measurements.</p><p>The preferred crossing angle for topo VI is similar to that found for topo IV, attained using the same single-crossing assay, of 85.5° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>). However, one distinct difference is that topo VI exhibited a far stricter preference for the DNA-crossing geometries on which it would act. If the imposed crossing angle (α<sub>L</sub>) is defined as the average angle in the positive distribution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), then the most acute α<sub>L</sub> that topo VI could unlink was 77°, with no activity detected on braids with an α<sub>L</sub> lower than this (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, topo IV seemed far more versatile and was able to unlink DNA-crossings with an α<sub>L</sub> as low as 50° (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests that topo VI either cannot remain bound to a disfavoured DNA crossing for long enough to achieve the preferred angle, or can bind but cannot achieve the correct crossing angle for gate opening and/or strand-passage. The latter is supported anecdotally by the observation that on some single crossings with more acute crossing angles, when manual removal of the single crossing was attempted by turning the magnets, the DNA extension did not increase. This suggests topo VI has bound to the crossing but unable to pass the duplex or reopen the N-gate, holding the two duplexes in place.</p><p>Taken together, the data obtained from the single-crossing assays not only provides an explanation for chiral discrimination by topo VI, but also strengthens the idea that topo VI is a preferential decatenase. Using MC simulations, it has been shown that angle distributions within catenanes are distributed around 90°, whereas positive supercoils are more acute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>). A strong crossing angle preference of 87–88° would indeed predispose topo VI to decatenation, while disfavouring supercoil relaxation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model for chirality-dependent topo VI activity.</title><p>Unbound topo VI (1) binds a G- and T-segment in the presence of ATP (2), leading to G-segment cleavage and T-segment strand-passage.

Along with the observation that topo VI has an extremely strict preference for DNA crossing geometries close to 90°, which appear more frequently in catenanes than they do in supercoils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>), these data strongly indicate that <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI is a preferential decatenase, which simultaneously disfavours supercoil relaxation. This leads to providing a potential explanation for the presence of topo VI in higher eukaryotes, during situations in which the genome is rapidly replicated, such as endoreduplication in plants, explored in depth below.</p><p>The preference for positive writhe, explained by the DNA-crossing angle preference of 87.4–87.8°, was an unforeseen result. While significant, with both supercoiled and braided DNA substrates, the 2–3-fold increase in rate on positive writhe was not particularly large, unlike the difference seen for topo IV, which relaxed positive writhe ~20 fold faster than negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Stone et al., 2003</xref>). Whether this difference for topo VI has in vivo implications isn’t clear. However, as <italic>M. mazei</italic> encodes a DNA gyrase, which maintains the genome in a negatively supercoiled state, the slight preference for positive DNA crossings may prevent topo VI from interfering with the activity of DNA gyrase. It may also indicate, as supercoils ahead of replication forks are positive, that topo VI can help support the relief of replication- and transcription-induced torsional strain in combination with other topos.</p><p>Consideration of the step in the topo VI strand-passage reaction at which chiral selection occurs revealed several possibilities. It could occur during initial DNA binding, T-segment capture, N-gate closure, G-segment cleavage or strand passage. Binding experiments in the absence of ATP indicate that negative DNA crossings are bound more tightly than positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>), despite both single-molecule and ensemble measurements revealing a two- to threefold rate enhancement in the presence of positive writhe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). This suggests that chiral selection does not occur at the initial DNA binding step. One interpretation of the binding data is that topo VI could undergo more G-segment-only binding on negative DNA-crossings, which does not permit activity, however as binding is poor in the presence of relaxed and linearised DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it is unlikely that the enhanced binding of negatively supercoiled DNA results from G-segment-only binding. In addition, further confirming observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>, data reported here suggest that topo VI is a DNA-crossing sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>), e.g. binding the G- and T-segments simultaneously, rather than binding a G-segment first before capturing a T-segment. This model of topo VI is supported by data showing that strand-passage occurs more quickly in plectonemes with more DNA crossings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), the rate of ATP hydrolysis is tightly coupled to the presence of DNA writhe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), and DNA binding increases with increasing supercoil density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). An alternative possibility is that negatively supercoiled DNA binds to topo VI as a product complex, that is with the T segment below the DNA gate, bound in the ‘exit cavity’ of the enzyme (topo VI does not have an exit gate like type IIA topos). This raises the possibility of strand passage in the opposite direction, that is bottom up, as has been proposed in ATP-independent relaxation of negatively supercoiled DNA by gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Williams et al., 2001</xref>). However, there is currently no direct evidence to support the ability of topo VI to do this.</p><p>It is known from work done by Wendorff and Berger that domains within the Top6B subunit are critical to recognising the T-segment and coupling this to G-segment scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). It is possible, therefore, that this may not only involve the presence of a T-segment, but more specifically its juxtaposition to the G-segment, which then permits Top6B recognition and N-gate closure. However, in addition to binding enhancement in the presence of negative supercoils, DNA cleavage by topo VI was also enhanced on negative supercoils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). This suggests that chiral selection does not occur at the N-gate closure or G-segment cleavage steps. This leaves DNA-gate opening and strand passage as the most likely candidates for the chiral discrimination step. There is precedence for this interpretation based on the structure of the type IIA topo, topo IIβ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). The structure of the open DNA-gate of topo IIβ, with a fully cleaved and separated G-segment, revealed that the T-segment would likely need to transfer through the break in the left-handed orientation and was suggested to provide further rationale for the type IIA preference for positive-DNA crossings. This may also be true for topo VI, with the likelihood of T-segment transfer being higher for positive DNA-crossings than negative, however in the absence of a structure bound to DNA, this remains speculative.</p><p>Another unforeseen outcome of this work was the switch from highly distributive topo VI activity in the presence of supercoils, to mild processivity on braids. There are two main differences between the magnetic tweezers supercoiling and braiding substrates: (1) braids do not accumulate twist upon magnet rotation, while supercoils do, and (2) the DNA crossing angle geometries of braids are closer to 90° than those within the plectoneme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). So it is likely that one factor, or a combination of both, promotes the processive unlinking of braided DNA substrates by topo VI. The latter is the more likely candidate, with the DNA-crossing geometries found in braids potentially promoting more efficient strand-capture and passage due to the larger imposed crossing angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). After the initial strand passage there is a kinetic competition between topo VI releasing the G-segment versus capturing a T-segment and catalysing another strand passage cycle. The larger crossing angles in braids facilitate T-segment capture, resulting in an increase in the number of strand passages catalysed before topo VI releases the G-segment. At low force, which was utilised in the supercoil relaxation measurements (0.4 pN), the increase in twist is minimal as the plectoneme forms after 3–4 magnet rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, it seems unlikely that a minor change in twist would be responsible for the significantly decreased activity on supercoils in comparison to braids. In addition, supercoil relaxation rate initially increased as force, and twist, increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The relaxation rate subsequently decreased as the force increased, indicating that twist may become important at higher forces, but this appears to be a secondary factor in determining strand passage rate. Moreover, increasing the force on the DNA braid reduced the strand-passage rate, largely due to increasing dwell times between catalytic events, but also decreasing both the processive rate and the number of strand passages per processive burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A-D</xref>). As twist does not change in the DNA braid, this leaves the DNA geometry as the most likely factor influencing catalysis. As force increases, the average braid angles deviate further from 90° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and distributions likely narrow, meaning the probability of achieving the topo VI preferred crossing angle will also decrease. DNA binding and ATPases assays performed here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>, suggest that topo VI preferentially binds and acts on DNA crossings and that G-segment only binding is unfavourable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). However, for processivity to occur, topo VI must remain bound to the initial G-segment once the T-segment has passed. This implies that during the topo VI strand-passage cycle there is competition between the capture and passage of a T-segment at the correct geometry and the rate of dissociation from the DNA, with the former potentially accelerated in the case of DNA braids.</p><p>Varying force on the supercoiled substrate suggested that DNA twist could play a secondary role in catalysis. The supercoiling rate initially increases with increasing force before decreasing sharply above a critical force, whereas the twist increases monotonically but sub-linearly with increasing force (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Neukirch and Marko, 2011</xref>). The initial increase in rate can be explained by the average supercoil angles becoming closer to 90° as force increases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The significant decrease in rate that occurs at high force, however, could be due to changes in twist preventing DNA binding or cleavage. However, this could also be due to inhibition of a step that is directly sensitive to force, such as G-segment binding or cleavage, which induce bending of the DNA, or gate closure, particularly since the twist increases sub-linearly with increasing force. Currently, little is known about the dynamics of gate opening for type II topos, but with its relatively simple structure, topo VI could make a good candidate for such studies, like recent experiments with <italic>E. coli</italic> topo I and III that directly observed gate opening dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mills et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Understanding the activity of topo VI from the archaeal perspective</title><p>Archaea constitute the third domain of the tree of life, alongside bacteria and eukarya. Archaea were distinguished from bacteria, previously having been grouped together, based on their unique ribosomal proteins and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Forterre et al., 2002</xref>). Archaeal DNA metabolism is far less studied than that of the bacterial and eukaryotic domains. However, it is known that archaeal DNA transcription and replication share features with both bacteria and eukarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausiannikava and Allers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Bell, 2006</xref>). For instance, like bacteria, archaea have sequence-specific origins of replication and encode transcriptional regulators that resemble those found in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ausiannikava and Allers, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Jackson, 2001</xref>). But, like the eukarya, archaea utilise a basal transcriptional complex that resembles the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, can have multiple origins of replication, and many species compact their genomes through the use of histone-like proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barry and Bell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Jackson, 2001</xref>). This complexity along with diversity within the archaeal domain itself can make understanding the roles of archaeal topos in vivo more challenging. This is compounded further by the distribution of topos among archaea. Almost all archaea contain topo VI, aside from the order Thermoplasmatales, which instead encodes a DNA gyrase, whereas some, including the Methanosarcina order, encode both gyrase and topo VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Forterre and Gadelle, 2009</xref>). In addition to type II topos, all archaea, aside from the Thuamarchaea, encode one or more copies of a type IA topo, which, in terms of sequence similarity, resembles bacterial and eukaryotic topo III, as opposed to bacterial topo IA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forterre et al., 2007</xref>). This has led to the proposal that topo VI must be involved in the removal of positive supercoils during transcription and replication, particularly in archaea lacking a gyrase, as topo III is a preferential decatenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). However, the work reported here solidifies the observation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>), that <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI is an extremely inefficient DNA relaxase, and provides evidence of its preferential decatenation activity. If this behaviour is true of all archaeal topo VI enzymes, then those organisms that lack DNA gyrase, would struggle to relieve torsional stress ahead of replication forks at a pace required by the cell, if they also do not have an efficient type I relaxase capable of relaxing positive supercoils, like a type IB.</p><p>The current literature confounds the issue as the first archaeal type IA topo explored in vitro, from the hyperthermophile <italic>Desulfurococcus amylolyticus</italic>, also termed topo III, was claimed to exhibit robust relaxation activity of both positive and negative writhe at 95 °C. However, it has also been established in <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>, that of the three type IA topos it encodes, two are reverse gyrases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bizard et al., 2011</xref>) (another type IA topo important in positive supercoiling of hyperthermophillic genomes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nadal, 2007</xref>), and the third is topo III, exhibiting preferential decatenation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bizard et al., 2018</xref>). It may be that in archaea that lack DNA gyrase and are apparently devoid of a type IA relaxase, that topo VI has evolved more efficient DNA relaxation activity, similar to how <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> DNA gyrase has evolved to efficiently both supercoil and decatenate DNA in the absence of topo IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Manjunatha et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>M. mazei</italic> encodes both topo VI and DNA gyrase, as well as two uncharacterised type IA topos, meaning that topo VI may not be required during positive supercoil relaxation and hence has evolved to preferentially decatenate. It is also important, as was done in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>, to consider the doubling time of the archaea in question, as the slow relaxation by topo VI may be adequate to support the growth of that particular organism, which did not seem to be the case for <italic>M. mazei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). The involvement of unknown accessory factors that may enhance the rate or processivity of topo VI has been postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wendorff and Berger, 2018</xref>). In addition, topo VI’s main in vivo role could be precatenane removal, which may occur closer to the termination of replication, or even during elongation or at cell division. For instance, if the replication fork can swivel in vivo, which is known to occur in bacteria and eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cebrián et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schalbetter et al., 2015</xref>), positive supercoiling generated ahead of polymerase may be redistributed to form precatenanes behind the fork in archaea, which are likely a preferred topo VI substrate. Therefore, in cells seemingly devoid of an efficient relaxase, topo VI may be able to efficiently support fork progression through unlinking of precatenated DNA, rather than relaxation of supercoils. This may also provide a functional explanation for why topo VI exhibits partially processive behaviour, as this would have utility in the rapid removal of precatenanes. However, as little is currently known about the specifics of how DNA topology changes during archaeal metabolism, this remains speculative. A better understanding of these varied topological states occurring in vivo will also permits more precise delineation of the relative decatenation versus relaxation activities of topo VI. Although topo VI preferentially unlinks rather than relaxes singly-catenated negatively supercoiled substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), in line with its preference for a crossing angle near 90°, the crossing angle distribution in catenated DNA molecules depends on both the sign and extent of supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1996</xref>). Combining the preferred crossing angle obtained here with simulations of the topological states of interlinked DNA in vivo will provide a fuller picture of the relative unlinking versus relaxation activities of topo VI.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for the physiological role of plant topo VI homologues</title><p>Genomic analysis of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> revealed that the Topo6A (AtSPO11-3) and Topo6B (AtTOP6B) genes were encoded, and homozygous null mutations in either, displayed identical phenotypes with severely growth stunted plants that failed to thrive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hartung and Puchta, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartung and Puchta, 2001</xref>). Furthermore, double mutants displayed a phenotype identical to that of either single mutant, demonstrating the proteins likely function in the same process, or even the same protein complex. A process called endoreduplication, in which the genome is replicated multiple times in the absence of cellular division, is critical for plant growth to enlarge hypocotyl and leaf cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sugimoto-Shirasu and Roberts, 2003</xref>), was shown to be deficient in the AtSPO11-3/AtTOP6B mutants and explained the dwarf phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Robert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vrielynck et al., 2016</xref>). However, <italic>A. thaliana</italic> possesses four type I topos, along with topo II and DNA gyrase, both of which are type IIA topos capable of the same reactions as topo VI, namely DNA decatenation, unknotting, and relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Corbett and Berger, 2003</xref>). Therefore, the exclusive requirement of topo VI by <italic>A. thaliana</italic> during endoreduplication remains uncertain. Our results provide a possible explanation since topo VI has an intrinsic preference for decatenation, arising from a strict DNA crossing angle preference. Topo VI efficiently unlinks catenanes and braids but exhibits much slower relaxation of supercoils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). During the endocycle, the genome is replicated to variable degrees, however in wild-type <italic>A. thaliana</italic> trichomes this can be as high as 32 C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sugimoto-Shirasu and Roberts, 2003</xref>), with mutants in topo VI unable to replicate the genome past 8 C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sugimoto-Shirasu et al., 2002</xref>). With increasing DNA replication, comes elevated levels of transcription, and therefore extensive pressure on the protein machinery involved in both of these processes. Replication- and transcription-dependent strand separation could result in significant levels of DNA supercoiling, which is efficiently dealt with by the type I and type IIA topos. It is possible, therefore, as these proteins are very efficient at relaxation, that even though they are known to efficiently decatenate in vitro, they become subsumed by the necessity to relieve torsional stress generated ahead of replication and transcription forks. With this reaction so heavily disfavoured by topo VI, it could decatenate and unknot the genome unhindered, allowing the cell to continue through the endocycle. The research described here, clearly does not rule out the possibility of protein-protein recruitment, temporal regulation, or other activity-modulating factors which lead to the indispensability of topo VI in endoreduplication, but does provide a rationale that is independent of the requirement of these yet unknown components.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"

Samples were then spun at 18,500 rpm for 1 hr at 4 °C with the RC 6+ centrifuge (Sorvall) and SS34 rotor.

The SP Sepharose column was removed before the protein was stepped off from the Q sepharose with Buffer B2 (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 800 mM NaCl, 20 mM Imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol). Protein concentration was assessed using solution absorbance at 280 nm, determined using a Nanodrop. The his-tag was cleaved using tobacco etch virus protease (TEV) at a 1:50 concentration ratio (TEV:topo VI) overnight at 4 °C. The cleaved protein was then passed over a HisTrap FF Ni<sup>2+</sup> column (5 ml/min, GE Life Sciences) and washed with Buffer B and the cleaved topo VI collected in the flow through. The un-cleaved topo VI, his-tag and his-tagged TEV were then stepped off in Buffer B1.

Here, both DNA braids and supercoils have been utilised. DNA duplexes (5 kb for supercoiling and 3 kb for braiding) are tethered at one extreme end to a glass slide by the interaction between digoxigenin-labels on the DNA and the anti-digoxigenin-coated glass slide. A streptavidin-coated magnetic bead (1 μm diameter, Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1; 35601, Invitrogen) is bound to the opposite biotinylated end of the DNA. Rotation of the fixed magnets above the sample cell caused rotation of the magnetic bead, which changed the linking number of the bound DNA molecule. For supercoiled DNA experiments, both DNA ends were bound to both the surface of the sample cell and the magnetic bead via multiple attachment points so that they are torsionally constrained and accumulate twist and writhe upon magnet rotation. For braided DNA experiments, two bound DNA duplexes are necessary; however, as they have a single digoxigenin labelled nucleotide, which is rotationally unconstrained, the rotation of the magnets cause the duplexes to wrap around one and other, increasing writhe, while twist is dissipated by the free rotation of the DNA.</p><p>Magnetic tweezers measurements were conducted with 0.05–2 nM of <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI in 20 mM Bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% tween-20, 30 µM bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 1 mM ATP at 21 °C, using 0.2–4 pN of force.

Following established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Charvin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neuman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vologodskii and Cozzarelli, 1994</xref>), a juxtaposition event was considered to take place when the separation between the two DNA chains was less than a threshold distance (10 nm). The angle formed by the two segments of closest approach was determined by considering the clockwise rotation that would align the bottom strand with the top strand.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Agarose gel-based DNA relaxation and decatenation</title><p>Topo VI was diluted using Dilution Buffer (20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mM potassium glutamate and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) for use at final concentrations of 0.1–40 nM, for agarose gel-based assays. Reactions were run in a 30 μL reaction volume with Relaxation Buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM ATP) and 2.5 nM negatively supercoiled pBR322* (Inspiralis) or singly-linked catenanes (Inspiralis) (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waraich et al., 2020</xref>) for details on catenane substrate preparation), for use in relaxation or decatenation assays, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 22 or 37 °C for 30 min (unless otherwise stated, e.g. time course) then stopped by the addition of 20 μL of 2 x Loading Buffer (100 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.0, 40% sucrose, 100 mM EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml Bromophenol Blue) and 30 μL chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v). The reaction mixture was vortexed and centrifuged for 3 min in an Eppendorf 5,425 centrifuge at 21,000 rcf, before being loaded onto a native 1% (w/v) TAE agarose gel (40 mM Tris·HCl pH 8.5, 20 mM glacial acetic acid and 1 mM EDTA) and run for 15 hr at 2 Vcm<sup>–1</sup>. The gels were stained for 1 hr using 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide in TAE, and destained for 30 min in TAE alone, before being imaged via UV transillumination.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Agarose gel-based DNA cleavage</title><p>The DNA cleavage assay was performed as per the relaxation/decatenation assays with the following modifications. Topo VI (5–80 nM) was incubated with 2.5 nM negatively supercoiled pBR322* (Inspiralis) in a 30 μL reaction volume with Cleavage Buffer (20 mM Bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM ADPNP) for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with the addition of 0.2% SDS and 3 units of Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, #P8107S), and incubated for 1 hr at 37 °C. The assay was then treated the same as for relaxation and decatenation assays, with the addition of 2 x Loading Buffer and chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1 v/v), followed by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ATPase assays</title><p>Topo VI ATPase activity was measured using two methods: a PK/LDH-linked assay described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a radioactive ATP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). For the radioactive assay, an ATP purification column was prepared using P-2 gel (Biorad). In 10 mL of P-2 wash buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl pH 8, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), 1.67 g of P-2 was added and left to hydrate overnight at 21 °C. The supernatant was removed from the hydrated gel, which was then washed four times with degassed P-2 wash buffer. The gel was then poured into a 4 mL Econo-Column (Biorad) and allowed to settle before P-2 buffer was slowly pumped through the column at 0.2 mL/min. A 100 μL ATP solution was made using 97 μL of 100 mM ATP, 2 μL of 33 mM [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP and 1 μL of a 1% (w/v) bromophenol blue solution dissolved in DMSO. Any residual P-2 wash buffer was carefully removed without disturbing the column matrix and the ATP solution added. Once the ATP solution had fully entered the column, the column was filled to the top with P-2 buffer. The ATP solution was left to migrate down the column, and using a Geiger counter pointed at the base of the column, the elution of the [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP was monitored. Once the [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP was eluting from the column, single drops were collected as separate fractions until the radioactivity signal intensity dropped again. Using TLC plates, 0.5 μL drops were spotted from each [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP fraction 1 cm from the bottom of the plate. The plate was then positioned upright with the [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP spots at the bottom in TLC running buffer (0.5 M lithium chloride in 1 M glacial acetic acid). Once the running buffer had migrated at least two thirds up the TLC plate, the plate was removed and fully dried. The dry TLC plates were then exposed for 1 hr to a phosphor screen, which was then imaged with a Typhoon FLA 7000 plate reader. The fractions shown to contain the most [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP and the least [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-phosphate were pooled and the concentration determined using absorbance at 260 nm (ATP <italic>ε</italic> = 15,400 M<sup>–1</sup>cm<sup>–1</sup>).</p><p>Using the purified [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP solution, a topo VI relaxation time course was performed. The reaction constituents were as follows: 1 μM topo VI, 430 nM DNA (relaxed, linear or supercoiled pBR322*), 450 µM [γ-<sup>32</sup>]-ATP, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 x minimal buffer (20 mM bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 100 mM potassium glutamate and 1 mM DTT), in a 55 µL reaction volume total. At each time point (1, 2, 4, 6,8, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes) a 5 µL aliquot was taken from the reaction and quenched using 5 µl of 2% SDS and 100 mM EDTA. A 1 µL aliquot of each time point was then spotted onto a TLC plate and treated as above. The intensity of the spots were calculated using ImageJ and the portion of ATP hydrolysed at each time point calculated using the proportion of phosphate released.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>DNA binding</title><p>To measure the binding of topo VI to DNA in the absence of nucleotide, a nitrocellulose membrane capture technique was employed. It is described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litwin et al., 2015</xref>, with slight modifications. Briefly, in a 500 µL volume, 16 nM topo VI was incubated with 10 nM pBR322* of varying topology (linear, negatively supercoiled, positively supercoiled and relaxed, obtained from Inspiralis) in Binding Buffer (20 mM bis-Tris propane (pH 7), 100 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM DTT), for 30 minutes at 37 °C. The reaction was then added to a 0.45 μm nitrocellulose Centrex MF filter (Whatman) equilibrated with binding buffer, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The flow through, containing unbound DNA, was removed and saved, and 500 μL of binding buffer added before a further centrifugation under the above conditions. The wash was removed and 500 μL of 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was added to the spin column and centrifuged once more, to elute topo VI-bound DNA. The fractions containing bound and unbound DNA were concentrated and buffer exchanged into 10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.5) using 30 kDa Amicon Ultra-0.5 columns (Millipore). The DNA concentration was measured using the nanodrop and the percentage bound of the total was calculated.</p><p>To further this analysis, distributions of positive and negative topoisomers were generated using <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> reverse gyrase. In 50 µL, 11 nM negatively supercoiled DNA was incubated with 100 nM reverse gyrase, 1 mM ATP, in 50 mM Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mM NaCl and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, at 95 °C for 10 or 20 sec (to generate negative and positive topoisomer distributions respectively) and stopped using 10 µL 0.5 M EDTA. To clean up the DNA, 2 µL of 2% SDS and 2 µL of proteinase K (New England Biolabs) were added and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 hr before purification with the Qiagen DNA clean up kit. The topology was confirmed by running 60 ng of the positively and negatively supercoiled DNA on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel containing 1.5 µg/mL chloroquine. It was then used in binding assays as described above, however once the topo VI-bound DNA was cleaned up and quantified, it was run on a native 1% (w/v) agarose gel for 15 hr at 2 Vcm<sup>–1</sup>. The gels were stained for 1 hr using 0.5 μg/mL ethidium bromide in TAE, and destained for 30 min in TAE, before being imaged via UV transillumination. The intensity of each topoisomer band was determined using ImageJ and the relative K<sub>d</sub> values for each topoisomer were calculated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Litwin et al., 2015</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analysis and figure preparation</title><p>Graphs were made using Igor Pro 7 (Wavemetrics) and figures were assembled using Adobe Illustrator.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Software</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-67021-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data are provided in the source files associated with each figure and figure supplement.</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank James Berger for the <italic>M. mazei</italic> topo VI expression plasmid, James Taylor for his guidance on the radioactive ATPase assays, Lipeng Feng for his help with the PK/LDH ATPase assay and Lesley Mitchenall for her expertise and training.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address the points raised by the referees in the sections below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In current paper, McKie et al. describe single-molecule magnetic tweezer measurements to show that M. mazei topoisomerase VI relaxes DNA more effectively when acting on positively supercoiled substrates, and that it unlinks DNA catenanes (experimentally mimicked by forming braided DNAs), particularly substrates with positive crossings, even more actively. Following an established approach used to characterize the chiral discrimination of DNA by bacterial topoisomerase IV, the authors integrate the magnetic tweezer data with angular probabilities derived from computational simulations of fluctuating DNA crossings. It is established that the penchant for specific DNA crossing angles by topo VI underlies the enzyme's preference for positive crossings, and that those angles are found more frequently in braids/catenanes than in plectonemes. A combination of magnetic tweezer measurements and biochemical assays are also used to show that while topo VI is a distributive and slow relaxase, it is a more potent and processive decatenase.</p><p>McKie et al. also deduce constraints on the mechanism of topo VI, beyond the preferred crossing angle, by interpreting counterintuitive results of DNA binding and cleavage assays. The tweezer data show greater relaxation activity for positive supercoils, yet the strength of DNA binding and amount of DNA cleavage are higher for negative supercoils. The authors rule out G-segment-only binding on negative supercoils (since binding and ATPase activity on relaxed and linear DNA are poor) and instead posit that chiral preference is set at the DNA-gate opening or strand passage steps, as has been proposed for human topo II β.</p><p>The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with observations appropriately contextualized in light of previous work showing that topo VI is a DNA crossover sensor, and with respect to other type II topoisomerases and the biology of archaea and plants. While there are some suggested recommendations that can be made for clarifying certain points or shoring up some of the claims, the findings overall appear supported by the data. The work constitutes a meaningful contribution to the understanding of mechanism in topo VI and the results and interpretations are situated thoughtfully amid the existing type II topoisomerase literature.</p><p>• The authors have specified that error bars refer to standard error of the mean but haven't stated numbers or natures of replicates.</p><p>• It would be helpful to show ATPase activity data for positively supercoiled DNA as well as negative in Figure 4A.</p><p>• In the Discussion section, page 23 paragraph 2, it says that the near-90° crossing angle for braids could explain the switch from distributivity on plectonemes to processivity on braids by &quot;promoting more stable DNA binding and efficient strand passage.&quot; This is speculative and a bit at odds with the binding on supercoils, and further raises the question as to whether there is a way to show binding strength (or unbound/bound fractions) for braids/catenanes in parallel with the data for negative supercoil binding tighter than positive. Please comment.</p><p>• Page 14 paragraph 1 (in regard to Figure 4D) states that the rate and extent of processive bursts are fairly constant over large concentration changes. However, for the rate plot, there is by eye a notable, fairly steady rate dependence (~1.5x increase for positive, ~2x increase for negative), especially in light of how the changes in Figure 6 Figure Supplement 1 C and D are described. It might be better to admit that the rates do increase slightly, but that since the burst sizes do not increase and because the dwell times decrease to some limit, it could still be concluded that the phenomena result from a single, processive enzyme rather than a concentration increase.</p><p>• Page 8, end of first paragraph. Why assume that positive crossover selection occurs following DNA cleavage? Why not just posit that the binding of negative crossovers, while favored, is also mildly inhibitory to strand passage? This would seem very analogous to topo IV. Or perhaps there is some confusion as to when preference occurs that could be cleared up in the writing?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Diverse type II topoisomerases perform critical roles managing DNA topology in cells; all off these enzymes are capable of carrying out a duplex strand passage reaction, but different enzymes specialize in harnessing this mechanism for distinct functions such as relaxation of positive and/or negative supercoiling, introduction of negative supercoiling, or decatenation. McKie et al. set out to characterize and understand the specialization of topoisomerase VI. They make use of tools including single-molecule assays with exquisitely well-controlled substrates to build on prior structural and biochemical work and help reconcile prior reports of its weak supercoil relaxation activity with its physiological importance.</p><p>The central comparison of single-molecule activity on supercoiled vs braided DNA molecules confirms and extends prior characterization of topoisomerase VI as a weak and distributive supercoil relaxase, while simultaneously clearly establishing that braids – an analog of physiological catenanes – are much more robustly relaxed. The application of the elegant single-crossing assay (introduced by Neuman et al. in earlier work), interpreted with the help of MC and BD simulations, leads to the strongly supported finding that topoisomerase VI prefers a crossing angle slightly less than 90 degrees. The authors also obtain a very clear measurement of a modest chiral preference on both supercoiled and braided substrates, and it is satisfying that for this enzyme the optimal crossing angle alone appears sufficient to explain this preference.</p><p>It is clear that there are relatively high average rates of braid relaxation. The stronger claim of even faster processive bursting may well also be correct, but is harder to evaluate from the information presented, which does not include a detailed analysis of the limits of the step-finding procedure (from Seol and Neuman) in its specific application here, nor any extensive presentation of raw traces. Given the quite small reported processivities, small extension signals in comparison to supercoil relaxation, and burst rates that are not quite insensitive to concentration, this is a claim where the details of the analysis are important for establishing confidence.</p><p>It is striking that the preferred crossing angle is quite similar to topo IV, but the degree of preference seems much more stringent – a conclusion based on the narrow range of geometries where the authors observe activity in single-crossing assays. A stringent preference for crossing angles near 90 degrees is central to the authors' explanations of preferential activity on braids and catenanes. However, the characterization and explanation of the difference in stringency with topo IV seem underexplored quantitatively, since the authors do not discuss e.g. the raw probabilities of sampling the optimal crossing angle in the assayed geometries that did not show any measurable activity, or the limits of detectable rates in their measurements.</p><p>Overall, this work advances the field by presenting a compelling case for topo VI as an effective decatenase, helping focus attention on this activity in its physiological roles, while presenting a plausible hypothesis – a strict crossing angle preference for strand passage – uniting observations of activities on diverse substrates.</p><p>To address my comments about burst analysis, I suggest:</p><p>1. Showing steps of representative traces, together with overlaid step-finding outputs.</p><p>2. Providing details of the step-finding procedure and subsequent analysis. E.g, the legend indicates that bursts were defined as two or more cycles; at what stage was that criterion imposed? Did step-finding also find smaller bursts (e.g. 1 cycle) and then those were excluded from subsequent analysis? Were the reported burst sizes corrected to account for the detection threshold?</p><p>3. Revisiting the simulation approach that was compelling for validating results in Seol et al. For example, if you simulate a &quot;null hypothesis&quot; of distributive activity with the same <italic>average</italic> braid relaxation rate measured in your assay, and include realistic noise, then apply the analysis pipeline used for experiments, what comes out?</p><p>To address my comments about ingle-crossing stringency, I suggest:</p><p>1. Report directly on tethers that showed no activity; what was the simulated distribution of crossing angles for those tethers? In particular, how does the probability of sampling the preferred crossing angle compare with tethers for which activity was observed?</p><p>2. How much slower must the rates be on these &quot;no activity detected&quot; tethers for relaxation to not be measurable?</p><p>3. While not as elegant as the internally controlled left-right comparisons, can raw rates of relaxation be compared between different tethers and related to the simulated probabilities of observing the preferred crossing angle?</p><p>Additional questions and suggestions:</p><p>Generally the discussion of crossing angles for different substrates (braids and supercoils at difference forces, catenanes and supercoils in the absence of force) would be quantitatively improved by calculating <italic>distributions</italic> of crossing angles for these cases in a unified analysis; I recognize this is a significant simulation task and currently you reference some past work to support general claims. At minimum I would reference, consider, and discuss early work presenting distributions of juxtaposition angles, from Vologodskii and Cozzarelli (1994 and 1996), which includes simulations of weakly supercoiled DNA (1996) where the juxtapositions that occur are still broadly distributed and just starting to be asymmetric.</p><p>The biochemical decatenation assay used here and in Ref. 47 is quite striking. What can you say about how &quot;special&quot; topo VI is in terms of the results of that assay? Ref. 47 shows a similar result for topo II α, where catenation occurs at a lower enzyme concentration than supercoil relaxation. How about other topo II enzymes, e.g. yeast topo II, bacterial topo IV…?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Topoisomerase VI is a chirally-selective, preferential DNA decatenase&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved. Both referees are favorable but request that a couple of issues still be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have satisfactorily addressed all major comments. A couple typos still appear to have snuck through: &quot;WaveMentrics&quot; in Figure 1C caption, and the formatting of Weeks-Chandler potential is fixed but the Debye-Huckle is not.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their revision, McKie et al. have added substantial new analyses, experiments, and clarifications to their manuscript, strengthening their study while responding thoughtfully to many of the issues raised by both reviewers. I am supportive of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and my remaining comments are concerned with just a few points on which I feel the authors could be more complete in addressing questions from the previous round of review, without requiring additional experiments or extensive calculations.</p><p>Burst analysis for unbraiding analysis:</p><p>I previously asked that the authors show representative traces, together with overlaid step-finding outputs. This request was minimally addressed by adding the step-finding overlay to the single trace that was already included in Figure 4B. To give the reader a more representative sense of this data and analysis, I think it would be appropriate to show more traces and overlays, including under varying conditions; this could be done in a supplementary figure. The annotation and description of Figure 4B itself could also be more clear: the step-finding output appears to show <italic>three</italic> bursts, but the main text refers to the figure as showing &quot;two rapid bursts&quot;, and the annotation and rate calculation from the text implicitly treat the relaxation as a single burst – 10 passages in 10 s for a rate of 1/s – while the burst rates (that would be extracted for tabulation in Figure 4D) from this trace must be somewhat higher than that (and higher than average, based on 4D), since much of that 10 s period is taken up with pauses; correct?</p><p>I had also requested details of the step-finding procedure – currently described with a quick reference to Seol et al.

The authors did not take up this suggestion, but addressed an underlying question by making a statistical argument against a distributive model in their response.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that measuring the binding to catenated DNA would be a useful addition; however, this experiment is currently technically inaccessible due to the lack of substrate availability. However, on further consideration we have revised the proposed model to provide a less speculative explanation for the slight increase in processivity observed with braided substrates. The slight increase in processivity likely arises from more efficient strand capture and passage of braided DNA, rather than stable binding. The data supports the hypothesis that on braided DNA the rate at which the T-segment is captured and passed increases due to the larger crossing angles and can therefore outcompete the rate at which the enzyme dissociates from the DNA. For the case of supercoiled DNA, with crossing angles that deviate further from the preferred crossing angle, the DNA crossing geometry slows T-segment capture and strand passage to a point where the enzyme is more likely to dissociate from the DNA post strand passage then capture a second T-segment. We have revised the text to reflect this more grounded mechanistic proposal for the increased processivity on braided DNA substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Page 14 paragraph 1 (in regard to Figure 4D) states that the rate and extent of processive bursts are fairly constant over large concentration changes. However, for the rate plot, there is by eye a notable, fairly steady rate dependence (~1.5x increase for positive, ~2x increase for negative), especially in light of how the changes in Figure 6 Figure Supplement 1 C and D are described. It might be better to admit that the rates do increase slightly, but that since the burst sizes do not increase and because the dwell times decrease to some limit, it could still be concluded that the phenomena result from a single, processive enzyme rather than a concentration increase.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a valid point and we have amended the description of the data in the revised manuscript to reflect this more nuanced interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Page 8, end of first paragraph. Why assume that positive crossover selection occurs following DNA cleavage? Why not just posit that the binding of negative crossovers, while favored, is also mildly inhibitory to strand passage? This would seem very analogous to topo IV. Or perhaps there is some confusion as to when preference occurs that could be cleared up in the writing?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this perspective is equally as valid and have amended the text to reflect both possibilities.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] To address my comments about burst analysis, I suggest:</p><p>1.

For example, if you simulate a &quot;null hypothesis&quot; of distributive activity with the same average braid relaxation rate measured in your assay, and include realistic noise, then apply the analysis pipeline used for experiments, what comes out?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point regarding the extent to which we can discern true processive bursts from the more rapid binding and action of individual distributive enzymes in the braiding relaxation measurements. The comparison that the reviewer is suggesting between a processive enzyme unlinking the braids versus multiple enzymes unlinking the braid in a perfectly distributive manner, but at the same average rate would be indistinguishable under the vast majority of reasonable assumptions about binding rates and enzymatic unlinking rates. In both cases the dwell-times between individual strand passage events would be exponentially distributed with the same mean time given that the average relaxation rates are the same. Although a direct comparison between the bursts of unlinking cannot distinguish between the two scenarios, we can perhaps get to the same point by considering the dwell times between the rapid bursts and compute the probability of observing these dwell times for a scenario in which the binding and relaxation time from in the bursts corresponds to the binding of individual enzymes, each relaxing a single crossing. As an example we can consider the positive burst rate at low enzyme concentration of ~27 strand passages per min and the average dwell-time between bursts of ~22 s (Figure 4 D and F). At a rate of 27 strand passages per min the average time between strand- passages is ~2.5 s. Assuming exponentially distributed binding times with a mean time of 2.5 s, we can compute the probability of observing a pause of 22s or longer; P(t&gt;=22s) ~0.00015. A similar analysis for the relaxation of negative crossings at the same enzyme concentration (~18 strand passages per minute and a dwell time of ~50 seconds) gives a probability of observing 50 second long pauses between binding events, P(t&gt;=50 s) ~6x10<sup>-8</sup>. A similar analysis can be performed for each average rate and each average pause duration between events, but the probabilities of observing both the average rate and the long pauses between events for a scenario of distributive enzymes binding and performing a single strand passage, never exceeds 0.005.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To address my comments about ingle-crossing stringency, I suggest:</p><p>1. Report directly on tethers that showed no activity; what was the simulated distribution of crossing angles for those tethers? In particular, how does the probability of sampling the preferred crossing angle compare with tethers for which activity was observed?</p></disp-quote><p>Tethers that showed no activity had a narrower separation (2e) between the two DNA molecules, resulting in crossing angle distributions peaked at smaller crossing angles for positive crossings, further away from 90°, and therefore a lower probability of obtaining the preferred crossing angle. To confirm this, we included the simulated single crossing angle distributions at two forces for a representative geometry at which topo VI was not able to unlink the single crossing. The analysis included as Figure 8 supplement 2 illustrates that the crossing angle distribution for single-crossing geometries that were not unlinked by topo VI are peaked at crossing angles 10-15 degrees less than single-crossings that were unlinked, and are ~4-150 -fold less likely to obtain the preferred crossing angle of ~87.6°. This very low probability of obtaining the preferred crossing angle likely results in a T-segment capture rate significantly slower than the G-segment off-rate. The off-rate would then out-compete T-segment capture, which would result in a decrease in the strand passage rate consistent with the precipitous decrease in unlinking rate.</p><p>This hypothesis will take substantially more work to test, and would be better addressed through kinetic approaches that could directly measure the G-segment release and capture rates. Nonetheless, we can estimate the G-segment off-rate from the size and rate of the processive bursts (figure 4). The average burst time for positive and negative braids was ~6 seconds, which provides a rough estimate of the G-segment binding time. Single positive crossings were relaxed in 4-10 seconds with an average of 6 seconds, comparable to the G-segment binding time. Negative crossings were relaxed in 7-44 seconds, with an average of 12 seconds. Scaling the measured relaxation rates of positive crossings by the relative probability of obtaining the preferred crossing angle for the non-relaxed crossings results in predicted relaxation times of 227 seconds at 1.5 pN and 76 seconds at 1 pN, and considerably longer for negative crossings. These long waiting times exceed the estimated G-segment binding time by an order of magnitude or more. In a simple kinetic competition model in which T-segment capture competes with G-segment unbinding, the probability of T-segment capture will decrease dramatically and the resulting relaxation rate will decrease quadratically with the decreasing T-segment capture rate. The unlinking rate will decrease both because the capture rate decreases, and because the probability of capturing the T-segment before topo VI releases the G-segment also decreases. The unlinking rate is proportional to the product of the probability and rate of T-segment capture. The combination of the low probability of capturing the T-segment prior to G-segment release, and the slow rate of capturing the T-segment would therefore result in a sharp decrease in the unlinking rate of single-crossings with lower probabilities of capturing the T-segment in the correct geometry for passage. Based on this argument, the observed selective relaxation of a narrow range of imposed crossing angles relatively close to 90° is plausible given the estimated G-segment off rate, but verifying this hypothesis in detail would require substantially more experiments, which is beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. How much slower must the rates be on these &quot;no activity detected&quot; tethers for relaxation to not be measurable?</p></disp-quote><p>In general, tethers with “no activity detected” were either left for up to 1 hour without a single unlinking event or the tethers did not remain attached to the slide surface for long enough to detect activity. This has been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. While not as elegant as the internally controlled left-right comparisons, can raw rates of relaxation be compared between different tethers and related to the simulated probabilities of observing the preferred crossing angle?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that the crossing angle can in principle be obtained from the rates of relaxing different single-crossing substrates combined with the simulated DNA crossing angle distributions. As the reviewer points out, comparing relaxation rates among different tethers is less elegant, primarily due to variations in topo VI concentration, even for nominally identical concentrations. The left-right relaxation of individual crossings is by far the most reliable approach to measuring the crossing angle. Nonetheless, to address the question posed by the reviewer, we computed the preferred crossing angle by comparing the relaxation rates of all positive single crossings and all negative single crossings. In practice this was done by comparing each set of n-1 measurements with one measurement for all 14 single-crossing measurements. This results in a total of 364 estimates of the crossing angle (13 measures for each handedness for each of 14 different geometries). The average crossing angle computed for each normalization single-crossing geometry, plotted a function of the imposed crossing angle of the normalizing braid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The average crossing angle obtained through this approach is 86.1 ± 0.5°, which is consistent with the angle obtained from the more precise left-right comparisons for individual crossings presented in the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Average preferred crossing angle for topo VI obtained from comparisons among all right handed crossings and all left handed crossings for single-crossing relaxation experiments.</title><p>Each point represents the average crossing angle obtained by comparing the relative relaxation times and simulated DNA crossing angle distributions of 26 single-crossing measurements (13 of each handedness) with measurements from one DNA tether, plotted as a function of the average imposed crossing angle of the tether geometry to which the other measurements were compared.

At minimum I would reference, consider, and discuss early work presenting distributions of juxtaposition angles, from Vologodskii and Cozzarelli (1994 and 1996), which includes simulations of weakly supercoiled DNA (1996) where the juxtapositions that occur are still broadly distributed and just starting to be asymmetric.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that obtaining the distributions of crossing angles in supercoiled DNA and in braided DNA would permit additional quantitative tests of the crossing angle preference of Topo VI. As the reviewer points out, this is an involved simulation undertaking that has not been previously reported. Our preliminary efforts reveal that this will be a significant undertaking that is beyond the scope or timeframe of this work. However, as suggested by the reviewer, we considered the crossing angle distributions for supercoiled DNA obtained by Vologodskii and Cozarelli in their 1994 and 1996 publications. Based on these published distributions estimated the preferred crossing angle based on the relative topo VI relaxation rate (more precisely the ATPase rate) of negatively versus positively supercoiled plasmid DNA (Figure 3 Figure Supplement 1). We find that for the preferred crossing angle of 87.6 deg, the relative probabilities in positively verses negatively supercoiled plasmids (both positive and negative σ = 0.06) are ~0.7, in reasonable agreement with the measured value of ~0.5. Alternatively, the ratio of crossing angle probabilities is a factor of ~0.5 at a crossing angle of ~85 degrees. Intriguingly, under the assumption that the positively supercoiled DNA is slightly (~15%) less supercoiled (σ = 0.05) that the negatively supercoiled (σ = -0.06) DNA, the agreement between the measured relaxation rate difference and relative probability is near perfect. Given the uncertainties in these measurements and the precise level of negative versus positive supercoiling in the plasmids, the correspondence is reasonable and is consistent with the predicted crossing angles measured with much higher precision in the single-crossing experiments.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for making this insightful suggestion.

The annotation and description of Figure 4B itself could also be more clear: the step-finding output appears to show three bursts, but the main text refers to the figure as showing &quot;two rapid bursts&quot;, and the annotation and rate calculation from the text implicitly treat the relaxation as a single burst – 10 passages in 10 s for a rate of 1/s – while the burst rates (that would be extracted for tabulation in Figure 4D) from this trace must be somewhat higher than that (and higher than average, based on 4D), since much of that 10 s period is taken up with pauses; correct?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises a good point and we apologize for not providing a more thorough description of the step-finder analysis of the braided DNA relaxation data in the previous version of the manuscript.

As the reviewer points out, there are three bursts, not two. With respect to the relaxation rate, we reported the average rate corresponding to the beginning and ending of the relaxation as indicated by the red dotted line in Figure 4B, which is a potential source of confusion since the overall average relaxation rate between the introduction of the braid and its relaxation was about half that at ~0.5 reactions s<sup>-1</sup> or 30 Lk min<sup>-1</sup>. We have revised the main text and figure legend to correct these errors and confusing language. The reviewer is correct that the burst rates observed in the example trace in Figure 4B are above the mean. Individual burst rates were widely distributed, which is made clear in the additional supplemental figure exhibiting a number of representative braid relaxation traces. The burst and average relaxation rates displayed in Figure 4B are higher than the average, but are nonetheless representative of the broad distribution of average and burst relaxation rates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I had also requested details of the step-finding procedure – currently described with a quick reference to Seol et al.

We also appreciate the good suggestion of simulating the braid unlinking as a series of distributive relaxation events occurring at the global average relaxation rate to compare the t-test analysis of these simulated traces with the results of the t-test analysis of the experimental braid unlinking data. We have added supplements to figure 4 (Figure supplements 2 and 3) in which we simulate a range of unlinking rates as a series of single relaxation steps occurring at exponentially distributed times corresponding to the average relaxation rate. We compute the average relaxation step-size, the average pause duration, and the probability of a processive burst (relaxation steps larger than 150% of a single crossing) for the positive, negative, and simulated braid relaxation data analyzed with identical t-test parameters. The results lend additional support to the conclusion that braided DNA is unlinked in a series of short processive bursts that are separated by long dwell times associated with topo VI rebinding. As is clear from the comparison between the simulated and measured T-test analysis results, the experimental average step-sizes, average dwell times, and probabilities of processive bursts are substantially larger than the values from the simulations based on the assumption of purely distributive relaxation events occurring at the same average rate. Whereas the T-test analysis does occasionally miss individual steps thereby artifactually indicating processive steps, the probability and extent of these false positive events are much lower than observed in the t-test analysis of the experimental braid relaxation data. We have also indicated the t-test parameters used for the analysis in the supplement. The data was initially down-sampled from 200 Hz to 20 Hz. The T-test comparison window size was set to 40 points, the significance level (α parameter) was set to an extremely stringent value of 10<sup>-7</sup>, and the minimum step size was set to half the extension associated with a single braid relaxation (typically 40 nm).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Distributions of crossing angles:</p><p>I agree that the analysis of crossing angle distributions previously calculated for supercoiled DNA by Vologodskii and Cozzarelli has strengthened the paper.
