Using a cell-based model of pathogenic huntingtin expression, we identified a class of compounds that protect cells through selective inhibition of a lipid kinase, PIP4Kγ. Pharmacological inhibition or knock-down of PIP4Kγ modulates the equilibrium between phosphatidylinositide (PI) species within the cell and increases basal autophagy, reducing the total amount of mHtt protein in human patient fibroblasts and aggregates in neurons. In two <italic>Drosophila</italic> models of Huntington’s disease, genetic knockdown of PIP4K ameliorated neuronal dysfunction and degeneration as assessed using motor performance and retinal degeneration assays respectively. Together, these results suggest that PIP4Kγ is a druggable target whose inhibition enhances productive autophagy and mHtt proteolysis, revealing a useful pharmacological point of intervention for the treatment of Huntington’s disease, and potentially for other neurodegenerative disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Huntington</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>lipid kinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000009</institution-id><institution>Foundation for the National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS096395</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Ramahi</surname><given-names>Ismael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Darrel K Royal Research Fund for Alzheimers Disease</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Al-Ramahi</surname><given-names>Ismael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Post Doctoral Fellowship (14POST20480137)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Panapakkam Giridharan</surname><given-names>Sai Srinivas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-AG053760</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barmada</surname><given-names>Sami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS097542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barmada</surname><given-names>Sami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Protein Folding Diseases FastForward Initiative</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name><name><surname>Barmada</surname><given-names>Sami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS064015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS099340</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weisman</surname><given-names>Lois S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005725</institution-id><institution>CHDI Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Botas</surname><given-names>Juan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010302</institution-id><institution>Robert A. and Renee E.

The disease is caused by the expansion of a translated CAG trinucleotide repeat within exon 1 of the huntingtin gene (<italic>HTT</italic>), resulting in a mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein with an abnormally long N-terminal tract of glutamine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ross and Tabrizi, 2011</xref>). Individuals with more than 36 to 39 repeats develop the disorder, and the length of the repeat correlates with the age of disease onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Walker, 2007</xref>). The poly-glutamine repeat expansion impacts the physical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kazantsev et al., 1999</xref>) and physiological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hipp et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Verhoef et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fernandez-Estevez et al., 2014</xref>) properties of the huntingtin protein, producing aggregates in aged striatal neurons that eventually precipitate to form neuronal inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Miller et al., 2010a</xref>). Accumulation of mHtt triggers a variety of insults that lead to striatal degeneration, however, the nature of the specific mHtt species, soluble, oligomeric or aggregate, that triggers neurodegeneration remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrasate et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lajoie and Snapp, 2010</xref>). In the last decade, a number of potential therapeutic avenues have been proposed to prevent or attenuate the neurodegeneration induced by mHtt, including examining the effects of mHtt-induced oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Wyttenbach et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Giuliano et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), huntingtin posttranscriptional modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Steffan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greiner and Yang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pavese et al., 2006</xref>), microglia activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gusella and MacDonald, 2009</xref>), a systematic exploration of coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gusella and MacDonald, 2009</xref>) and non-coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhang and Friedlander, 2011</xref>) DNA, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sarkar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Williams et al., 2008</xref>). However, it has been difficult to identify druggable targets that reduce disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bard et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to targeting mHtt-induced downstream pathogenic events, an attractive alternative for developing HD therapies is reducing the levels of mHtt protein, thus addressing pathogenesis at its root. The therapeutic potential of this approach is supported by observations in animal and cellular models of HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sarkar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">King et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Singh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Giorgini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yamamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin and Qin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>). Here we present PIP4Kγ as a novel therapeutic target for HD. PIP4Kγ [Phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate 4-kinase, type II γ] is a lipid kinase expressed by the PIP4K2C gene. The protein is predominantly localized in several tissues, including the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rameh et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clarke et al., 2009</xref>). Enzymatically, PIP4Kγ phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol-5-phosphate [PI5P] to produce phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lietha, 2011</xref>). The biological function of PIP4Kγ is not completely understood, although recent reports suggest a role in the modulation of vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Clarke et al., 2008</xref>), and mTOR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mackey et al., 2014</xref>). Recently we presented the first selective inhibitor of PIP4Kγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clarke et al., 2015</xref>). Here we introduce an additional chemotype with striking cell-based activity which prompted us to explore the utility of inhibiting PIP4Kγ in the context of pathologic mHtt expression. We show that inhibiting PIP4Kγ activity modulates productive autophagy, reduces mHtt protein levels in patient fibroblasts, and clears mHtt aggregates in neuronal cell models. Moreover, we show that inhibition of PIP4Kγ rescues mHtt-induced neurodegeneration in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> HD models.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of novel PIP4Kγ inhibitors</title><p>NCT-504 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is an analogue obtained upon medicinal chemistry optimization of a series of 5-phenylthieno[2,3-d]pyrimidine compounds identified in a high-throughput phenotypic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Titus, 2010</xref>).

Using a reconstituted assay of phosphorylation of the PI5P substrate by full length PIP4Kγ, NCT-504 inhibited enzyme activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15.8 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Notably, in the absence of PI5P substrate, the compound did not impair the intrinsic ATP-hydrolytic activity of PIP4Kγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that NCT-504 is an allosteric inhibitor of this kinase. This may account for the differences in potency observed in the enzymatic assay vs the DiscoverX binding assay. Similar differences in potency between these two assays have also been observed for allosteric modulators of other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rudolf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Smyth and Collins, 2009</xref>). NCT-504 function as an allosteric inhibitor may also explain why NCT-504 is exquisitely selective in the kinase profiling assay. In isolated enzyme assays against other PIP4K isoforms, 50 μM NCT-504 did not inhibit PIP4Kbeta or PIP4Kalpha (IC<sub>50</sub> between 50 μM and 100 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also characterized the compound using an alternate PIP4Kγ+ functional assay, which employs PIP4Kγ with a mutated G-loop and two additional mutations (described as PI5P4Kγ G3 + AB in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clarke and Irvine, 2013</xref>]) to increase the low intrinsic ATP turnover of the kinase in the presence of PI5P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Clarke and Irvine, 2013</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we exposed wild type mouse embryonic fibroblasts to nontoxic concentrations of NCT-504 (10 μM) for 12 hr, and then evaluated the levels of PI by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; toxicity assay in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, exposure to NCT-504 elevated cellular levels of PI5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Surprisingly, NCT-504 also robustly increased PI(3,5)P2 levels, and to a lesser extent increased levels of PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and E</xref>). We did not observe an effect on PI(4,5)P2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which is consistent with other reports indicating that the cellular levels of this lipid are mostly generated from PI4P via type I PI4P 5-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lietha, 2011</xref>). Kinetic measurement of PI levels showed that NCT-504 causes an increase in PI5P, PI(3,5)P2 and PI3P levels along with a decrease in PI4P, progressively over 12 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These statistically significant changes were not observed at 30 or 120 min suggesting that direct inhibition of PIP4Kγ eventually impacts other lipid kinases and phosphatases. Moreover treatment of unaffected human fibroblasts with NCT-504 elevated these three lipids in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further evidence that the changes in PI levels are due to the specific inhibition of PIP4Kγ, is the finding that shRNA-mediated silencing of PIP4Kγ resulted in a similar PI profile to that observed with NCT-504 inhibition, namely an elevation of PI5P, PI(3,5)P2 and PI3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D and E</xref>).

Importantly, a number of autophagy modulators have been described that reduce mHtt aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sarkar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roscic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Renna et al., 2010</xref>). That NCT-504 elevates the levels of three PI species implicated as positive regulators of autophagy suggests that the observed reduction in HTT-exon1-polyQ aggregates observed with NCT-504 treatment may occur due to upregulation of autophagy. Autophagy can be monitored by following the fate of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3-I). During autophagosome formation LC3-I gets conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine to form LC3-II, which is degraded upon autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Tanida et al., 2008</xref>). We tested and found that a two hour incubation of HEK293T cells with 5 or 10 μM NCT-504 did not significantly increase LC3-II levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). However, LC3-II levels depend on the rate of autophagosome formation, the rate of autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and on the rate of LC3-II degradation in mature autolysomes. Bafilomycin A1 inhibits the lysosomal v-ATPase, prevents autophagosome-lysosome fusion, and thus prevents autophagy-mediated degradation of LC3-II. Comparison of cells treated with and without bafilomycin A1 is a common method to monitor the rate of autophagosome formation within the cell independent of later steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barth et al., 2010</xref>). Bafilomycin A1 treatment for 2 or 6 hr elevated the total amount of LC3-II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and C</xref>). Importantly, treating cells with 10 μM NCT-504 and 100 nM bafilomycin A1 for two hours and six hours resulted in a 38% and 51% increase in LC3-II levels respectively compared with bafilomycin A1 treatment alone, which indicates that NCT-504 induces autophagosome formation. Similarly, treating cells with 5 μM NCT-504 and bafilomycin A1 for two and six hours resulted in a 30% and 46% increase in LC3-II levels respectively. Importantly, an elevation in LC3-II levels by NCT-504 in the presence of bafilomycin A1 but not in the absence of bafilomycin A1, suggests that NCT-504 elevates both the induction of autophagy as well as the rate of turnover of autophagic cargo (autophagy flux). To further evaluate the effects of NCT-504 on autophagosome formation and autophagy flux, we used a 293A cell line stably expressing a GFP-mCherry-LC3 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This double tagged LC3 is commonly used to distinguish between autolysosomes and autophagosomes or phagophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hundeshagen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kimura et al., 2007</xref>). Phagophore and autophagosome membranes conjugated with GFP-mCherry-LC3 are positive for both GFP- and mCherry-fluorescence. Upon generation of mature autolysosomes via fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, the GFP fluorescence from the internalized GFP-mCherry-LC3 is quenched in the acidic lysosomes; whereas mCherry fluorescence is insensitive to acidic pH and remains detectable. Thus, membrane structures positive for mCherry fluorescence, but not GFP fluorescence are autolysosomes. We determined the dose and time response of NCT-504 on autophagosomes and autolysosomes using GFP-mCherry-LC3; bafilomycin and torin-1 were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). As previously reported, bafilomycin treatment resulted in an increase in autophagosomes because the subsequent formation of autolysosomes is blocked. In addition, as previously reported, torin treatment elevated both the number of autophagosomes and autolysosomes, because inhibition of mTORC1 causes an increase in the induction of autophagy as well as an increase in autophagic flux. In contrast, NCT-504 treatment caused a robust increase in the formation of autolysosomes with only a modest elevation in autophagosomes, which indicates that NCT-504 increases autophagic flux, with only a modest increase in autophagy initiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29123.011</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of PIP4Kγ increases autophagy flux.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Western blots showing the levels of LC3-I, LC3-II and Tubulin (loading control) in HEK293T cells treated with either 5 or 10 μM NCT-504 or DMSO (control) for two or six hours in the presence or absence of 100 nM bafilomycin.

For example starvation does not upregulate autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mizushima et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, autophagy is spatially regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Maday and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). Thus, we tested whether NCT-504 impacts autophagy in neurons. We tested several doses and time points (up to 72 hr after treatment) and measured autophagy flux in DIV4 rat primary cortical neurons transfected with Dendra2-LC3, a photoconvertable reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Dendra2 has excitation-emission maxima that are similar to GFP. However, exposure to intense blue light raise these maxima, and thus red light is emitted. Since the photoconversion reaction is irreversible, and LC3 is both a marker of autophagy as well as a substrate, the disappearance of red Dendra2-LC3 over time can be used to assess autophagy flux in a noninvasive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gupta et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barmada et al., 2014</xref>). As a positive control for an increase in autophagic flux in neurons, we co-expressed Beclin-1, a positive regulator of autophagy that increases autophagy activity when overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kang et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, treatment of rat primary cortical neurons expressing Dendra2-LC3 with either 500 nM or 1 µM NCT-504 enhanced the rate of Dendra2-LC3 turnover. Thus, NCT-504 stimulates autophagy flux in primary rodent cortical neurons in a statistically significant manner up to 72 hr following treatment.</p><p>That NCT-504-induced changes in autophagic flux were dose dependent, led us to test whether the resultant increase in autophagy correlated with changes in Htt levels.

In a second set of experiments we tested the potential of dPIP4K to modulate mHtt pathogenesis using a behavioral readout. Neuronal-specific expression of HttN231Q128 leads to a late-onset motor impairment that can be quantified in a climbing assay. This phenotype was also ameliorated by reducing the activity of dPIP4K using a previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gupta et al., 2013</xref>) classical loss-of-function mutant allele in heterozygosis and a kinase dead allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

The compounds identified led to the development of NCT-504, a selective fully efficacious inhibitor of PIP4Kγ. NCT-504 treatment or knock-down of PIP4Kγ lowers huntingtin fragments Htt(exon1)-polyQ in multiple cell types including cortical and striatal neurons, and lowers full-length mutant huntingtin in patient fibroblasts and mouse striatal neurons. Moreover, genetic targeting of PIP4K in two Drosophila models of HD, mitigated associated HD phenotypes. Importantly, we observed two major changes in cells following PIP4Kγ inhibition, an increase in autophagic flux, and an increase in the levels of three phosphoinositide signaling lipids. It is tempting to speculate that the changes in PI upregulate autophagic flux, and thereby lower mHtt levels.</p><p>Little is currently known about cellular roles of PIP4Kγ. However, in line with our current findings, previous studies observed that knock-down of PIP4Kγ resulted in an increase in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mackey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vicinanza et al., 2015</xref>), and a reduction of EGFP-HttQ74 aggregates in MEFs that was dependent on the presence of the autophagy gene, ATG7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mackey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vicinanza et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>While increasing the proteolysis of pathogenic huntingtin protein via the upregulation of autophagy is an attractive therapeutic approach for HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin and Qin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>), there are potential challenges. Mutant huntingtin itself may alter autophagy. Wild-type huntingtin may be an adaptor for selected autophagic cargoes including itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, mutant huntingtin impairs the loading of ubiquitinated-tagged proteins into autophagosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010</xref>), and circumvents its own clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martin et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, mutant huntingtin sequesters diverse proteins required for key cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), including mTOR, which plays key roles in the regulation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Petersén A et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ravikumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pryor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashkenazi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Caviston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wong and Holzbaur, 2014</xref>). In addition, the PI binding autophagy adaptor protein ALFY which plays a fundamental role in degrading mutant huntingtin is down-regulated in HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Martin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Filimonenko et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast with these findings, there are studies that indicate that autophagy is not impaired in HD, and have revealed an elevation of autophagy flux in HD cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Petersén A et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kegel et al., 2000</xref>). Despite possible mutant huntingtin-dependent changes on autophagy, upregulation of autophagy remains a viable approach for lowering levels of mutant huntintin and aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lin and Qin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Sarkar et al., 2007</xref>). Note that caloric restriction also raises the basal level of autophagy, leading to improvements in HD models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Duan et al., 2003</xref>) and increasing axonal autophagosome transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ikenaka et al., 2013</xref>), although it is less clear how to translate this observation into clinical practice.</p><p>One common approach to induce autophagy is via inhibition of the major metabolic kinase mTORC1. Indeed, rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1 also reduces mHtt protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sarkar et al., 2009</xref>). However, while PIP4Kγ likely impacts mTORC1 activity, it is not yet clear whether PIP4Kγ inhibition results in mTORC1 inhibition or activation. One study showed that knock-down of PIP4K2C inhibits mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mackey et al., 2014</xref>). However, in PIP4K2C homozygous knock-out mice, mTORC1 is elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shim et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the precise link between PIP4Kγ and mTORC1 is not clear. Importantly, our data suggest that PIP4Kγ upregulation of autophagy has some differences with upregulation of autophagy via mTORC1 inhibition. While inhibition of mTOR via torin treatment exhibited a large increase in both autophagosome formation and autophagy flux, inhibition of PIP4Kγ had only a modest impact on autophagosome formation, but had a large increase in autophagic flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, elucidation of the mechanism whereby PIP4Kγ inhibition increases autophagic flux remains to be fully determined.</p><p>It is likely that inhibition of PIP4Kγ increases autophagic flux at least in part via the resulting impact on the levels of selected phosphoinositide lipids. PIP4Kγ is predicted to convert PI5P to PI(4,5)P2. However, it was not known which cellular pools of PI5P are substrates for PIP4Kγ. Using NCT-504 we found no significant change in PI5P levels or other PI lipids following up to two hours of inhibition of PIP4Kγ. This contrasts with other lipid kinases such as PIKfyve, where direct inhibition results in an acute loss of PI(3,5)P2 which can be observed within 5 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McCartney et al., 2014</xref>). The long delay prior to changes in PI5P following PIP4Kγ inhibition suggests that PIP4Kγ is not in contact with most of the cellular PI5P, or is only active under specific conditions. However, after 12 hr treatment with NCT-504, there was a 1.6 fold elevation of PI5P. The fact that this change occurred well after 2 hr of inhibition, suggests that it might not be directly due to an accumulation of the PI5P substrate normally used by PIP4Kγ. Indeed, at 12 hr PI(3,5)P2 levels were also elevated at 2-fold, which was even higher than the fold elevation in PI5P. This raises the possibility that long-term inhibition of PIP4Kγ indirectly results in the activation of PIKfyve. This activation of PIKfyve may account for the increase in PI5P as well as PI(3,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zolov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McCartney et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sbrissa et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, at 12 hr PI3P levels increased 1.3 fold, suggesting that VPS34 may be indirectly activated as well.</p><p>The elevation of PI3P, PI(3,5)P2 and/or PI5P likely contribute to the elevation in autophagic flux. PI3P has well characterized roles in autophagy, and acts in initiation of phagophore formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Shibutani and Yoshimori, 2014</xref>) as well as in later steps of autophagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carlsson and Simonsen, 2015</xref>), including autophagosome-lysosome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ikonomov et al., 2006</xref>) and lysosome reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). In some conditions, PI5P can induce autophagy independent of PI3P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Vicinanza et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, PI(3,5)P2 functions at a late step in autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ikonomov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">de Lartigue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ikonomov et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Martin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rusten et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sano et al., 2016</xref>). These late functions, may contribute to the observed increase in autophagic flux. In addition to these changes the statistically significant decrease in PI4P may also contribute to changes in autophagy. A reduction of PI4P has been postulated to be necessary for lysosome reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Yu et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The elevation of PI3P, PI(3,5)P2 and PI5P may also have a role in compensating potential mutant huntingtin-dependent changes in PI or masking of selected PI. Several studies have indicated that there are polyglutamine-dependent alterations in PI binding of huntingtin protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kegel et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kegel et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kegel et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, wild-type huntingtin binds phosphoinositide lipids including PI5P and PI(3,5)P2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kegel et al., 2009b</xref>). Notably, when assessed using unilamellar vesicles, huntingtin with a polyglutamine expansion bound these lipids even more tightly than wild-type hungtingtin, potentially reducing the free total levels of these lipids and impacting their downstream dependent signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kegel-Gleason, 2013</xref>). Masking of PI lipids could negatively and progressively impact the function of proteins involved in autophagosome cargo recognition and loading, especially those effector proteins dependent on low abundance PI, such as PI5P and PI(3,5)P2. Additional studies need to be carried out to determine the effectors proteins (Alfy and/or others) responsible for the action of PIP4Kγ modulation, the mechanism of action behind the high cellular alteration in PI(3,5)P2 as well as the modulation of other PI levels, and the impact of those changes on mTOR function and autophagy dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ikonomov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ikonomov et al., 2001</xref>). It has not escaped our attention that mHtt-dependent effects seem to be triggered by aging, which is known to limit the clearance of misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Komatsu et al., 2007</xref>), and deregulate phosphatidylinositide lipid signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Igwe and Filla, 1995</xref>).</p><p>The data presented in this manuscript demonstrates that pharmacological inhibition, or knock-down of PIP4Kγ produce a similar reduction in huntingtin levels, and a concomitant elevation of PI5P and PI(3,5)P2 and PI3P. These findings open the door to a new disease-modifying approach for this disorder and validate PIP4Kγ as a druggable target. In a recent report, a homozygous mouse knockout displayed no growth or behavioral abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shim et al., 2016</xref>). From the translational point of view, the development of selective PIP4Kγ inhibitors could be extraordinarily useful for other neurodegenerative diseases as well. Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease in particular are also mediated by the accumulation of toxic protein aggregates, whose catabolism by autophagy might rescue stressed neurons. Starvation increases life spans across species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Speakman and Hambly, 2007</xref>) and there are numerous diseases where upregulation of basal autophagy is beneficial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hara et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Seino et al., 2013</xref>).

For the FL-HTTQ200 a similar procedure was used, the animals were video recorded and data was processed using a custom designed analysis software (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref>), which allowed for calculating speed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Immortalized MEF wild-type and MEF Atg7 knock-out cells were a gift from Dr. Masaki Komatsu (Niigata University, Japan).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Inhibition of PIP4Kγ ameliorates the pathological effects of mutant huntingtin protein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Harry T Orr (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Leslie Thompson (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Note that while reviews found considerable merit in your study, there are major limitations that need to be addressed in order for <italic>eLife</italic> to consider your paper in the future. First, it is important that these studies be performed using a full-length Htt fly model. Second, it is also critical that your analysis include a dosing regime of the PIP4K compound. Should you choose to perform these studies and submit the new manuscript in the future, we will attempt to get some of the same reviewers.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study the investigators present a rather extensive body of work (and concise) in support of the concept that inhibition of the lipid kinase PIP4Kγ reduces levels of huntingtin and mitigates phenotypic effects of mutant Htt in a fly model, presumably via induction of autophagy. Building on their previous work, a novel PIP4K inhibitor and its ability to enhance autophagy in cells and reduce Htt levels in neurons are presented. Importantly they go on to show that in a fly model of mutant Htt pathology reduction of PIP4Kγ mitigates two disease-related phenotypes; retinal degeneration and a motor performance deficit. All in all the data are solid and present a strong basis for exploring further the therapeutic potential of targeting PIPK4γ.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript is describing the inhibition of PIP4Kγ as a potential therapeutic target in Huntington's disease by the triggering of autophagy to clear huntingtin protein, in what they refer to as a druggable target.</p><p>This small molecule lead, NCT-504, is important because it appears to trigger the degradation of huntingtin, and thus falls into the hypotheses of therapies for HD designed to _specifically_ reduce or eliminate huntingtin protein in Huntington's disease, which include AAV siRNAs, and anti-sense oligonucleotides, which are either pending or are in clinical trials currently. The concept behind this study was driven by mouse exon1 model work that implies that increasing the rate of autophagy may be beneficial for neurodegeneration in HD.</p><p>The manuscript has some solid data, but is confusing to follow in that they go back and forth from small fragment over expression models, in which 3% of the mutant huntingtin ORF with synthetic allele is over expressed at massive levels to induce the formation of aggregates, to data from human HD fibroblasts, which is arguably the most exciting data in this work. The only assay of pathological effects comes from an outdated fly fragment model.</p><p>The overall picture seems exciting but the details in the data are not as clear as the writing would suggest. In many of the figures and assays, they only look at mutant HD cells, and not fibroblasts from unaffected individuals, and most of the readouts are only looking at one protein, while the proposed mechanism is to switch on autophagy in general. Autophagy, and its sub-categories of mitophagy, micro-autophagy, macro-autophagy, pexophagy are all dynamic system in a high rate of constant flux in the cell. If this is truly a drug lead for Huntington's disease, or any disease, they need to show some selectivity in the effected state and in the target. It seems that even in their loading controls, there is a massive global effect of shutting down PIP4Kγ either by SiRNA or global inhibitor. In other words, autophagy in all its forms is in dynamic flux for a reason, and just pushing it in one direction may be as problematic and inhibiting it.</p><p>I have an conceptual concern that this data suggest that 97% of the huntingtin ORF is irrelevant for regulating the turnover of this protein by autophagic mechanisms, and it appears from this data that the molar stoichiometry is irrelevant, as whether they look at endogenous huntingtin proteins, or massively over-expressed small molecule fragments at orders of magnitude above physiological molarity, the compound works just as well to clear 'huntingtin', and likely everything else.</p><p>My major concern is that I believe they have proven that PIP4K γ inhibition triggers a massive level of autophagy, but they have no data here that show any selectivity or health effects on the fibroblasts. Is this &quot;curing dandruff by decapitation&quot;? They reference a manuscript on a PIP4Kγ knockout mouse stating the investigators observed &quot;no growth or behavioral abnormalities&quot;, except the manuscript actually describes a massive global hyperactivation of the immune systems in those knockouts, and the true validation of a drug target would be a conditional knockout. For what it's worth, Broad's Exac exomic sequencing database shows no homozygous null alleles of PIP4Kγ yet in humans. Thus, I have concerns that PIP4K γ inhibition could really be a drug target.</p><p>They do not state exactly how their HD fibroblasts are immortalized, but is seems that there is no difference in effect between HEK293, STHdHQ111, HD primary cells, or HD immortalized cells. This is rather surprising since the only known inducer of huntingtin expression is P53, and some of those lines have P53, and others do not. This has been a concern that has been ignored in most HD cell lines studies, despite over 80 manuscripts published consistently defining disrupted P53 biology in HD, from mouse to humans. So whether they have p53 or not, whether small fragments of full protein, everything gets cleared, in all lines.</p><p>Major concerns</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref></p><p>From the high throughput screen, they found NCT-504 and by the structure guessed that it was a kinase inhibitor, and tested this by kinomic screening, and used a cutoff of &gt;65% inhibition to claim specificity. This is a very high cutoff, and the entire kinome screening data should be included a supplemental, not just 3/442 kinases. From my experience with pharma, even 20% inhibition is cause for concern on these screens. The IC50 is about 16μM for NCT-504. This is very high, and by their own data, the IC50 exceeds the toxicity threshold concentration in neurons.</p><p>The concentrations of NCT-504 used for effects vary hugely across the figures. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and from text, IC50 is quoted at 15.8μM. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>μM is used to reduce aggregation by 50% effect, so whatever reason they see effect, it seems to be unlikely through PIP4Kγ inhibition.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: concentration of NCT-504 is now 10μM, less than the IC50, and only one dose tested.</p><p>The loading controls seem to switch between α-tubulin, actin and GAPDH. For these studies looking at autophagic flux, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> they need better controls, not an insoluble polymer of actin. I'd like to see GAPDH and at least two inner mitochondrial proteins to show me the cells are not just completely autophagic or apoptotic. Images are essential.</p><p>Again, for Figure, 4, now 2μM of NCT-504 is used again in Q68 cells, but then 10μM in Q45 cells. This is plus or minus 500%.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: they need to show the whole blot in a supplemental figure. I see a severe hit on actin levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> with PIP4K2C_si, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> with 10μM NCT-504, which concerns me that these cells might be heavily auto-degrading or just dead.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, they show a very unconventional assay for neuronal toxicity, in that they are no showing any images of neurons or other measure of health, or even life, but their own data shows a pretty severe &quot;toxicity&quot; at 10μM NCT-504, the exact concentration used in HD fibroblasts, and still below their calculated IC50.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>, that western blot is not appropriate data to conclude anything.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. They now switched back to a severe allele Q128 (extremely rare) and only small fragment 1-231. Why did they not use full huntingtin?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a very well written manuscript that describes strong data showing that PIP4K γ inhibition, either pharmacologically or through KD, causes reduction of levels of soluble HTT. In cases where aggregation or formation of HMW species are observed, PIP4K reduction also reduces these aggregated species as well. The authors used several different cell lines ranging from immortalized lines to primary neurons or human fibroblasts (N2a, stHDHq111, human fibroblasts, primary neurons). Experiments are elegant, well described and well controlled, with helpful supplemental data, such as the KD efficiency of the RNAis and kinetics of the phosphatidylinositide changes with treatment. There are a few minor concerns:</p><p>1) How was NCT-504 selected for these studies from published the high-throughput screen? Was this best hit? Because of the complexity of these pathways, it would be helpful to have a schematic early on to show the various components of the pathway, how each of the PIP derivatives are generated and where this kinase fits into general scheme.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> - Why not show more complete set of westerns as in C and D? Need quantification for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>3) Do the fibroblasts have HMW species? This is not mentioned and if they are present, why they are not included should be addressed.</p><p>4) A potentially important experiment would be using a pulse chase or other such assay to measure whether this truly increases degradation of the protein.</p><p>5) Please describe length of HTT fragment in the 128Q HTT transgene in flies.</p><p>6) A citation should be included for the Neuron paper from the Davidson lab when discussing Rhes and Rheb.</p><p>7) It is a stretch to say that compound modulates HTT proteolysis as there is a single Western blot with one panel.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Inhibition of PIP4Kγ ameliorates the pathological effects of mutant huntingtin protein&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

While one reviewer is concerned with the extent to which these findings might apply to a mammalian model of HD, it was noted by other reviewers that their use of primary cortical neurons from mice provides strong evidence of the biological relevance of this compound and pathway beyond its heavy use of fly HD models.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>It is critical that the authors pay close attention to and respond accordingly to reviewers 1 and 2 concerns that the strength of this manuscript is decreased considerably by the style/manner in which it is written. Extensive editing to the text and figures are needed so that the manuscript flows smoother and rationale for the studies are clearer.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this new submission of a previously submitted manuscript the ability of a small molecule to inhibit PIP4Kγ and impact HD-like phenotypes in cellular and animal models expressing mutant Htt (full-length and fragment) is presented. Overall while this work addresses a very interesting issue and additional data using a FL-Htt fly model have been added, it remains difficult to read/follow in several key places.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>Overall the manuscript remains hard to read, needing English editing in many places.</p><p>In several places statements are not referenced when they should be. For example, second paragraph of Results – &quot;Similar discrepancies in potency […]&quot; needs to be referenced.</p><p>Clarity of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> would be improved by including concentrations of compounds used within body of the figure and not just in the legend.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is a revised manuscript and the authors were very responsive to the reviewers.</p><p>The work described identifies PIP4Kγ as a therapeutic target for HD and shows that pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme promotes mutant HTT degradation and autophagy. They provide in vivo evidence that lower the levels of PIP4Kγ is beneficial in a fly model of HD-retinal assays and motor performance. This is a promising direction to pursue as a possible therapy for HD and is in line with current treatments directed at lowering mHTT protein levels. Generally the quality of the data is strong. Minor points are that there are a number of formatting typos. Also the figures are not very consistent. Formatting is varied-different fonts, different graphing and repetitive information in legend and graphs.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript describes the effect of inhibition of the PIP4Kγ in models of Huntington's disease. There is extensive description of the effect of the drug on lipid metabolism and autophagy. There are also data from cell models including HD fibroblasts. The reduction of Htt levels is of interest. However effects on Htt aggregates are difficult to interpret since aggregates may be toxic or protective. There is also an interesting effect on an HD <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. It would be beneficial if the investigators had some more substantial data on models more directly relevant to HD pathogenesis. For instance instead of using HD fibroblasts it would be beneficial to use HD iPS cell models. In addition, there are no data from HD mouse models. The processes of autophagy are cell type specific, and may be different in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian systems, so in vivo data from mice rather than flies would be advantageous.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29123.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Note that while reviews found considerable merit in your study, there are major limitations that need to be addressed in order for eLife to consider your paper in the future.

This model allowed us to quickly screen libraries for compounds that could modulate the levels of NT-mHtt fragment. A similar approach would have been impractical in other cell models including the human HD fibroblasts. Once we identified NCT-504 as a potential target in the primary screen, we proceeded to the validation of the compound as well as its putative target (PIP4Kγ) in more physiologically relevant models, because we completely agree with the reviewer that these models are better suited for understanding mHtt biology. Given the consistency we observe between the fragment models and the full length human patient fibroblasts or mouse STHdh<sup>Q111</sup> we think that the screening strategy is validated. Although currently not a feasible option, in future studies we are aiming at performing these protein levels screens in the HD patient fibroblasts.</p><p>With regard to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, we have followed the reviewers’ advice by evaluating the effect of PIP4K loss of function in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model expressing full length Htt with 200 glutamines (new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We now include data using full length Htt-poly-Q, obtaining similar results and indicating that silencing of the gene or elimination of a single allele ameliorates the neurodegeneration and loss in motor skills. There are numerous published studies by us and others using <italic>Drosophila</italic> models (PMID: 18184562, 18184562) and mouse models (PMID: 24052178) of Huntington disease expressing full length huntingtin poly-Q or just the N-terminal exon 1 fragment. Comparing the phenotype of the disease in both models, exon 1 Htt-poly-Q models tend to be more severe with an earlier onset and therefore more difficult to recover from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The overall picture seems exciting, but the details in the data are not as clear as the writing would suggest. In many of the figures and assays, they only look at mutant HD cells, and not fibroblasts from unaffected individuals,</p></disp-quote><p>It is difficult to quantify levels of Htt protein in wildtype fibroblasts because they express very low levels of protein and in general in this cell line the mutant protein does not accumulate much. Recently we found that HEK293 cells have quite high levels of wildtype Htt protein. We have produced a stable HEK293 cell line transfected with LC3-GFP-mCherry. We now have included in our manuscript results from this cell line of NCT-504’s effect on autophagosome formation, autophagy flux and Htt level in dose response and in a time dependent manner. Indeed modulation of autophagy and reduction of wildtype Htt levels can be observed in HEK293, indicating a biological effect upon inhibiting PIP4Kγ in a context outside of HD. Other potential effects of inhibiting PIP4Kγ on unaffected individuals are commented on by Lewis Cantley in their PIP4Kγ knockout mouse (and referenced in our paper) where the only observable effect is the activation of the immune system. Additionally we have included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> data showing that decreasing PIP4K activity using a heterozygous loss of function (lof) or a neuronal expressed dominant negative (DN) does not cause neuronal dysfunction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> measured as motor performance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and most of the readouts are only looking at one protein, while the proposed mechanism is to switch on autophagy in general.

In other words, autophagy in all its forms is in dynamic flux for a reason, and just pushing it in one direction may be as problematic and inhibiting it.</p></disp-quote><p>As we note in the manuscript, numerous authors have described mutant Htt-dependent autophagy dysregulation in Huntington’s disease (HD). Especially important are several studies describing severe deficits in productive autophagy in HD cells and an inability to load mHtt and aggregates into autophagosome vesicles. Our data show that inhibition of PIP4Kγ increases productive autophagy of mHtt and aggregates. In the discussion we hypothesize that this is due to the observed shift in PI’s, which seem to promote the loading of mHtt and aggregates. In addition, this shift also upregulates autophagy flux, which might potentially increase the proteolytic rate of other ubiquitinated proteins tagged for elimination by autophagy, as well as damaged mitochondria (mitophagy is impaired in HD) and other cell damaged organelles. The impact of shifting autophagy dynamics can be insult-dependent and has to be evaluated in relevant disease models. Indeed upregulation of autophagy can prevent or promote apoptosis, depending of the cell model and its capacity to respond to stress. In previous KO mouse studies by Lewis Cantley, PIP4Kγ-dependent upregulation does not seem to have a major biological impact in viability or behavioral dysregulation, with no observable phenotype other than hyperactivation of some T cell populations, which it seem to be controllable by rapamycin. In the context of HD, levels of mHtt are elevated not only in striatal neurons, but also many other cell types, and numerous authors have described non-neuronal Huntington impairments, and therefore a global reduction of mHtt is perceived to be beneficial, as has been demonstrated with other autophagy modulators. Indeed our in vivo models indicate that this is the case, with an amelioration of the disease progression. Moreover this benefit of inhibiting PIP4Kγ is titrated by elimination of a single allele. Further dose dependent efficacy studies with a fully optimized PIP4Kγ inhibitor will be necessary to determine the adequate dose, schedule and potential side effects of this novel mechanism.</p><p>We have performed titration curves for NCT-504 in the Q45 patient fibroblasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, NCT-504 is not toxic until we reach the 10μM concentration, at which it does cause cell loss. We do see a significant effect on mHtt levels at 5μM. Thus we are able to reduce mHtt levels in non-toxic conditions.</p><p>We have also assessed the effect of the heterozygous PIP4K<sup>LOF</sup> as well as the new PIP4K<sup>DN</sup> allele on motor performance on their own in the absence of mHtt.

As discussed above, now we have added new data using a FLQ200 <italic>Drosophila</italic> model showing similar results, with amelioration of the decline in motor performance. Our studies in the mechanism of action indicate an increase in autophagy flux, which is impaired both by expression of NT Htt-poly-Q and by expression of FL Htt-poly-Q. Our control proteins indicate that this mechanism does not clear everything else, but eliminate specific insults in Huntington cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My major concern is that I believe they have proven that PIP4K γ inhibition triggers a massive level of autophagy, but they have no data here that show any selectivity or health effects on the fibroblasts. Is this &quot;curing dandruff by decapitation&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the interpretation that PIP4K γ inhibition triggers a massive level of autophagy. Instead PIP4K γ inhibition seems to elevate productive autophagy of mHtt and fragments, ameliorating disease progression.</p><p>Autophagy is a continuous and dynamic process carried out by cells to eliminate properly tagged proteins and organelles, by polyubiquitination (macrophagy, mitophagy) or KFERQ-like sequences (chaperone-mediated autophagy). The basal level of autophagy depends of stimulation by environmental stressors but also by intracellular factors such as genetic stressors, lysosomal homeostasis and level of energy production. Elevating the basal level of productive autophagy does not have to be necessarily detrimental for the cell in general and even less in HD, as productive autophagy is downregulated by the expression of mHtt and its fragments. Indeed, our siRNA experiments across cell lines show that elimination of the PIP4Kγ kinase activity does not induce cell death. This is further corroborated by the viability of full knockout animals with no growth or behavioral abnormalities. Furthermore any theoretical risk could be further modulated using the right dose and schedule of a PIP4Kγ small molecule inhibitor.</p><p>It is not clear for us how to assess the potential health benefit on fibroblasts, besides analyzing the reduction of the accumulated insult and the effect on cell viability. Therapeutically, any intervention is a balance between potential benefits and adverse effects which need to be carefully evaluated in relevant disease models (cell and animals if available) and eventually in human clinical trials. We believe that our data demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of this mechanism in relevant models of HD.</p><p>As detailed above, analysis of toxicity by dose titration in cells indicates that we are causing mHtt decrease at a non-toxic concentration. Furthermore decreasing <italic>PIP4K</italic> levels or activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> does not cause any visible toxic effect in our assays. This is consistent with results in mouse models. Overall we believe the PIP4Kγ is a very safe target, and any toxicity that maybe observed with the NCT-504 is likely due to side effects not related to PIP4Kγ inhibition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They reference a manuscript on a PIP4Kγ knockout mouse stating the investigators observed &quot;no growth or behavioral abnormalities&quot;, except the manuscript actually describes a massive global hyperactivation of the immune systems in those knockouts, and the true validation of a drug target would be a conditional knockout. For what it's worth, Broad's Exac exomic sequencing database shows no homozygous null alleles of PIP4Kγ yet in humans. Thus, I have concerns that PIP4Kγ inhibition could really be a drug target.</p></disp-quote><p>Lewis Cantley et al. in their description of the phenotype of PIP4Kγ knockout mouse also mentioned a population of human subjects carrying polymorphisms at PIP4K2C locus linked with familial autoimmunity. Additionally these authors described the hyper-activation of the immune system in the null PIP4Kγ mouse, which they are able to correct using the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin, a well-accepted upregulator of autophagy initiation which is also able to ameliorate in vivo the HD phenotype, demonstrating that the autophagy-modulating effect of inhibiting PIP4Kγ is distinct from inhibition of mTOR. Importantly in our HD <italic>Drosophila</italic> models, we demonstrated a potential therapeutic benefit upon decreasing dPIP4K activity, indicating that a partial modulation of PIP4Kγ activity might be enough for observing a beneficial effect. Dose dependent efficacy studies with the HD animal models and eventually in HD patients with a fully optimized PIP4Kγ inhibitor will be necessary for determining the percentage of PIP4Kγ-inhibition and the schedule needed to minimize any potential immune side effects while maximizing the therapeutic benefit from mHtt elimination. Furthermore, the potential secondary effects of PIP4Kγ inhibitors such as a risk of hyper-activation of the immune system could be different in mHtt-carrying HD-patients (migration of primary microglia seems to be impaired by mHtt expression PMID: 27615381) that in wt HD-patients or in population carrying specific SNP’s at the PIP4K2C locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>They do not state exactly how their HD fibroblasts are immortalized, but is seems that there is no difference in effect between HEK293, STHdHQ111, HD primary cells, or HD immortalized cells. This is rather surprising since the only known inducer of huntingtin expression is P53, and some of those lines have P53, and others do not. This has been a concern that has been ignored in most HD cell lines studies, despite over 80 manuscripts published consistently defining disrupted P53 biology in HD, from mouse to humans.

This is a very high cutoff, and the entire kinome screening data should be included a supplemental, not just 3/442 kinases. From my experience with pharma, even 20% inhibition is cause for concern on these screens. The IC50 is about 16μM for NCT-504. This is very high, and by their own data, the IC50 exceeds the toxicity threshold concentration in neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We did include the entire kinome screening data as Table 1 – Source data 1, and apologize if it was not available by the reviewer somehow. It can be observed that at 10 μM NCT-504 only PIP4Kγ is robustly inhibited, with little or no effect in the rest of the 442 kinases in the panel, as might be expected for a non-competitive allosteric inhibitor.</p><p>Regarding the IC50 of NCT-504, we explained in the manuscript the differences in IC50’s obtained using several in vitro kinase assays. While the IC50 using isolated PIP4Kγ was 15.8 μM, the IC50 using DiscoverX binding assay was 350 nM. As a screening center, we are very familiar with these kind of discrepancies between biochemical assays, and in the manuscript refer to other authors describing similar problems with allosteric modulators. The main reason behind these discrepancies has to do with the assay conditions used for evaluating inhibition of isolated kinases, usually requiring extraordinary high levels of ATP in order to promote autophosphorylaton and activation and the need for using micelles or detergents to stabilize the active conformation of the kinase, something especially important for lipid kinases such as PIP4Kγ. In general, for these kind of kinases, the DiscoverX binding assay using <italic>E. coli</italic> or mammalian cell-expressed kinases labeled with DNA tag for qPCR readout, seems to more faithfully reproduce the activity of the kinase in its natural environment. Importantly, in order to properly evaluate the real PIP4Kγ inhibitory capacity of NCT-504 in a cell environment we measure its dose dependent modulation PI5P levels (and other PI’s), using siRNA as a control of the maximal elevation obtained upon elimination of the activity of PIP4Kγ. These measurements in cells clearly indicate that the concentration used in the cell assays to evaluate effects on mHtt and aggregates robustly inhibits PIP4Kγ and that blocking the activity of this kinase does not reduce cell viability. All the data reported in the original manuscript was carried out at non-toxic concentration of NCT-504 in the same cells. Now we have incorporated additional dose-response and viability in different cell lines and end points (PI’s levels, autophagy, mHtt levels, viability, etc.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The concentrations of NCT-504 used for effects vary hugely across the figures.

We previously indicated that the concentration of NCT-504 able to induce a robust effect is cell type dependent, as would be expected for a modulator of autophagy.

We use in these cell 10μm as we want to observed a robust effect on PI’s modulation at a non-toxic dose for comparison with the shRNA data.

There is extensive description of the effect of the drug on lipid metabolism and autophagy. There are also data from cell models including HD fibroblasts. The reduction of Htt levels is of interest. However effects on Htt aggregates are difficult to interpret since aggregates may be toxic or protective. There is also an interesting effect on an HD Drosophila model. It would be beneficial if the investigators had some more substantial data on models more directly relevant to HD pathogenesis. For instance instead of using HD fibroblasts it would be beneficial to use HD iPS cell models. In addition, there are no data from HD mouse models. The processes of autophagy are cell type specific, and may be different in Drosophila and mammalian systems, so in vivo data from mice rather than flies would be advantageous.</p></disp-quote><p>These comments, while very relevant, are outside the scope of the paper focused in the validation of PIP4kγ as a target for Huntington’s disease.
