(HpARI1 and HpARI2) or enhancing (HpARI3) responses to the cytokine. We previously showed that HpARI2 also bound to DNA via its first complement control protein (CCP1) domain. Here, we find that HpARI1 can also bind DNA, while HpARI3 cannot. Through the production of HpARI2/HpARI3 CCP1 domain-swapped chimeras, DNA-binding ability can be transferred, and correlates with in vivo half-life of administered proteins. We found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) also binds to the extracellular matrix component heparan sulphate (HS), and structural modelling showed a basic charged patch in the CCP1 domain of HpARI1 and HpARI2 (but not HpARI3) which could facilitate these interactions. Finally, a mutant of HpARI2 was produced which lacked DNA and HS binding, and was also shown to have a short half-life in vivo. Therefore, we propose that during infection the suppressive HpARI1 and HpARI2 proteins have long-lasting effects at the site of deposition due to DNA and/or extracellular matrix interactions, while HpARI3 has a shorter half-life due to a lack of these interactions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Heligmosoides polygyrus bakeri</italic></kwd><kwd>IL-33</kwd><kwd>heparan sulphate</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010269</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/221914</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McSorley</surname><given-names>Henry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014780</institution-id><institution>Longfonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Accelerate as part of the AWWA project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McSorley</surname><given-names>Henry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007155</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/S000593/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McSorley</surname><given-names>Henry J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

It can act as a potent inducer of type 2 immune responses, and genetic studies show a strong link between the IL-33 pathway and the risk of developing allergic asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Moffatt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Oboki et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, IL-33 responses are important for induction of anti-parasite type 2 immune responses in helminth infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McSorley and Smyth, 2021</xref>). Conversely, IL-33 is a potent inducer of IFN-Î³ and regulatory T cell responses, dependent on the cytokineâs context, cytokine release mode, and the cell responding to the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonilla et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Schiering et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, IL-33 can have pro-allergic, pro-inflammatory, or anti-inflammatory activities, and modulation of IL-33 responses can have a range of effects.</p><p>Parasitic helminths secrete an array of immunomodulatory proteins which tailor the host immune response to allow parasite persistence without immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Maizels et al., 2018</xref>). Our previous work identified the HpARI protein family, secreted by the murine intestinal nematode <italic>Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri</italic>. Each member of the HpARI family consists of three complement control protein domains, CCP1-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>). Our initial characterisation of the HpARI protein (later renamed HpARI2) showed that it bound directly to IL-33, inhibiting the interaction between IL-33 and its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>). Our recent structural characterisation of the HpARI2:IL-33 complex showed that HpARI2 binds IL-33 via interactions between the cytokine and the CCP2 and CCP3 domains of HpARI2. In particular, a long loop in CCP3 contacts IL-33 at a site which overlaps with the IL-33:ST2 binding site, thus inhibiting cytokine-receptor interactions to effectively block the cytokine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jamwal et al., 2023</xref>). However, the CCP1 domain was not characterised in this structure.</p><p>We previously showed that HpARI2 can interact with DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner, via its CCP1 domain. Truncations of HpARI2 which lack CCP1 cannot bind to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>), while HpARI2 truncations lacking the CCP3 domain can still bind to IL-33 (albeit with lower affinity), but cannot block interactions between IL-33 and its receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">ChauchÃ© et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Jamwal et al., 2023</xref>). Thus, through CCP1-DNA and CCP2/3-IL-33 interactions, HpARI2 binds to genomic DNA and IL-33 within the nucleus of necrotic epithelial cells, tethering the cytokine and preventing its release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>). Characterisation of the other members of the HpARI family showed that HpARI1, like HpARI2, blocked responses to IL-33. HpARI3, however, bound to IL-33 but did not block interaction of IL-33 with its receptor. Instead HpARI3 stabilised IL-33, amplifying responses to the cytokine in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colomb et al., 2024</xref>). Thus, <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> produces a family of structurally similar HpARI molecules with opposing physiological effects.</p><p>Here, we investigated the role of the CCP1 domain of the HpARI proteins, and found that HpARI1 and HpARI2 can also bind to heparan sulphate (HS) via their CCP1 domain, while HpARI3 cannot. This extracellular matrix binding extends the half-life of HpARI2 in vivo at the site of administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HpARI1 and HpARI2 bind to DNA, while HpARI3 does not</title><p>HpARI2 was previously shown to tether IL-33 in necrotic cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>). Using a short-term in vivo model of IL-33 release, we co-administered HpARI1, HpARI2, or HpARI3 with Alternaria allergen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and assessed IL-33 release. As shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>), due to interaction between the HpARIs and IL-33, released IL-33 could not be detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the presence of HpARIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, denaturing western blots dissociated the HpARI-IL-33 complex and allowed measurement of released IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). As shown previously, HpARI2 suppressed the release of IL-33 measured by western blot, due to its tethering function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>). HpARI1 showed a similar trend which did not reach statistical significance in this experiment. HpARI3 lacked this ability and did not alter the levels of released IL-33 as assessed by western blot. We therefore measured the ability of the HpARIs to bind to DNA (as a correlate of the tethering function of these proteins) using an electromobility shift assay (EMSA) to measure formation of DNA-protein complexes via altered polyacrylamide gel migration of short DNA oligonucleotides. HpARI1 and HpARI2 both caused altered migration of DNA probes, indicating binding to DNA, while HpARI3 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, while HpARI2 effectively bound all DNA, HpARI1 showed a reduced DNA-binding ability, only binding 50% of the DNA in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HpARI family members have differing effects against IL-33 release.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup for <bold>B</bold> and <bold>C</bold>.

In EMSA experiments, these constructs showed DNA binding directly related to the source of their CCP1 domain, with HpARI3:2 lacking, and HpARI2:3 showing DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Therefore, members of the HpARI family differ in their ability to bind both IL-33 and DNA, the latter of which is mediated solely by the CCP1 domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>HpARI fusion proteins show unexpected effects on IL-33 responses in vivo</title><p>The HpARI2:3 and HpARI3:2 fusion proteins represent useful tools to separate the DNA binding and IL-33 modulation effects of HpARI2 and HpARI3, respectively.

As expected, HpARI2 and HpARI2:3 tethered IL-33 and reduced its release, due to their combination of IL-33 and DNA-binding activities. HpARI3 and HpARI3:2 lack tethering ability, and slightly increased levels of IL-33 in BAL, possibly due to binding and stabilisation of the soluble cytokine in the absence of DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Unexpectedly, when the downstream response to released IL-33 was measured 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), IL-33 tethering did not correlate with suppression of IL-33-induced responses: while HpARI2 suppressed and HpARI3 amplified eosinophilia, ILC2 activation (as measured by surface CD25 or cell size by median FSC), and IL-5 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâH</xref>), HpARI2:3 could not suppress IL-33 responses despite tethering of IL-33 at the 15 min timepoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In fact, HpARI2:3 amplified IL-33-dependent responses similarly to HpARI3, and tended to have increased activity compared to the HpARI3 wild-type protein. Similarly, despite a lack of IL-33 tethering, HpARI3:2 was capable of effectively blocking IL-33-dependent responses similarly to HpARI2 wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2DâH</xref>). Therefore, these data indicated that our model of DNA tethering of IL-33 by HpARI2 could not fully explain the activity of these proteins.</p><p>We hypothesised that the altered activity of the fusion proteins could be due to their effective half-life in vivo. We administered HpARI2 or HpARI3:2 either 1 day, 3 days, or 7 days prior to Alternaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and found that while HpARI2 could suppress Alternaria-induced eosinophilia and ILC2 responses when administered 3 days prior to allergen, HpARI3:2 could only replicate this suppression when administered 24 hr prior to Alternaria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3BâE</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Therefore, the in vivo half-life of HpARI2 is controlled by the CCP1 domain, and the HpARI3 CCP1 domain confers a shorter in vivo half-life than the HpARI2 counterpart. As extracellular DNA is only present in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) at very low concentrations at homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Curren et al., 2023</xref>), and is released in response to stimuli such as Alternaria, we hypothesised that the HpARI2 CCP1 could have a second binding partner which mediates its long in vivo half-life. As other host and pathogen CCP domain proteins have been demonstrated to interact with extracellular matrix constituents such as HS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mark et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>), we hypothesised that this could be the case for the HpARIs also.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>HpARI fusion proteins show CCP1 domain determines half-life in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental setup for BâE.

For instance, the TGF-Î² mimic Hp-TGM binds to the mammalian TGF-Î² receptor as well as cell surface co-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Johnston et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Dinther et al., 2023</xref>). There is a family of 10 Hp-TGM proteins (Hp-TGM1-10) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Smyth et al., 2018</xref>) which have distinct activities: HpTGM-1 is an agonist of the TGF-Î² receptor and uses CD44 as a co-receptor, directing its activity to CD44-positive immune cells such as CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, resulting in regulatory T cell induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">van Dinther et al., 2023</xref>). Conversely, in a recent pre-print the related protein Hp-TGM6 was shown to be a TGF-Î² receptor antagonist which is particularly active on fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">White et al., 2023</xref>), blocking TGF-Î² signalling. Thus the prototypic Hp-TGM sequence has undergone selection to carry out a range of contradictory functions. Similarly, here we describe the effects of the HpARI family and find that HpARI1 and HpARI2 bind HS and suppress IL-33 responses, while HpARI3 does not bind HS, and amplifies IL-33 responses. As the Hp-TGM proteins are targeted to different cellular targets through co-receptor interactions, we propose that the activity of the HpARIs is controlled by timing of release, in vivo half-life, and localisation within the host, controlled by interactions with the extracellular matrix.</p><p>We show here that HpARI1 and HpARI2 have a positively charged patch in their CCP1 domain. In the case of HpARI2, we show that this charged patch lengthens the effective half-life of the protein in vivo via binding to DNA and, more relevantly, HS. We propose that this binding to the extracellular matrix and cell surface proteoglycans prevents diffusion of HpARI1 and HpARI2, keeps the local concentration high, and prevents loss of protein to the circulation. This makes HpARI2 a particularly effective IL-33 suppressor when compared to a systemically administered monoclonal antibody which must reach an effective concentration throughout the circulation of the host to allow blockade at the site of IL-33 release. Some cytokines and chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ridley et al., 2023</xref>) bind to the extracellular matrix to ensure their effects are constrained to the local milieu. This is critical for their activity: it was recently shown that abrogating the HS-binding activity of IFN-Î³ results in fatal systemic (rather than local) inflammation after viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kemna et al., 2023</xref>). This approach of retaining proteins on the extracellular matrix is being developed for increasing the efficacy of protein-based therapeutics, while decreasing toxicity at off-target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alshoubaki et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Martino et al., 2014</xref>). This was exemplified in a study showing that heparin binding was able to prolong the blocking of VEGF signalling by recombinant VEGFR1 in therapeutic use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Xin et al., 2021</xref>). It appears that this same technique has been evolved by parasitic helminths to localise immunomodulatory proteins. HS binding has been demonstrated for several other CCP domain proteins, including the viral CCP protein Kaposiâs sarcoma-associated herpesvirus complement control protein (KCP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Mark et al., 2006</xref>), and the mammalian proteins Factor H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2008</xref>) and C4BP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Spijkers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Trouw et al., 2005</xref>). In C4BP, the protein presents a basic patch which is able to bind both DNA and HS, similarly to the data we show here for HpARI1 and HpARI2.</p><p>While HpARI1 binds to DNA and HS, it has lower affinity for these ligands compared to HpARI2, and in the DNA-binding assays only bound to 50% of the total DNA. It is unclear what the purpose is of this reduced binding affinity, but it could be that HpARI1 remains partially in solution, diffusing further from the site of deposition than HpARI2, and so mediating its effects at a greater distance from the site of release.</p><p>In this context, it is interesting that HpARI3 does not bind HS, while having the opposite effect on IL-33 as compared to HpARI2. The effects of IL-33 are highly contingent on the context of IL-33 release, and the cell type and tissue that it is acting on. In parasitic infection, IL-33 released by epithelial cells in the intestine induces a type 2 immune response which results in parasite ejection. In the same helminth infection model, IL-33 released by myeloid cells induced regulatory T cell expansion, suppressing effector immune responses and resulting in increased parasite burdens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hung et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, at different sites and in different cells, IL-33 can have directly opposing effects.</p><p>In the context of the findings outlined here, we propose the following model for the HpARI familyâs effects: HpARI2 binds strongly to the extracellular matrix, and is retained in the local milieu of the parasite where it blocks IL-33 released in response to infection. HpARI1 binds less strongly to HS, and therefore may diffuse slightly further from the site of deposition, to block more distant IL-33 responses. Finally, HpARI3 lacks HS binding and so diffuses freely to amplify IL-33 responses at distal sites, which we hypothesise could amplify IL-33-dependent regulatory responses. To investigate these hypotheses, transgenic parasites deficient for individual HpARI proteins would be useful, however this has proved intractable for parasitic nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Quinzo et al., 2022</xref>), and has not been achieved in <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> to date.</p><p>The findings outlined here may be applicable beyond <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic>, as it appears likely that other parasitic helminths have used extracellular matrix binding as a technique to retain immunoregulators within the local milieu. Indeed, <italic>Trichuris muris</italic>, another intestinal nematode, secretes the immunoregulatory protein p43. This protein binds and blocks IL-13, but also has HS-binding activity which has been proposed to tether p43 to the extracellular matrix, increasing survival of the protein at the site of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bancroft et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>H. polygyrus bakeri</italic> has developed a series of immunomodulatory protein families, including 10 Hp-TGMs and 2 HpBARIs, therefore it will be informative to investigate whether members of these families also bind to the extracellular matrix, and whether this alters their in vivo localisation and/or half-life.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe a novel HS-binding ability of members of the HpARI family and show that this binding increases their in vivo half-life and activity at the site of deposition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Expression and purification of HpARI proteins and mutants</title><p>Proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">ChauchÃ© et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Osbourn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Vacca et al., 2020</xref>).

All ITC experiments were performed on Microcal PEAQ-ITC (Malvern) and Microcal PEAQ-ITC analysis software was used for data analysis. Direct titration of proteins was done individually against HS tetrasaccharide (HS4) (Iduron, UK) reconstituted in SEC buffer. Typical titration was carried over 20 injections with an initial injection of 0.4 Âµl followed by 19 injections of 2 Âµl of 2 mM HS tetrasaccharide into protein solution inside the cell, stirring at 750 rpm at room temperature. All titrations were done twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical data were analysed using GraphPad Prism v10.0.0.

With our revised findings we can now state definitively that HpARI1 has a lower affinity for HS compared to HpARI2, and in each of our assays (EMSA (Fig 1D-E), size exclusion chromatography (Fig 4A), HS-bead pull-down (Fig 4B), lung cell surface binding (Fig 4C) and ITC (Fig 4D)) HpARI1 always shows a weaker response compared to HpARI2. We hypothesise that HpARI1 binds more weakly to DNA/HS to allow it to diffuse further from the site of deposition, but we have yet to demonstrate this during infection.
