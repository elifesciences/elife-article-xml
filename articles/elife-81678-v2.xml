Cas7-11 encodes a single polypeptide containing four Cas7- and one Cas11-like segments that obscures the distinction between the multi-subunit Class 1 and the single-subunit Class-2 CRISPR Cas systems. We report a cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) structure of the active Cas7-11 from <italic>Desulfonema ishimotonii</italic> (DiCas7-11) that reveals the molecular basis for RNA processing and interference activities. DiCas7-11 arranges its Cas7- and Cas11-like domains in an extended form that resembles the backbone made up by four Cas7 and one Cas11 subunits in the multi-subunit enzymes. Unlike the multi-subunit enzymes, however, the backbone of DiCas7-11 contains evolutionarily different Cas7 and Cas11 domains, giving rise to their unique functionality. The first Cas7-like domain nearly engulfs the last 15 direct repeat nucleotides in processing and recognition of the CRISPR RNA, and its free-standing fragment retains most of the activity. Both the second and the third Cas7-like domains mediate target RNA cleavage in a metal-dependent manner. The structure and mutational data indicate that the long variable insertion to the fourth Cas7 domain has little impact on RNA processing or targeting, suggesting the possibility for engineering a compact and programmable RNA interference tool.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ribonucleic acid or RNA is an important molecule involved in making proteins, transmitting diseases, offering immunity in form of vaccines, and also degrading itself.

Three types of CRISPR Cas effectors are known to utilize programmable CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to guide cleavage of the complementary target RNA. The multi-subunit Type III effectors, exemplified by the Type III-A (Csm) and the III-B subtypes (Cmr), assemble 4–5 Cas7, 2–3 Cas11, and 1 Cas10 subunits into a sea horse-shaped helical enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Molina et al., 2020</xref>). They cleave the target RNA at a 6-nucleotide (nt) interval within the complementary region that coincides with the evenly spaced Cas7 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Tamulaitis et al., 2014</xref>). The Type VI, or Cas13, is a single subunit and substantially smaller effector. Unlike Csm/Cmr, Cas13 employs two higher eukaryotic and prokaryotic nucleotide binding domains in cleaving the target RNA outside the complementary region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>). The recently discovered Type III-E effector, Cas7-11 or gRAMP (for giant repeat-associated mysterious protein), is also a single subunit effector with fused Cas7-like and Cas11-like segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Unlike Cas13 but similar to Csm/Cmr, Cas7-11 employs the Cas7-like segments to cleave crRNA-guided target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Interestingly, whereas Cas13 can distinguish self from foreign RNA by utilizing the 3’ protospacer flanking sequence (PFS) in the target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meeske and Marraffini, 2018</xref>), both Csm/Cmr and Cas7-11 are insensitive to 3’ PFS in cleaving their respective target RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>). The three effectors also differ in crRNA processing. Csm/Cmr utilize an independent processing endonuclease, Cas6, to result in a mature crRNA containing an 8-nt repeat (5’-tag) linked to the spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carte et al., 2008</xref>). By contrast, both Cas13 and Cas7-11 process their own crRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>). Cas7-11 is therefore believed to be a unique Type III CRIPSR-Cas system. Interestingly, Cas7-11 has been demonstrated to form a complex with the caspase-like TPR-CHAT peptidase, suggesting a potential for a viral RNA-induced and protease-mediated antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>). Given the known collateral nuclease activities of Cas13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">East-Seletsky et al., 2016</xref>) and Csm/Cmr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Elmore et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Samai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kazlauskiene et al., 2016</xref>), and the complex enzyme composition of Csm/Cmr, Cas7-11 provides a desirable platform to further develop RNA interference and editing tools. To understand the molecular basis for crRNA processing and target interference by Cas7-11, we determined a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of <italic>Desulfonema ishimotonii</italic> Cas7-11 (DiCas7-11) at an overall resolution of 2.82 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). DiCas7-11 has been demonstrated to function in programmable RNA cleavage and editing both in vitro and in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>).

The density map resolves most of the DiCas7-11 protein, the crRNA (–15 to +19) and the partially cleaved target RNA (+19* to +2*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The PFS region plus the first base paired nucleotide (+1*) are not observed. The core Cas7-11 assembly is half-moon shaped with four Cas7-like (C7L) domains (C7L.1–C7L.4 from N- to the C-terminus) forming a long ridge and a single Cas11-like domain (C11L) occupying the crescent center.

The similarity in the bound RNA trajectory at the core between the two complex is striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4b</xref>), suggesting a similar RNA binding apparatus in both complexes. DiCas7-11 lacks the domains equivalent to the Csm4 and the Cas10 (Csm1) subunits and, thus, the functions associated with them.

The 34-nt crRNA lies along the C7L ridge with its repeat region spanning C7L.1-C7L.2 and the spacer region covering C7L.3-C7L.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b-c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

The short span of the guide-target region on C7L domains explains the two, instead of four as in LlCsm, sites of target cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The observed structure suggests that the pre-crRNA is processed by the first C7L domain, which yields a mature crRNA containing the last 15 nucleotides of the direct repeat (5’-tag) linked to the programmed spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To confirm the site of processing, we subjected synthetic pre-crRNA containing 2’-deoxy modification at −16,–15, or –14 position to the processing reaction, respectively, and found that the cleavage products are consistent with the density-derived 15-nt 5’-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Strikingly, the sequence identity upstream of U(–15) is not important for processing, as those substituted with poly-adenine (polyA) or the previously characterized <italic>Candidatus Scalindua broadae</italic> (Csb) pre-crRNA are successfully processed by DiCas7-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). A well-conserved histidine residue, His43, is immediately next to the leaving 5’-hydroxyl oxygen (2.3 Å) of U(–15), suggesting its role in processing. Consistently, His43 to alanine mutation (H43A) abolished pre-crRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The requirement for His43 without requiring divalent metals in processing suggests that DiCas7-11 employs a general acid-base catalysis mechanism similarly suggested for Cas6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Li, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hochstrasser and Doudna, 2015</xref>), although detailed roles of His43 and other possible catalytic residues remain to be characterized. In this regard, the histidine-mediated processing reaction may be further assisted by nearby polar residues Tyr55 (4.3 Å from the leaving 5’-hydroxyl oxygen) and Arg26 (5.1 Å from the leaving 5’-hydroxyl oxygen). Interestingly, CsbCas7-11 contains threonine in place of His43 and phenylalanine in place of Tyr55, and it does not process its crRNA at position –15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">van Beljouw et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that precise processing may not be required for the RNA interference activity.</p><p>The processed 15-nt 5’-tag interacts extensively with C7L.1 and to less extent with C7L.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The protein nearly buries the entire 5’-tag and thus precluded it from complete base pairing with a complementary RNA. In general, well-conserved residues form base-specific interactions while non-conserved residues maintain interactions with RNA sugar phosphate backbone. C7L.1 forms a ferredoxin fold (β2↑β3↓α2β1↑α1β4↓) highly abundant in CRISPR Cas components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Makarova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Wang and Li, 2012</xref>). It uses α1, β2, a long β-hairpin connecting β2 to β3 (thumb) and a C7L.1-specific insertion loop (finger) to secure the significantly bent 5’-tag, resembling a rope-gripping right hand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). The first nucleotide, U(–15), forms a hydrogen bond network with a number of residues including the well-conserved His43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Removal of U(–15) did not impact target RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), suggesting the possibility that the U(–15)-protein interactions may be important for processing rather than target interference. The most extensive interactions take place at the strictly conserved A(–12)-U(–11)-G(–10)-U(–9) tetranucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Both sidechain as well as mainchain atoms of C7L.1 participate in ‘reading’ the four RNA bases, and the amino acids involving base-specific contacts (Thr59, Arg62, Arg67, Lys89, Thr92, and Glu93) are well conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, all edges of G(–10), the Watson-Crick, the Hoogsteen, and the sugar, are in close contacts with the conserved C7L.1 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Downstream of the AUGU tetranucleotide is a tight right-handed helical turn formed by C(–8)-A(–7)-C(–6)-G(–5). The turn is stabilized by both base stacking as well as an unusual network of intra-strand polar contacts. The base of G(–5) interdigitates those of C(–8) and A(–7) with the well-conserved Arg35 on top, leaving C(–6) protruding into the interior of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas phosphate backbone atoms in A form RNA do not engage in intra-strand contacts, those within the turn mediate numerous interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The strictly conserved G(–5) forms the most intra-strand interactions. Its N2 atom contacts the non-bridging oxygen of A(–7) while its non-bridging oxygen forms hydrogen bond with 2’-OH of C(–8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Finally, the 2’-OH of G(–5) forms bifurcated contacts with the N7 atom of the strictly conserved A(–7) and G(–4). The tight and the N+3 interactions involving the C(–8)-A(–7)-C(–6)-G(–5) backbone atoms is reminiscent of those within a 3<sub>10</sub> helix in proteins. Interestingly, the non-conserved 5’-tag nucleotides, A(–3), C(–6), and C(–8) form minimal contacts with the protein, suggesting their minor roles in maintaining protein-RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The rest of the 5’-tag is clamped down by the thumb of C7L.1 and α1 of C7L.2 analogously as by two Cas7 subunits in Csm complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sridhara et al., 2022</xref>). Consistent with the extensive 5’-tag-protein interactions, removal of either first four or eight 5’-tag nucleotides abolished RNA-guided target cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). The different mode of 5’-tag binding to Cas7-11 from that of Csm explains the lack of a Cas10-like effector as in Csm. Rather, it allosterically activates a different effector, the TPR-CHAT protease, in a 3’ PFS-dependent manner. Though 13 of the 15 5’-tag nucleotides are buried by the protein, the last two, C(–1) and A(–2), are partially solvent-accessible and can potentially participate in PFS-mediated activation of the TRP-CHAT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Based on structural observations, we hypothesized that a free-standing C7L.1 (fC7L.1) domain may be sufficient for binding and processing pre-crRNA. We thus created and purified a truncated mutant comprised of residues 1–238 (hereafter fC7L.1 for free C7L.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Following 30 min incubation with pre-cRNA, fC7L.1 successfully processed the RNA, albeit at slightly reduced efficiency as compared to wild-type DiCas7-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, right). In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay shows that fC7L.1 remains bound to the cleaved pre-crRNA specifically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>), suggesting its potential to be used as a new CRISPR tool for in vivo RNA tracking or purification.</p><p>The spacer region of the crRNA is captured by the rest of the C7L ridge and base paired with the target RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The three base paired regions largely resemble A form helix with some deviations in base-pair tilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Three of the four C7L domains contain the characteristic ‘thumb’ that secure the crRNA at two evenly spaced (6-nt) kinks with bases flipped. The duplex bound by C7L.4 creates an extra spacing between the G(+13*)-C(+13) and G(+14*)-C(+14) pairs but no base flipping. Like the multi-subunit Type III effectors, the kinked crRNA-target RNA duplex creates bended sugar-phosphate backbone at the locations that coincide with the sites of cleavage. Both sites are cleaved by Cas7-11 in a metal-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). Consistent with the previous observation that Type III systems generate 2’,3’-cyclic product in spite of the metal dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hale et al., 2009</xref>), the target RNA containing 2’-deoxy modification at A(+4*) (site 1) and C (+10*) (site 2) prevented formation of any cleavage product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and d</xref>). Two acidic residues, Asp429 and Asp654, were previously shown to be critical to cleavage at site 1 and site 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref>). Satisfactorily, they are found near each corresponding scissile phosphate with the carboxylate oxygen 4.2–6.7 Å from the leaving 5’-oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). At both sites, the phosphodiester bond breakage is further assisted by the near ‘in-line’ geometry of the nucleophilic 2’-oxygen, the scissile phosphate and the leaving 5’-oxygen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Two residues from the C11L domain, Arg283 (site 1) and His306 (site 2), where Arg283 is better conserved than His306, are observed to stabilize the attacking nucleotides by stacking on their bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Despite the demonstrated dependence on Mg<sup>2+</sup> in target cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), no sufficient density is observed that can be assigned to Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. The roles of these protein residues in facilitating metal-dependent phosphodiester bond breakage remains unclear.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Target RNA cleavage mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Recognition of target RNA by the crRNA and <italic>Desulfonema ishimotonii</italic> Cas7-11 (DiCas7-11).

Surprisingly, we found that Tyr360 is not required for site 1 cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and f</xref>), indicating that, at least for DiCas7-11, Asp429 is sufficient in mediating the metal-dependent cleavage.</p><p>To access the length of base pairing required for target cleavage, we further examined the cleavage of a series of truncated target from either the 3’ or the 5’ end. We found that as short of 16 base pairs in total length and 2 base pairs on one flanking end can facilitate RNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and e</xref>), suggesting that both protein and crRNA:target pairing play significant roles in shaping the target RNA for cleavage.</p><p>Though the final atomic model of DiCas7-11 lacks the large insertion to C7L.4 (residues 979–1297) due to weak density, focused classification and refinement led to a low-resolution map that matches the AlphaFold-predicted model of the insertion domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). This model indicates that a large majority of the insertion domain is not engaged with any of the features described above and suggests the possibility that it is not essential to RNA-guided target cleavage.

We superimposed the active form of DiCas7-11 bound with the processed native crRNA (this study) to that by Kato et al. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) and found a close agreement in protein and RNA structures. The superimposed structures resulted in 0.918 Å root-means-square-difference (r.m.s.d.) for 8114 atoms for protein, 0.691 Å for 192 backbone atoms of crRNA, and 0.80 Å for 96 backbone atoms of target, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>). The target cleavage sites are highly similar despite the protein used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kato et al., 2022</xref>, contains mutated catalytic aspartates. The largest difference, however, is observed in interactions between DiCas7-11 and the first 5’-tag residue between the two structures. In that by Kato et al., G(–15), which is non-native, establishes minimal interactions with the protein, whereas in that of the active DiCas7-11, the native U(–15) interacts extensively with conserved protein residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

This result suggests that, though U(–15) is nonessential to the architecture and the target-cleavage competency of DiCas7-11, it may be important for efficient processing.</p><p>The structure and complementary biochemical assays show that Cas7-11 has a minimal architecture required for programmable RNA cleavage. The covalent linkage of the homologous units suggests an evolutionary advantage in dedicating Cas7-11 to RNA cleavage. Considering the known collateral RNase activity of Cas13 and the complicated Csm/Cmr systems, Cas7-11 offers a desirable alternative in developing gene regulation tools. While DiCas7-11 has been successfully demonstrated to function in mammalian cells, the efficiency and accuracy remain to be improved. With now the available structures and the accurately mapped processing and target cleavage sites, protein engineering may assist the efforts in designing improved Cas7-11-derived RNA interference platforms. Both fC7L.1 and DiCas7-11-Δint1 lend a proof-of-concept for such an effort.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type(species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (species)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> NiCo21(DE3)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">New England Biolabs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C2529H</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used for proteins expression</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sumo-tag-DiCas7-11 expression plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Özcan et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene:172503</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">His-tag-DiCas7-11 expression plasmid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Constructed in-house.

The first one comprises pACYC-duet-1 plasmid inserted with the codon-optimized sequence encoding for DiCas7-11 with an N-terminal his-tag. The second plasmid encodes sumo-tag fused DiCas7-11 (Addgene: 172503). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> NiCo21 (DE3) competent cells were transformed with either plasmid used in protein production. A single colony was picked and transferred to 100 mL LB media containing 50 μg/mL ampicillin and grown for 12 hr at 37°C before inoculation into 1 L LB culture. The cells were induced at mid-log phase with the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside) and grown overnight at 16°C and harvested. Cells were lysed and centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 30 min in buffer A (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol) sonicated 10 times on pulse for 20 s with 40 s rest between the pulses. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4°C and the resulting supernatant was passed through the pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA resin column. The protein bound resins were washed by 100 mL buffer B (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 50 mM imidazole) and eluted with buffer C (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, and 300 mM imidazole). For the sumo-tagged DiCas7-11, the ULP1 protease was added to the elutant to remove the sumo-tag from DiCas7-11 while dialyzing at 4°C overnight. The digested protein solution was diluted twofold before being loaded onto a heparin column pre-equilibrated with buffer D (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, and 5% glycerol). The bound protein was eluted with a salt gradient. Pooled fractions were further purified on a gel filtration column in buffer E (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 2 mM DTT, and 5% glycerol). The protein containing fractions were pooled, concentrated to 21 mg/mL, aliquoted, and stored at –80°C for future use. We found that the quality of the sumo-tag purified protein is superior to that of the his-tag purified protein and used it in subsequent experiments. The DiCas7-11 mutants, DiCas7-11-Δint1 and fC7L.1, were prepared by Q5 ×2 master mix mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) using primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and purified similarly as the wild-type sumo-tagged DiCas7-11.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>In vitro transcription and purification</title><p>For synthesis of 59-nt pre-crRNA, DNA oligonucleotides appended with T7 promoter sequence were ordered from Eurofins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Nilsen as Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p>The reviewers thought that the work was interesting and in principle appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. Nevertheless, each raised a significant number of concerns regarding the presentation of the work. Please address these concerns as thoroughly as possible. We hope that the concerns can be handled through textual revisions and revision of the figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have the following points for the authors to address.</p><p>1. Comparison with Type III Csm complex – In page 4, the authors claim &quot;the similarity in the bound RNA trajectory at the core between the two complex[es] is striking (Supplementary Figure 4)&quot;. However, Figure S4 only showed side-by-side comparison of the complex. There was no superpositioning nor r.m.s.d. value for the readers to evaluate the claims. These need to be provided.</p><p>2. &quot;The first 18 nucleotides of the target RNA (+19* ~ +2*) remain base paired with the spacer region of the crRNA (Figure 1c, Supplementary Figure 3, &amp; Supplementary Figure 5).&quot; – What happens to the +1* nucleotide? Is it base paired with the guide? If not, why?</p><p>3. Along the same line, the role of the PFS motif in DiCas7-11 should be discussed. While most of the 5´ handle residues are sequestered, the last two nucleotides are displayed by DiCas7-11. The authors should discuss whether their structural observations in this region agree the biochemical data by Ozcan et al. For example, can the authors define the A-1*, G-2*, and the preceding nucleotides in their density map? Is there any interaction between this region and C-1A-2 in the 5´ handle?</p><p>4. Along the same line, the authors should include a zoom-in view of each guide RNA-target segment. It is hard to tell from viewing Figure 1C whether the guide and target form perfect, distorted, or shearing base pairing in each segment. Suggesting including a supplementary figure showing the zoomed base pairing densities.</p><p>5. I suggest the authors to improve the rendering of the EM maps in supplementary figure 3. For the three enzymatic centers, the important H-bonds should be marked with dashed lines, and distances labeled.</p><p>6. Page 7, 5´ handle recognition: as the authors pointed out, not all 15 handle residues are highly conserved among Cas7-11 guide RNAs. Can the authors rationalize the handle nucleotide conservation based on variations in the recognition residues in Cas7-11?</p><p>7. Enzymatic mechanism of crRNA biogenesis – Typically besides His, additional polar residues are involved in assisting the proton shuttering. Are there any such residues conserved among Cas7-11s?</p><p>8. Cleavage at site 1 – I did not quite follow the author's conclusion that because Y360 is not required for site 1 cleavage, D429 is sufficient for mediating the metal-dependent cleavage. Is Y360 the only alternative catalytic residue in this site? Given that site 1 cleavage is metal independent, D429 is unlikely the general acid/base. Did I misunderstand something here?</p><p>9. Figure 3c – No target band, nor cleavage product bands in lanes 4 and 5. Why is that? Are they not labeled? I could not make sense of this panel from reading the text and legend.</p><p>10. Figure 3e – Why isn't substrate 5 cleaved but substrate 7 cleaved. Both results seem surprising.</p><p>11. Page 5, first sentence of the 2nd paragraph: how does supplementary Figure 5 support the claim of structural similarity?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. I found Figure 2 and 3 (especially 3b-f) difficult to follow due to the lack of description of gel visualization methods and the overuse of &quot;asterisk&quot; in the figure legends. The following suggestions may help to reduce such confusion for future readers of this paper:</p><p>a. In the biochemical experiments, gels were visualized using either SybrGold staining or fluorescence labeling of the target RNA. The visualization method should be clearly stated in the figure legend for each panel containing a gel, to make it easier for the reader to understand the gel.</p><p>b. In some cases, the &quot;target&quot; label on the left side of the gel is not aligned correctly with all targets shown on the gel (e.g. in Figures 3c, 3e), because targets of multiple sizes were used on the same gel. Please adjust these labels.</p><p>c. Please describe which substrates were Cy5 labeled in the figure legend for Figure 3b, and/or describe what the yellow circle at the 5' end of target RNA 1 indicates.</p><p>d. Please list the target RNAs in Figure 3b in the order they are shown on gels in panels 3c-f.</p><p>e. Please describe the blue stars depicting deoxy positions for RNA target 2 in Figure 3b as &quot;blue stars&quot; rather than as asterisks.</p><p>f. The use of an asterisk to indicate the labeled target in panel 3d and the spurious RNA in panel 3e is confusing. Could one of these be indicated using a different label? For example, the labeled target RNA could be indicating using the same yellow circle that was used in the cartoon of target RNA 1.</p><p>2. Kato et al. described Zinc-finger domains in the Cas7 domains. Is evidence for these domains present in the cryo-EM map obtained in this study? These were not built into the structural model that was provided to reviewers.</p><p>3. p. 4 line 15: The authors state that the density map revealed a &quot;partially cleaved target RNA&quot; but do not explain their interpretation of the map that led them to conclude that the RNA is partially cleaved. What was this determination based on? As mentioned in the public review, there appears to be little density for the site 1 product. Further discussion of this interpretation should be included in the manuscript.</p><p>4. p. 3 line 22: The authors suggest that Cas7-11 may be an &quot;evolutionary intermediate&quot; between Class 1 and 2 effectors. This terminology is misleading, as it suggests that Class 1 and 2 effectors are homologous. Please reword this sentence.</p><p>5. p. 6 line 6: The authors refer to the catalytic mechanism employed for crRNA processing as an &quot;RNase A-like mechanism&quot;. A more generic term like &quot;general acid-base mechanism&quot; would be more appropriate, as there are likely several differences between RNase A and the Cas7-11 catalytic activity (e.g. there is only one catalytic histidine in the Cas7-11 active site and two in the RNase A active site; it is unclear whether the cyclic phosphate is resolved via hydrolysis by Cas7-11 as it is by RNase A).</p><p>6. p. 7 line 2: The authors compare a structure in the crRNA 5' handle to a 3-10 helix of a protein. It is unclear how these are similar, as this region of the RNA has the base of residue -5 stacked between the bases of residues -7 and -8, which is quite a distinct architecture than what would be observed for the side chains of a 3-10 helix. The phrase about the 3-10 helix could be removed.</p><p>7. Please use consistent nomenclature for the Csm complex subunits. It would be helpful to a broad audience to describe Csm3 as the Cas7-like subunit and Csm2 as the Cas11-like subunit in the text (p. 4 lines 20-21). Cas10 is referred to as Csm1 at the top of p. 5. Please use the updated nomenclature of Cas10 only. Csm1 could be indicated in parenthesis when first mentioning Cas10.</p><p>8. Reference 1 could be updated to the more recent Makarova review (PMID: 31857715).</p><p>9. p. 3 line 4: &quot;efforts&quot; should be &quot;effectors&quot;</p><p>10. p. 3 line 11: &quot;Higher Prokaryotic and Eukaryotic binding domain&quot; should be &quot;Higher Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Nucleotide binding domain&quot;</p><p>11. p. 5 line 8: The reference to Supplementary Figure 5 seems extraneous here.</p><p>12. p. 6 line 21: Please cite Figure 2a at the end of this sentence.</p><p>13. p. 8 line 18: The authors state that Asp429 is sufficient for mediating metal-dependent cleavage, but the paragraph presents data that target cleavage in this active site is metal independent. This sentence is incongruous with the rest of the paragraph and requires clarification.</p><p>14. A general comment regarding the structure figures: The figures are very attractive, but it would be helpful if the side chains of proteins were colored by heteroatom to more readily observe the identity of the residue and potential polar contacts.</p><p>15. In Supplementary Figure 1, please indicate which peak was collected for the bottom elution profile.</p><p>16. In Supplementary Figure 2, does &quot;pcts&quot; stand for &quot;particles&quot;? It may be helpful to spell out the whole word, as this is not a standard abbreviation as far as I know.</p><p>17. In Supplementary Figure 4, it would be helpful to show Cas7-11 in this figure so that the reader does not need to compare with a separate figure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.81678.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I have the following points for the authors to address.</p><p>1.

We added a statement on page 8 speculating that the two unpaired (C-1 and A-2) could pair with PFS to influence Cas7-11 structure and its downstream activity such as activation of TPR-CHAT by Hu et al.</p><p>“The different mode of 5’ tag binding to Cas7-11 from that of Csm explains the lack of a Cas10-like effector as in Csm. Rather, it allosterically activates a different effector, the TPRCHAT protease, in a 3’ PFS-dependent manner. Though 13 of the 15 5’-tag nucleotides are buried by the protein, the last two, C(-1) and A(-2), are partially solvent-accessible and can potentially participate in PFS-mediated activation of the TRP-CHAT activity <sup>20</sup>.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Page 7, 5´ handle recognition: as the authors pointed out, not all 15 handle residues are highly conserved among Cas7-11 guide RNAs. Can the authors rationalize the handle nucleotide conservation based on variations in the recognition residues in Cas7-11?</p></disp-quote><p>We revised the paragraph in page 7 extensively and with careful citations to supplementary figure 6 (now Figure 2—figure supplementary 1) to reflect the fact that “In general, well-conserved residues form base-specific interactions while non-conserved residues maintain interactions with RNA sugar phosphate backbone.”. We clearly state if an amino acid is conserved or not when describing its mode of interactions. We explicitly point out that the non-conserved RNA nucleotides, A(-3), C(-6), and C(-8), form minimal contacts with proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Enzymatic mechanism of crRNA biogenesis – Typically besides His, additional polar residues are involved in assisting the proton shuttering. Are there any such residues conserved among Cas7-11s?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We now extend our discussion to include discussion of the surrounding residues that can potentially influence processing activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Cleavage at site 1 – I did not quite follow the author's conclusion that because Y360 is not required for site 1 cleavage, D429 is sufficient for mediating the metal-dependent cleavage. Is Y360 the only alternative catalytic residue in this site? Given that site 1 cleavage is metal independent, D429 is unlikely the general acid/base. Did I misunderstand something here?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we meant to use the phrase “metal-independent” instead of “metal-dependent” because at the time, we were convinced this site uses a metalindependent mechanism, which prompted us to look for possible general acid/base residues such as the well-conserved Tyr360.</p><p>This conclusion had since been revised given the new data described below (see response to item 3 of Reviewer 2). In an effort of repeating the target cleavage assay, we discovered that two different batches of DiCas7-11 resulted in different metal-dependence. Whereas the older batch used for biochemistry studies such as those in Figure 3 reproducibly produces metalindependent cleavage of site 1, the batch later purified showed a complete dependence on metal (revised Figure 3). The two batches were from two different clones, one was constructed in-house and another described by Ozcan et al. and purchased from Addgene (Özcan, Ahsen, et al. “Programmable RNA targeting with the single-protein CRISPR effector Cas711.” <italic>Nature</italic> 597.7878 (2021): 720-725.). Though both encode an identical protein with affinity tag differences, the in-house clone produced samples with noticeably more degraded or prematurely terminated proteins (see figure in and response to item 3 of Reviewer 2). Though the cleavage gel patterns from the in-house clone-derived protein resemble those by Ozcan et al. that seem to suggest metal independence for site 1, the cleaner protein prep from the Addgene clone clearly showed metal dependent cleavage for both sites (see figure in and response to item 3 of Reviewer 2). We thus updated our target cleavage results and discussions throughout the manuscript to reflect this new result. The exact reason for the different cleavage patterns with different proteins is not clear at this time (see figure in and response to item 3 of Reviewer 2).</p><p>Therefore, the nonessential role of Y360 for site 1 can now be better explained, given the fact that Asp429 is likely sufficient for metal-dependent cleavage. The previous statement is in fact appropriate now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Figure 3c – No target band, nor cleavage product bands in lanes 4 and 5. Why is that? Are they not labeled? I could not make sense of this panel from reading the text and legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for pointing this out. The reason is that crRNA is coincidentally the same size as the deoxy-modified target RNA used in this assay. To avoid the confusion, we reanalyzed the same reactions by using a shorter deoxy target RNA and updated Figure 3c. The conclusion is now clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 3e – Why isn't substrate 5 cleaved but substrate 7 cleaved. Both results seem surprising.</p></disp-quote><p>The result is correct. However, we should have made more clear what exactly these target RNA are. In the revised Figure 3, we clearly indicate the length and possible cleavage sites of each target RNA. The original substrate 5 (now 7), though flanking both cleavage sites, has only 12-base pairs with crRNA, which could be insufficient for substrate binding and is thus not cleaved. In contrast, substrate 7 (now 5), though flanks only site 2, can base pair with 18 crRNA nucleotides and is thus cleaved.</p><p>Given the fact that substrate 6 is also cleaved (16-base pairs), we suggest that target RNA pairing with either end of the crRNA for at least 16 bases are sufficiently cleaved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

A more generic term like &quot;general acid-base mechanism&quot; would be more appropriate, as there are likely several differences between RNase A and the Cas7-11 catalytic activity (e.g. there is only one catalytic histidine in the Cas7-11 active site and two in the RNase A active site; it is unclear whether the cyclic phosphate is resolved via hydrolysis by Cas7-11 as it is by RNase A).</p></disp-quote><p>This statement is indeed speculative, and we agree there are likely differences between RNase A and Cas7-11. Without thorough enzyme kinetic studies, the catalytic mechanism of Cas7-11 remains at large. We do not know if His43 acts as general acid or base, nor do we know if there are other amino acids nearby that participate in rate enhancement. We revised the statement to “The requirement for His43 without requiring divalent metals in processing suggests that the C7L.1 employs a general acid-base catalysis mechanism similarly suggested for Cas6 <sup>16,17</sup>, although detailed roles of His43 and other possible catalytic residues remain to be characterized.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. p. 7 line 2: The authors compare a structure in the crRNA 5' handle to a 3-10 helix of a protein. It is unclear how these are similar, as this region of the RNA has the base of residue -5 stacked between the bases of residues -7 and -8, which is quite a distinct architecture than what would be observed for the side chains of a 3-10 helix. The phrase about the 3-10 helix could be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that we need further clarify the reference to 3-10 helix. We should have emphasized that the comparison is between the backbone of the two kinds of polymers, especially the intra-chain interactions established among the backbone atoms.</p><p>We revised the statement to “The tight and the N+3 interactions involving the C(-8)-A(-7)C(-6)-G(-5) backbone atoms is reminiscent of those within a 3<sub>10</sub> helix in proteins.”. This statement is also better positioned in the text after a series of descriptions of the unusual tight turn interactions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Please use consistent nomenclature for the Csm complex subunits. It would be helpful to a broad audience to describe Csm3 as the Cas7-like subunit and Csm2 as the Cas11-like subunit in the text (p. 4 lines 20-21). Cas10 is referred to as Csm1 at the top of p. 5. Please use the updated nomenclature of Cas10 only. Csm1 could be indicated in parenthesis when first mentioning Cas10.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the suggestion. We revised the statement to “The entire DiCas7-11 complex can be superimposed onto the closely matched homologous <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> Csm (LlCsm) complex <sup>13</sup> with the C7L.1-C7L.4 ridge matching that formed by four Cas7-like (Csm3) subunits and C11L matching the Cas11-like (Csm2) subunit adjacent to Cas10 (Csm1) (Figure 1—figure supplementary 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

A general comment regarding the structure figures: The figures are very attractive, but it would be helpful if the side chains of proteins were colored by heteroatom to more readily observe the identity of the residue and potential polar contacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced the figures with heteroatom colored side chains of proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15.
