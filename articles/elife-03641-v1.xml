To this end we present an approach termed PRIME for generating cell-specific genome-scale metabolic models (GSMMs) based on molecular and phenotypic data. We build &gt;280 models of normal and cancer cell-lines that successfully predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner. We utilize this set of cell-specific models to predict drug targets that selectively inhibit cancerous but not normal cell proliferation. The top predicted target, <italic>MLYCD</italic>, is experimentally validated and the metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion investigated. Furthermore, we tested cell-specific predicted responses to the inhibition of metabolic enzymes, and successfully inferred the prognosis of cancer patients based on their PRIME-derived individual GSMMs. These results lay a computational basis and a counterpart experimental proof of concept for future personalized metabolic modeling applications, enhancing the search for novel selective anticancer therapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03641.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03641.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03641.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer is not just one disease, but a collection of disorders; as such there is no single general treatment that is effective against all cancers. Different tissues and organs—including the lungs, skin, and kidneys—can get cancer, and each need different treatments. Even two patients with the same type of cancer might respond differently to the same treatment.</p><p>Being able to distinguish between different cancer types would help doctors personalize a patient's cancer therapy—which would hopefully improve the outcome of the treatment. An important step in developing such personalized treatments is to find out how each type of cancer cell behaves and to see how this behavior differs both from normal, healthy cells and other types of cancer.</p><p>Countless chemical reactions take place inside living cells, and these reactions essentially dictate how a cell will grow and behave. The chemical reactions occurring inside a cancerous cell can be described as its ‘metabolic phenotype’ and will likely be different to the chemical reactions occurring in a healthy cell. Now Yizhak, Gaude et al. have used a range of data, including gene expression data, to create computer models of the metabolic phenotypes of 60 different types of human cancer cell. The same approach was also used to create metabolic models of over 200 healthy human cells that were dividing normally. Yizhak, Gaude et al. used these metabolic models to predict how quickly the different types of cancer cell would divide and how the cells would respond to drug treatments.</p><p>It may be possible to reduce the spread of all types of cancer—without also affecting healthy cells—by targeting proteins that help cancerous cells to proliferate. Yizhak, Gaude et al. used all of the models to search for genes that encode such proteins. One gene that was predicted to provide such a drug target encodes an enzyme that is needed to make and break down fatty acid molecules. Experiments confirmed that inhibiting this gene slowed the proliferation of both leukemia and kidney cancer cells, but had less of an effect on the growth of healthy bone marrow or kidney cells. Finally, Yizhak, Gaude et al. generated detailed metabolic profiles of cancer cells taken from over 700 breast and lung cancer patients and were able to use the models to successfully predict the outcome of the diseases in these patients.</p><p>Yizhak, Gaude et al.'s findings might help future efforts aimed at developing and delivering personalized cancer therapies. The next challenge is to use additional data—such as gene sequencing data—to generate more detailed and more accurate metabolic models for many cancer patients, to both predict their individual responses to available drugs and identify new patient-specific treatments.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03641.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03641.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>genome-scale metabolic modeling</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>selective drug target</kwd><kwd>personalized medicine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0603804571</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhak</surname><given-names>Keren</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruppin</surname><given-names>Eytan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001698</institution-id><institution>Israel Cancer Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0603804521</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhak</surname><given-names>Keren</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruppin</surname><given-names>Eytan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-CORE Program Grant No 41/11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yizhak</surname><given-names>Keren</given-names></name><name><surname>Ruppin</surname><given-names>Eytan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gaude</surname><given-names>Edoardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Frezza</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome-scale metabolic modeling of individual cancer cells and healthy human cells identifies specific and selective metabolic vulnerabilities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Personalized medicine is moving us closer to a more precise, predictable and powerful method of treatment, customized for the individual patient. One field of research in which personalized medicine holds great promise is cancer therapy. The use of molecular data to personalize cancer treatment and differentiate one type of cancer from another can facilitate the use of highly tailored therapies and offers tremendous potential for improved prognoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Simon and Roychowdhury, 2013</xref>). A fundamental stepping-stone towards this goal is the ability to derive large-scale functional physiological models of specific cells that capture their unique cellular behavior. These models can then be utilized to identify drug targets that differentiate one cancer type from the other, and most importantly, distinguish them from their normal counterparts thus achieving treatment response selectivity.</p><p>This study addresses these challenges within the growing paradigm of Genome-Scale Metabolic Modeling, a computational framework for studying metabolism on a genome-scale that has been successfully used for a variety of applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burgard et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oberhardt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chandrasekaran and Price, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jensen and Papin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Szappanos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wessely et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lerman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Oberhardt et al., 2013</xref>). In recent years, two Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GSMMs) of human metabolism were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ma et al., 2007</xref>), and their utility in predicting human metabolic phenotypes has been demonstrated in a wide range of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shlomi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frezza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yizhak et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, more comprehensive versions of the generic human model were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Thiele et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mardinoglu et al., 2014</xref>). While these generic models are not specific to any cell- or tissue-type, they have successfully served both as a basis for generating context-specific models of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shlomi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jerby et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>) and for studying cancer metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Folger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frezza et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shlomi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Facchetti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolfi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agren et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yizhak et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, methods for building context-specific models do not take into account subtle differences in levels of expression of a particular enzyme, but rather its presence or absence. This coarse discretization makes these methods less applicable for the task of building cell-specific models, in cases where a high similarity in transcriptomics levels of different samples is observed. Namely, when the inter-individual variations in the molecular signatures of different cells are too small, this type of methods would lead to nearly identical models with little specific predictive value. Alternatively, absolute expression levels can be used to constraint the model's solution space, as previously done by E-Flux for studying bacterial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colijn et al., 2009</xref>). Nonetheless, the applicability of E-Flux for studying human metabolism has not been established.</p><p>In this study we aim to derive cell-specific metabolic models for human cell lines that are capable of predicting metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner. We aimed to construct such models for the human NCI-60 and HapMap cell line collections, where the similarity in expression levels of different cell lines is quite high. We began our investigation by testing the suitability of two existing model-building approaches towards this end. The moderate performance achieved by existing methods (see next section) have led us to develop a new cell-specific model building method termed PRIME (Personalized ReconstructIon of Metabolic models), which utilizes both molecular and phenotypic data for tailoring cell-specific GSMMs. We applied PRIME to reconstruct &gt;280 GSMMs of cancer and normal proliferating cells, which are tested by their ability to predict metabolic phenotypes such as proliferation rate, drug response and biomarkers on an individual level. We then utilized the models of normal and cancer cell lines to predict cancer selective drug targets. We validate experimentally that the top predicted gene target, Malonyl-CoA decayboxylase (<italic>MLYCD</italic>), induces a clear selective effect on cell growth when tested in both leukemia and renal cancer cell lines, vs normal lymphoblast and renal cell lines. Furthermore, we used PRIME to reconstruct personalized metabolic models of breast and lung cancer patients successfully inferring their prognosis. We therefore suggest that PRIME can be applied in the future to a variety of personalized medicine applications where molecular and phenotypic data can be coupled together to find metabolic drug targets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of a phenotype-based cell specific (PBCS) GSMMs via the PRIME approach</title><p>In this study we aim to derive individualized metabolic models for both normally proliferating lymphoblast cell lines (HapMap dataset), and a panel of cancer cell lines (the NCI-60 collection) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2008</xref>). As these datasets contain both gene expression information and growth rate for each cell line, our goal has been to use the gene expression to build cell-specific models that can predict an array of metabolic phenotypes using the measured proliferation rates for initial testing and validation. The difference in the gene expression of HapMap and NCI-60 datasets is very subtle (mean Spearman R &gt; 0.92, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panel), which may in turn imply that discretization-based methods would result here with nearly identical models that will fail to differentiate between their phenotypes. We therefore hypothesized that the integration of absolute expression levels would possibly be more suitable for our goal. To this end, we examined the performance of the two representative previously published methods on these datasets, one accepting discretized expression as inputs (iMAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shlomi et al., 2008</xref>]) and one analyzing the raw, non discretized expression data (E-Flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Colijn et al., 2009</xref>]).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03641.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The PRIME pipeline and growth rate predictions obtained by different methods.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Upper panel: Spearman rank correlation between the metabolic gene expression of two representative cell lines in the HapMap (left) and NCI-60 (right) datatset (the two cell lines represent the average correlation across the entire datasets); Middle panel: Spearman rank correlation between predicted and measured growth rates in the HapMap (left) and NCI-60 (right) datatset as predicted by iMAT, a method that utilizes discrete gene expression signature as input; Lower Panel: Spearman rank correlation between predicted and measured growth rates in the HapMap (left) and NCI-60 (right) datatset as predicted by E-Flux, a method that utilizes absolute gene expression levels as input.

As input, PRIME gets a GSMM and gene expression measurements for p cells together with their associated phenotypic measurement (e.g., proliferation rate). (Step 1): A set of genes whose expression is significantly associated with the phenotype is identified. (Step 2): A linear transformation from the expression of the phenotype-associated genes, to reactions' upper bound (maximal flux capacity) is applied (‘Materials and methods’). PRIME outputs a GSMM for each of the p input cells, such that each cell model generates a different feasible flux solution space.

PRIME aims to reconstruct distinct, phenotype-based cell-specific metabolic models (PBCS) based on sample-specific molecular data. This is achieved by setting maximal flux capacity constraints <italic>on a selected subset of reactions</italic> in the generic species model, according to their associated gene expression levels and phenotypic data. PRIME's starting point is similar to E-Flux. While both methods utilize the rather straightforward notion of adjusting reactions' bounds according to expression levels, few key differences between them help PRIME generate more accurate models: (1) since modifying the reactions' bounds is considered to be a hard constraint, one should aim to avoid over-constraining the network based on irrelevant or noisy information. Clearly, only a subset of the metabolic genes affects a specific central cellular phenotype. Accordingly, PRIME identifies this set in the wild type unperturbed case and modifies the bounds of only the relevant set of reactions; (2) while a common assumption is that expression levels and flux rates are proportional, this is known to hold only partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bordel et al., 2010</xref>). PRIME therefore utilizes the additional phenotypic data to determine the direction (sign) of this relation and modifies the bounds accordingly (‘Materials and methods’); (3) PRIME modifies reactions' bounds within a pre-defined range where the modification is known to have the greatest effect on a given phenotype (‘Materials and methods’). Importantly, E-Flux has only been utilized to build models of two different bacterial conditions, by aggregating the expression levels of all samples associated with each condition. In this study we employ the principles described above to build individual cell models from the human metabolic model based on a <italic>single sample</italic> gene expression signature of each cell.</p><p>PRIME takes three key inputs: (a) gene expression levels of a set of samples; (b) a key phenotypic measurement (proliferation rate, in our case) that can be evaluated by a metabolic model; and (c) a generic GSMM (the human model, in our case). It then proceeds as follows: (1) A set of genes that are significantly correlated with the key phenotype of interest is determined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>); (2) The maximal flux capacity of reactions associated with the genes identified in (1) is modified according to the <italic>directionality and level</italic> of their corresponding gene expression level. Importantly, to assure that bound modifications would have an effect on the models' solution space, reactions' flux bounds are modified within an effective flux range. Accordingly, PRIME outputs a GSMM tailored uniquely for each input cell (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and the ‘Materials and methods’ for a formal description).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PBCS metabolic models of normal lymphoblasts and cancer cell lines</title><p>We first applied PRIME to a dataset composed of 224 lymphoblast cell lines from the HapMap project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">International HapMap Consortium, 2005</xref>). This dataset is composed of cell lines taken from healthy human individuals, from four different populations, including Caucasian (CEU), African (YRI), Chinese (CHB) and Japanese (JPT) ethnicities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>). Applying PRIME to the generic human model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duarte et al., 2007</xref>), we constructed the corresponding 224 metabolic models, one for each cell line. The correlation between the proliferation rates predicted by these models and those measured experimentally is highly significant (Spearman R = 0.44, p-value = 5.87e-12, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). In addition to capturing the differences between each of the cell lines the models also correctly predict the experimentally observed significant differences between populations' proliferation rates (CEU &lt; YRI &lt; JPT &lt; CHB) in the correct order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stark et al., 2010</xref>]). The correlation observed remains significant also after employing a five-fold cross validation process 1000 times, controlling for the (indirect) use of proliferation rate in determining the modified reactions' set (mean Spearman R = 0.26, empiric p-value = 0.007, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). Specifically, this analysis is performed by utilizing the set of growth-associated genes derived from the train-set to build the models of the test-set, where the correlation between measured and predicted proliferation rates is then evaluated.</p><p>We further applied PRIME to build individual models and predict the proliferation rates of 60 cancer cell lines, obtaining a highly significant correlation between the measured and predicted proliferation rates (Spearman R = 0.69, p-value = 1.22e-9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2B</xref>). A four-fold cross-validation analysis resulted with a mean Spearman correlation of 0.56 (empiric p-value = 0.006, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, ‘Materials and methods’). Grouping the samples into the nine tumor types found in this dataset and evaluating the mean proliferation rate of each group, a significant correlation is obtained between the measured and actual growth rates of the different tumors (Spearman R = 0.71, p-value = 0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The higher correlation achieved for the cancer cell-lines in respect to that achieved for the normal cell-lines, is a result of the higher correlation found between metabolic gene expression and growth rate in the former datatset (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>).</p><p>To further examine the process employed by PRIME we tested three additional alternatives: (1) modifying the bounds of all enzyme-associated reactions and not only of those that are growth-related. This process decreased the correlation to Spearman R = 0.24, p-value = 2.4e-9 and Spearman R = 0.56, p-value = 2.8e-6 for the NCI-60 and HapMap datasets, respectively; (2) selecting random sets of reactions at the size of the original set and modifying their bounds according to their gene expression. Repeating this process 1000 times resulted with significantly inferior predictive performance in both datasets compared to PRIME (empiric p-value &lt; 9.9e-4, ‘Materials and methods’); (3) permuting the measured proliferation rates in each of the cell lines datasets for a 1000 times and correlating them with those computed by the PRIME models. In this case as well the original growth prediction results were found to be highly superior (empiric p-value &lt; 9.9e-4, ‘Materials and methods’).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Prediction of cell-specific metabolic liabilities using the NCI-60 collection</title><p>PRIME's major goal is to generate cell-specific metabolic models. Therefore, PRIME has the potential to guide pharmacological interventions based on the individual's phenotype, which underlies the basis of personalized medicine. We therefore tested the ability of PRIME to predict the response of each individual cell line to various metabolic drugs, and compared it with the response measured in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scherf et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holbeck et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lock et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>In silico</italic> drug response is computed according to the biological phenotype measured experimentally, which in this case includes ATP levels, or AC50/IC50 values (the concentration at which a given compound exhibits half-maximal efficacy or half-maximal inhibition of cell growth, respectively). ATP flux production levels can be estimated directly in a metabolic model. The latter measurements (AC50/IC50) were computed by evaluating the flux through the drug's target reaction under 50% of drug maximal efficacy or 50% inhibition of cell maximal growth (‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D–F</xref>).

Moreover, performing a permutation test in each of the datasets separately by permuting the measured drug response data, a highly significant result is obtained (empiric p-value &lt; 9.9e-4, ‘Materials and methods’). Applying a partial correlation analysis between <italic>in silico</italic> predicted and measured drug response while controlling for the experimentally measured proliferation rate (as growth rate itself has been implicated as a predictor of drug response, e.g., for cytotoxic drugs), we still find a significant association between predicted and measured drug response for the HapMap and CEU datasets, and in some cases even higher than before (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D–E</xref>).

To further validate these findings, we examined the clinical relevance of our predicted selective targets on a cohort of 1586 breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Curtis et al., 2012</xref>). A Cox multivariate regression analysis shows that this set is enriched (Hypergeometric p-value = 2.1e-5) with genes whose lower expression is significantly associated with improved survival (Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-values with FDR and α = 0.1, ‘Materials and methods’), when examined together with known prognostic variables such as patients' clinical stage, histological grade, tumor size, lymph node status and estrogen receptor status. A similar analysis for the set of predicted <italic>non-selective</italic> targets yielded either borderline or insignificant results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>).

Of note, the model predicted that upon <italic>MLYCD</italic> suppression, part of the accumulated malonyl-CoA is diverted to fatty acid biosynthesis. Since this process requires NADPH as source of reducing power, the aberrant activation of fatty acid synthesis caused by the loss of MLYCD would impair redox homeostasis of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berg, 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1H</xref>). We validated this hypothesis by first assessing fatty acid synthesis. To this aim, cells were incubated with <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-glucose and the abundance of <sup>13</sup>C-labelled TCA cycle intermediates and palmitate were analyzed by LCMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). While the labeling of citrate, the main lipogenic precursor, was, if any, slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), the m+4 and m+6 isotopologues of palmitate were significantly increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), suggesting that fatty acid synthesis is accelerated in these cells. Of note, the reduction of the m+2 and m+4 isotopologues of TCA cycle intermediates suggested that the oxidative capacity of the TCA cycle is intact, albeit reduced, in MLYCD-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). To validate the prediction that MLYCD-depleted cells increase the demand of NAPDH to fuel fatty acid synthesis, we measured the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), the major source of cytosolic NADPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). To this end, cells were incubated with 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-glucose and the amount of singly (m+1) or doubly (m+2) labeled lactate was used as measure of PPP or glycolysis activity, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref> for a representation of the experiment). As predicted by PRIME, PPP flux was increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–I</xref>). Together, these results corroborate the prediction made by PRIME that the loss of MLYCD increases fatty acid synthesis and impinges on the PPP for generation of reducing power. Finally, we tested whether the observed activation of fatty acid synthesis, by draining NADPH, impairs the capacity of cells to maintain redox homeostasis. In line with this hypothesis, MLYCD-depleted cells exhibited a lower GSH/GSSG ratio compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Furthermore, the incubation of cells with the antioxidant N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) fully restored the proliferation defects observed in MLYCD-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the suppression of cancer cell proliferation caused by the loss of MLYCD depends, at least in part, on the aberrant activation of fatty acid synthesis, which leads to a reduced ability of cells to maintain redox homeostasis. Overall, this investigation showed the benefits of PRIME to predict and investigate metabolic liabilities of cancer cells, based on cell-specific metabolic models.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Predicting gene knock downs that differentially modulate breast cancer cells growth</title><p>We next aimed to go beyond predicting targets that are selective with respect to <italic>cancer versus normal</italic> cell populations as a whole, to study if we can use PRIME to predict the differential response amongst cancer cell lines to specific treatments.

Importantly, growth rate measurements are not available for these datasets. Nonetheless, a possible way to overcome this hurdle and to build personalized metabolic models for cancer patients is to use phenotypic data measured for one set of cells to reconstruct models of a different set of cells or clinical samples. To examine this approach we utilized the set of growth-associated genes derived from the NCI-60 collection to build personalized GSMMs of more than 700 breast and lung cancer clinical samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Okayama et al., 2012</xref>).

We apply this method for the reconstruction of metabolic models of both cancer and normal cells. To the best of our knowledge, PRIME is the first method able to generate human cell-specific GSMMs that can predict metabolic phenotypes in an individual manner, including growth rates and drug response. The set of normal and cancer PRIME-derived models is utilized to identify a set of drug targets that can inhibit the proliferation of specific cell lines, as well as metabolic targets that can selectively block cancer but not normal cells growth. The experimental validation that we provide testifies that coupling molecular and phenotypic data for building cell-specific models can enhance the predictive power of GSMMs.</p><p>As many other computational approaches, PRIME is not devoid of limitations. First, PRIME assumes that cells try to maximize their proliferation, while different objective function(s) should be considered for non-proliferating cells. Second, we assume that all models share the same set of enzymes and differ only in their cellular abundance, but different cells may express different coding variants that should be incorporated in future studies. Third, PRIME relies on the measurement of a specific phenotype that is not always available for a given set of cells or samples. Here we introduced a possible way to overcome this hurdle, as demonstrated by PRIME's ability to utilize clinical data and build cell-specific GSMMs tailored for each individual patient. However, while this analysis provided significant results, the obtained signal is mild and the question whether and how best one can identify a universal set of growth-associated genes still requires further study. Given the results obtained, one can confidently expect that follow-up work analyzing richer datasets, and most importantly, incorporating additional kinds of omics data (such as enzyme sequence data) will significantly improve the predictive power of PRIME further.</p><p>In this work we have also experimentally validated the prediction made by PRIME that MLYCD inhibition selectively affects cancer proliferation. MLYCD is an important enzyme of fatty acid metabolism, which role in cancer therapy has been recently suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). However, the selectivity across cancer types, and the mechanism of action of its inhibition have not been fully investigated. Our results show that the silencing of <italic>MLYCD</italic> has an anti-proliferative effect across multiple cancer cell lines but spares the non-transformed counterparts, confirming PRIME's predictions. We have also shed some light on the functional effects of inactivation of MLYCD in cancer cells. The toxic effects of MLYCD inhibition have been previously attributed to the accumulation of malonyl-coA and to the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Our results suggest that, besides turning off fatty acid oxidation and partially deregulating TCA cycle, the loss of MLYCD stimulates fatty acid synthesis, which drains reducing equivalents and sensitize cells to oxidative stress. Therefore, our results not only confirmed the <italic>cancer versus normal</italic> selectivity of MLYCD inhibition but also elucidated a novel liability of cancer cells based on the pharmacological inhibition of fatty acid metabolism. Of note, both these features were accurately predicted by PRIME. Importantly, in humans, the loss of MLYCD leads to methylmalonic aciduria, an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder. Nevertheless, in vivo experiments in rodents and pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), ex vivo experiments in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouzakri et al., 2008</xref>), and in MRC-5 non-transformed fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>) suggest that the inhibition of MLYCD is well tolerated, as our results indicate. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of the enzyme has no detrimental effects on normal cells and tissues, and that other factors contribute to the severity of MLYCD deficiency in humans, including a toxic effect of the mutated protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polinati et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we here show that incorporating gene expression measurements and phenotypic data within a genome-scale model of human metabolism via PRIME results in functional cell-specific models with considerable predictive power. We believe that the demonstrated ability of PRIME to predict the effects of known metabolically-targeted drugs on individual cell proliferation rates will help to pave the way for tailoring specific therapies based on metabolic modeling of cancer biopsies from individual patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>A constraint-based model (CBM) of metabolism</title><p>A metabolic network consisting of <italic>m</italic> metabolites and <italic>n</italic> reactions can be represented by a <italic>stoichiometric matrix S</italic>, where the entry <italic>S</italic><sub><italic>ij</italic></sub> represents the stoichiometric coefficient of metabolite <italic>i</italic> in reaction <italic>j</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 2004</xref>).

Next, the minimal flux through each essential reaction is found via Flux Variability Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Varma and Palsson, 1994</xref>).

The set of growth-associated reactions found in the train-set is then used to build the models of the test-set. The correlation reported is the mean Spearman correlation achieved by comparing the measured and predicted growth rates of the test-set alone, while repeating this process 1000 times. The empiric p-value is computed by permuting the gene expression 1000 times, in each case building the resulting models and performing the cross-validation analysis as described here. Finally we compared the resulting mean Spearman correlation of each of these models to that obtained with the original data. Generally, all permutation tests are repeated 1000 times. Empiric p-value is then computed as (n+1)/1001 where n equals the number of times a random set of values yields a result which is more significant than the original result obtained when the data is not permuted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Drug response simulations</title><p>Each drug is mapped to its corresponding metabolic reaction through its known enzymatic targets according to DrugBank database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wishart et al., 2008</xref>). In this study we focused on drugs that: (1) have an inhibitory effect; (2) the majority of their targets are metabolic; (3) are not associated with dead-end reactions. The drug response data used in this analysis was measured in various ways: (a) ATP concentrations (HapMap dataset): In this case the <italic>in silico</italic> drug response is computed via MOMA in two steps; (1) obtaining a wild-type flux distribution via Flux Balance Analysis in which the corresponding drug target reaction is initially forced to be active (the pre-drug condition). Enforcing the target reaction to be active is necessary in order to get an effect on the resulting flux distribution following the inhibition simulated in the next step. Here we enforced a positive flux through the target reactions that is 50% of the maximal flux rate it is able to carry (our results are robust to various activation thresholds; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). (2) Next, the knock out flux distribution is computed via MOMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Segre et al., 2002</xref>) while constraining the flux through the corresponding reactions to zero. This process is repeated for each personalized model separately and the predicted ATP production is used to estimate the cell response to the simulated drug. A robustness analysis is carried out by using 1000 different wild-type flux distributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>); (b) AC50 values (CEU dataset): AC50 values represent the concentration in which the drug exhibits 50% of its maximum efficacy. In this case, <italic>in silico</italic> AC50 values are calculated by estimating the maximal flux rate carried by the target reaction when the growth rate is set to 50% of the drug's maximal response (a value that is available in the dataset used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lock et al., 2012</xref>]); (c) IC50 values (NCI-60 dataset): IC50 values represent the concentration of drug needed in order to reduce the growth rate to 50% of its maximal value. In this case, <italic>in silico</italic> IC50 values are calculated by estimating the maximal flux rate carried by the target reaction when growth rate is set to 50% of its maximal value. In all cases of drug response simulations the permutation test is carried out by permuting the measured data 1000 times and re-estimating the resulting correlation for each permuted vector.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Predicting uptake and secretion rates</title><p>We have utilized the CORE data published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al.

We have focused on 33 metabolites for which a corresponding exchange reaction exist in the human model and for which a non-zero flux was measured in at least three of the cell-lines. For each of these metabolites we estimated the maximal flux rate through its exchange reaction under at least 90% maximal growth rate, and compared it to that measured experimentally across the 59 cell-lines for which data exist. A similar approach was taken for both the PRIME and the E-Flux models.

The knock down of each tested reaction was simulated by inhibiting the target reaction by at least 75% of its maximal flux, then maximizing cellular growth under this perturbation. To increase specificity, we focused on reactions that are: (1) catalyzed by a single gene, and (2), their catalyzing gene does not catalyze more than three different reactions. Reactions were then ranked based on the variance in their knock down predicted growth rate across the four cell line models. 13 top predicted genes were selected for further experimental validation based on their high ranking in the list (i.e., high variance) and their association with diverse metabolic pathways (excluding transport reactions which their catalyzing enzymes are less specific). Each gene was examined experimentally in the two cell lines predicted to have the lowest and highest affect on cell growth. The permutation test is performed by permuting the models' predicted growth rates (after reaction knock down) 1000 times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Drug selectivity analysis</title><p>The effect of reaction's deletion on cell proliferation for the identification of selective treatment was simulated via MOMA with its robustness analysis as described in the section ‘Predicting differential effects on cancer cell growth’ above.

The set of selective reaction targets is composed of those that reduce the growth of all normal cells by less than 20% and the growth of all cancer cells by more than 30%. Additionally, this set includes only those reactions that exhibit more than 20% difference in growth reduction between the normal and cancer proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

The work is interesting as it addresses development of technique that is able to predict metabolic phenotype, a problem currently lacking conclusive answers.

The authors need to assay the cells MLYCD activity, de novo fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. The authors instead use steady-state metabolomics, which can be very misleading. For example, they go on to suggest that the mechanism of the selective toxicity results from a redox imbalance for which the argument (and data) are extremely weak.

Indeed, in this study we worked on developing a computational approach that will enable the generation of cell-specific models with a significant predictive value. The main thrust of the paper is therefore focused on the validation of the reconstructed models through different publically available resources, including growth rates, drug response, biomarkers and clinical survival data, and through the generation of new data concerning the differential effect of 13 predicted genes upon cancer cell growth. The significant results obtained by these various validations vouch for its ability to provide meaningful predictions for yet untested targets. The specific case of <italic>MLYCD</italic> as a selective drug target is tested here experimentally more deeply, and further data has been added to its validation as described in our response to the next comment.</p><p><italic>In this regard, additional experimental data should be provided. Specifically, the authors use siRNA to knockdown of MLYCD without providing any assays to determine if the knockdown was effective other than showing a modest suppression in total mRNA content that results in a modest suppression in cell growth. The authors need to assay the cells MLYCD activity, de novo fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation. The authors instead use steady-state metabolomics, which can be very misleading</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the referees that steady-state metabolomics measurements can be misleading if used to infer the activity of metabolic pathways. Therefore, to address the referee’s concerns we have performed <sup>13</sup>C-labeling experiments followed by targeted LCMS analyses to assess fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid oxidation in MLYCD-depleted cells. Although we were not able to reliably detect malonyl-CoA and malonate in our experiments, we have now shown that the silencing of MLYCD leads to a significant decrease in fatty acid oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>) and to increased <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D-F</xref>). These results demonstrate that the extent of depletion of MLYCD achieved.</p><p><italic>For example, they go on to suggest that the mechanism of the selective toxicity results from a redox imbalance for which the argument (and data) are extremely weak</italic>.</p><p>We thank the referees for this remark, which prompted us to better support our hypothesis. It is worth mentioning that we investigated the deregulation of redox homeostasis as an experimental validation of PRIME’s predictions on the global metabolic effects of MLYCD depletion. These predictions indicated that the silencing of MLYCD causes a redox imbalance due to an increased demand of NAPDH to support accelerated lipid synthesis. We have now strengthened this hypothesis by: (1) confirming that fatty acid synthesis is increased in MLYCD-depleted cells (see comment above); and (2) measuring the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway, the major source of cytosolic NADPH [1]. To this aim, we performed an isotope tracing experiment with 1,2-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>2</sub>-Glucose, which enables us to distinguish between glycolysis and PPP fluxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Reassuringly, we observed a significant increase in the PPP upon MLYCD inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G-H</xref>). These results are in line with the hypothesis that aberrant fatty acid synthesis drains redox equivalents, exposing cells to higher oxidative stress.</p><p><italic>Furthermore, in humans, mutations in MLYCD cause malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (OMIM#248360) therefore the selective toxicity may be a cell culture artifact</italic>.</p><p>The referees are correct in pointing out that, in humans, the loss of MLYCD leads to methylmalonic aciduria, an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder. Nevertheless, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments in rodents and pigs [2, 3], <italic>ex vivo</italic> experiments in human skeletal muscle [4], and in MRC-5 non-transformed fibroblasts [5] suggest that the inhibition of MLYCD is well tolerated, as our results indicate. It is therefore possible that the inhibition of the enzyme has no detrimental effects on normal cells and tissues, and that other factors contribute to the severity of MLYCD deficiency in humans, including a toxic effect of the mutated protein [6]. We agree with the referees that more experiments are required to assess the therapeutic window of MLYCD inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>, but we believe that these experiments are beyond the scope of this manuscript. In light of the referees’ comment, however, a brief discussion along these lines has now been added.</p><p><italic>Another major concern is the lack of accompanying models or at least the base code of the method, which would facilitate easier dissemination.

Additionally, following the reviewer's suggestion, a detailed description of MOMA was added to the Methods as follows: “Gene knock outs are simulated by constraining the flux through the corresponding metabolic reaction to zero.

The discrepancy between the labeling of pyruvate and lactate may be due to different pools of pyruvate being diverted to lactate and alanine, as previously observed (Zwingmann C et al.

However, we believe that this discussion is beyond the scope of the manuscript and, to avoid confusion, we decided to remove the pyruvate labeling, and to present only the m+1/m+2 ratio for lactate, as it is generally accepted for understanding the flux of carbons through the PPP.</p><p><italic>References</italic></p><p>1.
