role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in regulating pathological processes in various diseases including organ fibrosis. Endometrium fibrosis is the leading cause of uterine infertility, but the role of circRNAs in its pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we provide the evidence that upregulation of circPTPN12 in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) of fibrotic endometrium functions as endogenous sponge of miR-21–5 p to inhibit miR-21–5 p expression and activity, which in turn results in upregulation of ΔNp63α to induce the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EECs (EEC–EMT). In a mouse model of endometrium fibrosis, circPTPN12 appears to be a cofactor of driving EEC–EMT and administration of <italic>miR-21–5</italic> p could reverse this process and improve endometrial fibrosis. Our findings revealed that the dysfunction of circPTPN12/miR-21–5 p/∆Np63α pathway contributed to the pathogenesis of endometrial fibrosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endometrial epithelial cells</kwd><kwd>endometrial fibrosis</kwd><kwd>epithelial mesenchymal transition</kwd><kwd>circPTPN12</kwd><kwd>mir-21-5p</kwd><kwd>∆Np63α</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDA16040302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81971336</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82071600</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Guangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Excellent Youth Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BK20170051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Guangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jiangsu Province’s Key Provincial Talents Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZDRCA2016067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Guangfeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jiangsu Biobank of Clinical Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BM2015004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFC1004404</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Yali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Upregulation of circPTPN12 in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) of fibrotic endometrium sponged miR-21–5 p and resulted in upregulation of its target gene, ΔNp63α, which induced transition of EECs to mesenchymal cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endometrial fibrosis is clinically characterized with intrauterine adhesions (IUA) and is often secondary to severe injury of endometrium including various uterine operations mainly repeated curettage. Endometrial fibrosis is the most common reason of uterine infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">March, 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">March, 2011b</xref>). The mechanism of endometrial fibrosis remains unclear, which hampers the development of effective therapeutics for the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">March, 2011b</xref>). Recently, our study showed that the ectopic expression of ΔNp63α, a transcription factor, in the endometria of IUA patients triggers the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) (EEC–EMT) to promote endometrial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the process of EMT, post-transcriptional regulation has critical roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nieto et al., 2016</xref>). Studies showed that let-7d is downregulated in EMT of the lung epithelial cells and downregulation of let-7d in mice causes lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pandit et al., 2010</xref>). miR-29b suppresses EMT of lung epithelial cells and prevents mice against lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sun et al., 2019</xref>). In the renal fibrosis, miR-34a induces EMT in renal tubular epithelial cells and knockout miR-34a ameliorates renal fibrosis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>). Moreover, miRNAs may function differently in the pathogenesis of fibrosis in different tissues. For example, miR-27a prevents the fibrosis of detrusor and kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Wu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), but promotes the myocardial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ya-Se et al., 2018</xref>). However, the role of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometrial fibrosis is less studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies demonstrate that the expression and activity of miRNAs are regulated by circular RNAs (circRNAs). circRNAs are recognized as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to sponge miRNAs to modulate the expression and activity of miRNAs and their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>). To date, little is known about the biological function of circRNAs in the pathogenesis of endometrial fibrosis. Since we found that the ectopic expression of ΔNp63α in EECs induces EEC–EMT and promotes endometrial fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), and ΔNp63α is regulated by multiple miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Candi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rodriguez Calleja et al., 2016</xref>), we speculated whether circRNAs is involved in the pathogenesis of endometrial fibrosis by interacting with miRNAs. Therefore, we studied the expression changes of circRNAs/miRNAs in endometrial fibrosis and their regulatory relationship with ΔNp63α to favor the understanding of endometrial fibrosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>miR-21–5 p is downregulated in EECs and associated with EEC–EMT</title><p>To study the spectrum of changes in the levels of ΔNp63α antagonizer miRNAs, the transcriptomic alterations in the endometria of the patients with IUA were determined.

Since epithelial cells often switch to matrix-producing myofibroblasts via EMT in tissue fibrosis process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Iwano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zeisberg et al., 2007</xref>) and we proved recently that ΔNp63α inducing EEC–EMT participates in endometrium fibrosis in IUA patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), we speculated that miR-21–5 p may serve as a protector for maintaining endometrium homeostasis and preventing EECs from EMT. Therefore, we performed loss and gain of miR-21–5 p function by transfecting miR-21–5 p mimic and inhibitor into primary EECs respectively. miR-21–5 p expression increased 11 times in EECs transfected with miR-21–5 p mimic, while the expression decreased 2.5 times after miR-21–5 p inhibitor transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After miR-21–5 p knockdown, the expression of epithelium-specific marker, E-cadherin, was downregulated, but mesenchymal markers, N-cadherin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and fibronectin (FN), were overexpressed in EECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, overexpression of miR-21–5 p markedly decreased the expression of N-cadherin, α-SMA, and FN and increased the expression of E-cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>circPTPN12 is upregulated in EECs and negatively correlated with miR-21–5 p</title><p>Since circRNAs are the main regulators for miRNAs activity and act as ceRNA to sponge miRNAs by complementary base pairing to regulate the expression of target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheng et al., 2019</xref>), we analyzed the expression profile of circRNAs in endometrium samples from severe IUA patients and normal controls through high-throughput sequencing. We detected 17,134 distinct circRNAs and 4886 of them have been registered in circBase database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Of the 172 miR-21–5 p binding circRNAs, 12 were upregulated and 4 were downregulated in IUA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). We focused on the upregulated circRNA candidates because miR-21–5 p was downregulated in the endometria of IUA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) and circRNAs function as ceRNAs to inhibit miRNAs activities and expression. The most upregulated circRNA was hsa_circ_0003764 (circBase ID), and it was 64-fold higher than that in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and RNA-scope assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) showed that hsa_circ_0003764 was significantly upregulated in the endometria of IUA patients and mainly expressed in EECs. Through circPrimer software, we found that hsa_circ_0003764 is derived from 5 to 8 exons of tyrosine–protein phosphatase non-receptor type 12 (PTPN12) gene.

The resultant products of divergent primers were confirmed in line with the sequence of circPTPN12 by sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, bottom). To investigate the stability of circPTPN12, total RNA isolated from IUA patients’ endometria was treated with RNase R for 15 min, then the expression of circPTPN12 and PTPN12 was respectively detected and the results showed that PTPN12 expression was significantly decreased while circPTPN12 expression was not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Furthermore, we added actinomycin D to inhibit the transcription of EECs. We harvested total RNA at five time points, analyzed the expression of circPTPN12 and PTPN12 by qRT-PCR, and revealed that the half-life of circPTPN12 was exceeding 24 hr, whereas the half-life of linear PTPN12 transcript was less than 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, circPTPN12 was more stable than PTPN12 mRNA, suggesting that circPTPN12 is circular.

We used biotin-labeled circPTPN12 to pull down the circPTPN12 in the lysates of the transfected HEK-293T cells.

To determine the binding site of circPTPN12 for miR-21–5 p, we cloned the full-length sequence of circPTPN12 in pGL3 vector containing a luciferase reporter. Luciferase activity was substantially reduced in the presence of the miR-21–5 p mimic, which was effectively restored when miR-21–5 p was knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We then compared the sequence of circPTPN12 with that of miR-21–5 p using circBank and Circular RNA Interactome databases and noticed that circPTPN12 contains three putative target sites of miR-21–5 p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, top).

These findings are in agreement with the therapeutic effect of transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells into the uterine cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2018</xref>). Since miRNAs are main regulator of ΔNp63α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Candi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Lena et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rodriguez Calleja et al., 2016</xref>) and sufficient abundance of miRNAs transcripts in cells is essential in the regulating target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brown and Naldini, 2009</xref>), we chose the highest expressed miR-21–5 p in normal endometria to study its role in the current study. We found that miR-21–5 p is located in EECs, and the downregulation of miR-21–5 p can increase the expression of ΔNp63α, leading to the transition of EECs to cells with features of mesenchymal cells. In IUA mice model, supplementation of exogenous miR-21–5 p reversed the EEC–EMT and endometrial fibrosis, indicating that miR-21–5 p is essential in maintaining EECs properties. Our findings appear to be different from the observations that in lung and kidney fibrosis researches miR-21–5 p promotes EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2019c</xref>).

In this study, we identified a new circPTPN12, which rarely expressed in normal endometrium but significantly upregulated in the endometria of IUA patients. The colocalization of circPTPN12 and miR-21–5P in the cytoplasm of EECs, luciferase assay, and RIP experiments supports the circPTPN12/miR-21–5 p sponge hypothesis. Therefore, the current study for the first time demonstrates the role of a circRNA in endometrial fibrosis.</p><p>There are some limitations in our study. First, since the IUA patients enrolled in this study were all associated with repeated curettage, the findings in the present study may not be applicable to the IUA patients associated with infection or uterine artery embolization. Second, we only studied the roles of miR-21–5 p and circPTPN12 based on their highest expressions in the heatmap or volcano plots, yet there may be other less-expressed miRNAs and circRNAs that are potentially associated with the endometrial fibrosis, which remains to be further studied.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK-293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Ishikawa</td><td>ATCC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_2529">CVCL_2529</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-E-cadherin <break/>(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab76055</td><td>WB (1:1000) <break/>IHC (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-N-cadherin <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab18203</td><td>WB (1:500) <break/>IHC (1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-α-SMA <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab5694</td><td>WB (1:500) <break/>IHC (1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-FN <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab2413</td><td>WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-ΔNp63α <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat# <break/>ABS552</td><td>WB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-AGO2 <break/>(rabbit monoclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab186733</td><td>RIP (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GAPDH (HRP-conjugated GAPDH mouse mAb)</td><td>ABclonal</td><td>Cat# AC035</td><td>WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-rabbit IgG</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 7074S</td><td>WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-mouse IgG</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cat# 7076S</td><td>WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Sequenced based reagent</td><td>RT-qPCR primers</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents</td><td>Thermo Scientific</td><td>Cat# 78835</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>PrimeScript reagent Kit with DNA Eraser</td><td>TaKaRa BIO</td><td>Cat# <break/>RR047B</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>RNA-scope assay</td><td>Advanced Cell Diagnostics</td><td>Cat# 710171 <break/>Cat# 713661 <break/>Cat# 854881</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Actinomycin D</td><td>MedChem Express</td><td>Cat# <break/>HY-17559</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism version 6.0</td><td>GraphPad Software Inc</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Image J</td><td>NIH</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_003070">SCR_003070</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>edgeR</td><td>Bioconductor</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_012802">SCR_012802</ext-link></td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human endometrium samples</title><p>This study was approved by the Committee on Human Research of the Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital (No. 2012022), and informed consent was obtained from each participant.

Paraffin blocks were cut into 2 μm thick slices. After dewaxing and blocking endogenous peroxidase activity in 3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, slices were heat-mediated in universal antigen retrieval. The slides were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBST for 1 hr. After these pretreatments, slides were incubated with primary antibodies at 4°C overnight and washed by PBST. HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr. Slides were exposed to 3′3-diaminobenzidine to visualize the antigen signals. The positive staining was confirmed in a blinded manner by two independent observers by microscopy (DMi8, Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). For cell immunofluorescence, isolated EECs that had been plated on matrigel-coated coverslips for varying times were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and permeabilized with cold methanol. Fixed cells were stained with a primary antibody overnight, washed, and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorescein or rhodamine. Nuclei of EECs were stained using 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Abcam).

The same vector was used without the ΔNp63α insertion to construct the control virus (GeneChem, Shanghai, China). circPTPN12 adenovirus (Ad-circPTPN12), adeno-associated virus (AAV-circPTPN12), and plasmid construction circPTPN12 adenovirus were obtained from Genechem. Briefly, the full length of circPTPN12 with its flanking introns including complementary Alu elements was amplified to insert into a pCMV-MCS-EGFP vector, and an empty pCMV-MCS-EGFP vector served as control virus. circPTPN12 adeno-associated virus was obtained from HanBio Biotechnology (Shanghai, China). The full length of circPTPN12 was inserted into pHBAAV-CMV-CircRNA-EF1-ZsGreen vector and then inserted into adeno-associated virus. The empty vector was used as control virus. circPTPN12 overexpression plasmid was obtained from Genepharma (Shanghai, China).

BALB/c female mice, at 8–10 weeks of age, 18–20 g, were bred in the Animal Laboratory Center of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital. Mechanical injury of endometrium was performed as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, mice at estrum defined by vaginal smears were anesthetized with isoflurane. Laparotomy was performed to expose the uterus, followed by insertion of rough surfaced needle to injure uterine endometrium. Mice in sham-operation were just subjected to laparotomy to expose the uterus without injury. AAV-circPTPN12 or AAV-control (10 μl of 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> viral genomes/µl) was administered via intrauterine injection 5 days after mechanical injury to study the function of circPTPN12 in endometrium fibrosis. For the therapeutic effect of miR-21–5 p, agomir-21–5 p (Ribobio) or agomir-NC (Ribobio) (5 nmol in 10 μl) was administered every 5 days for three times via intrauterine injection after mechanical injury and AAV-circPTPN12 injection. Mouse model grouping was shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>. Uterine tissues were collected at estrum, 24–26 days after first surgery.

The authors provide a mechanistic explanation for these findings and elegantly illustrate the physiological relevance thereof in a mouse model of endometrial fibrosis.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Targeting circPTPN12/miR-21-5p/∆Np63α pathway as a therapeutic strategy for human endometrial fibrosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diane Harper as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrea Romano (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors performed an impressive amount of work. Experiments and well designed, performed, data are interpreted correctly and overall the quality of the experimental part is excellent, I just have few minor comments (see below). What in my opinion presents important limitations, and should be carefully checked by the authors, is the way data are presented and the discussion, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors cannot justifiably state that this is truly a therapeutic strategy for endometrial fibrosis without formally testing this; the authors should modify the manuscript throughout the text, title and abstract, accordingly. The title implying a therapeutic strategy is in my opinion too assertive based on the data and the Discussion section (see comment 4) of the current manuscript version. Certainly, the term 'targeting' is not appropriate since the experiments were not aimed at 'targeting' this pathway as therapy, but at exploring its involvement.</p><p>2) The study design and results are presented as a mix of hypothesis driven and non-hypothesis drive approaches. In the introduction, the aim seems to be hypothesis driven, i.e. the search for post-transcriptional regulators of ∆Np63α. Then in the results, it seems the authors 'interrogate' their transcriptomic data without any supervision or pre-imposed assumption. Was that really the case, or the authors specifically focussed on miRNAS and circRNA with potential interactions with ∆Np63α. The manuscript text should be updated accordingly.</p><p>3) In the expression profiling analysis, 40 upregulated and 40 downregulated miRNAs were observed. The authors decided to explore miR-21-5p in particular, because it was expressed and high levels (as relatively high amounts of these molecules are needed to exert their biological functions) and because this miRNA showed strong differential expression between patients and controls (no pre-analyses of potential role of this miRNA with 5p/∆Np63α?). In my opinion, the decision to further explore miR-21-5p is not fully justified: there may other less expressed miRNAs among the 80 differentially expressed that -although less expressed than miR-21-5p, can have a biological effect. In addition, if I look at the heat map in figure 1B, miR-21-5p does not seem to have consistent expression across samples (control2 and IUA1 have basically identical levels of this molecules), and there are other miRNAs with more consistent levels across cases and controls (miR 133, for instance). Similar considerations apply to the selection of the circRNAPTPN12 among those found to be differentially regulated.</p><p>4) The discussion does not reach the standards of other parts of the study (especially the results). The discussion is only an extended summary with reference to figures (which in my opinion is not appropriate) and should be extensively re-written. There is too much repetition of Results in the &quot;Discussion&quot; section. It would be more readable if the discussion part would be shortened and reformatted. Since the title suggests the existence of some implications for the treatment of the patients, the discussion should include some possible clinical considerations. What is the relevance of this pathways and p63 in endometrial fibrosis? In other endometrial disorders characterised by fibrosis? It there any data of patient material supporting the implication of this path? What are the clinical and therapeutic scenarios? Reversing fibrosis? Preventing fibrosis?</p><p>5) Normally, ΔNp63α is rarely expressed in normal endometrial epithelial cells, the author proposed that the expression of ΔNp63α in IUA is increased due to decreased miR21-5p and increased circPTPN12 as confirmed by WB and luciferase assay, it is very interesting to see whether the expression of ΔNp63α in IUA epithelium is increased by IHC or IF.</p><p>6) Whether the localization of ΔNp63α in epithelium would be observed in animal model under different treatment conditions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65735.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors cannot justifiably state that this is truly a therapeutic strategy for endometrial fibrosis without formally testing this; the authors should modify the manuscript throughout the text, title and abstract, accordingly.
