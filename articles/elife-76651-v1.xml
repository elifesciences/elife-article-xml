However, once inactivated, their re-activation remains difficult, especially in diploid cells. Here, we present DExCon (<underline>D</underline>oxycycline-mediated endogenous gene <underline>Ex</underline>pression <underline>Con</underline>trol), DExogron (DExCon combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation), and LUXon (light responsive DExCon) approaches which combine one-step CRISPR-Cas9-mediated targeted knockin of fluorescent proteins with an advanced Tet-inducible TRE3GS promoter. These approaches combine blockade of active gene expression with the ability to re-activate expression on demand, including activation of silenced genes. Systematic control can be exerted using doxycycline or spatiotemporally by light, and we demonstrate functional knock-out/rescue in the closely related Rab11 family of vesicle trafficking regulators. Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene, and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon), or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, transferrin receptor recycling, expression kinetics, and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in ovarian cancer cell lines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>gene expression control</kwd><kwd>vesicle trafficking</kwd><kwd>Rab25</kwd><kwd>genome editing</kwd><kwd>Rab11</kwd><kwd>cell migration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DCRPGF\100002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gemperle</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Thomas S</given-names></name><name><surname>Caswell</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>836212</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gemperle</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Caswell</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C147/A25254</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flett</surname><given-names>Chloe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R009376/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Caswell</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203128/A/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gemperle</surname><given-names>Jakub</given-names></name><name><surname>Harrison</surname><given-names>Thomas S</given-names></name><name><surname>Flett</surname><given-names>Chloe</given-names></name><name><surname>Adamson</surname><given-names>Antony D</given-names></name><name><surname>Caswell</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

CRISPR/Cas9 technology has revolutionized gene editing approaches and makes generation of gene knock-outs or knock-ins straightforward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doudna and Charpentier, 2014</xref>). Combination of CRISPR with single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) donors has proven to be the most precise and efficient method of on-target integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quadros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>), although knock-in approaches still suffer from low efficiencies, especially when aiming to achieve homozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gurumurthy et al., 2019</xref>). Fluorescent protein (FP) knock-in at endogenous loci leading to protein-fusion allows functional enrichment of complete knock-in events and study of native protein function using fluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leonetti et al., 2016</xref>). However, they only complement loss-of-function/gain-of-function methods, and their usefulness is limited by brightness of the chosen FP. Conditional loss-of-function methods mainly rely on CRISPR/Cas9 combination with FLP-frt or Cre-LoxP systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quadros et al., 2017</xref>). However, these are labor intensive and mediated by recombination, which is by nature irreversible thus complicating attempts to rescue gene expression. In addition, to understand the full spectrum of gene functions, it is advantageous to reversibly tune expression levels, visualized by fluorescence microscopy, in a spatiotemporal context and not only depend on binary on/off approaches. Such levels of control can be partly offered by the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>) introduced as a tag into the endogenous locus via CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röth et al., 2019</xref>). Here, an exogenously expressed plant auxin receptor F-box protein triggers ubiquitylation and degradation of target proteins fused to an AID tag on addition of the plant hormone auxin. However, this technology has its own limitations and caveats; for example, poor spatial control due to diffusion of auxin, significant basal degradation without auxin, and/or incomplete auxin-induced protein depletion.</p><p>Ideally, gene expression control and visualization of its protein product should be generated by a single gene modification (e.g. CRISPR knockin) at the endogenous locus and allow temporal, conditional, and reversible gene inactivation of all protein-coding transcripts, on demand, without the drawbacks of AID system. Such an approach is particularly useful for studying highly similar protein coding genes where their complementary and specific functions remain poorly understood, such as for members of Rab11 family of small GTPases: Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25 (Rab11c). Rab11s share high amino acid identity (Rab11a:Rab11b 89%, Rab11a:Rab25 66%, Rab11b:Rab25 61%), are known to play key roles in membrane transport, localize to recycling endosomes, and have been identified as important players in the cellular basis of an ever-increasing number of human disorders, including cell migration/invasion and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>). Several Rab11 family isoforms have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ota et al., 2004</xref>), and specific antibodies are hard to obtain without cross-reactivity. Moreover, much what is known about their regulation and dynamics in live cells has been achieved with the aid of transiently transfected cDNA (complementary DNA)-mediated overexpression which may lead to non-physiological artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ratz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gibson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To overcome the limitations of previously established gene expression control technologies, we generated tractable single CRISPR knock-in based strategies for tunable and reversible gene expression control capable of knock-out/rescue and endogenous gene re-activation. These modifications are ideal for microscopy when combined with FP knock-in, are free of transfection artifacts, preserve post-transcriptional and post-translational control, and avoid comprehensive and labor-intensive genotyping post-editing of clones. Specifically, we harnessed CRISPR/Cas9 technology for targeted knock-in of the third-generation tetracycline-inducible system (Tet-On 3G) promoter TRE3GS followed by an FP coding region. This promoter lacks binding sites for endogenous mammalian transcription factors, is effectively silent in the absence of induction, and any transcription driven by endogenous active promoter generates non-sense frameshift. Simultaneous or sequential silencing of additional alleles was achieved by additional ssDNA donor coding antibiotic resistance to attain complete and selectable functional knock-out. Spatiotemporal control was achieved by combination with a photoactivatable (PA)-Tet-OFF/ON system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>), even in cells within 3D microenvironments. We further established a tunable dual-input system combining TetON and AID, termed DExogron (DExCon [<underline>D</underline>oxycycline-mediated endogenous gene <underline>Ex</underline>pression <underline>Con</underline>trol] combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation), that enhanced switch off kinetics of the TetON system, allowing rapid complete protein depletion or adjustment of expression to physiological levels on demand.</p><p>Our optimized pipeline to deliver this suite of CRISPR tools was applied to modulate endogenous gene expression of Rab11 family members, demonstrating that re-activation of endogenous Rab25 expression can promote the invasive migration of cancer cells, and revealing new insight into the localization and functions of Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Deconvolving the relative functions of genes within highly related gene families has proven difficult, for example, the Rab11 family has a complex relationship with cancer, with several potential oncogenic and tumor suppressive functions identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kelly et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheng et al., 2004</xref>). However, gene editing offers potential solutions. In order to identify the best knockin strategies to visualize the Rab11 gene family, we first analyzed the expression patterns of the Rab11s across tissues and in cancer using UCSC Xena, an online exploration tool for multi-omic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldman et al., 2020</xref>). Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25 were significantly enriched in ovarian cancer, both for primary and recurrent tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Bioinformatic analyses suggested the existence of additional potentially protein-coding human Rab11a/b splice variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) revealed abundant expression of two Rab11b-coding and five Rab11a-coding transcripts across multiple healthy tissues while Rab25 is more restricted, but expression is increased across multiple types of cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.48420/16988617">https://doi.org/10.48420/16988617</ext-link>). Similarly, several Rab11a/Rab11b/Rab25 splicing isoforms are enriched in ovarian cancer compared to normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). All significantly expressed transcripts share an intact N-terminus; however, for some splice variants, amino acids important for GTP/GDP binding (which allow oscillation between active/inactive states) or for the attachment to the outer leaflet of endosomal membranes are missing, which could therefore profoundly alter Rab11s function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Thus, to capture the full physiological picture of the combination of Rab11s protein-coding transcripts, we fluorescently tagged the N-terminus of Rab11s using CRISPR knockin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We used long ssDNA donor for precise and efficient on-target integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Quadros et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miura et al., 2018</xref>) with flanking homologous arms 150–300 bases prepared via RNA intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Initial testing of different approaches led to our optimized protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) combining magnetofection of long ssDNA and high fidelity (Hifi) Cas9 delivered as ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with guideRNA (crRNA:tracrRNA). This combination reduces off-target effects to non-detectable levels and leads to Hifi hetero/homozygous knockin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vakulskas et al., 2018</xref>). To avoid comprehensive and labor-intensive genotyping post-editing of clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miura et al., 2018</xref>), we took the advantage of fluorescent readouts to monitor and enrich correct homology directed repair (HDR) by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leonetti et al., 2016</xref>). Pilot testing led to a high rate of successful knock-in human embryonic kidney (HEK)293T cells with expected localization of Rab11a (10–20%) or Rab11b (2–10%), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). For further work, we selected a commonly used cell line model for ovarian cancer, A2780, and knocked-in mNeonGreen or mCherry after the start codon of Rab11a or Rab11b, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This integration, although less efficient (0.2–1%) compared to HEK293T, was specific as all sorted cells exhibited correct Rab11a/b localization, and our protocol was also successful in a second ovarian cancer cell line that has defective homologous recombination (BRCA-1 mutant COV362 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Beaufort et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Western blotting with antibodies that recognize Rab11a, or both Rab11a and Rab11b, confirmed knock-in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canaj et al., 2019</xref>), a proportion of cells showed truncation of the linker flanking the FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) but not in the integrated homologous arms, indicating that sorting cells for fluorescence (or another functional protein) is important for establishing in frame knock-in at the N-terminus preserving protein function. This potential caveat was demonstrated by our effort to knock-in an additional non-fluorescent component, antiGFPnanobody, together with mCherry. Although knock-in to the Rab11a locus showed the expected localization of mCherry-Rab11a in all sorted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), integration of the antiGFPnanobody sequence was not complete in ~90% of mCherry-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B-C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A rapid and efficient pipeline for CRISPR/Cas9 knock-in of fluorescent proteins at the endogenous locus of Rab11 family members.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Schematic representation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mediated knock-in strategy of different fluorophores with corresponding homologous arms (A), the ssDNA preparation technique (IVT=in vitro transcription; RT=reverse transcription; RE=restriction endonuclease; purif.=purification using magnetic SPRI beads) (B), and our optimized pipeline (RNP=ribonucleoprotein complex) (C).

The most promising candidate was the advanced non-leaky TRE3GS promoter of the third-generation tetracycline-inducible system (Tet-On 3G) as it offered conditional and reversible control regulated by the small molecule doxycycline (dox). Analysis of 365 bp TRE3GS promoter revealed four potential translation initiation ATG codons, all of which could be designed out of frame to the endogenous start codon, leading to multiple premature stop codons in transcripts driven by basal expression of the endogenous active promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

We identified two Rab11b splice variants that could produce protein coding products of similar molecular weight to the single band observed in A2780 cells by western blotting (201 [24.5 kDa] and 202 [20 kDa]). The main Rab11b protein-coding splice variant 201 is ~4× more abundant than the protein-coding splice variant 202, consistent with eQTLs analysis of ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and DExCon modification did not significantly influence their relative abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Specific primers that detect splice variants 201, 202, and a third (short and likely untranslated) 204 variant indicated that the latter is expressed, but again the DExCon module did not change the ratio of Rab11b splice variants 201/202/204 upon dox induction. This suggests that the DExCon module can recapitulate the spectrum of splice variant expression from the Rab11b locus and provides an advantage over generation of a knock-out cell line and subsequent tet-inducible protein-coding rescue from a viral vector containing cDNA.</p><p>To exemplify the versatility of our CRISPR knock-in pipeline, we generated double mNeonGreen/mCherry knock-in at Rab11a/Rab11b loci, respectively, with and without the DExCon module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). In all combinations, endogenous Rab11a/Rab11b localization driven by dox-induced or endogenous promoter was significantly correlated, and both Rab11a and Rab11b concentrated in vesicles at the perinuclear recycling compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). By contrast, transient transfection of plasmids coding FP-Rab11a/Rab11b gave very bright overlapping signals, but large vesicles were observed particularly toward the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These findings were confirmed when red/green-FPs were switched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>) and suggest that DExCon can induce expression from the endogenous gene locus that preserves physiological distribution of the protein within cells with signal intensities compatible with low light/exposure live microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>).

Exposing cells to different dox concentrations appeared to have a dose-dependent effect when analyzed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>); however, fluorescence microscopy revealed that the difference was primarily due to the number of responding cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Nevertheless, we noticed a positive correlation between expression of Tet-On 3G transactivator, reported as mTagBFP fluorescence, and mNeonGreen-Rab25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <italic>R</italic>=0.43, p=0.0003). Taking advantage of this, we sorted for mNeonGreen-Rab25 expression and analyzed Rab25 and mTagBFP levels. Dox-induced Rab25 expression levels in ‘low’ sorted cells were comparable to endogenous Rab25 expression levels in OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell lines over 48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) and Rab25 expression levels correlated with Tet-On 3G levels as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The ability to re-induce previously sorted expression levels was preserved over several months under standard cell culture conditions and reached maximal fluorescence after 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These results indicate that the DExCon approach was able to re-activate endogenous silenced Rab25 on demand and levels could be tuned to match endogenous, physiologically relevant expression levels.</p><p>While DExCon was able to temporally control Rab25 expression, this method lacks spatial control. We therefore explored the newly developed PA-Tet-OFF/ON system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamada et al., 2018</xref>), which has not previously been applied at an endogenous locus, to establish a light inducible ‘LUXon’ variant of DExCon. This system integrates the cryptochrome 2 cryptochrome-interacting basic helix-loop-helix 1 light-inducible binding switch with Tet-binding domains of Tet repressor (TetR) (residues 1–206) as the split DNA-binding domain, and the transcription activation domain of p65 (p65 AD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We tested PA-Tet-OFF or PA-Tet-ON and versions with improved blue-light sensitivity (ON2; OFF2), stably delivered by lentivirus. Cells stably expressing PA-Tet-ON2, PA-Tet-OFF1, or two were then edited by mNeonGreen DExCon knock-in to the Rab25 locus, illuminated by blue light for 24 hr and sorted, all showing the expected Rab25 endosomal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). Cyclical exposure to light/dark led to repeatable re-silencing of Rab25, and the level of re-activation could be modulated by timing of blue light which is one of the major advantages of a light-inducible gene expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G</xref>). As these systems responded to the weak blue-light exposure used (~6.8 W/m<sup>2</sup>), we found the additional layer of dox control to prevent leakiness of the system very practical. Dox addition with blue light was necessary to re-activate Rab25 in PA-Tet-ON2 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), while dox addition to PA-Tet-OFF1/2 completely blocked expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>).

In this assay, a monolayer of the cells grown on a thick layer of collagen supplemented with non-labeled fibronectin is wounded and then overlaid with another layer of collagen supplemented with far-red labeled fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). The advantage of this approach is that system can be partly illuminated and Rab25 expressing cells can be monitored migrating toward the far-red fibronectin labeled cell-free area. This approach allowed us to demonstrate that Rab25 expression can be induced locally in 3D matrices and is suggestive of a link between Rab25 re-expression levels and increased invasiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). To quantify this, we next illuminated cell spheroids overlaid by 3D matrix, modulating the exposure to blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–N</xref>). Longer exposure to blue light led to brighter mNeonGreen signal in both PA-Tet-OFF/ON systems with expected Rab25 localization in polarized/elongated cells interacting with matrix fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1H</xref>). When all cells were pre-illuminated 2 days before invasion to induce Rab25 expression, we saw a significant dose-dependent effect of Rab25 induction via light exposure for over 6 hr on invasion that was not observed in the presence of dox in the TET-OFF system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L–N</xref>). Adjusting the illumination protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1I</xref>), activating Rab25 expression with constant blue light for 24 hr before spheroid formation/invasion, led to a light-dose dependent effect where the most invasive cells were those illuminated the longest approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J,K</xref>).

ATAC-seq dataset analysis further suggested that the chromatin structure of the silenced Rab25 locus, both in promoter and enhancer sequences, is less accessible for transcriptional machinery to drive transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To prove that slower Rab25 DExCon expression kinetics in A2780 cells can be simply explained by the decrease of DNA accessibility for transcription, we knocked in TRE3GS-mNeonGreen to the Rab11a or Rab25 loci of OVCAR-3 cells, an ovarian cancer line where both Rab11a and Rab25 are endogenously expressed. Dox induction again led to the correct localization of Rab11a or Rab25, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), but this time there was no delay in the normalized expression kinetics of Rab25, as was observed for A2780 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Interestingly, in both A2780 and OVCAR-3 cells Rab11a DExCon always led to greater fluorescence intensity compared to Rab25 DExCon, suggesting additional mechanisms of protein level control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We further explored the possibility of simultaneous visualization of different alleles of the same gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). We were able to successfully modify a second allele of mCherry-Rab11a, mCherry-Rab11b, or DExCon-mCherry-Rab11b modified cells by knocking in DExCon-mNeonGreen modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement Figure 5—figure supplements 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2A-C</xref>). Dox-mediated induction led to consistent almost identical localization in all cells with alleles modified with mCherry and DExCon-mNeonGreen for both Rab11a and Rab11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>). Consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>), DExCon-mNeonGreen-Rab11a was slightly more diffuse than DExCon-mCherry-Rab11b in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This demonstrates that DExCon-induced Rab11 expression levels do not appreciably alter localization of the GTPases and generate signals compatible with routine imaging.</p><p>Unexpectedly, expression kinetics of double DExCon-mCherry/DExCon-mNeonGreen Rab11b cells were noticeably different between mCherry and mNeonGreen modified Rab11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>). While the mNeonGreen kinetics of Rab11a expression were still slightly faster than mNeonGreen of Rab11b, the mCherry Rab11b fluorescence displayed significant delay similar in both Rab11a/b and Rab11b double DExCons cells. When DExCon cells were pre-induced with dox for 24 hr, followed by dox removal, a decrease in fluorescence was observed over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). mCherry-Rab11b showed remarkably stable fluorescence, whereas mNeonGreen-Rab11b was lost more rapidly. Stable fluorescence of mCherry was also observed for nanobody-mCherry DExCon Rab11s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1G</xref>). By contrast, mNeonGreen fluorescence continuously declined overtime, where Rab11a and Rab11b decreased in intensity more rapidly than Rab25 following dox removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). This suggests that the FP is an important consideration when using FP-knock-in to understand protein dynamics but opens the possibility of modifying individual (e.g. mutant vs non-mutant) alleles within cells to study their stability and function.</p><media id="video13" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-76651-video13.mp4"><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>Timelapse (Incucyte S3 system, 20x) of protein expression kinetics of mNeonGreen-Rab11a/mCherry-Rab11b or mNeonGreen-Rab11b/mCherry-Rab11b double DExCon cells (A2780) treated by doxycycline (dox) (from time 0).</title><p>Timelapse covers total 49 hr with frame taken every 30 min (∼30 min elapsed time per second of the movie); 96 well tissue culture plates (Corning); RPMI fenol-free media.

Knock-out phenotypes were reversed when Rab11a/b expression was re-activated with dox; however, induction of degradation with IAA did not oppose this rescue, suggesting that IAA induced Rab11b depletion is incomplete in the presence of dox and is not sufficient to mimic the knock-out phenotype.

Dox-induced re-expression of Rab11b had a dose-dependent dominant-negative effect on invasion under all combinations, sufficiently blocking even Rab11a rescue. The negative effect of Rab11b rescue was reversed by simultaneous dox/IAA co-treatment and led to cell invasion comparable to wt control cells or even significantly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>) despite the cytotoxic effect of IAA observed on individually migrating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D,E</xref> vs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

Indeed, mCherry fluorescence intensity of DExogron Rab11b cells or DExogron-Rab11b/DExCon-Rab11a cells was slightly, but significantly, decreased below the fluorescence of dox/IAA co-treated cells as early as 1–4 hr after switching to dox-free media supplemented only with IAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and returned to non-detectable levels in 24–48 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>).

We further tested how DExCon/DExogron controlled Rab11 family expression level influenced recycling of internalized TFN to test the function of these re-expressed proteins in a different context. DExCon or DExogron modified Rab11a or Rab11b cells which lack expression of the targeted GTPase(s) had little impact on TFN-R recycling at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that fast recycling is likely predominant in A2780 cells as in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheff et al., 1999</xref>). Re-expression of Rab25 did not impact upon recycling, indicating that this Rab11 family member may have a limited influence on trafficking this cargo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, dox-induced high-level expression of either Rab11a or Rab11b under DExCon/DExogron control decreased the level of recycling at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), consistent with the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ren et al., 1998</xref>), perhaps by favoring the slow-recycling route. DExCon/DExogron Rab11a/b cells selected for expression levels comparable to endogenous Rab11a/b knock-in did not have any significant effect on TFN-R recycling rate compared to the non-modified control, indicating that it is the expression level that slows recycling. Similarly, IAA/Dox co-treatment of DExogron-Rab11b cells led to near-physiological levels of Rab11b which had no significant effect on TFN-R recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Surprisingly, TFN-R recycling slowed by high Rab11a DExCon levels was restored to the level of double knock-out cells by lowering Rab11b levels with DExogron (Rab11a DExCon/Rab11b DExogron, IAA/dox co-treatment).

However, the ability to control gene expression is lost following irreversible deletion, and this system does not allow evaluation of the phenotypic effects across a spectrum of different expression levels. Our DExCon/Dexogron/LUXon approaches are attractive alternatives as they offer, in addition to reversible inactivation of protein-coding genes, conditional and (for LUXon) spatiotemporal expression control of re-activated genes which are visualized by an introduced FP.</p><p>Other approaches to modulate endogenous gene expression have used components of lac repression and tet activation systems introduced to the endogenous promoter sequence or downstream, including ‘Reversible Manipulation of Transcription at Endogenous loci-control’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2017</xref>). Our approach differs because it bypasses the function of the endogenous promoter and does not require insertion of effector binding sites that can perturb target gene expression. Our one-step CRISPR knock-in based method is best suited for any genes whose protein-coding transcripts share the initial ATG codon and can be N-terminally tagged, or introduce the DExCon module upstream of alternatively edited genes. For genes where the fluorophore would have to be introduced internally or C-terminally, two-step CRISPR knock-in approaches are necessary (one for TRE3GS promoter, second for FP). Although our system does not silence transcription driven by an endogenous active promoter, it generates non-sense frameshifts in transcripts originating from the endogenous promoter and can activate silenced transcripts. This offers advantages over methods that alter promoter methylation (e.g. dCas9 fused to transcriptional activators or repressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pflueger et al., 2019</xref>, which can create modifications over several tens of kilobases and impact off-target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groner et al., 2010</xref>) and overcomes the limit of classical knock-in where low expression confounds detection or protein products. Furthermore, in contrast to transient transfection of exogenous vectors, DExCon preserves splicing control and allows analysis of the full complement of physiologically localized isoforms within cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>).</p><p>The AID system is an excellent method of protein down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nishimura et al., 2009</xref>), which has since been further developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Röth et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yesbolatova et al., 2020</xref>) allowing rapid degradation of target proteins. Using CRISPR, we successfully applied the improved AID system to the endogenous locus of Rab11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2019</xref>); however, the incorporation of degron miniIAA7 tag in front of mCherry at the Rab11b locus resulted in a profound decrease in mCherry fluorescence without induction by IAA, and induction did not lead to complete protein removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Our combination of degron and DExCon (DExogron), however, can generate robust expression and allows additional fine temporal control of the DExCon system, providing a system that can reveal acute phenotypes that otherwise might be masked by compensation or a dominant terminal phenotype.</p><p>For broad application of strategies such as DExCon, feasibility and efficiency are critical. One of the main obstacles to gene editing via HDR is its low efficiency, which complicates targeting all alleles, generation, and selection of homozygous knock-in modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gurumurthy et al., 2019</xref>). Our optimized magnetofection mediated delivery of Hifi Cas9 as a RNP complex with single-stranded donor DNA ensured precise and on-target integrations to endogenous Rab11 family gene loci reflected by expected localization in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although truncated integration events are often reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Canaj et al., 2019</xref>), functional flanking components (tet-responsive promoter and FP) allow selection of polyclonal populations with full integration of the ssDNA template (including for example the nanobody anti-GFP domain), negating the need for comprehensive and labor-intensive genotyping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). We demonstrated the robustness of our approach by generating single, double, and triple knock-in DExCon at the endogenous loci of Rab11 family genes in A2780 cells without the need for clonal selection. Our strategy further offers sufficient expression modulation from monoallelic modifications; therefore, we could independently target alleles of the same gene using combinations of different donors (DExCon-mNeonGreen, DExCon-mCherry, antibiotic resistance [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>]). As proof of principle, we imaged protein products of both Rab11b alleles to demonstrate new possibilities, for example, studying the dynamics of mutant and wildtype alleles of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. When simultaneously delivering DExCon together with antibiotic resistance to a second allele, we observed a dramatic increase in selection efficiency from 0.2 to 25% (FP-positive dox-responsive cells surviving antibiotic treatment) allowing for easy enrichment of homozygous edits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Sequential delivery of antibiotic resistance to DExCon-Rab11a and -Rab11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-F</xref>) further improved editing outcome, effectively generating a knockout of one allele to ensure that all protein generated by cells from the second allele is tagged appropriately (mNeonGreen/mCherry in this case), full knock-out with dox-controlled expression. The conventional Tet-OFF/ON system is widely used in various research models, such as transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>) and can be easily combined with our DExCon/DExogron/LUXon strategy for a huge range of applications across the field of biology. Notably, DExogron harbors promising application also for essential genes with knock-out lethal phenotypes. Here, the continual presence of dox or the transition from Tet-on to Tet-off system would be required, and IAA treatment could induce immediate knock-out effect.</p><p>To demonstrate the potency of our strategies on closely related genes, we deployed them to study members of the Rab11 family (Rab11a, Rab11b, and Rab25) in an ovarian cancer cell line that lacks endogenous Rab25 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We demonstrated that spatiotemporal re-activation of silenced endogenous Rab25 expression can promote invasive migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J–O</xref>), and that Rab11b and Rab11a may have complementary functions in migration and invasion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–I</xref>). We identified and reversibly rescued two Rab11b protein-coding splice variants (201 [24.5 kDa] and 202 [20 kDa]) in a physiologically proportional manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Mutants of Rab11 that lack the C-terminus, similar to Rab11b variant 202, have previously been shown localize diffusely and are unable to bind and recycle TFN-R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schlierf et al., 2000</xref>). However, we observed specific endosomal localization of CRISPR/Cas9-modified Rab11b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) likely corresponding with the 201 variant and suggesting that the 202 variant is not a significant protein product. Interestingly, cells migratory/invasive responses appear to be sensitive to expression levels, particularly for Rab11b. Cells handle recycling cargoes by numerous routes simultaneously, and these differences could be explained by favoring trafficking of a cargo along Rab11b routes by increasing expression, for example, Rab11/Arf6 and Rab4-dependent trafficking of α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins appear to act as competing pathways in migrating cells to modulate migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caswell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgan et al., 2013</xref>). The tunable Rab11 family expression control further revealed a pleiotropic effect of Rab11a/b, and Rab25, on their recognized cargo TFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>) and further suggests that cells may be sensitive to Rab11 re-expression levels that can change the coordination of membrane trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheff et al., 1999</xref>). Rab11a/b seem to have little influence on the rate of TFN recycling when knocked-out by DexCon/DExogron, suggesting that Rab4 rapid recycling (or other routes) predominate in the cells used in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). The ability of Rab11a/b to divert TFN via a longer recycling route to delay return to the surface likely stems from TFN receptor carrying capacity, as higher DexCon/DExogron Rab11 levels have physiological endosomal membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). Interestingly, lowering/tuning Rab11b expression restored TFN-R recycling rate slowed by high Rab11a levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>), and Rab25 expression, even at high level, has no discernible effect on TFN recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), as found previously in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casanova et al., 1999</xref>. Rab11a/b/25 colocalize with TFN to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>), and it is therefore interesting to speculate that this could be underpinned by their different relocalization/recycling kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5M</xref>) or by differences in effector recruitment pathways/cargo selectivity.</p><p>DExCon/DExogron tools allowed us to quantify surprising differences between Rab11 family members. We found that our system reflects the accessibility for transcriptional machinery to drive transcription at the endogenous locus, demonstrating that Rab11a has significantly faster expression kinetics and compared to Rab11b and re-activated Rab25 expression is slower still (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). However, in cells with endogenous Rab25 expression, expression kinetics are demonstrable faster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We also demonstrated that the ability to relocalize differed significantly between Rab11 family members with Rab25 as the least dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K–M</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-C</xref>). The faster relocalization rate of Rab11a over Rab11b could be explained by its more diffuse localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>), which could suggest it is less stably associated with endosomal membranes. Furthermore, we observed a population of Rab25 specific vesicles in the nuclear periphery which appeared to be less mobile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), and these vesicles were always negative for TFN receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>). Such vesicles with limited mobility were recently described to be located on the nuclear envelope, where they exhibit propensity to undergo fusion and act as a novel endosomal route from the cell surface to the nucleoplasm that facilitates the accumulation of extracellular and cell surface proteins (e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)) in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shah et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaumet et al., 2015</xref>). Rab25-mediated EGFR recycling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caswell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caswell et al., 2008</xref>) and elevated levels of nuclear EGFR correlate with poor prognosis in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Xia et al., 2009</xref>), and our data which suggest that Rab25 may be connected with nuclear envelope-associated endosomes warrants further investigation.</p><p>Overall, the work presented here opens new avenues not only for the precise expression control of endogenous genes, but also for the manipulation and imaging of gene function. All the benefits of gene editing can be obtained in one CRISPR based knock-in. DExCon, DExogron, and LUXon are powerful tools that allow new insight into the function of individual genes and closely related gene families.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Combimag nanoparticles (OZBiosciences) were used according to the manufacturer suggestions, with a magnetic plate. To increase HDR efficiency of shorter homologous arms used for Rab11b knock-in (100–150 bases), RAD51-stimulatory compound 1 (RS-1, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Song et al., 2016</xref>) was successfully implemented in our protocol (20 µM prior magnetofection), but did not improve efficiency with longer arms used for Rab11a and Rab25 (300 bases).

Sequences of tracrRNA and donor plasmids used for ssDNA preparation, all designed to be resistant to Cas9 cleavage, are provided in excel file S1. The amount of long ssDNA (15–105 ng) was critical to optimize for each ssDNA preparation method as excess of highly pure full-length ssDNA led to profound cell death and was sometimes accompanied by non-specific knock-in events. Knock-in was verified by FP expression and localization, and FACS sorted cells validated for specific full-length knock-in by western blot and by sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA.

Calculated halftimes of Rab11 family members generated through individual curve fits were tested for significant differences via one way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>High throughput imaging and expression/degradation kinetics</title><p>Incucyte S3 Live Cell Analysis system, situated in temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> controlled incubator, was used for high throughput imaging. Images of cells in phenol red-free RPMI media (Thermo, #11835030) supplemented with 10% v/v FBS and ciprofloxacin (0.01 mg/ml; Sigma) were acquired with a 10×/1.22 Plan Fluor (wound healing, proliferation) or 20×/ 0.61 S Plan Fluor (fluorescence kinetics) objective and the green and red filter set for fluorescence images with standard exposure settings. Wound healing: confluent A2780 cells seeded on 96-well ImageLock microplates were pre-treated for 24±dox (250 ng/ml)±IAA (100 μg/ml), scratched by the WoundMaker to create homogeneous 700–800 µm wide wounds and automatically imaged every 30 min or 1 hr in RPMI phenol-free media ±dox/IAA using Incucyte S3 system. This system automatically detected and quantified the ratio of the cell-occupied area to the total area of the initial scratched region (phase-contrast). This data was then processed as whole data aggregates and individual wells (n=6–9 across three replicates) were fitted by one-phase association function (Prism software) to calculate the time needed to close 50% of the normalized wound area. Cell proliferation was analyzed on Costar 96 flat bottom plates (Corning 3596) by Incucyte software trained to recognize cell occupied area (=confluence %) based on the brightfield images taken every 30 min and its change over 72 hr. At time 0, cells were seeded sparsely (5–10 thousand cells/well)±dox (250 ng/ml)±IAA (100 μg/ml) and the logarithm of two calculated from the cell confluence normalized to 5 hr (starting point of potential dox/IAA effect). Curves slopes were then obtained by linear regression from the linear part of the individual curves (5–40 hr; n=6–9 across three replicates) and used for calculation of the doubling time [T] by the formula T=log(2)/slope. For fluorescence expression/degradation kinetics analyzed by Incucyte, approximately 20,000 cells were seeded per well of Costar 96 flat bottom plate (Corning 3596)±dox/IAA and immediately imaged (red/green/bright) every 30 min (first 2 hr every 15 min) up to 72 hr. Fluorescence intensity was automatically analyzed as integrated fluorescence intensity per image divided by phase area confluence change to count for the effect of cell proliferation. To calculate halftime of degradation (expression) kinetics induced by IAA treatment (Dox), data were fitted by one-phase association function. Where appropriate, individual values were scaled per their range as to normalize differences between datasets for comparison (minimum and maximum set at 0 and 1000 respectively).</p><p>A BioTek Synergy H1 microplate reader was used to analyze expression kinetics or protein stability of dox-preinduced cells seeded confluent (100% monolayer) in Costar 96 flat bottom plate (Corning 3596)±dox with Leibovitz’s L-15 phenol red-free (CO<sub>2</sub> independent media; #21083027 Thermofisher) supplemented with 10% v/v FBS and ciprofloxacin (0.01 mg/ml). Readings were captured every 1 hr over 24–48 hr at 37°C (gain 100 399/454; gain 100 490/517 nm; gain 150 580/610 nm). A2780 cells were growing in L-15 media only up to a monolayer and differences in cell numbers were during readings negligible (mTagBFP fluorescence of Teton3G-T2A- mTagBFP). To be able to monitor fluorescence change over 72 hr, cells were seeded 24 hr before the experiment ±dox and fluorescence intensity measured over the following 48 hr. To account for the phototoxic effect of fluorescence readings and compare differences between datasets, fluorescence kinetics were scaled per their range (minimum and maximum set at 0 and 1000 respectively). Data were aggregated and fitted by one-phase association function (to calculate halftime) or by polynomial function.</p><p>Statistics were calculated from halftimes generated through individual curve fits (expression kinetics) or slopes derived from the linear part of the curve (protein stability), unless otherwise indicated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>CDM and 3D invasion assays</title><p>CDMs were generated as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caswell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cukierman et al., 2001</xref>). Briefly, plates were coated with 0.2% gelatin (v/v, Sigma Aldrich), crosslinked with 1% glutaraldehyde (v/v, Sigma Aldrich), and quenched with 1 M glycine (Thermo Fisher) before TIFs were confluently seeded. DMEM medium supplemented with 25 µg/ml ascorbic acid (v/v, Sigma Aldrich) was changed every 48 hr for 8 days. Cells were denuded with extraction buffer (0.5% v/v) Triton X-100; 20 mM ammonium hydroxide (NH<sub>4</sub>OH) to leave only matrix. Finally, phosphodiester linkages in the DNA backbone were cleaved by DNAse I (Lonza).</p><p>Collagen/FN matrix for invasion assays was prepared as follows: Collagen solution (10 mg/ml, Corning #354249) was diluted to the final mix: 2.25 mg/ml, 1×RPMI, 15 mM HEPES (750 mM), 8.5 mM NaOH (1 M), 0.4% NaHCO3 (7.5 %, Sigma), 5 µg/ml folic acid, and supplemented with 25 µg /ml fibronectin (labeled or un-labeled as needed). FN was dialyzed into PBS by Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Casette (Thermo) and conjugated with Alexa-fluor 647 NHS ester (Thermo). For LUXon invasion experiments Alexa-647 conjugated FN was then supplemented in a 1:10 ratio (labeled/non-labeled, total 25 µg/ml). For the modified 3D cell-zone exclusion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gemperle et al., 2019</xref>), 50 µl of the collagen/FN (un-labeled) mix was added into well of a 96-well plate and polymerized at 37°C. Cell suspension (100 μl; 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) was added on top of the collagen/FN gel. After cell attachment (4 hr), the medium was removed and scratch was performed. Immediately after removal of the rest of media in the generated wound, another layer of collagen/FN mix (100 μl, including FN-647) was added (schematic of the experiment is shown in 3I). Collagen was allowed to polymerize for 30 min at RT/37°C, RPMI medium added, and cells incubated for 24 hr at 37°C in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere to allow invasion. For spatiotemporal re-activation of Rab25 expression, wells were partly illuminated by blue LED for first 9 hr (black plasticine was used to block light on 80% of the well area).</p><p>Spheroids of uniform size were prepared using MicroTissues 3D Petri Dish micro-mold spheroids (microtissues; #12–81) for on-chip spheroid invasion assays. Briefly, 600 μl of 2% UltraPure Agarose (v/v in PBS; Sigma) was allowed to form gels in 3D petri dish micro-mold with 81 circular recesses (9 × 9 array; 800 μm each in diameter). 40,500 cells/190 μl (500 cells/spheroid with an estimated diameter 100 μm) were introduced to the micro-mold and allowed to self-assemble into spheroid over 48 hr. To increase the compactness of the spheroid, 10% serum was changed to 1% on the second day of spheroid formation (±dox/IAA). Medium was fully aspirated and 190 μl of collage/FN introduced and polymerized at 37°C. Chip with 81 spheroids embedded in collagen/FN gel were overlayed with 0.8–1% UltraPure Agarose (v/v in PBS) to prevent gel movement and shrinking. Finally, chips were overlayed with RPMI media (10% serum;±dox/IAA 2 × excess to count for the volume of agarose), imaged (4 × objective, phase contrast) and cells allowed to invade for 48–72 hr at 37°C in a humidified 5% (v/v) CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere (±blue light illumination) before additional imaging.

While re-tagging Rab11a, Rab11b and Rab25 in other cell lines is not really practical, using a few other cargoes (that are differentially regulated) would substantially enhance the paper. For example, comparing various Rab11 members and recycling of a few different integrin receptors (that have different recycling kinetics) would be very interesting, especially since transferrin is bulk recycled and does not have very intricate regulation that is would be differentially affected by Rab11a, Rab11b or Rab25.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76651.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Using qPCR and semi quantitative rtPCR we determined that the relative abundance of 201 and 202 splice variants is not significantly altered by the DexCon module. This was confirmed with a third primer combination that detects, another predicted splice variant (204, likely untranslated due to an early stop codon) in addition to 201 and 202 and demonstrated that the relative ratio of splice variants is not altered upon fluorescent-tagging and CMV-promotor-driven expression of Rab11 from the endogenous locus, although there was slight increase in expression of all three variants from the dox-induced DexCon module. These data are included in a new Figure 2 Figure supplement 1B and described on page 5. For Rab11a, the splicing pattern is more complex, and we were unable to design specific primers to discern the major isoform (201, corresponding to full length ~24.4kDa Rab11a) from other splice variants (all of which generate shorter proteins that lack sequences essential to GTPase function). Unfortunately, we did not have time to test recycling of different integrins within the timeframe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For localisation, we introduced the DExCon-mNeonGreen module into the second allele in cells where the first allele had a conventional mCherry-Rab11a or mCherry-Rab11b allele, introduced DExCon-mNeonGreen into one Rab11b allele and DExCon-mCherry into the second allele in the same cells, and introduced DExCon-mNeonGreen into Rab11a and DExCon-mCherry into Rab11b in the same cells before analysing their localisation using spinning disk confocal imaging (new Figure 5 figure supplement 2). In all CRISPR/Cas9 modified cells the localisation was near identical, although slight differences in the distribution of DExCon-mNeonGreen-Rab11a and DExCon-mCherry-Rab11b were again observed. These data are described in the text on page 13 as below:</p><p>“We further explored the possibility of simultaneous visualization of different alleles of the same gene (Figure 5E; Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C). We were able to successfully modify a second allele of mCherry-Rab11a, mCherry-Rab11b or DExCon-mCherry-Rab11b modified cells by knocking in DExCon-mNeonGreen modules (Figure 5F; Figure 5—figure supplement 1F,2A-C). Dox-mediated induction led to consistent almost identical localization in all cells with alleles modified with mCherry and DExCon-mNeonGreen for both Rab11a and Rab11b (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-C). Consistent with previous results (Figure 2E; Figure 2—figure supplement 2E), DExCon-mNeonGreen-Rab11a was slightly more diffuse than DExCon-mCherry-Rab11b in the same cells (Figure 5—figure supplement 2D). This demonstrates that DExCon-induced Rab11 expression levels do not appreciably alter localization of the GTPases and generate signals compatible with routine imaging.”</p><p>For function of the DExCon-expressed Rab11a/b/25, we see clear positive effects on cell migration in 2D and in 3D matrix, which suggests these proteins are fully functional (when expressed at an appropriate level; Rab25: Figure 3K-N); (Rab11a/b 2D migration Figure 6F, 3D migration Figure 6G-I). We also tested the influence of Rab11a, Rab11b and Rab25 expression on TFN-R recycling. We found that the DExCon/DExogron induced knockout of Rab11a/b did not appreciably influence TFN-R recycling. This is consistent with the majority of TFN-R being recycled by the fast Rab4-dependent pathway, as is the case in other cell lines (e.g. MDCK cells, DOI: 10.1083/jcb.145.1.123). Indeed, inducing high level expression of Rab11a/b lowered the level of TFN-R recycling (new Figure 7B), consistent with the literature (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.95.11.6187). This effect was also notable at an early recycling timepoint (new Figure 7C), suggesting that this high expression level can divert TFN-R from fast to slow recycling routes. This is addressed in the text on page 20/21 as below:</p><p>“Recycling of TFN-R is typically biphasic with an initial rapid direct route from early endosomes to the plasma membrane (under control of Rab4) and a slower non-essential route that requires additional trafficking through perinuclear recycling endosomes via Rab11<sup>32–34</sup> (Figure 7A). Our previous experiments demonstrated that the DExCon/Dexogron system induces expression of Rab11 family members to promote cell motility (Figure 3N; Figure 6F-H), the expressed proteins show endogenous localization within cells (2E; Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-D) and they traffic together with TFN (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D; Video 3), suggesting that they are fully functional. We further tested how DExCon/DExogron controlled Rab11 family expression level influenced recycling of internalised TFN to test the function of these re-expressed proteins in a different context. DExCon or Dexogron modified Rab11a or Rab11b cells which lack expression of the targeted GTPase(s) had little impact on TFN-R recycling at 30 mins (Figure 7B), suggesting that fast recycling is likely predominant in A2780 cells as in other cell types<sup>34</sup>. Re-expression of Rab25 did not impact upon recycling, indicating that this Rab11 family member may have a limited influence on trafficking this cargo (Figure 7B). However, dox induced high level expression of either Rab11a or Rab11b under DExCon/Dexogron control decreased the level of recycling at 30 minutes (Figure 7B), consistent with the literature<sup>35</sup>, perhaps by favouring the slow recycling route. DExCon/DExogron Rab11a/b cells selected for expression levels comparable to endogenous Rab11a/b knock-in did not have any significant effect on TFN-R recycling rate compared to the non-modified control, indicating that it is the expression level that slows recycling. Similarly, IAA/Dox co-treatment of DExogron-Rab11b cells led to near-physiological levels of Rab11b which had no significant effect on TFN-R recycling (Figure 7B). Surprisingly, TFN-R recycling slowed by high Rab11a DExCon levels was restored to the level of double knockout cells by lowering Rab11b levels with DExogron (Rab11a DExCon/Rab11b DExogron, IAA/dox co-treatment). These data suggest that Rab11a/Rab11b can recycle TFN-R via the slow recycling pathway, and that increasing levels of Rab11a/b could favour the slow recycling route to delay recycling of TFN.</p><p>To test the effect of an acute decrease of Rab11a/Rab11b levels towards the expression driven by endogenous locus, we pre-adapted A2780 cells to high Rab11a/Rab11b levels by treating them with Dox over &gt;7 days before decreasing Rab11 levels by switching to IAA; dox+IAA or dox positive media for 24-48h prior analysis. TFN-R recycling was assessed after 10 minutes to highlight competition between fast and slow recycling routes (Figure 7C). Cells induced to have high level expression of DExCon-mNeonGreen-Rab11a or/and DExogron-mCherry-Rab11b again showed lower levels of TFN-R recycling compared to control (mainly evident for Rab11a), but tempering expression of Rab11a and Rab11b (or Rab11b alone in DExogron-mCherry-Rab11b cells) by withdrawing dox/adding IAA demonstrated that lower Rab11 levels correlated with increased recycling rates (7C). These data further support the notion that competition between fast and slow recycling likely controlled by Rab4 and Rab11a/b respectively underpins the differences in recycling rates induced by increasing Rab11 expression level.</p><p>Taken together, this suggests that the DExCon/DExogron system affords control over the timing and level of gene expression of Rab11 family members, and points towards a more complex relationship between fast Rab11-independent and slow Rab11-dependent recycling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Please repeat the experiment 6F under -dox +IAA conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point and we have addressed this in a new Figure 6 figure supplement 2F and in the text on page 17 as follows:</p><p>“Because IAA induced depletion of DExogron Rab11b was incomplete when expression was driven in the presence dox, we pre-induced DExogron-Rab11b for 24 hours (Figure 6—figure supplement 2F) and then transferred cells to dox-free media with IAA (10 g/ml) for 24 hours before scratch. As expected, this condition led to complete mCherry removal (not detectable by fluorescent microscopy) and was sufficient to reverse the ‘rescued’ motility of DExogron-mCherry-Rab11b or DExogron-mCherry-Rab11b/DExCon-mNeonGreen-Rab11a cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 2F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It would be very interesting and perhaps more informative to analyze Rab11 family in more interesting cellular contexts (instead of transferrin recycling in cancer cells). While re-tagging Rab11a, Rab11b and Rab25 in other cell lines is not really practical, using a few other cargoes (that are differentially regulated) would substantially enhance the paper. For example, comparing various Rab11 members and recycling of a few different integrin receptors (that have different recycling kinetics) would be very interesting, especially since transferrin is bulk recycled and does not have very intricate regulation that is would be differentially affected by Rab11a, Rab11b or Rab25.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment, but for the purposes of the revision we chose to focus on the technical aspects of the approach instead. We are certainly interested in pursuing this in more cancer appropriate cell lines in future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
