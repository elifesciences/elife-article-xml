Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. (2015) to perform conditional gene inactivation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Mosaic analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cannot be easily performed in post-mitotic cells. We therefore, therefore, developed Flip-Flop, a <italic>flippase</italic>-dependent in vivo cassette-inversion method that marks wild-type cells with the endogenous EGFP-tagged protein, whereas mutant cells are marked with mCherry upon inversion. We document the ease and usefulness of this strategy in differential tagging of wild-type and mutant cells in mosaics. We use this approach to phenotypically characterize the loss of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic>, encoding the γ subunit of the AMP Kinase complex. The Flip-Flop method is efficient and reliable, and permits conditional gene inactivation based on both spatial and temporal cues, in a cell cycle-, and developmental stage-independent fashion, creating a platform for systematic screens of gene function in developing and adult flies with unprecedented detail.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26420.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26420.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26420.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The instructions needed to build and maintain cells in an organism are encoded in their DNA. There are many different cell types, and each type only needs a small portion of the information found in the DNA to do its job. Hence, only some of the instructions, in the form of genes, need to be active or ‘expressed’ in any given cell type.</p><p>To understand how a gene works, it is necessary to know in which cell the gene is expressed and where in the cell the gene product – normally a protein – is located. Researchers may study a gene by deleting it, which prevents the protein from being made, or by attaching a new instruction into the gene, which generates a fluorescent tag on the protein to determine where and when it is expressed. Until now, it was not possible to selectively inactivate a gene and simultaneously mark both normal cells containing the protein and mutant cells lacking the protein.</p><p>Based on an existing tagging approach, Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. have now developed a method in which normal and mutant cells of fruit flies are marked differently. A gene of interest is tagged with a fluorescent marker called green fluorescent protein (or GFP). The same gene is then inactivated in some of the cells, which are tagged with a red marker called mCherry. Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. compared normal and mutant cells, and were able to determine how long it takes before the mutant cells become abnormal.</p><p>With this new method, the role of numerous genes in any tissue of adult flies can be reassessed. This will allow to investigate what happens when a protein is removed in specific cells in adult flies. A future goal will be to apply this method to other animals that are more closely related to humans, such as mice, to gain a clearer picture of the role of genes in different cell types and how faulty genes may cause disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26420.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26420.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>MiMIC</kwd><kwd>FLEx</kwd><kwd>SNF4Aγ</kwd><kwd>effete</kwd><kwd>Trim9</kwd><kwd>post-mitotic cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagarkar-Jaiswal</surname><given-names>Sonal</given-names></name><name><surname>Bellen</surname><given-names>Hugo J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS U54 NS093793</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Manivannan</surname><given-names>Sathiya N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NICHD U54 HD083092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zuo</surname><given-names>Zhongyuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010302</institution-id><institution>Robert A. and Renee E.

For <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes whose loss causes early developmental lethality, characterization of gene function in later stages of the animal’s life cycle relies on generating mosaics. Currently, Mosaic Analysis with a Repressible Cell Marker (MARCM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Port et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xue et al., 2014</xref>) are the two major techniques used to study mutations in mosaics. While MARCM has been very successfully used in mitotically active, developing tissues, the technique has two major limitations. First, the technique relies on mitotic recombination and can therefore not be used in non-dividing cells. Second, along with the mutation under study, other mutations in the chromosome distal to the FRT site also become homozygous in mutant cells, requiring ‘rescue experiments’ of the gene of interest to validate the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Roegiers et al., 2009</xref>). Another strategy is based on CRISPR/Cas9-mediated somatic mutagenesis to generate mosaics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Port et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). The limitations of CRISPR/Cas9 are that the identity of the generated lesions for the gene of interest may vary in individual cells in the same animal or tissue. Moreover, the mutant cells are not marked and cannot be distinguished from neighboring wild-type cells.</p><p>Here, we describe a new flippase (FLP)-dependent method ‘Flip-Flop’ that offers several advantages over the current techniques for generating mosaics. (1) The method does not rely on cell division and can, therefore, be broadly used for conditional gene inactivation in post-mitotic cells such as neurons. (2) It allows endogenous tagging of proteins with EGFP, which permits multiple applications, and (3) it simultaneously marks mutant cells with mCherry.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Flip-Flop construct and strategy</title><p>We engineered the ‘Flip-Flop’ cassette for conditional gene inactivation. This cassette contains two modules that are placed in opposite orientation: a protein-trap (PT) module and a gene-trap (GT) module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The PT module carries a splice acceptor (SA), followed by an in-frame EGFP coding sequence, and a splice donor (SD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). The GT module similarly contains a SA, but is followed by the T2A peptide sequence, an mCherry coding sequence, stop codons in all three reading frames, and an SV40 polyA signal. The PT and GT modules are placed in opposite orientations and are flanked by inverted pairs of canonical FRT and FRT14 sites, forming a flip-excision switch (FLEx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schnütgen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). The entire cassette is nested between two inverted <italic>attB</italic> sites that facilitate Recombination-Mediated Cassette Exchange (RMCE) between the Flip-Flop cassette and a target Minos-Mediated Integration Cassette (MiMIC) that resides in a coding intron of the gene of interest. When integrated in the MiMIC in the PT orientation, Flip-Flop should result in expression of the endogenous protein with an internal EGFP tag. The internal EGFP tagging does not or subtly disrupt the protein’s function in 77% of the cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>). The cassette can then be converted from a PT to a GT, in vivo, by inverting the cassette’s orientation through the expression of <italic>FLP</italic> that acts on the FLEx switch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Following the switch from the PT to the GT orientation, transcription is precociously terminated by the polyA sequence. When this truncated transcript is translated, the T2A site induces a translational skip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tang et al., 2009</xref>), truncating the native protein and re-initiating translation at the mCherry sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hence, inversion of the Flip-Flop cassette results in the generation of a truncated protein, which is typically non-functional, and simultaneously marks the cells that are actively transcribing the gene with mCherry. While mCherry’s expression pattern recapitulates the spatiotemporal expression pattern of the recipient gene, it does not reproduce the endogenous subcellular localization of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In summary, expression of <italic>FLP</italic> will induce a Flip-Flop and produce mCherry-labeled mutant cells in which the gene is inactivated, whereas the surrounding cells are wild-type and express the EGFP-tagged protein.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26420.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mosaic generation using the Flip-Flop cassette.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The architecture of the Flip-Flop cassette. The cassette consists of two independent modules (PT and GT), that are oriented in opposite orientations. The PT module contains a splice acceptor (SA), followed by an EGFP tag and a splice donor (SD). The GT module contains a SA sequence, followed by the T2A peptide coding sequence (which will induce a translational skip), the mCherry coding region, stop codons in all three coding frames, and an SV40 polyA transcriptional termination signal. Given the opposite orientation of both modules, only one of the SA sequence will be active with respect to the recipient gene. The two modules are nested within a pair of <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>FRT14</italic> inverted repeats, forming a flippase-responsive FLEx switch. Finally, the entire cassette is flanked by two inverted <italic>attB</italic> sequences that permit <italic>phiC31-</italic>mediated RMCE between the Flip-Flop cassette and pre-existing MiMIC elements. A comparison of the <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>FRT14</italic> sequence is shown below. The <italic>FRT14</italic> sequence varies from the canonical <italic>FRT</italic> sequence at the residues highlighted in red. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic showing the inversion of a PT-oriented Flip-Flop cassette, inserted into the coding intron of a hypothetical gene. Upon <italic>FLP</italic>-expression, the FLEx switch undergoes two recombination events: (1) recombination between the two <italic>FRT</italic> sites or between the two <italic>FRT14</italic> sites leads to cassette inversion that is followed by (2) excision of either the pair of <italic>FRT</italic> sites or the pair of <italic>FRT14</italic> sites, both of which have obtained the same orientation due to the flip. Since the remaining unpaired <italic>FRT</italic> and <italic>FRT14</italic> sites are not able to recombine, the cassette will be locked in the GT orientation. Thus, the initial PT orientation allows the gene to be tracked by EGFP-tagged protein expression in tissues. <italic>FLP</italic> activity inverts the Flip-Flop cassette in random cells, generating a mosaic tissue consisting of cells that did not undergo the flip and are still expressing the EGFP-tagged protein and cells that inverted the Flip-Flop cassette into the GT orientation, which are marked by mCherry expression.

Seven of the nine generated PT insertions complement the lethality associated with loss of the corresponding gene, suggesting that these internally tagged proteins are biologically functional, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Venken et al., 2011</xref>). The PT insertion in <italic>eff</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) introduces the expression of internally tagged Eff (Eff-EGFP-Eff) in the wing discs of <italic>eff<sup>MI05507-EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup></italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> a). Heat-shock-induced expression of <italic>FLP</italic> (<italic>hsFLP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>) causes loss of the EGFP signal and induces mCherry expression in random subsets of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> b-d). Similarly, the PT insertion in <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref> a) leads to SNF4Aγ-EGFP-SNF4Aγ expression in adult egg chambers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> a). The SNF4Aγ Flip-Flop cassette can be flipped to the GT orientation efficiently, generating large clones of cells expressing mCherry upon heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> b-d). Finally, we tagged <italic>Cdep</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref> a-b), observed EGFP expression in the eye-antennal discs, and efficiently induced inversions using <italic>ey-FLP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Hence, the PT orientation insertions permit gene expression analysis and can effectively be inverted to create mCherry marked mutant cells.</p><p>A comparison of the PTs generated using a previous, shorter, RMCE construct (GFSTF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Venken et al., 2011</xref>) and the PT of the Flip-Flop cassette did not show any obvious difference in expression pattern or genetic properties based on complementation tests. In summary, if the protein traps are functional with the GFSTF cassette they are also functional with the EGFP-tagged proteins derived from the Flip-Flop.</p><p>In addition to the above-described PT lines, we generated GT-lines expressing mCherry for five genes: <italic>eff, Cdep</italic>, <italic>Trim9</italic>, <italic>Ank2</italic>, and <italic>Ctrip</italic>. Complementation tests with independently derived loss-of-function alleles (or deficiencies) indicate that these GT-alleles are indeed loss-of-function alleles. Note that none of these GT insertions induce an obvious dominant phenotype. We observed efficient conversion of an initial GT insertion to the PT orientation for <italic>eff<sup>MI05507 T2A-mCherry-EGFP</sup></italic>, using either the <italic>ey-FLP</italic> or <italic>hsFLP</italic> drivers in larval brains. As shown, the use of <italic>ey-FLP</italic> introduces Eff-EGFP-Eff expression in the eye discs (area within white dotted lines), as well as the area of the brain where <italic>eyeless</italic> is expressed (demarcated by blue dotted lines) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). In contrast to the <italic>ey-FLP</italic>, smaller clones of randomly positioned wild-type and mutant cells can be generated by stochastic FLP expression when applying heat shocks. Indeed, heat-shock-induced <italic>hsFLP</italic> expression brought about small patches of EGFP-positive cells in <italic>eff<sup>MI05507 T2A-mCherry-EGFP</sup></italic> larval brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). This type of experiment creates wild-type cells in an otherwise mutant animal and should help to assess whether a mutant phenotype can be attenuated or reverted, or not. In addition, these experiments may help identify in which tissue an essential gene is required.</p><p>Finally, for <italic>Nedd8</italic> and <italic>Sik3</italic> we generated PT lines, but these insertions failed to complement corresponding deficiencies, showing that the internal EGFP tag disrupts protein function. Nevertheless, we were able to induce inversions for both genes using <italic>ey-FLP</italic>, confirming our observation that flipping the Flip-Flop cassette is efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D and E</xref>). In summary, both orientations of the Flip-Flop cassette could effectively be flipped.</p><p>To examine and compare the efficiency of the Flip-Flop inversions, we tested six genes using the same FLP-source, under identical conditions. For <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic>, <italic>Trim9</italic> and <italic>eff,</italic> more than 95% of the cells undergo cassette inversion. For <italic>Nedd8</italic>, <italic>cdep,</italic> and <italic>Sik3</italic>, more than 70% cells displayed Flip-Flop inversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Hence, inducing Flip-Flop inversions in eye-antennal discs is highly efficient for all genes tested.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conditional gene inactivation using Flip-Flop in post-mitotic cells</title><p>Next, we tested if Flip-Flop can be used for gene inactivation in post-mitotic cells by using <italic>Trim9</italic> as an example. Previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al. (2011)</xref> created an imprecise excision of a P-element (P{GawB}Trim9[NP4638]) inserted in the 5′-regulatory region of <italic>Trim9</italic> and reported that animals lacking the first few amino acids of Trim9 are viable and exhibit a droopy wing phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2011</xref>). We generated both GT- (<italic>Trim9<sup>MI12525P T2A-mCherry-EGFP</sup></italic>) and PT-oriented (<italic>Trim9<sup>MI12525EGFP- T2A-mCherry</sup></italic>) Flip-Flop insertions in <italic>Trim9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> a). The GT insertion is homozygous lethal and does not complement a deficiency (<italic>Trim9<sup>Df</sup></italic>), while the PT insertion is viable in trans over <italic>Trim9<sup>Df</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref> b) suggesting that the PT encodes a functional protein.

This, together with the lethality observed in the GT insertion, suggests that a strong loss of <italic>Trim9</italic> leads to early developmental lethality.</p><p>We then examined the consequences of neuronal loss of <italic>Trim9</italic>, by inverting the <italic>Trim9<sup>MI12525EGFP T2A--mCherry</sup></italic> PT insertion in larval and adult brains using neuronally expressed FLP (<italic>nSyb-GAL4&gt;UAS-FLP</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Prior to the flip, in the PT orientation, <italic>Trim9</italic> is expressed in numerous neurons in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> a-d) and the protein is localised to nuclei and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> e-h). These cells do not express mCherry. Following inversion to the GT orientation, we detected mCherry expressing cells in the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> a’-d’). Upon close examination, we observed three different populations of neurons. First, cells that have undergone cassette inversion and are marked with mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> e’-h’, indicated by number (1) Second, cells that are EGFP-positive (Trim9-EGFP-Trim9) and did not flip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> e’-h’, indicated by number (2) Third, a population of cells that expresses both Trim9-EGFP-Trim9 as well as mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> e’-h’, indicated by number (3) Note that Trim9-EGFP-Trim9 levels are lower in these cells. We reason that these cells have undergone cassette inversion and are hence expressing mCherry, but that the Trim9-EGFP-Trim9 that was produced prior to the flip has not been fully degraded. Thus, the population of cells that express only mCherry must have lost most of the tagged Trim9 protein, whereas Trim9-EGFP-Trim9 perdures in a subset of cells that are yellow. Importantly, this allows analysis of protein perdurance. In addition, it permits researchers to only select and analyse those cells that are truly mutant and have lost the majority of the wild-type protein. Neuronal <italic>Trim9</italic> inactivation does not affect the eclosion of the animal but leads to the sterility of short-lived animals with droopy wings, corroborating previous observations associated with the loss of <italic>Trim9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Song et al., 2011</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26420.011</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inactivation of <italic>Trim9</italic> in post-mitotic cells using <italic>nSyb-GAL4/UAS-FLP</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A third instar larval brain of <italic>nSyb-GAL4/+; Trim9<sup>MI12525EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup>/Trim9<sup>Df</sup></italic>, raised at 29°C stained for EGFP (green, a, d and f), mCherry (red, b, d and g) and Elav (blue, c, d and h).

The ATP/AMP ratio is sensed through an allosteric mechanism by the non-catalytic γ subunit of the AMPK complex, which in turn promotes the phosphorylation of the catalytic α subunit enhancing α subunit’s kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Sanders et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Scott et al., 2004</xref>).

Sensing the ATP/AMP ratio by the γ subunit is thus critical for the proper function of the AMPK complex, and together with the other AMPK subunits, the γ subunit is crucial for proper energy homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hardie et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the γ subunit is encoded by <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic>, with 16 transcriptional isoforms.

In the presence of <italic>UAS-FLP</italic>, the GAL4 from <italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417 T2A&gt;GAL4</sup></italic> will drive FLP expression in cells expressing SNF4A<italic>γ</italic>, which will convert the PT insertion into a GT insertion. The GT insertion, while expressing mCherry, leads to the loss of functional protein produced by the <italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09147EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup></italic> allele. Hence, <italic>UAS-FLP;; SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup>/SNF4Aγ<sup>MI094177 T2A&gt;GAL4</sup></italic> animals lack expression of both alleles of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These animals die as poorly developed pupae and are slim and elongated in the larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> b-c). These larvae show a broad expression of mCherry that resembles the EGFP expression pattern from <italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417EGFP- T2A-mCherry</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> b).</p><p>Next, we induced Flip-Flop inversion in eyes. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye is a highly organised structure that is composed of about 800 small functional units called ommatidia. Every ommatidium contains eight photoreceptor cells (R1-R7) each with a rhabdomere, the light-sensing organelle. Within each ommatidium, rhabdomeres are arranged in a highly stereotypic fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> c control panel, indicated by numbers). In <italic>ey-FLP;;SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup></italic>/<italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>Df</sup></italic> animals, almost all photoreceptors inverted from the PT- to GT- orientation, as revealed by mCherry expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> b’). Inverting the cassette in <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> to a GT orientation reduces the amplitude of the electroretinogram (ERG) in 1-day-old flies. These animals did not show a stronger reduction in ERG amplitude when measured at day 30 and hence do not show further degeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). We also observed a reduction in the number of rhabdomeres as well as defects in photoreceptor organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–c’</xref>). The loss of SNF4Aγ disrupts energy homeostasis, possibly prevents the photoreceptors from meeting their high-energy demand and leading to a reduction in their activity. Similar defects have been described in <italic>alicorn</italic> mutant eye clones (SNF4Aα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Spasić et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously shown that <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> is required for autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lippai et al., 2008</xref>). We, therefore, analysed the role of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> in autophagy in mutant cells generated by Flip-Flop inversion. To this end, we induced Flip-Flop-mediated loss of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> in the adult gut and starved adults for 24 hr by growing them on agar lacking amino acids (aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To analyse the induction of autophagy, we stained adult gut from these animals for p62, a marker that is degraded by autophagy. If <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> is required for autophagy, loss of SNF4Aγ should lead to p62 accumulation in mutant cells, as they should not induce autophagy. However, we observed a loss of p62 in mutant cells (mCherry positive) and robust staining of p62 in control cells (EGFP positive, indicated by red arrows) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, this parallels the observation by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sahani et al. (2014)</xref> in vertebrate cells. These authors observed that following prolonged amino acid starvation, the autophagy marker p62 is restored because of an increase in transcription and translation mediated by the availability of autophagy derived aa. Hence, we propose that loss of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> blocks autophagy, deprives cells of aa during starvation, leading to a loss of p62.

To further characterise the role of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons, we used a post-mitotic GAL4 driver <italic>C155-GAL4</italic>, to drive <italic>UAS-FLP</italic> and obtain GT orientated Flip Flops in all neurons. Such pan-neuronal flip of <italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417EGFP-T2A-mCherry</sup></italic> into a non-functional GT leads to severe locomotor defects in adult flies (data not shown). We also examined the role of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> in adults using <italic>hsFLP-</italic>mediated cassette inversion. Flies of the genotype <italic>hsFLP; SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417EGFP- T2A-mCherry</sup></italic> / <italic>SNF4Aγ<sup>MI09417</sup></italic> were raised at 18°C and were given a 2-hr heat-shock at 37°C, 3 days after eclosion. Two days after the heat-shock, H and E staining of adult brains revealed severe neurodegeneration. The extent of neuronal loss did not worsen by day 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> b and d). In addition, these flies typically die 3 to 4 weeks later. Following heat-shock, animals that do not carry <italic>hsFLP</italic> do not show obvious lesions in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> a and c). We conclude that loss of <italic>SNF4Aγ</italic> leads to neuronal demise in adult flies.</p><p>In conclusion, the Flip-Flop strategy allows conditional gene inactivation and generation of mosaics for a side-by-side comparison of mutant and wild-type cells in the same tissue, while simultaneously marking wild-type and mutant cells with different fluorescent markers. By using different sources of <italic>FLP</italic>, one can control the spatial and temporal pattern of mosaic generation and gene inactivation. Using <italic>hsFLP</italic>, we show that Flip-Flop can be used to severely inhibit gene function during development, as well as in adults in both mitotically active and post-mitotic cells. Flip-Flop can therefore reliably be used to explore gene functions both during development and in adult flies. Recently, a similar Flippase-based conditional gene inactivation method ‘FlpStop’ was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>). Both the FlpStop and Flip-Flop strategies employ a similar Flex switch to induce local cassette inversion. However, there are several important differences between the two technologies. (1) FlpStop does not tag the endogenous protein with a fluorescent tag, while Flip-Flop produces an internally EGFP-tagged protein. While this may seem beneficial for genes where an internal tag is deleterious to the protein, we argue that for the majority of the genes the internal EGFP tag is not detrimental (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, endogenous tagging is very advantageous as it permits to track the expression and subcellular localization of a protein, allows anti-GFP antibody-mediated immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">David-Morrison et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Yoon et al., 2017</xref>), enables ChIP sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nègre et al., 2011</xref>), and permits mRNA or protein removal with iGFPi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Neumüller et al., 2012</xref>) or deGradFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Caussinus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Urban et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, the EGFP tag allows us for the first time to track protein perdurance in mutant cells. (2) The second major difference between FlpStop and Flip-Flop relates to how mutant cells are marked. In FlpStop, tdTomato is expressed under the control of the UAS/GAL4 system. Hence, cells that have undergone inversion will express tdTomato, irrespective of the expression pattern of the gene. In contrast, Flip-Flop will label cells with mCherry only if they express the gene of interest. In summary, the ability to track the loss of the protein of interest in mutant cells concomitant with loss of the EGFP signal while simultaneously marking the mutant cells with mCherry from the same regulatory elements distinguishes Flip-Flop from all other mosaic analyses methods.</p><p>We would like to note that Flip-Flop insertions can be generated based on existing MiMIC insertions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015</xref>) as well as MiMIC-like elements introduced by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and can be extended to <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture system using RMCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Manivannan et al., 2015</xref>). We, therefore, believe that the use of Flip-Flop will permit functional annotation of numerous genes in unprecedented detail.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>Flip-Flop constructs were generated using the following steps: ‘attB-FRT14-FRT-SA-(GGS)4-PhaseX-EGFP-(GGS)4-SD-{SA-3xSTOP-SV40pA}reverse orientation-FRT14-FRT-attB’ for all three reading frames were synthesised in pUC57 (Genewiz).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Buszczak (Reviewer# 1), Frank Schnorrer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes a technique called Flip-Flop, which marks wild-type cells with EGFP-tagged endogenous protein and mutant cells with mCherry. Essentially the method relies on a newly designed MiMIC cassette. This cassette carries EGFP flanked by splice acceptor and donors and a T2A-mCherry flanked by a splice acceptor and multiple stop codons in the inverted orientation. Both fluorescent modules are flanked by FRT, FRT14 and AttB sites. Expressing flippase converts the protein trap into a mutagenic gene trap or vice versa. The authors use a number of specific examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of the technique.</p><p>The data are well-presented and the Flip-Flop technique will be useful to the research community, particularly in the clonal analysis of gene function in post-mitotic cells. This technique also enables the user to evaluate protein perdurance in mutant cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>One way to make this technique far more accessible to various researchers would be to generate a transgenic source of the three Flip-Flop cassettes. This would enable the targeting of currently available MiMIC lines with the Flip-Flop cassette using genetic crosses rather than injections. Is this possible?</p><p>The local chromatin environment may influence Flip-Flopping in different genes in different tissues. Do the authors see any evidence for this? The authors should provide quantification and statistics for the efficiency of Flip-Flopping in different settings, in both different genes and different tissues.</p><p>The authors should acknowledge/discuss that the level to which a GT can reduce gene function will depend on its position within a given gene and the efficiency of splicing. There may also be concerns that protein truncations will act in a dominant negative or neomorphic manner, potentially complicating the interpretation of results. Further discussion of the various advantages and disadvantages of the technique would strength the impact of the paper. Users of Flip-Flop will still have to characterize the degree to which a particular GT disrupts normal gene function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This new strategy uses the MiMIC collection and a new plasmid that can be inserted into the 2 attP sites of the MiMIC lines. It enables an irreversible Flp-induced conversion from a GFP protein trap, which should be functional, to an T2A-Cherry gene trap, which produces a mutant truncated protein, in addition to cytoplasmic Cherry from the endogenous enhancer. A nice by-product is the Cherry labelling of the mutant cells, at least if the gene studied is expressed at detectable levels.</p><p>The authors show that cassette inversion does indeed generate non-functional alleles for 4 genes, for which GFP fusions as viable. Thus, supposedly the tagged protein is functional and the gene trap is lethal. However, these studies were not done in clones.</p><p>For 2 of these genes (Trim 9 and SNF4A γ) they provide data for clonal loss of function phenotypes, in either all neurons during larval development for Trim9, resulting in sterility, or in all cells expressing SNF4a γ during development resulting in pupal lethality. For SNF4a they show that clonal loss of function during eye development also results in some defects. If loss of SNF4a γ is induced in all cells by heat shock specifically in adults the brain neurons degenerate.</p><p>Together, this suggests that the FlipFlop tool works well to induce loss of function phenotypes in a conditional manner for genes in which suitable MiMIC insertions exist. This allows conditional deletion of genes in the adult fly.</p><p>1) For this tool to be used by the broad community it would be important to know how many of the GFP-Cherry genetrap insertions result in functional proteins. As this cassette is much larger than the regular MiMIC exchange cassette I find this critical. The authors test only 6 genes, from which 4 result in viable flies and 2 do not. I would expect at least 10 or 20 cassette exchanges to provide statistics on this important point. By the cassette exchange method using transgenes, as published by the authors in 2016 in <italic>eLife</italic>, it should be easy to do it for a larger number of genes.</p><p>2) I am a bit disappointed by the phenotypical analysis done in this study. The authors don't use the power of the system, having mutant and wild-type cells next to each other to assess cellular phenotypes. The reason for that might be lack of time – see point 3.</p><p>3) The Clandinin lab used a very similar Flp induced method (called FlpStop) to also generate conditional alleles with MiMIC lines. The Flip inversion method appears very similar. Differences are that the wild-type protein is not labelled in the wild type cells and the mutant cells are labelled by UAS-tomato rather than gene trap Cherry (the former might be of advantage at least if the protein of interest is expressed a low level). This other study induced conditional alleles for 6 genes showing that the strategy indeed appears to work generally. As this study was published in February 2017 in <italic>eLife</italic> (Fisher et al.) the authors should compare the 2 strategies at least in the Discussion of a revised version.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26420.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>One way to make this technique far more accessible to various researchers would be to generate a transgenic source of the three Flip-Flop cassettes. This would enable the targeting of currently available MiMIC lines with the Flip-Flop cassette using genetic crosses rather than injections. Is this possible?</italic> </p><p>Yes, this is possible. We recognize that using a genetically deliverable donor for the Flip-Flop cassette will be useful to the community. We have earlier developed such a tool for EGFP-FlAsH-StrepII-TEVcs-3xFlag {GFSTF} tag used for RMCE with existing MiMICs (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015 <italic>eLife</italic>; 4:e08469). This system involved the use of direct FRT repeats to circularize an RMCE cassette in vivo and use it as a donor in a PhiC31 mediated cassette exchange. However, the Flip-Flop cassette uses FRT sites for cassette inversion. Hence, we will need a Cre/LoxP system to generate the donor as done by Diao et al., (Diao et al., 2015). However, cloning of the LoxP sites in a construct with several repetitive elements, creating at least 6-10 transgenes, testing many MiMICS and determining the efficiency will take at least 6-8 months. We will create the genetic donors in the future but it is beyond the scope of this proof-of-principle study.</p><p><italic>The local chromatin environment may influence Flip-Flopping in different genes in different tissues. Do the authors see any evidence for this? The authors should provide quantification and statistics for the efficiency of Flip-Flopping in different settings, in both different genes and different tissues.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that cassette inversion will depend on the accessibility of FRT sites for the Flippase. To examine this in a quantitative fashion for multiple genes, we have extended our initial analysis of Flip-Flop inversion for six genes using the same source of Flippase in identical culture conditions. This analysis reveals that inversion in eye-antennal discs is as follows: for <italic>SNF4Aγ, Trim9</italic> and <italic>eff</italic> the efficiency is more than 95%, whereas for <italic>Nedd8, cdep</italic> and <italic>Sik3</italic> it is higher than 70%. We present these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>. We have also modified the text according to the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><p><italic>The authors should acknowledge/discuss that the level to which a GT can reduce gene function will depend on its position within a given gene and the efficiency of splicing. There may also be concerns that protein truncations will act in a dominant negative or neomorphic manner, potentially complicating the interpretation of results. Further discussion of the various advantages and disadvantages of the technique would strength the impact of the paper. Users of Flip-Flop will still have to characterize the degree to which a particular GT disrupts normal gene function.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. We would like to point out that the splice acceptor site used in Flip-Flop cassette is the same as in the original MiMIC cassette. In our previous study (Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015, <italic>eLife</italic>), we found that 92% of the MiMIC gene trap insertions are severe loss of function alleles of the gene of interest. In contrast, none of the MiMIC insertions in the reverse orientation (non-GT) caused an obvious phenotype. In addition, we checked for aberrant splicing and found no exon skipping in three out of three genes. In our current study, we evaluated the effect of the GT orientations by generating GT-oriented Flip-Flop lines and examined their ability to complement a deficiency. Seven out of nine complemented a deficiency and the encoded protein is tagged with GFP, whereas two GFP insertions failed to complement the def. This is in line with our previously published data where 77% of the tagged proteins with GFP were functional (Nagakar-Jaiswal et al., 2015). Upon Flip-Flop the viable GFP tagged genes became tagged with RFP and all became lethal when tested as homozygotes or over a deficiency, indicating that they are loss of function mutations. Importantly, none of the heterozygous lines show a dominant phenotype, suggesting that we do not induce dominant negative or dominant gain of function mutations. We also did not observe any dominant phenotypes in the 58 strains tested in Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al. that carried SA-polyA tails that caused truncations. In summary, the vast majority of the GT-lines are strong loss of function alleles and do not show a neomorphic/gain-of-function or dominant negative phenotype that could arise from a truncated, yet lingering protein with a dominant negative molecular function. We are aware of the issues raised by the reviewer and will mention some of the above data in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…] 1) For this tool to be used by the broad community it would be important to know how many of the GFP-Cherry genetrap insertions result in functional proteins. As this cassette is much larger than the regular MiMIC exchange cassette I find this critical. The authors test only 6 genes, from which 4 result in viable flies and 2 do not. I would expect at least 10 or 20 cassette exchanges to provide statistics on this important point. By the cassette exchange method using transgenes, as published by the authors in 2016 in eLife, it should be easy to do it for a larger number of genes.</italic> </p><p>The MiMIC cassette is 1400 nt and the current one is 2600 nt. It is not a very big difference and the size does not seem to be an issue. Indeed, we compared the protein traps generated using the previous construct (Venken et al., 2011) and the Flip-Flop cassette for all the lines described in this manuscript. We didn’t find any obvious difference between the expression pattern and the genetics based on complementation tests. If the protein traps are functional with the GFP cassette from Venken et al., they are also functional with GFP derived from the Flip-Flop, and complement each other. This argues that there are no obvious differences between the two tagging methods and we now discuss this finding.</p><p>To accommodate the reviewer’s concern, we have included three more genes that we were in the process of generating prior to submission (<italic>Ctrip, Eip63E</italic> and <italic>Ank2</italic>). We have no other conversions and it would take us many more months to create and test more lines.</p><p><italic>2) I am a bit disappointed by the phenotypical analysis done in this study. The authors don't use the power of the system, having mutant and wild-type cells next to each other to assess cellular phenotypes. The reason for that might be lack of time – see point 3.</italic> </p><p>To satisfy the reviewer we incorporated new data on SNF4Ay. The data are new. They are included in the Results section and we have included them in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The Clandinin lab used a very similar Flp induced method (called FlpStop) to also generate conditional alleles with MiMIC lines. The Flip inversion method appears very similar. Differences are that the wild-type protein is not labelled in the wild type cells and the mutant cells are labelled by UAS-tomato rather than gene trap Cherry (the former might be of advantage at least if the protein of interest is expressed a low level). This other study induced conditional alleles for 6 genes showing that the strategy indeed appears to work generally. As this study was published in February 2017 in eLife (Fisher et al.) the authors should compare the 2 strategies at least in the Discussion of a revised version.</italic> </p><p>We agree that the two strategies employ similar Flex switch to induce local cassette inversion. However, there are main differences between the two studies. Fisher et al., do not tag the endogenous protein with a tag. While this may seem beneficial for genes where an internal tag is deleterious to the protein, we argue that for a clear majority of the genes the internal EGFP tag is not detrimental. The major advantage to the internal tag is the ability to track the expression of the gene of interest. Moreover, it allows anti-GFP antibody mediated immunoprecipitations followed by mass spectroscopy (David-Morrison et al., 2016; Yoon et al., 2017), enables ChIP sequencing (Negre et al., 2011), and permits mRNA or protein removal with iGFPi (Neumuller et al., 2012) or deGradFP (Caussinus et al., 2011; Nagarkar-Jaiswal et al., 2015; Urban et al., 2014). Finally, the EGFP tag allows us for the first time to track protein perdurance in mutant cells.</p><p>The second major difference is the expression of mCherry to mark the mutant cells. In Fisher et al. tdTomato is expressed under the control of the UAS/GAL4 system. Therefore, cells that have undergone cassette flip express tdTomato irrespective of the gene of interest’s expression. This could dilute the effect of true-mutant cells with cells where cassette inversion has occurred but do not bear any consequence to the gene of interest. In contrast, the Flip-Flop technology allows cells to be marked with mCherry only where the cells would otherwise express the gene of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26420.016</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Contrast between the FLPstop and Flip-Flop technologies.</title><p>(Top) A hypothetical gene expression in a wing imaginal disc recapitulated by internally tagged EGFP expression from the Flip-Flop cassette (green). Upon flippase expression mCherry expressing mutant cells are generated within the domain of the gene’s expression. (Botton) FlpStop construct does not provide any information on the expression of the gene. Mosaics generated could lie outside the domain of the gene’s expression and therefore may not be relevant.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26420.016">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26420.016</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26420-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We recognize that the mCherry expression under UAS/GAL4 may be beneficial as it provides a bright read-out compared to that of the T2A mCherry which depends on the gene’s expressivity to be detected. We argue that the loss of EGFP and/or the mCherry together permit the evaluation of the mutant cells and thus the level of mCherry expression alone is not a limiting factor for detecting mutants.</p></body></sub-article></article>
