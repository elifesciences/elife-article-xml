such as the Venus flytrap have evolved spectacular movements to capture animals for nutrient acquisition. However, the molecules that confer this sensitivity remain unknown. We used comparative transcriptomics to show that expression of three genes encoding homologs of the MscS-Like (MSL) and OSCA/TMEM63 family of mechanosensitive ion channels are localized to touch-sensitive trigger hairs of Venus flytrap. We focus here on the candidate with the most enriched expression in trigger hairs, the MSL homolog FLYCATCHER1 (FLYC1). We show that <italic>FLYC1</italic> transcripts are localized to mechanosensory cells within the trigger hair, transfecting <italic>FLYC1</italic> induces chloride-permeable stretch-activated currents in naïve cells, and transcripts coding for <italic>FLYC1</italic> homologs are expressed in touch-sensing cells of Cape sundew, a related carnivorous plant of the Droseraceae family. Our data suggest that the mechanism of prey recognition in carnivorous Droseraceae evolved by co-opting ancestral mechanosensitive ion channels to sense touch.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Dionaea muscipula</kwd><kwd>Drosera capensis</kwd><kwd>ion channels</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32GM101876</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Procko</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1RO1HL143297</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Swetha</given-names></name><name><surname>Keenan</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mousavi</surname><given-names>Seyed Ali Reza</given-names></name><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R35GM122604</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Procko</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name><name><surname>Dabi</surname><given-names>Tsegaye</given-names></name><name><surname>Chory</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Procko</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name><name><surname>Murthy</surname><given-names>Swetha</given-names></name><name><surname>Keenan</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name><name><surname>Mousavi</surname><given-names>Seyed Ali Reza</given-names></name><name><surname>Dabi</surname><given-names>Tsegaye</given-names></name><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name><name><surname>Chory</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010285</institution-id><institution>University of San Diego</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Faculty Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baird</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>George E.

For example, whereas most plants respond slowly to mechanical stimuli—such as touch, gravity, or changes in turgor pressure—by altering growth, some plants have additionally evolved rapid touch-induced movements. These movements can be used to deter herbivory, as is seen with the sensitive plant (<italic>Mimosa pudica</italic>), or to physically capture and digest mobile animals, as occurs in carnivorous plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chehab et al., 2008</xref>). The best known carnivorous plant, <italic>Dionaea muscipula</italic> (Venus flytrap) of the Droseraceae family, is one such plant that has evolved a remarkable and rapid touch response to facilitate prey capture (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). How this predator evolved its complex leaf form and function for this purpose has long puzzled scientists; indeed, Charles Darwin proclaimed the species &quot;one of the most wonderful [plants] in the world&quot; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Darwin, 1875</xref>).</p><media id="video1" xlink:href="elife-64250-video1.mp4" mimetype="video" mime-subtype="mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Touch response of the Venus flytrap.</title><p>Real-time recording of trap closure in response to insect (house fly) touch.</p></caption></media><p>Several groups have described the events that evoke trap closure in Venus flytrap in detail. The plant leaf consists of an open bilobed trap, to which animal prey are attracted by volatile secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kreuzwieser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lloyd, 1942</xref>). There, the animal comes into contact with one of three to four mechanosensory trigger hairs on each lobe. Bending of any one trigger hair generates an action potential in sensory cells at the base of the trigger hair that propagates through the trap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benolken and Jacobson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burdon-Sanderson, 1873</xref>) and is correlated with an increase in cytosolic calcium in leaf trap cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suda et al., 2020</xref>). Two action potentials (or two touches) in a short period are required to likely further increase cytosolic calcium levels above a necessary threshold to initiate rapid closure of the trap, which ensnares the prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Sharp, 1910</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suda et al., 2020</xref>). Trap closure occurs in as little as 100 ms, representing one of the fastest movements in the plant kingdom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Forterre et al., 2005</xref>). These electromotive properties were first described in the 1870s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burdon-Sanderson, 1873</xref>); however, almost a century and a half later, the molecular underpinnings of these events remain elusive.</p><p>Early recordings from Venus flytrap trigger hairs suggest that, based on the time scale of action potential generation, mechanosensitive ion channels may play a role in transducing force into electrical signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benolken and Jacobson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobson, 1965</xref>). To identify possible ion channels required for the touch response in Venus flytrap, we sought to find genes that are preferentially expressed in trigger hairs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>The Venus flytrap genome is very large (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Palfalvi et al., 2020</xref>)—approximately 20× the size of that of the commonly studied model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>)—and lacks available inbred strains. Therefore, we established a clonal propagation system for the collection of genetically identical material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using these clones, we generated a de novo transcriptome representing genes expressed in trap tissue from Illumina-based short sequencing reads. The transcriptome of our clonal strain consists of almost 28,000 unique transcripts with open reading frames coding for predicted proteins of at least 100 amino acids. This is larger than the approximately 21,000 genes previously predicted by genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Palfalvi et al., 2020</xref>), reflecting the presence of multiple isoforms in our transcriptome, possible heterozygosity and strain differences, and/or differences in genome/transcriptome completeness, indicated by BUSCO analysis (see Materials and Methods). When we compared the transcriptome of trigger hairs with that of only the leaf traps, 495 protein-coding genes were differentially enriched by greater than twofold in the trigger hair, whereas 1844 were similarly enriched in the trap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A and 1B</xref>). Based on homology to Arabidopsis, many genes preferentially expressed in leaf traps were associated with photosynthetic function, whereas those more highly expressed in the trigger hairs included transcription factors and genes that may affect cellular and organ structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C and 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of putative mechanosensory channels in the Venus flytrap trigger hair.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image of a soil-grown Venus flytrap clone (left), Venus flytrap leaf (center), and single trigger hair (right).

Of 45 such transcripts, three coded for possible candidates based on homology to Arabidopsis proteins. Two of these shared homology to MSL family proteins (transcript IDs comp20014_c0_seq1 and comp28902_c0_seq1), and one to the OSCA family (comp16046_c0_seq1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Haswell and Meyerowitz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). We call these genes <italic>FLYCATCHER1</italic> and <italic>FLYCATCHER2</italic> (<italic>FLYC1</italic> and <italic>FLYC2</italic>) and <italic>DmOSCA</italic>, respectively. We did not observe enriched expression of homologs to the mechanically activated PIEZO channels. Strikingly, one of these MSL-related transcripts, <italic>FLYC1</italic>, was expressed 85-fold higher in trigger hairs than in trap tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), and was the second highest enriched gene (a putative terpene synthase was 176-fold enriched; see Materials and Methods). By contrast, the other two putative ion channels were less than sevenfold differentially expressed.</p><p>Using a similar approach, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iosip et al., 2020</xref> recently described 495 genes as trigger hair-specific. These genes were enriched in the trigger hair relative to six other tissue types: root, flower, petiole, trap, rim, and gland tissues. Remarkably, this approach identified <italic>FLYC1</italic>/<italic>DmMSL10</italic> (transcript <italic>Dm_00009130-RA</italic>) as the most trigger hair-specific of all genes. <italic>FLYC2</italic> (transcript <italic>Dm_00001246-RA</italic>) and <italic>DmOSCA</italic> (3' end of transcript <italic>Dm_00001755-RA</italic>) were not identified as trigger hair-specific using this analysis; however, both transcripts were enriched over twofold in trigger hairs when compared to other leaf tissues (trap, petiole, rim, and glands). Expression of these genes in root and/or flower tissue might suggest that they have additional functions in other organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iosip et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these findings are consistent with our own, and support the possibility that all three genes might play a role in trigger hair touch sensation.</p><p>To validate our transcriptome, we verified the <italic>FLYC1</italic> transcript sequence from cDNA. In addition, we used Sanger sequencing of PCR products generated from genomic DNA template to assemble the complete gene sequence. Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected between the two <italic>FLYC1</italic> alleles of our clonal strain, of which only two were found in the coding region and were both silent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To further assess the natural variation that may exist, we sequenced the <italic>FLYC1</italic> gene from a morphologically dissimilar cultivar, and found additional SNPs and short sequence variations.

In Arabidopsis, MSL8 functions in pollen rehydration, whereas the roles of the remaining MSLs in mechanosensory physiological processes is unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hamilton et al., 2015</xref>).

Furthermore, along with other members of the MSL family, MSL10 accounts for stretch-activated currents recorded from root protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haswell et al., 2008</xref>).

Although initial identification characterized the OSCA family as hyperosmolarity-activated calcium channels, it has been demonstrated that several members of the OSCA family are mechanosensitive ion channels that are non-selective for cations with some chloride permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>).

Furthermore, purification and reconstitution of AtOSCA1.2 in proteoliposomes induce stretch-activated currents, indicating that these proteins are inherently mechanosensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murthy et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, mutant OSCA1.1 plants have stunted leaf and root growth when exposed to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>), possibly as a consequence of impaired mechanotransduction in response to changes in cell size.

The trigger hair can be divided into two main regions: a cutinized lever and a podium on which the lever sits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). An indentation zone at the top of the podium separates the two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>), and is where most flexure of the trigger hair occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lloyd, 1942</xref>).

Remarkably, by fluorescent in situ hybridization, we detected <italic>FLYC1</italic> transcript specifically in indentation zone sensory cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>).

The channel has a conductance of 164 ± 9 pS (N = 6) in physiological recording solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), and upon removal of the stretch stimulus, the currents decay with a time constant of 167 ± 34 ms (N = 5). In land plants and green algae, chloride-permeable channel opening is associated with membrane depolarization, due to the efflux of chloride ions down their electrochemical gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beilby, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hedrich, 2012</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether FLYC1 is permeable to chloride by recording stretch-activated FLYC1 currents from inside-out excised patches in symmetrical versus asymmetrical NaCl solution. In symmetrical 150 mM NaCl, FLYC1 stretch-activated single-channel currents reversed at +2.9 ± 1.0 mV (N = 8), whereas in intracellular 30 mM NaCl and extracellular 150 mM NaCl asymmetrical solutions, FLYC1 currents reversed at −30 ± 1.5 mV (N = 7). This reversal potential is closer to the theoretical reversal potential of −37.8 mV for chloride ion than of +37.8 mV for sodium ion, derived from the Nernst equation under our experimental conditions. Therefore, FLYC1 exhibited a preference for chloride over sodium with a P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> ratio of 9.8 ± 1.8 (N = 7), as measured using the Goldman–Hodgkin–Katz equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These results are further supported by the lack of inward chloride currents at positive potential when stretch-activated currents were recorded in calcium-gluconate containing extracellular solution in the cell-attached patch clamp mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, from our excised inside-out patches in symmetrical 150 mM NaCl the single-channel conductance of FLYC1 was 276 ± 10 pS (N = 9), calculated as the slope of the I–V curve between −80 and 0 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial MscS are bona fide mechanically activated ion channels, with in-depth structural and molecular understanding of how they are gated by membrane tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Booth and Blount, 2012</xref>). Much less is known about the structure and function of plant MSLs. Although homology modeling of MSL10 with MscS has hinted at certain residues that alter channel conductance, molecular determinants of selectivity and gating in MSL10 remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Maksaev and Haswell, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maksaev et al., 2018</xref>). Intrigued by the high sequence similarity in the C-terminus of MscS, MSL10, and FLYC1 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), we asked to what extent the molecular architecture of the putative pore-lining helix is shared among these channels. Homology-modeling of FLYC1 with the known MscS structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bass et al., 2002</xref>) suggested that certain features of the pore-forming transmembrane domain (TM6) are indeed conserved. These include hydrophobic residues within the part of the helix that lines the pore (TM6a), and a glycine kink at G575 followed by an amphipathic helix (TM6b) that lies parallel to the inner plasma membrane surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). Based on our result that FLYC1 has a higher preference to chloride, we tested whether the positively charged lysines on either side of the putative pore (K558 and K579) may confer pore properties. We substituted lysines at position 558 and 579 with glutamate and measured P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub>. Whereas selectivity for chloride in both mutants remained unchanged, the K579E mutant exhibited smaller single-channel currents at positive membrane potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>), suggesting that K579 is indeed in the vicinity of the pore. This analysis confirms that the predicted TM6 of FLYC1 is part of the pore-lining region of the channel, consistent with mutagenesis results in MSL10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maksaev et al., 2018</xref>). These observations are further supported by the cryo-electron microscopy structure of AtMSL1, which indicates a similar architecture of the last TM of the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deng et al., 2020</xref>).

First, members of both families have enriched mRNA transcript expression in the sensory trigger hairs of Venus flytrap. Among these, <italic>FLYC1</italic> is a prime candidate as its mRNA is massively enriched in the putative mechanosensory cells that initiate transduction of the touch-induced signal. Second, <italic>FLYC1</italic> forms a mechanically activated ion channel with properties that would facilitate generation of action potentials in sensory cells. Third, expression of <italic>FLYC</italic> genes is remarkably conserved in two morphologically disparate touch-sensitive structures from different genera in the Droseraceae family. In addition to the three candidates presented here, our results do not exclude the possibility that other mechanosensitive proteins could also contribute to the events that enable touch-induced prey capture. In the future, knockout experiments will be critical to determine which candidate mechanosensor(s) identified here, if any, are absolutely necessary for functional prey detection and trap closure.</p><p>Using a mammalian cell-expression system, we detected robust macroscopic as well as single-channel stretch-activated currents in FLYC1-expressing cells and identified residues important for channel properties, which strongly suggests that FLYC1 form mechanosensitive ion channels. However, we were unable to detect currents from the other channels tested, including Arabidopsis MSL10, which has previously been shown to induce currents only in oocytes but not in mammalian cells. We hypothesize that these channels fail to fold and traffic correctly to the mammalian cell membrane, or, alternatively, that the activation threshold for these channels might be higher than that of DmFLYC1 (Venus flytrap), technically precluding us from recording reliable stretch-activated currents. Future functional studies on these genes in different non-mammalian expression systems and purification and reconstitution of proteins in lipid vesicles will conclusively determine whether these genes encode inherently mechanosensitive ion channels.</p><p>It is interesting to compare FLYC1 channel properties to its homologs, MSL10 and MscS. FLYC1 single-channel conductance is 164 ± 9 pS (in physiological pipette solution) in cell-attached patches and 276 ± 10 pS (in 150 mM NaCl) in excised inside-out patches from HEK-P1KO cells, whereas MSL10 and MscS channel conductance from oocytes is 103 ± 3 pS and 218 ± 2 pS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maksaev and Haswell, 2011</xref>). FLYC1 and MSL10 stretch-activated currents have slow opening and closing kinetics with lack of inactivation in the presence of sustained pressure, unlike MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maksaev and Haswell, 2011</xref>). The half-maximal activation (P<sub>50</sub>77.3 ± 4.0 mmHg) for FLYC1 is two-fold lower than its bacterial orthologs MscS (P<sub>50</sub>188 ± 31 mmHg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akitake et al., 2005</xref>) and MscL (P<sub>50</sub>147.3 ± 4.3 mmHg; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doerner et al., 2012</xref>). However, we observed that similar to MSL10 recordings in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maksaev and Haswell, 2012</xref>), the cell membrane in our recordings often ruptured before current saturation (saturated open probability (Po) was measured in only 3/9 cells) resulting in our measurement of FLYC1 P<sub>50</sub> likely being an underestimation. Finally, P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> ratio of FLYC1 (P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> = 9.8) is higher than ratios obtained for MSL10 (P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>Na</sub> = 5.9) and MscS (P<sub>Cl</sub>/P<sub>K</sub> = 1.2–3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Maksaev and Haswell, 2012</xref>). In-depth functional and structural characterization of these channels (FLYC1, MSL10, and MscS) under similar expression systems and recording conditions will further determine absolute differences in their properties and the underlying molecular architecture that govern these properties.</p><p>Our characterization of FLYC1 as a chloride-permeable mechanically activated ion channel suggests a possible mechanism to elicit rapid touch-induced movements in Venus flytrap. Due to the high electronegativity of sensory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benolken and Jacobson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hodick and Sievers, 1988</xref>), combined with a concentration gradient that likely favors efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Higinbotham et al., 1967</xref>), a chloride-permeable channel like FLYC1 could contribute to membrane depolarization. This is consistent with the finding that increasing concentrations of extracellular chloride ions reduced or abolished the electrical response of Venus flytrap sensory cells to a mechanical stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jacobson, 1974</xref>). FLYC1-mediated depolarization, likely in combination with FLYC2 and OSCA, would then initiate action potentials that propagate into the leaf through plasmodesmata clustered on the basal side of the sensory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Williams and Mozingo, 1971</xref>), eliciting trap closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The role of a mechanosensitive calcium permeable ion channel, OSCA, is noteworthy here. Indeed, it has been described that trigger hair movement causes a rise in cytosolic calcium and that this signal propagates through the trap preceding its closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suda et al., 2020</xref>); however, the propagation signal most likely involves a mechanism independent of mechanotransduction. A similar chain of events would occur in the sundew tentacle: prey contact with the tentacle results in DcFLYC-induced action potentials, possibly in combination with OSCA or other mechanosensory proteins not identified here, that may propagate through plasmodesmata along the outer cell layers of the tentacle mechanosensory head and stalk, evoking tentacle bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of touch-induced movements in carnivorous Droseraceae plants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In Venus flytrap, mechanical stimulation of the trigger hair by a prey animal causes bending at the indentation zone sensory cells (1), leading to mechanically induced activation of mechanosensitive (MS) channels and chloride efflux (2).

The presence of two overlapping peaks on a chromatogram was used as evidence of SNPs and allelic variation. Our most 3' primer (CP1009) anneals over the stop codon and the last 31 bases of the coding sequence, and as such, we cannot rule out the existence of additional SNPs within this 31 bp stretch.

insect prey. A transcriptomics project revealed candidate sensors, and functional assays demonstrated that one of them, FLYC1, forms stretch-activated channels in a heterologous system. This work sets the stage for future discovery of the signaling events that link trigger hair deflection to trap closure and the proteins that sense trigger hair deflection.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Stretch-activated ion channels identified in the touch-sensitive structures of carnivorous Droseraceae plants&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work is a fascinating story of MSL-type channel evolution toward a true touch-sensing function in plants. Reviewers and editors alike were excited about discovering which proteins might render carnivorous plants able to detect and trap insects walking inside traps. The authors present a substantial genetic/transcriptomics groundwork that allowed them to identify candidates to be channels responsible for the mechanosensory function in trigger hairs of the Venus flytrap. One of these proteins, FLYC1 appears to be the main player, acting as a bona fide homomultimeric mechanosensitive channel. The authors also describe the aspects of the cells in which FLYC1 likely functions, and suggest that these columnar cells with radially-oriented long sides presents an interesting system for future engineering-type finite-element analysis to identify zones of maximal strain/compression where the channels might be deployed for maximal efficiency.</p><p>Although there was clearly much enthusiasm, there were also some functional studies the reviewers deemed critical to complete or improve. Also, there are field standards for considering something a bona fide mechanosensitive channel that are not all met by presented data on the three channels (see details in point 3). This and lack of loss-of-function data from Venus fly traps means that the authors can't definitively conclude that these identified channels are actually responsible for the trap closure, and this needs to be acknowledged more clearly in the text.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers concurred that it was essential to provide a more complete electrophysiological characterization of FLYC1. Specifically, as presented in Figure 4, the channel is on the “sluggish” side. Activation takes about 500 ms, but the rate of opening, as it should, increases with tension. The authors state: “Similar to MSL10 stretch-activated currents in oocytes, FLYC1 currents had a slow rise time for activation and did not saturate, suggesting that these channels don't inactivate.” Neither of these conclusions is supported by the presented data. Extension of pressure stimuli to 2-5 seconds should produce a plateau in elicited currents, which will enable the authors to estimate the open probability (Po) and create a saturating dose-response curve. From this curve, the authors should be able to determine the midpoint of activation and the slope. Alternatively, the application of a 5s-long linear pressure ramp from 0 to ~120 mm Hg should produce a similar activation curve within one sweep. Co-expression of <italic>E. coli</italic> MscL in the same cell, as was previously done by David Clapham's group (Doerner, Febvay and Clapham, 2012), would enable the authors to pinpoint the tension midpoint for FLYC1 since MscL's midpoint is known (12 mN/m). Longer stimuli and special pressure protocols (Akitake, Anishkin and Sukharev, 2005) would reveal whether FLYC1 adapts or inactivates. At least a saturating dose-response curve (Po versus pressure) should be presented.</p><p>Also as related to experiments presented in Figure 4, in the Abstract it is claimed that mechanosensitive FLYC1 channels are chloride-permeable. This claim seems to depend on the reversal potential measured in Figure 4D (excised patches studied in asymmetric NaCl concentrations) and in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 (on-cell patches recording with Ca-gluconate in the pipette). The current data are weak. It would be better to perform experiments on the same samples exposed to solutions that differ only in their Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration and show that the reversal potential follows the change in the Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient. In principle, this could be achieved by recording currents in an excised patch exposed to a symmetric NaCl solution and then exposed to asymmetric conditions that change only Cl<sup>-</sup>.</p><p>2) Given the way that the authors have placed this work in a comparative analysis, it was also agreed that the authors should make an attempt to characterize the FLYC2 and DmOSCA channels in another system. The cells do not have to be Piezo1-knockouts since the conductance and kinetic properties of the plant channels are easily discernable from those of Piezos. The reviewer suggest to abandon HEK-P1KO cells, and instead try Cos, Sf9 cells, and/or oocytes. Moreover, a recording system based on msl9-1; msl10-1 knock-out plant protoplasts has been reported (Haswell et al., 2008). Δ 5 Arabidopsis plants are available now for MSL channel expression and recording. Another option is to use this system and add some electrophysiology data for the FLYC2 and DmOSCA channels.</p><p>3) Regardless of the outcome of these experiments, the authors need to directly address the fact that they will not have tested whether or not any of the three identified channel proteins are needed for trigger hair function. They remain outstanding <italic>candidates</italic> for this physiological role but until knock-out or knock-down experiments are performed, the possibility that none are required for his function will remain. The force-gated ion channels field has identified criteria that must be met before a protein can considered to form a bona fide mechanosensitive channel. These include: 1) the protein expressed in the correct tissue at the right time; 2) be sufficient to form a mechanosensitive channel in heterologous systems; 3) be required for physiological responses to mechanical cues. The data in this manuscript indicated that two criteria are met for FLYC1 and that only the first criterion is met for FLYC2 and DmOSCA. Yet, despite the consistent identification of these proteins as candidate mechanosensors, an implicit assumption is woven through the manuscript suggesting to readers that these three proteins are now known to be the sensors used by trigger hairs to detect insects. The authors should either be more circumspect in their writing or provide the data. Since the latter is going to be very difficult, they should leave open the possibility that FLYC2 and DmOSCA might not form mechanosensitive channels and that perhaps only a subset of the three candidates will end up being required for physiological responses. As an example, the first paragraph in the Discussion summarizes the findings but does not explicitly tell the reader that additional work is needed to determine whether any of the candidates are required for trigger hair function. Failing to explicitly state that this remains a possibility may leave readers with the impression that the problem is solved which will complicate future efforts to directly address this question by these authors and others who may be inspired to build on this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64250.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers concurred that it was essential to provide a more complete electrophysiological characterization of FLYC1.

We agree that further characterization of FLYC1 would add substantial value to the paper. We have performed and included pressure dose-response data (see new Figure 4B) that address two major properties:</p><p>Channel kinetics: As suggested by the reviewers we recorded FLYC1 currents in response to 3s pressure stimulus, which allowed the current to reach steady state. As seen in the representative trace of Figure 4B, these currents do not inactivate. We attempted several times to record currents from a longer stimulus duration (5s or 10s) from multiple cells in order to conclusively state that the channel does not inactivate over time and potentially report statistics. We also tried the linear pressure ramp from 0 to ~120 mmHg protocol as suggested by the reviewers. Unfortunately, due to the high pressure stimulus that is required to cause maximal activation of the channel, we were unsuccessful in maintaining the integrity of the patch in most of our attempts. High pressure and longer stimulus duration resulted in frequent patch rupture. Pressures beyond 100 to 110 mmHg is lytic for HEK cells. We have consistently observed this from our many recordings of stretch-activated currents from other mechanosensitive ion channels like Piezos, Tmem63s, and Arabidopsis OSCA channels. The lack of inactivation and patch rupture was also observed by Elizabeth Haswell’s group, in their recording of MSL10 from oocytes (Maksev and Haswell, 2011). Lastly, we have removed the sentence “Similar to MSL10 stretch-activated currents in oocytes, FLYC1 currents had a slow rise time for activation and did not saturate, suggesting that these channels don't inactivate.” in accordance with our inability to make such strong claims based on our presented data. However, we do acknowledge these observations in the Discussion paragraph that compares and contrasts FLYC1 properties with MSL10 and MscS.</p><p>Pressure P<bold><sub>50</sub></bold>: With the new 3s protocol we were successful in measuring the P50 of the channel (77.3 ± 4.0 mmHg (N=9)). Normalized and absolute values for the pressure dose-response curves are reported in Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, respectively. For reasons noted above, not all cells hit saturation/ maximal open probability at higher pressure responses, but we were able to reliably record saturating currents in 3 out of 9 cells. This is indicated in the Discussion.</p><p>We hope the addition of the dose-response curve with a longer pressure stimulus is sufficient for the initial characterization of FLYC1 and allow for more detailed characterization in the future, like co-expression with <italic>E. coli</italic> MscL to determine absolute tension midpoint.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also as related to experiments presented in Figure 4, in the Abstract it is claimed that mechanosensitive FLYC1 channels are chloride-permeable.

We have now added additional data to strengthen our claim that FLYC1 are chloride-permeable channels. Similar to experiments done on MSL10, we recorded I-V relationship of stretch-activated single channel currents from excised inside-out patches in symmetrical NaCl. This data is added to the graph that depicted I-V relationship in asymmetrical NaCl conditions. As demonstrated in Figure 4D, changing intracellular NaCl concentration from 30 mM to 150 mM (while maintaining the extracellular solution at 150 mM NaCl) resulted in ~3 fold increase in single channel current amplitude at negative potentials and also caused a change in the reversal potential (-30 ± 1.5 mV to +2.9 ± 1.0 mV). These results are similar to those obtained for MSL10 (Maksaev and Haswell, 2011). We think that the symmetrical NaCl control, along with measured chloride permeability ratio and the calcium-gluconate experiment, provide compelling evidence to suggest that these channels are permeable to chloride. We did attempt to switch only chloride concentration on the same excised patches but these experiments proved challenging, and given the time constraint we resorted to simply recording I-V currents in symmetrical NaCl solution. Furthermore, these experiments allowed us to measure the channel’s conductance in 150mM NaCl. These results are now described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the way that the authors have placed this work in a comparative analysis, it was also agreed that the authors should make an attempt to characterize the FLYC2 and DmOSCA channels in another system.

In our past experience, if we cannot get recordings of a clone in HEK cells, it also does not work in other adherent cell lines. Consistently, we tested FLYC1, FLYC2, and DmOSCA in HeLa cells but didn’t observe stretch-activated currents from any of the candidates. We agree, however, given the success of MSL10 recording in oocytes, this approach might yield promising results. While we plan to perform these experiments, we do not currently have this type of recording set up within our labs, and standardizing and optimizing a recording system in oocytes without face-to-face instruction from a knowledgeable colleague is not practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, attempting these experiments will cause a significant delay. We hope that the experiments we have added to further characterize FLYC1 and compare it to homologs are sufficient to highlight our focus on the most promising candidate. We do believe additional experiments on FLYC2 and DmOSCA is important for future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Regardless of the outcome of these experiments, the authors need to directly address the fact that they will not have tested whether or not any of the three identified channel proteins are needed for trigger hair function.

We have altered the language of the manuscript at several places to emphasize this point.</p><p>1) We have added a discussion of a paper recently published while ours was under revision (Iosip et al., 2020) which performed a similar RNAseq experiment to our own. We end this discussion with “Together, these findings are consistent with our own, and support the possibility that all three genes might play a role in trigger hair touch sensation.”</p><p>2) We have added the following to the end of the first Discussion paragraph: “In the future, knockout experiments will be critical to determine which candidate mechanosensor(s) identified here, if any, are absolutely necessary for functional prey detection and trap closure.”</p><p>3) We have highlighted the importance of further knockout studies in a newly separated final paragraph in the Discussion. 4) As suggested by reviewer 3, we have removed “resulting in trap closure” to remove the direct causal implication.</p></body></sub-article></article>
