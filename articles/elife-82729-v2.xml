Post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) is a key aspect of this program. Indeed, deletion of neuron-enriched miRNAs induces strong developmental phenotypes, and miRNA levels are altered in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the mechanisms used by miRNAs to instruct brain development remain largely unexplored. Here, we identified miR-218 as a critical regulator of hippocampal assembly. MiR-218 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and enriched in both excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs). Early life inhibition of miR-218 results in an adult brain with a predisposition to seizures. Changes in gene expression in the absence of miR-218 suggest that network assembly is impaired. Indeed, we find that miR-218 inhibition results in the disruption of early depolarizing GABAergic signaling, structural defects in dendritic spines, and altered intrinsic membrane excitability. Conditional knockout of <italic>Mir218-2</italic> in INs, but not PNs, is sufficient to recapitulate long-term instability. Finally, de-repressing <italic>Kif21b</italic> and <italic>Syt13</italic>, two miR-218 targets, phenocopies the effects on early synchronous network activity induced by miR-218 inhibition. Taken together, the data suggest that miR-218 orchestrates formative events in PNs and INs to produce stable networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Network activity levels in the adult brain are determined by the precise interplay between excitatory pyramidal neurons (PNs) and GABAergic inhibitory interneurons (INs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isaacson and Scanziani, 2011</xref>). A properly balanced network is achieved through a series of developmental events in early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>). During neural circuit assembly, neurons first rapidly grow dendrites and axons to form a coarse network, followed by a synaptic refinement period shaped by sensory experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blankenship and Feller, 2010</xref>). At this early stage, the interplay between PNs and INs is crucial for cell survival, growth, and synapse formation. For example, depolarizing GABA released from INs generates synchronous activity that drives gene expression programs to instruct PN growth and network assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonifazi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cancedda et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Deidda et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, excitatory PN afferents sustain the survival of INs and mediate their integration into the circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Xue et al., 2014</xref>). Unsurprisingly, errors at this stage have catastrophic long-term consequences for network function. Derailment from the healthy developmental trajectory results in aberrant levels of neuronal activity in the adult brain, a feature that can disrupt the precise computations underlying cognition and behavior. In fact, aberrant network activity is a core symptom of neuropsychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rubenstein and Merzenich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zoghbi and Bear, 2012</xref>).</p><p>At the molecular level, circuit assembly is orchestrated by a multitude of genes whose expression is tightly regulated in time (developmental stages) and space (cell types). Studies spanning the past few decades have identified sophisticated transcriptional regulation of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Silbereis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Telley et al., 2016</xref>). However, the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is less well understood. This regulation is mediated by a class of non-coding RNAs, miRNAs. MiRNAs either degrade mRNA targets by reducing their stability or repress their translation, providing a layer of control of gene expression that supersedes transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bartel, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartel, 2004</xref>). This post-transcriptional regulation is necessary for neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">McNeill and Van Vactor, 2012</xref>): conditional knockout (cKO) of <italic>Dicer</italic>, an essential component of the miRNA biogenesis machinery, induces a marked decrease in neuronal survival and multiple defects in both cortical lamination and the formation of proper synaptic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Pietri Tonelli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawase-Koga et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tuncdemir et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zolboot et al., 2023</xref>). We and others have shown that deletion of a single highly enriched neuronal miRNA is sufficient to induce strong developmental phenotypes, including disruption of circuit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dulcis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lippi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lippi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schratt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Siegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Siegert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zolboot et al., 2023</xref>). Together, these studies suggest that miRNAs tightly control key facets of neuronal development. Unsurprisingly, patients suffering from neurodevelopmental disorders have altered levels of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bian and Sun, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">O’Connor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), but if and how miRNAs contribute to disease is unknown. Both miRNAs and target mRNAs can be enriched in specific cell types, generating cell type-specific miRNA-target networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nowakowski et al., 2018</xref>). In cortical structures most of the work has focused on PNs. However, recent research has demonstrated crucial roles for miRNAs in INs, from early development (survival, specification, and lamination of medial ganglionic eminence-derived INs) to cognitive functions and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Daswani et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tuncdemir et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous work has demonstrated that miR-218 plays a crucial role in cell fate specification and survival of embryonic motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reichenstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Thiebes et al., 2015</xref>) as well as in regulating cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Torres-Berrío et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we show that miR-218 is essential for multiple aspects of hippocampal circuit assembly. Blockade of miR-218 in early postnatal life results in networks with excessive neuronal activity in the adult, a symptom common to many neurodevelopmental disorders. Our data suggest that miR-218 regulates several key processes during early postnatal life that are instrumental to produce a balanced network. These include early depolarizing GABAergic signaling, structural growth of spines, and the regulation of intrinsic membrane excitability. Finally, we show that cKO of <italic>Mir218-2</italic> in INs, but not PNs, recapitulates long-term effects on circuit stability, suggesting an important role in this cell type.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MiR-127, miR-218, and miR-136 are highly expressed in the hippocampus and developmentally upregulated</title><p>A wealth of literature indicates that miRNAs regulate key neurodevelopmental processes that build well-balanced, properly functioning brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zampa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zolboot et al., 2021</xref>).

We selected 10 highly expressed candidate miRNAs and used qRT-PCR to determine their expression levels before (embryonic day 16, E16 and postnatal day 3, P3), during (P12), and after (P40-48) hippocampal circuit assembly. Three candidates, miR-127, miR-218, and miR-136, increase substantially in expression during early postnatal development, suggesting that they function in this developmental window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). MiR-218 levels increased nearly threefold from E16 to P12 and remained elevated into adulthood.

We compiled a list of predicted miR-218 targets from the TargetScan prediction database and a published CLEAR-CLIP dataset from P13 mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moore et al., 2015</xref>). This set of putative miR-218 targets showed a modest, but significant increase in expression in a.218 hippocampus compared to a.Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is consistent with miRNAs primarily affecting RNA stability of their targets. However, the relatively small size of the increase might also reflect miR-218 targets that are repressed translationally and therefore are not captured by RNA-Seq. Further, we identified subsets of genes that were either up-regulated (138 genes, p-value &lt;0.05) or down-regulated (102 genes, p-value &lt;0.05) in a.218 compared to a.Ctrl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The up-regulated genes showed significant enrichment of the miR-218 seed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), as well as additional miRNA seeds, suggesting convergence of repression by multiple miRNAs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mapping miR-218 targets and transcriptional changes upon miR-218 inhibition with RNA-Seq from dorsal hippocampus at P8.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cumulative fraction of all genes (black line), non miR-218 targets (gray line), let-7 targets (yellow), miR-218 targets purple.

The up-regulated genes showed significant enrichment in several developing interneuron populations and in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Circuit formation arises from the coordinated interaction of activity-dependent and intrinsic formative events. Our RNA-Seq data revealed that inhibition of miR-218 de-represses genes that regulates multiple aspects of this process. We therefore hypothesized that the increased network activity measured in the adult could result from defective inhibition, excessive excitatory drive, or altered intrinsic excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>MiR-218 inhibition affects proper synaptic architecture</title><p>Inhibition of miR-218 changes the expression levels of many genes involved in synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To understand if synaptic rearrangements underlie a.218-induced phenotypes, we examined the role of miR-218 activity on synapse formation within the hippocampus using immunohistochemistry and electrophysiology. In all experiments, a.Ctrl or a.218 were injected into the dorsal hippocampus at P2. Inhibition of miR-218 had no effect on GABAergic synapse number in the CA3 pyramidal layer as measured by VGAT and gephyrin puncta density at P8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). There was also no effect on either amplitude or frequency of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs) in CA3 pyramidal neurons at P14-P16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref>). We then asked if, instead, there was a structural defect causing changes in connectivity. We measured spine density at P11 by co-injecting antagomiRs with a GFP-expressing pseudorabies virus to sparsely label neurons. We saw no effect on spine density in CA3 pyramidal neurons. In contrast, early miR-218 inhibition significantly reduced spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons, the major postsynaptic targets of CA3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). The reduction in spines was most prominent among mushroom-type spines. We then tested whether this reduction in spines was long-lasting by co-injection of a.218 or a.Ctrl with AAV-smFLAG at P2 and measuring spine density at P40-P45. Early, transient inhibition of miR-218 produced a long-lasting reduction in spines on CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–F</xref>). The phenotypic differences between CA1 and CA3 PNs could be due to different levels of miR-218 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and/or different miR-218-regulated gene programs in each cell type.

Loss of miR-218 activity significantly decreased the frequency of SEs and total events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). In addition, a.218 frequently caused SEs to occur in quick bursts, rather than at the evenly spaced intervals seen in control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Acute blockade of GABAergic signaling by bath application of picrotoxin (PTX, 50 μM) on P5 acute slices produced effects similar to miR-218 inhibition.

These data support the hypothesis that impairment of GABAergic neurotransmission could contribute to the a.218-induced phenotypes. As a further test of this hypothesis, we tested acute blockade of GABA on CA3 spontaneous activity at P8, when glutamatergic neurotransmission has begun and GABA, although still depolarizing, has been shown to mediate shunting inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Staley and Mody, 1992</xref>).

Spontaneous network activity plays an important role during this timeframe in shaping the properties of mature circuit function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ben-Ari, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duan et al., 2020</xref>). The genetic programs underlying early spontaneous activity are subject to both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. We have previously shown that a single miRNA can regulate multiple aspects of circuit development in early postnatal life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lippi et al., 2016</xref>). In the present study, we further demonstrate that a distinct developmentally regulated miRNA, miR-218, influences postnatal hippocampal development through effects on neuronal morphology, excitability, and network activity. The long-term effects are likely due to alterations in neuronal excitability and disruption of GABAergic signaling. We further show that miR-218 is required specifically in INs for proper network development, and that miR-218 functions in part through regulation of the kinesin <italic>Kif21b</italic> and the synaptotagmin <italic>Syt13</italic>.</p><p>An increasing body of work has shown that abnormal expression of miR-218 is associated with several nervous system disorders, including major depressive disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Torres-Berrío et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Torres-Berrío et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Torres-Berrío et al., 2017</xref>), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reichenstein et al., 2019</xref>), and temporal lobe epilepsy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaalund et al., 2014</xref>). Our work importantly extends these findings to show that inhibiting miR-218 during circuit development, particularly in INs, results in increased seizure susceptibility and severity, thus establishing a causal link between miR-218 levels and neurodevelopmental phenotypes.</p><p>Manipulation of miR-218 levels has repeatedly been shown to alter neuronal activity in both spinal cord and hippocampal neurons. Our findings that inhibition of miR-218 resulted in hyperactive network activity and hyperexcitable CA3 pyramidal neurons are consistent with recordings from <italic>Mir218</italic> KO embryonic spinal cord motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). Recent data from miR-218 knockdown in cultured primary hippocampal neurons indicated that miR-218 inhibition decreased neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reichenstein et al., 2019</xref>). Additional studies with constitutive <italic>Mir218-2</italic> KO mice showed a 50% reduction in miR-218 in the hippocampus, cognitive deficits, decreased activity, loss of long-term potentiation and increased spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lu et al., 2021</xref>). Several factors could explain the discrepancies between our findings and these published results, including differences in the extent and duration of knockdown/KO, or different effects of miR-218 across developmental ages (15–21 days in vitro for cultured neurons, P30-40 for <italic>Mir218-2</italic> KO CA1 neurons) and brain regions (CA3 vs CA1). The regulation of a given mRNA by miR-218 is likely highly dependent upon the relative concentrations of both the target mRNA and the miR-218 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin et al., 2021</xref>). It is therefore plausible that miR-218 will regulate distinct cohorts of target mRNAs in different cell types and at different developmental time points.</p><p>Prior work has shown miR-218 is expressed in both excitatory PNs and INs within the mouse nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we observe effects of miR-218 inhibition on the intrinsic excitability of early postnatal hippocampal PNs. In many neuron types, intrinsic properties, including membrane resistance and rheobase, change extensively during early postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-García et al., 2021</xref>). This may be due to changes in the expression and/or distribution of K+channels, some of which have been shown to be miR-218 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reichenstein et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, it is possible that miR-218 inhibition at later stages could have different effects on intrinsic excitability of PNs than those we describe here during the early postnatal window.</p><p>While we find that inhibiting miR-218 renders PNs hyperexcitable at P5-6, the overall effect is to decrease network activity. This is likely due to a role of miR-218 in promoting GABAergic signaling. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, miR-218 is expressed in a subset of INs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">He et al., 2012</xref>). Second, a subset of genes upregulated following miR-218 inhibition are enriched in INs compared to PNs in the postnatal hippocampus. Third, the effects of miR-218 inhibition on spontaneous network activity are strikingly similar to the effects of acute GABAergic blockade at both P5 and P8. Fourth, removal of <italic>Mir218-2</italic> from INs, but not PNs, confers increased susceptibility to seizures in mature animals and reduces network activity at early postnatal ages. Thus miR-218 regulates GABAergic signaling in the early postnatal hippocampus to establish proper network formation. These data are consistent with work showing that GABA signaling during early development is crucial for the proper establishment of synaptic architecture and excitatory/inhibitory balance in mature circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ben-Ari et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cherubini et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Salmon et al., 2020</xref>). Removal of <italic>Mir218-2</italic> specifically from INs, however, only leads to a subset of the phenotypes of global miR-218 inhibition.</p><p>We confirmed two downstream targets of miR-218 in the hippocampus, the kinesin <italic>Kif21b</italic> and the synaptotagmin <italic>Syt13. Kif21b</italic> and <italic>Syt13</italic> were up-regulated in both the a.218 vs. a.Ctrl RNA-Seq and the <italic>Mir218-2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> vs WT RNA-Seq experiments. Consistently, both genes were also highly up-regulated in <italic>Mir218</italic><sup>-/-</sup> spinal cord motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2015</xref>). Mutations in <italic>Kif21b</italic> have been shown to impair neuronal migration, axonal growth and branching, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asselin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Narayanan et al., 2022</xref>). The vesicle trafficking protein SYT13 has been shown to regulate insulin secretion and cell-matrix adhesion in the pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bakhti et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ofori et al., 2022</xref>) and to promote axon growth and protect motor neurons from degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nizzardo et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, these findings strongly suggest that miR-218 functions in part through modulating intracellular trafficking and is required in both PNs and INs in concert to regulate intrinsic and network excitability.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animal experiments were conducted at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), the Scripps Research Institute (SRI), Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC), and at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (UNIMORE).

Briefly, C57B/L6J P8 male mice were anesthetized with Ketamine/Xylazine and sacrificed by decapitation. Acute coronal slices (300 µm) were prepared using a Leica vibratome with ice-cold oxygenated slicing solution as described above. We obtained 3–4 coronal slices containing both dorsal hippocampi per animal. To load the calcium indicator, slices were transferred into a sealed 1.5 ml tube containing 5 µM Fluo-4AM (Molecular Probes, 50% DMSO, 50% Pluronic Acid) diluted in oxygenated modified artificial cerebrospinal fluid (mACSF) at 35 °C, for 30 min in the dark. The mACSF (also used as imaging solution) contained (in mM): 126 NaCl, 3.5 KCl, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 1.0 MgCl2, 2.0 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. Slices were then dissected along the midline and transferred to a slice holder where they were maintained at room temperature in the dark for an additional 1 hr before imaging. Experiments were performed in a custom-made chamber that allowed constant perfusion with aerated mACSF at 1–2 ml/min. A Leica SP5 multiphoton microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) with a low-magnification (10 X) 36 water immersion objective was used for imaging. Bi-directional scanning was used at a 400 Hz imaging rate, with a time resolution of 328ms. The image field was typically 620x310 µm. Follow-up experiments were performed with a Nikon A1R Multiphoton system using a 16x CF175 LWD objective, N.A. 0.8, 488nmm laser with the same frame rate as described previously. After 5–10 min of imaging, 5 µL of potassium chloride (KCl, 1 M) was added to the aCSF immediately above the slice to depolarize neurons and detect healthy cells.

Cells were identified automatically using principal component analysis and independent component analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mukamel et al., 2009</xref>) (PCA; ICA), and were manually verified, and only cells that responded to the KCl-induced depolarization at the end of the imaging were retained. Cells that had very slow calcium responses (&gt;5 s) were excluded, on the basis that they were most likely glia. The calcium signal trace for each cell was obtained by averaging the fluorescence within that ROI as a function of time.</p><p>We adjusted for photo-bleaching-induced decreases in baseline fluorescence as follows. First, we first smoothed the data by applying a band-pass filter (cutting high-frequency oscillations); then we determined a “support line” (SL), precisely a cubic curve underneath the smoothed series whose distance from the series was minimum. The filtered series was the difference between the series and SL. The KCl-induced depolarization at the end of the movie was not included to compute SL. A manual threshold (normally ≥3 fold the standard deviation of baseline fluorescence or F0) was used to identify calcium events. The synchronized events (SEs) were detected by selecting the principal component (PC) that corresponded manually using ICM, which was typically the first or second PC. Because these events were correlated and accounted for a lot of variance in the data, they were easily extracted by PCA. The number of SEs was determined by comparing raster plots of all calcium events extracted with ROIs with the corresponding PC that signifies the event. The number of cells participating in each SE was determined by counting how many cells, out of all viable cells (those which responded to KCl), had calcium events in the time window of 984ms before and after the peak of the SE. Asynchronous events were all events that were not included in the time window of each SE.</p><p>Data from each movie were then transferred to Excel (Microsoft) for consolidation, and statistical analysis was performed in Prism (GraphPad). The ROUT method was used for detecting outliers. At P8, outliers were detected based on the number of SEs. These movies were removed for all further analysis. For a.Ctrl three outliers were detected and removed, for a.127, two outliers were removed, and for a.136 four outliers were removed. No outliers were detected among the a.218 movies. At P40, three outliers were removed from a.218 movies, whereas none were detected in the a.Ctrl data. One outlier was detected and removed from a.218 P5 recordings. For P5 movies, the percent of SEs occurring in bursts was determined from the PCA trace. A burst of SEs was determined by multiple SEs occurring within a time interval such that the baseline of the PCA trace did not return to baseline in between SEs. The percent of total SEs in each movie occurring within bursts was manually counted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lentiviral miRNA sensor</title><p>The miR-218 lentiviral sensor was created from the lentiviral miR-101b tracer, a generous gift from Dr. Fred Gage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lippi et al., 2016</xref>).

Normally-distributed data were analyzed with parametric tests (Student’s t-test or ANOVA), otherwise non-parametric tests were used (Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallis tests). Statistics for experiments with multiple observations (e.g., movies, tissue sections, or cells) from individual animals were derived using linear mixed models using the R packages lmerTest and emmeans to correct for multiple comparisons, as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2022</xref>. Individual details (tests and sample numbers) are described in the figure legends. All behavioral data, expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM), were analyzed using Student’s t test or one- or two-way ANOVA or Fisher’s exact test. Differences were considered significant with p&lt;0.05. 0.05&lt;p &lt;0.1 were also reported.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Resources, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experimental procedures at UCSD, TSRI, CCHMH and SRI were performed as approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and according to the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Gary Brennan (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are major concerns related to the statistical assessment of the data being inappropriate in multiple instances.</p><p>2) Please address how the loss of miR-218 in the cellular phenotypes is causally involved in seizure susceptibility and behavior deficits.</p><p>3) Are seizures assessed at the chronic epileptic stage? the current data doesn't causally link changes in seizure susceptibility to miR-218 function in interneurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this study, Taylor et al. describe the developmental role of miRNA-218 in shaping postnatal hippocampal circuits. They show developmental regulation of miR-218 expression and inhibiting miR-218 activity in early phases of post-natal developmental results in excessive network activity and susceptibility to epileptic seizures after kainate-induced insults. Conditional knock-out of miR-218 in interneurons indicates a possible cell-type specific role of miR-218 in shaping early-life hippocampal circuitry.</p><p>Describing a cell-type specific function of a particular microRNA in neural circuitry development during a defined time window would definitely represent a major advance in the field. However, in my opinion, the presented data falls significantly short in linking interneuron (IN) – and/or pyramidal neurons (PN)-expressed miR-218 to the observed structural, electrophysiological, or behavioural phenotypes. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms of how miR-218 regulates neural excitability, synapse structure, and behaviour remain almost completely obscure. Therefore, as outlined in more detail below, extensive additional data together with solidification of the already presented data, in particular regarding statistics, is required to warrant publication of this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. The authors show that transient oligonucleotide-mediated miR-218 inhibition leads to deficits in interneurons and pyramidal neurons, but whether these deficits are cell-autonomous and which of these defects underlies the observed cognitive and/or behavioural phenotypes remains unknown. Therefore, it would be important to measure at least some of these parameters (i.e., spine density, intrinsic electrophysiological properties, stereotypic behaviour, memory) also in mice that lack miR-218 specifically in excitatory neurons (Vglut-Cre) or inhibitory (Vgat-Cre) interneurons.</p><p>2. Similarly, the current data doesn't causally link changes in seizure susceptibility to miR-218 function in interneurons. Simply showing that PTX treatment phenocopies miR-218 inhibition is not enough in this regard. Therefore, the authors have to repeat calcium imaging experiments (Figure 8) in slices from interneuron-specific (Vgat-Cre) miR-218 cko mice. Even more elegant would be a rescue experiment where miR-218 is re-expressed (e.g., using AAV-miR218-hairpin) specifically in interneurons of miR-218 deficient mice at P2 (and once the developmental window is closed, e.g. P21) followed by calcium imaging and the measurement of seizure susceptibility. Alternatively, the authors could inject a rAAV-CAMKII-218sponge into Vgat-Cre miR218 cko animals and see if susceptibility to epilepsy increases, e.g by performing EEG recordings. Such experiments would provide insight into a potential synergy of miR-218 function in IN versus PN.</p><p>3. Another major weak point of this manuscript is the lack of a target or mechanism for the described developmental role of miRNA-218. The authors performed elegant FACS-sorting and subsequent RNA-seq but do not exploit the data accordingly to mine for possible concrete targets and molecular mechanisms. We feel that at the very least the authors should show differential expression of a few of the most promising targets using multiplexed fluorescent in-situ hybridization assays with single-cell type resolution (INs vs PNs). In addition, a direct functional interaction of miR-218 with some of the predicted targets should be validated, e.g., using luciferase reporter assays. The ideal experiment would consist of a cell-type specific rescue using an AAV-RNAi approach against possible upregulated targets in the miR-218-2 cko line to try to rescue the altered network activity and/or seizure susceptibility.</p><p>4. The statistical assessment of the data is inappropriate in multiple instances. For example, the authors often take the number of technical replicates as n, which is not correct and overpowering the tests (cf. Yu et al., 2022, for correct use of statistical tests). In most cases, mixed-effect models would represent more appropriate tests, in particular with regard to the following figures:</p><p>– Figure 1A: It is not clear, what they tested in the sequencing or where this comes from (Lippi et al., 2016?). What were the conditions, statistics etc?</p><p>– Figure 1B: I would like to see some sort of statistical test, showing the significance of time as a fixed effect.</p><p>– Figure 1F-I: the number of n are videos, which kind of test has been chosen? Have they been corrected for blocking effects? See Yu et al., 2022 as a reference for correct statistics.</p><p>– Figure 2B-C: Overpowered with the use of the number of videos and the use of a simple Mann-Whitney test, assuming independence for all videos coming from one mouse. Block for mouse or average all videos coming from one mouse.</p><p>– Figure 4H and 6B: Number of n are sections coming from 3-4 animals. Same as before, take into account blocking effects.</p><p>– Figure 6D and 7B-D: We are aware that the standard for electrophysiological data is to perform statistics on the level of the number of cells, but statistically speaking it is not the correct approach. We would like to break this norm and ask for a corrected statistical test taking into account blocking effects at the mouse level.</p><p>– Figure 8B-F: see comments from Fig1F-I.</p><p>– Figure 9C: see comments from Fig4H. Also, a two-way ANOVA-type statistical test would be more appropriate in Figures 9A, C, D, and E.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82729.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1.

Simply showing that PTX treatment phenocopies miR-218 inhibition is not enough in this regard. Therefore, the authors have to repeat calcium imaging experiments (Figure 8) in slices from interneuron-specific (Vgat-Cre) miR-218 cko mice. Even more elegant would be a rescue experiment where miR-218 is re-expressed (e.g., using AAV-miR218-hairpin) specifically in interneurons of miR-218 deficient mice at P2 (and once the developmental window is closed, e.g. P21) followed by calcium imaging and the measurement of seizure susceptibility. Alternatively, the authors could inject a rAAV-CAMKII-218sponge into Vgat-Cre miR218 cko animals and see if susceptibility to epilepsy increases, e.g by performing EEG recordings. Such experiments would provide insight into a potential synergy of miR-218 function in IN versus PN.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we performed calcium imaging experiments from VGat-Cre/miR218<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. At P5, miR-218 loss-of-function in interneurons phenocopied the decrease in synchronous activity observed with a.218 (Figure 10A-C). This is consistent with a body of literature suggesting that GABA released from interneurons is the major source of synchronous activity at this developmental stage. We conclude that miR-218 is a critical regulator of interneuron function in the developing hippocampus.</p><p>Surprisingly, we observed a similar phenotype at P8 (Figure 10A-C). This is the opposite phenotype of what we observed with a.218 (Figure 1F-I, 8E-F), suggesting that blockade of miR-218 function in pyramidal neurons and interneurons simultaneously results in a complex compound phenotype that is not due to the function of miR-218 in interneurons alone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Another major weak point of this manuscript is the lack of a target or mechanism for the described developmental role of miRNA-218. The authors performed elegant FACS-sorting and subsequent RNA-seq but do not exploit the data accordingly to mine for possible concrete targets and molecular mechanisms. We feel that at the very least the authors should show differential expression of a few of the most promising targets using multiplexed fluorescent in-situ hybridization assays with single-cell type resolution (INs vs PNs). In addition, a direct functional interaction of miR-218 with some of the predicted targets should be validated, e.g., using luciferase reporter assays. The ideal experiment would consist of a cell-type specific rescue using an AAV-RNAi approach against possible upregulated targets in the miR-218-2 cko line to try to rescue the altered network activity and/or seizure susceptibility.</p></disp-quote><p>To identify miR-218 targets that are responsible for the a.218 phenotypes, we first performed qPCR analysis on the candidates that were consistently upregulated in RNAseq experiments. Two genes, Kif21b and Syt13, were confirmed as significantly upregulated (Figure 10E). As we did before (Lippi et al. 2016), we tested if their selective and simultaneous de-repression with target site blockers (TSB) phenocopied aspects of the a.218 phenotype. TSB-treated mice showed increased synchronous and total events at P8 (Figure 10F-G), suggesting that derepression of these two genes is an important driver of the altered spontaneous activity induced by a.218.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The statistical assessment of the data is inappropriate in multiple instances. For example, the authors often take the number of technical replicates as n, which is not correct and overpowering the tests (cf. Yu et al., 2022, for correct use of statistical tests). In most cases, mixed-effect models would represent more appropriate tests, in particular with regard to the following figures:</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer directing us Yu et al., 2022. Accordingly, we have revised the statistical analyses to account for the animal from which an observation is made. In many cases, we have now analyzed the data using linear mixed-effect models with animal-specific random effects, as recommended by Yu et al., 2022. The majority of our findings remained statistically significant with the revised statistical tests.

We respectfully disagree with the reviewer that a two-way ANOVA would be more appropriate for Figure 9D and E because the test is used to know how two independent variables, in combination, affect a dependent variable. In this case the knockout of miR-218 either in pyramidal neurons or in interneurons is not in combination. These are not animals coming from the same litters and experiments were not done the same day. The two data sets were grouped in a single bar graph for simplicity of visualization, but we realized it was misleading and confusing; hence, we split them in two graphs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
