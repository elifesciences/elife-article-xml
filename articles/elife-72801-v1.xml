Understanding the biological basis for the spectrum of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-related disease manifestations is imperative to improving treatment and prevention of CDI. Here, we investigate the correlates of asymptomatic <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization using a multi-omics approach. We compared the fecal microbiome and metabolome profiles of patients with CDI versus asymptomatically colonized patients, integrating clinical and pathogen factors into our analysis. We found that CDI patients were more likely to be colonized by strains with the binary toxin (CDT) locus or strains of ribotype 027, which are often hypervirulent. We find that microbiomes of asymptomatically colonized patients are significantly enriched for species in the class Clostridia relative to those of symptomatic patients. Relative to CDI microbiomes, asymptomatically colonized patient microbiomes were enriched with sucrose degradation pathways encoded by commensal Clostridia, in addition to glycoside hydrolases putatively involved in starch and sucrose degradation. Fecal metabolomics corroborates the carbohydrate degradation signature: we identify carbohydrate compounds enriched in asymptomatically colonized patients relative to CDI patients. Further, we reveal that across <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates, the carbohydrates sucrose, rhamnose, and lactulose do not serve as robust growth substrates in vitro, consistent with their enriched detection in our metagenomic and metabolite profiling of asymptomatically colonized individuals. We conclude that pathogen genetic variation may be strongly related to disease outcome. More interestingly, we hypothesize that in asymptomatically colonized individuals, carbohydrate metabolism by other commensal Clostridia may prevent CDI by inhibiting <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation. These insights into <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization and putative commensal competition suggest novel avenues to develop probiotic or prebiotic therapeutics against CDI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Clostridioides difficile</kwd><kwd>gut microbiome</kwd><kwd>colonization resistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1DK111930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henderson</surname><given-names>Jeffrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000030</institution-id><institution>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200-2017-96178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dubberke</surname><given-names>Erik R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008460</institution-id><institution>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AT009741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dantas</surname><given-names>Gautam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000125</institution-id><institution>National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01OH011578l</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dantas</surname><given-names>Gautam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000090</institution-id><institution>Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH1810225</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dantas</surname><given-names>Gautam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HD004010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fishbein</surname><given-names>Skye RS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Integration of clinical patient data, pathogen information and a multi-omic analysis of the gut microbiome reveals key determinants of disease in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-colonized patients.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> infection (CDI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the health care setting and in the community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guh et al., 2020</xref>). Antibiotic treatments, among other risk factors associated with weakened colonization resistance, increase susceptibility to CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubberke and Olsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eze et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>C. difficile</italic> residence in the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract may result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic colonization to severe CDI-related colitis and fatal toxic megacolon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crobach et al., 2018</xref>). Diagnosis of CDI relies on detection of the protein toxin, most commonly by enzyme immunoassay (EIA), or the detection of the toxin-encoding genes <italic>tcdA</italic> and <italic>tcdB</italic>, by nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). These diagnostic tools serve as rough benchmarks for assessing the severity of disease. Discrepancies between the results of these assays, as in the case of patients with clinically significant diarrhea (CSD) who are EIA negative (EIA-) but NAAT positive for toxigenic <italic>C. difficile</italic> (Cx+)<italic>,</italic> highlight the complexity of states in which <italic>C. difficile</italic> can exist in the GI tract. Because CDI is a multi-factorial interaction between the host, pathogen, and microbiome, clarifying the differences in biological correlates between asymptomatic colonization (Cx+/EIA-) and CDI (Cx+/EIA+) is critical for identifying mechanisms of colonization resistance, and for defining novel probiotic or prebiotic avenues for treatment or prevention of CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kondepudi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rätsep et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p><italic>C. difficile</italic> enters the GI tract as a spore, germinates in the presence of primary bile acids, and replicates through consumption of amino acids and other microbiota or host-derived nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hryckowian et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, many of these metabolic cues are characteristic of a perturbed microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nagao-Kitamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battaglioli et al., 2018</xref>). The hallmark of <italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis is the expression of the toxin locus encoded on the <italic>tcd</italic> operon; this locus is tightly regulated by nutrient levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martin-Verstraete et al., 2016</xref>). Correspondingly, it is hypothesized that an environment replete of nutrients induces toxinogenesis, allowing <italic>C. difficile</italic> to restructure the gut environment and acquire nutrients through inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fletcher et al., 2021</xref>). The instances of patients who are colonized but have no detectable <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin in their stool suggests that these patients’ microbiomes may be less permissive towards CDI development. Identification of metabolic traits within the microbiome of asymptomatic, <italic>C. difficile</italic>-colonized patients could reveal a number of potential therapeutic pathways toward precise amelioration of symptomatic <italic>C. difficile</italic> disease.</p><p>A multitude of probiotic and prebiotic approaches have demonstrated efficacy to curb <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rätsep et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>). While restoration of the microbiota through fecal microbiota transplantation can provide colonization resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Laffin et al., 2017</xref>), the molecular mechanisms of how this resistance is conferred remain unclear. Recent studies using a murine model of infection have indicated that the administration of carbohydrates (both complex and simple) in the diet can be used to curb or prevent CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mefferd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schnizlein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hryckowian et al., 2018</xref>). Paradoxically, integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics data collected during murine <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization indicates that simple carbohydrates are imperative for pathogen replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fletcher et al., 2018</xref>). It is critical to understand the mechanism by which catabolism of specific carbohydrates could inhibit <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation in the human GI tract.</p><p>Here, we perform a multi-level investigation of two relevant patient populations, those colonized with <italic>C. difficile</italic> but EIA negative (asymptomatically colonized) and those who are EIA positive (CDI) to understand the microbial and metabolic features that may underlie protection from CDI. First, we use microbiome analyses to identify a number of non-<italic>C. difficile</italic>, clostridial species that are negatively correlated with <italic>C. difficile</italic> in asymptomatically colonized individuals. Secondly, interrogation of a metabolomics dataset from the same patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>) reveals increased abundance of a number of carbohydrate metabolites in asymptomatically colonized patients. Finally, we show that some metabolites enriched in asymptomatically colonized individuals are largely non-utilizable by <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates. Together, these datasets reveal that asymptomatically colonized patients are defined by an interaction of clostridial species and carbohydrate metabolites that may serve as a last-line of resistance against CDI in colonized patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The clinical manifestation of <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization in a host gastrointestinal tract is determined by a multi-factorial interaction between the host, their microbiome, and the pathogen. We hypothesized that, among these factors, natural variation in <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains infecting patients might differentiate asymptomatic from CDI patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubberke et al., 2018</xref>). Through retrospective analysis of a human cohort of 124 patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) with clinically significant diarrhea (CSD) and stool submitted for <italic>C. difficile</italic> toxin testing, we defined two cohorts: those diagnosed with CDI (Cx+/EIA+) or those asymptomatically colonized (Cx+/EIA-) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>). EIA status (EIA+ or EIA-) was determined by the result of the clinical toxin EIA performed on the stool specimen, and a positive toxigenic culture (a <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolate with with <italic>tcdA</italic> and/or <italic>tcdB;</italic> Cx+) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubberke et al., 2018</xref>). In-depth analysis of <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolate factors related to EIA status was performed on the isolates corresponding to the 102 metagenomic samples analyzed (see Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Multiplex PCR was used to identify isolates with <italic>cdtAB</italic>, the binary toxin locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cowardin et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, there was a significant enrichment of isolates with <italic>cdtAB</italic> in the stools of patients with CDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; p = 0.0012, Fisher’s exact test). Additionally, there were differences in the distribution of <italic>C. difficile</italic> strains associated with the two patient cohorts; CDI patients were more likely to be infected by a <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolate of the ribotype 027 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; p = 0.0058, Fisher’s exact test), a clade likely to contain virulent members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merrigan et al., 2010</xref>). Interestingly, of the isolates positive for <italic>cdtAB</italic> (22 out of 102 isolates), 36% were considered a ribotype 027 strain. Given these genetic indicators of potential differences in virulence, we asked if strains from both groups were capable of producing toxin, using culture supernatants from in vitro broth culture. We found that 56% of isolates expressed detectable TcdA/B, with no significant different (p = 0.86) in the capacity of strains from Cx+/EIA- stools (24 out of 54 isolates) or Cx+/EIA+ (24 out of 48 isolates) to elaborate toxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Predictably, differences in genetic indicators of strain virulence (as indicated by prevalence of both a prominent ribotype and a second toxin locus) were significant correlates of EIA status.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pathogen and microbiome determinants of <italic>C. difficile</italic>-colonized patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic> isolate distribution based on PCR and ribotyping data for each isolate cultured from patient stools. **, p &lt; 0.001 as measured by a Fisher’s exact test.

To determine the microbial correlates of disease state, we performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing on patient stool samples from the asymptomatic (n = 54) and CDI (n = 48) groups, and classified species using MetaPhlAn2. Given the strong association with antibiotic exposure in our CDI cohort, we hypothesized that our asymptomatically colonized patients would have increased microbiome-mediated colonization resistance relative to CDI patients. We examined community structure in stool metagenomes and found that there was no significant difference in Faith’s diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Faith and Baker, 2007</xref>), a measure of alpha-diversity that incorporates phylogenetic relationships, between patient groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p = 0.1602). There were no significant differences in beta-diversity, as measured by weighted Unifrac distance, between EIA status (p = 0.233, permutational analysis of variance test [PERMANOVA]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although we hypothesized that increased virulence (through additional toxin allele or ribotype) associated with EIA+ could affect microbiome structure, we found no significant association between beta-diversity and <italic>cdtAB</italic> presence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; p = 0.799, PERMANOVA) or ribotype distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>; p = 0.982, PERMANOVA).

In contrast, we found no significant differences in relative abundance of bacterial phyla between asymptomatically colonized patients and patients with CDI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data indicate that there were no gross differences in microbiome structure related to either EIA status or pathogen features.</p><p>Instead, we hypothesized that differences between these states may manifest at higher resolution. We used a multivariable regression model, as implemented by MaAslin2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mallick et al., 2021</xref>) to identify microbial taxa predictive of either group. Interestingly, species from class Clostridia were most enriched in taxa significantly altered by EIA status (Fisher’s exact test, p = 0.0022). <italic>C. difficile</italic> was the strongest predictor of CDI state, whereas non-<italic>C. difficile</italic> clostridial taxa were predictive of asymptomatic state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, FDR &lt; 0.25). Correspondingly, we saw increased <italic>C. difficile</italic> relative abundance in CDI patients and increased levels of a number of non-<italic>C. difficile</italic> clostridial species, including <italic>Eubacterium</italic> spp., <italic>Dorea</italic> spp., and <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic> spp. in asymptomatic patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Given our inability to detect <italic>C. difficile</italic> in all sequenced stools (70 out of 102 culture-positive stool samples), we utilized an alternative metagenomic species classifier Kraken (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wood and Salzberg, 2014</xref>), to validate our findings. Using Kraken, we detected <italic>C. difficile</italic> in nearly all stool metagenomes (101 out of 102). Using the identical linear mixed modeling approach (MaAsLin2), we recapitulated data indicating that <italic>C. difficile</italic> abundance was the strongest predictor of EIA status and increased in Cx+/EIA+ patients. Additionally, a number of commensal clostridial taxa from the <italic>Eubacterium</italic> genus and <italic>Anaerostipes</italic> genus were strongly associated with EIA- status, confirming prior MetaPhlAn2 predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>,B).</p><p>Using our microbiome data, we examined the association between <italic>C. difficile</italic> levels and pathogen markers previously associated with EIA status.

Notably, there was a slight, yet insignificant increase in <italic>C. difficile</italic> abundance in microbiomes associated with a ribotype 027 isolate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) relative to microbiomes associated with <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates of other ribotypes. We also interrogated taxonomic features that were predictive of antibiotic exposure. Expectedly, we found that taxonomic features predictive of CDI state were also associated with antibiotic exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Our data indicate that patients with asymptomatic <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization or CDI do not have grossly different gut microbiome community structures but instead have distinctive alterations in a subset of species from class Clostridia and class Bacilli in the microbiota.</p><p><italic>C. difficile</italic> pathogenesis is heavily affected by carbohydrate, amino acid, and bile acid levels in the gastrointestinal tract, related to the metabolism of competitive commensals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sorbara and Pamer, 2019</xref>). To identify metabolic pathways in other clostridia that might enable them to outcompete <italic>C. difficile</italic>, we defined metabolic potential in patient microbiomes using HUMAnN2 to quantify microbial pathway abundances. We found no significant differences in alpha- or beta-diversity between overall metabolic pathway composition in the two patient microbiome groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>,B; p = 0.2393, Wilcoxon rank sum and p = 0.054, PERMANOVA). Therefore, we trained an elastic net model to identify specific pathways associated with EIA status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found a number of carbohydrate degradation pathways and amino acid biosynthetic pathways associated with the asymptomatically-colonized (Cx+/EIA-) patients, including sucrose degradation III and fucose and rhamnose degradation. Investigation of the genera that encode such pathways revealed that the sucrose degradation III pathway was increased in asymptomatic patients, largely due to <italic>Blautia</italic> spp. and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> spp. of the class Clostridia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, the fucose and rhamnose degradation pathways were entirely defined by <italic>Escherichia spp.</italic>, presumably <italic>E. coli</italic>. This suggests that metabolic functions such as fucose and rhamnose degradation may be confined to a smaller number of taxa than carbohydrate degradation pathways such as sucrose degradation. Using the HUMAnN2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franzosa et al., 2018</xref>) gene family information, we used linear mixed modeling to identify carbohydrate-active enzymes differentially associated with EIA status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Supporting the pathway analysis, we found an increased abundance of a subset of glycoside hydrolase genes, specifically involved in sucrose and starch metabolism in the asymptomatically colonized patients.

We again used MaAslin2 to determine metabolites associated with each disease state. Consistent with previous analysis, a number of end-product Stickland fermentation metabolites (4-methypentanoic acid and 5-aminovalerate) were associated with CDI patients. While 4-hydroxyproline was the strongest predictor of asymptomaticallycolonized patients, many of the significant metabolites that were associated with asymptomatic patients were predicted to be carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, FDR &lt; 0.25; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Putative metabolite identities were initially annotated by matching metabolite spectra to the NIST14 GC-MS spectral library.

These data reveal a carbohydrate signature that is depleted in CDI patients. Notably, fructose and rhamnose are either substrates or products of the sucrose degradation III and fucose and rhamnose degradation pathways, which we found to be enriched in asymptomatically colonized patients.

Using a defined minimal media (CDMM)( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karasawa et al., 1995</xref>) to test nutrient utilization, we found that <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates grew robustly on fructose as expected (median maximum A<sub>600</sub> of 0.90), but did not proliferate on rhamnose or lactulose (median maximum A<sub>600</sub> of 0.19 and 0.24, respectively).

We optimized the number of latent components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and number of variables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Of the metabolomic variable weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the 10 highest-weighted metabolites were also discovered by previous analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The predictive value of each of the components per block was greater that an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.85, with the second metagenomic block component having the best performance (AUC = 0.94, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The strong performance of the latent components in classifying samples via EIA status validated our previous findings. Using the variables defining the first latent component, we performed correlational analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and found a number of striking correlations. <italic>C. difficile</italic> abundance was positively correlated with a number of well-known Stickland metabolites (5-amino-valeric acid and 4-methylpentanoic acid, rho = 0.48 and 0.36, respectively)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2019</xref>), whereas <italic>C. difficile</italic> had negative correlations with fructose, rhamnose, and hydroxyproline (rho = –0.27, 0.36, and –0.34, respectively).

Accordingly, we performed whole transcriptome RNA sequencing on <italic>C. difficile</italic> cultures exposed to a metabolizable substrate, fructose, or a non-metabolizable substrate, rhamnose.

Some of the most altered genes were indicative of carbon catabolite repression of sugar transport and upregulation of glycolytic processes to metabolize fructose. In contrast, we found only three genes significantly increased in the rhamnose condition. The lack of striking systems-level or targeted (toxin expression, sporulation) regulation by rhamnose, and <italic>C. difficile</italic>’s inability to utilize it, leads us to conclude that its association with asymptomatically colonized patients’ microbiomes is not through direct interaction or suppression of <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Instead, we speculate that rhamnose may be the byproduct of a complex commensal metabolism of other dietary polysaccharide substrates, which could exclude <italic>C. difficile</italic> from the GI tract.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Factors affecting the outcome of <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization</title><p>Susceptibility to CDI is the result of a complex interaction between host factors (variation in bile acid metabolism, adaptive immunity) and abiotic factors such as antibiotic treatment and diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mullish and Allegretti, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Littmann et al., 2021</xref>). These variables largely affect colonization resistance in the gut microbiome community and influence pathogen proliferation (germination rate, variation in toxin activity, and metabolic capacity). Our study endeavored to identify gut microbiome signatures (both taxonomic and metabolic), bacteriologic traits, and antibiotic exposure histories that might help explain Cx+/EIA- <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization. Clinically, this manifestation is an intermediate state on the spectrum of <italic>C. difficile</italic>- associated disease and correspondingly, a diagnostic conundrum. One limitation of this study is our inability to assess dietary histories of patients leading up the diagnostic event. The metabolomic data provides a snapshot in time. While we hypothesize the increase in monosaccharides is due to an increase in carbohydrate degradation within the community, it is unclear whether the carbohydrate signature is due to microbial community differences in cross-feeding rates or differences in host diet.</p><p>Another important limitation to this study is our inability to control for <italic>C. difficile</italic> strain differences and correspondingly, heterogeneity in processes such as spore germination, nutrient utilization, and toxin expression in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hunt and Ballard, 2013</xref>).

In vitro examination of toxin production (TcdA and TcdB) using a commercial ELISA indicated that over half of isolates expressed detectable levels of toxins. Toxin expression is well-known to be regulated by nutrient conditions and although our in vitro data indicate that both cohorts contain similar numbers of strains capable of producing toxin in vitro, such conditions are considered inadequate to predict in vivo levels of toxin production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burnham and Carroll, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akerlund et al., 2006</xref>).

Clindamycin and quinolones, two antibiotics also associated with CDI in other human cohorts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Teng et al., 2019</xref>) are likely not significantly associated in our population due to the low prevalence of their exposure.

However, we restricted our cohort to patients who were not on their way to developing CDI, by excluding patients with EIA- stool if they were subsequently diagnosed with CDI or received empiric CDI treatment within 10 days of initial stool collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubberke et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In another scenario, the overlap of signatures between pathways, metabolites, and microbes highlights a number of possible metabolic pathways that might be exclusionary to <italic>C. difficile,</italic> namely starch/sucrose degradation and rhamnose degradation. The combination of our microbiome data, which shows enrichment of number of commensal Clostridia such as <italic>Eubacterium</italic> spp.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desai et al., 2016</xref>), starch/sucrose degradation pathways, and our in vitro data highlights a possible microbe-metabolite combination that could prevent <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation. Rhamnose is a major component of plant and some bacterial cell-wall polysaccharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). Metabolic pathway profiling revealed an enrichment of fucose and rhamnose degradation pathways in asymptomatically colonized patients, represented by Enterobacterales taxa. Therefore, we propose that the detected rhamnose is a byproduct of commensal catabolism of more complex polysaccharides containing rhamnose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Porter and Martens, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mistou et al., 2016</xref>). These findings are of course limited by the scope of the in vitro experiment and the correlative nature of our microbiome data. Future work examining in vivo competition between diverse <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates and commensal isolates with critical metabolic elements would be required.</p><p>Lactulose was a carbohydrate associated with asymptomatically-colonized patients and not a robust growth substrate for <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Interestingly, lactulose has been previously associated with a decrease in <italic>C. difficile</italic>-related diarrhea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maltz et al., 2020</xref>) and decreased risk of CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maltz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwalla et al., 2017</xref>). Lactulose is a disaccharide product from heat treatment of lactose (a common sugar in dairy products), but it is also a component of some laxatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi, 1958</xref>). However, patients were screened and excluded from this cohort if they were prescribed laxatives in the 24 hr prior to sample collection. In addition to this screening/exclusion criteria, lactulose is almost exclusively prescribed to liver failure patients (there were none reported in this study), thus it is more likely to be present from consumption of heated milk (containing lactose). Other in vitro work demonstrates that addition of ‘non-digestible’ oligosaccharides, such as lactulose, provides a competitive advantage to <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> spp. over <italic>C. difficile</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kondepudi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins and Macfarlane, 2003</xref>). While we do not recommend lactulose, a laxative, as such a prebiotic, there are a number of other ‘non-digestible’ oligosaccharides that might serve similar purposes in future interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hopkins and Macfarlane, 2003</xref>). Taken together, these data emphasize the potential for synthetic or natural prebiotic interventions to shift a vulnerable microbiota away from CDI.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Strategies to ameliorate toxigenic <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation</title><p>Our multi-omics analyses of a colonized asymptomatic patient population support a growing body of literature concerning commensal metabolism as a tool against <italic>C. difficile</italic>. Evidence from both mouse models of disease and human studies indicate that administration of polysaccharides or ‘microbial accessible carbohydrates’ may prevent <italic>C. difficile</italic> proliferation or decrease the risk of CDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mefferd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schnizlein et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hryckowian et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maltz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, a probiotics-based attempt to design a consortium of mucosal sugar utilizers revealed its ability to decrease <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that increasing mucosal metabolism, or carbohydrate catabolism, may be another route to strengthening commensal resistance to <italic>C. difficile.</italic> Interestingly, previous attempts to combinatorically assemble species and nutrient combinations that might inhibit <italic>C. difficile</italic> indicate that success is afforded by species able to competitively utilize carbohydrates such as sorbitol and mannitol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghimire et al., 2020</xref>). Given the plethora of prebiotics and probiotics explored in the <italic>C. difficile</italic> field, we emphasize the need for an approach that harnesses both probiotic- and prebiotic-based components to inhibit the proliferation of <italic>C. difficile</italic> and toxin-mediated pathogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient cohort analysis</title><p>A previous retrospective cohort study was conducted to understand <italic>C. difficile</italic> colonization. In that study, <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates were cultured from patient stool as described. Ribotyping was performed using the DiversiLab Bacterial Barcodes software (bioMerieux) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubberke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Westblade et al., 2013</xref>). Analysis of isolate genetic traits and in vitro toxin production was performed on the 102 isolates for which we had corresponding metagenomic sequencing data (see below). Data concerning isolate ribotype was aggregated into the three most abundant ribotypes (ribotype 027, ribotype 106, ribotype 14/20), where all other ribotypes or unclassified strains were grouped into ‘Other’. For the purposes of this study, data concerning inpatient antibiotic orders were retrospectively collected from the electronic medical informatics database for patients with toxin EIA positive (Cx+/EIA+) stool (n = 62) or toxin EIA negative (Cx+/EIA-) stool (n = 62). The presence of antibiotic orders was classified into three dichotomous groups by timing of exposure: antibiotics in 0–7 days before stool collection (1 week), antibiotics in &gt;7–14 days before stool collection (2 weeks), and antibiotics in &gt;14–30 days before stool collection (1 month). To understand the specific antibiotics associated with EIA status in our patient cohort, raw antibiotic exposure data was aggregated by time. Additionally, low-prevalent antibiotics ( &lt; 10% exposure in patients) were removed from analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed using the <italic>glm</italic> function in R. To understand overall antibiotic exposure as it relates to EIA status, any antibiotic exposure was considered ‘1’ and zero antibiotic exposure in a patient was considered ‘0’. The binary antibiotic exposure variable was then used in linear mixed modeling analysis to understand species associated with antibiotic exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Metagenomic sequencing and analysis of patient stool</title><p>Metagenomic DNA was extracted from patient stools as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishbein et al., 2021a</xref>). <italic>C. difficile</italic> was isolated from patient stools as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fishbein et al., 2021a</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Peter J Turnbaugh as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Need to discuss the ability to exclude alternative hypotheses, including variations between C. difficile strains, dietary intake, differences in host physiology, and bile acid production/metabolism. The former seems like a critical point – are these individuals colonized by similar strains of C. difficile? Are they all toxin positive? It is critical to test if C. difficile from the Cx+/EIA- samples are actually capable of producing toxin.

They do this through the re-analysis of their previously published cohort wherein they can separate the colonization vs infection state on the basis of qPCR and toxin detection (EIA) which provides a unique opportunity to address their question in an excellently phenotyped cohort.</p><p>Using appropriate and current approaches, the authors find relatively subtle differences in the microbiome and metabolome of colonized/infected participants including certain carbohydrates which are elevated in asymptomatic individuals. They demonstrate these carbohydrates are not substrates for C. difficile; however, this line of experimentation sought to find negative results and it remains to be determined if they have any relevance in vivo or in complex communities. The authors could consider an additional experiment to probe this observation in more depth such as ex vivo fecal incubations or strain-strain competition experiments to provide more direct evidence for how they may influence the suppression of C. difficile.</p><p>Comments for the authors:</p><p>Given that this manuscript is primarily computational, it would be beneficial if the code for the analysis was shared in a public repository.</p><p>PRJNA748262 does not appear to be publicly available.</p><p>Line 66: would asymptomatic colonization be on the disease spectrum?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reveals exciting details of the lifestyle of C. difficile in individuals who are asymptomatic carriers and contrasts these with individuals with active CDI. It will be an important contribution to the C. difficile research field and more broadly to people interested in targeted manipulation of microbial communities.</p><p>The study team leveraged a unique patient cohort, coupled with metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, and bacterial culture techniques to suggest that the gut microbiome (namely, commensal clostridia) inhibit C. difficile proliferation. Much of the paper relies on the idea that C. difficile burdens are lower in asymptomatically colonized individuals versus those with C. difficile infection (CDI). However, many individuals who are asymptomatically colonized with C. difficile have burdens that are comparable to those who have CDI (and there may be a bimodal distribution of asymptomatically colonized individuals – those that have C. difficile detectable by metagenomic sequencing and those that do not). I worry that their conclusions are skewed by an apparent binary distribution of C. difficile burdens in both patient groups.</p><p>The patients are binned based on initial C. difficile diagnostic tests (asymptomatic individuals carry toxin-encoding C. difficile as detected by PCR but have no detectable toxin via immunoassay). I am unsure how sensitive the standard diagnostic immunoassay for C. difficile is but do know C. difficile toxin production is controlled by a complex regulatory network and abundance of these toxins can change with respect to parameters such as nutrient availability, temperature, pH, and cell density. I wonder if the isolates from the study are all capable of producing functional toxin. These strains could have mutations (in regulatory elements, for example) that may impact toxin production.</p><p>The authors perform a culture-based experiment to support their findings that certain metabolites present in the gastrointestinal tracts of asymptomatic individuals do not support the growth of C. difficile. They use isolates from the study participants but it is unclear if these isolates were taken from asymptomatic individuals or those with CDI but do not leverage strains commonly used in the research community (C. difficile 630 and C. difficile R20291).</p><p>Lines 67-69. What is the limit of detection of EIA? It's striking to me that, while C. difficile burdens are a predictor of Cx+/EIA+ vs. Cx+/EIA- patients, there are ~23 Cx+/EIA- patients whose relative abundance of C. difficile essentially superimposes with those of the Cx+/EIA+ group. There are fibroblast rounding assays that quantify C. difficile toxins. The limit of detection of these assays may be lower than kits used in diagnostic labs. Can the authors perform one of these assays on the samples in this study to better calibrate readers expectations of whether toxigenic C. difficile is or is not expressing toxin? As the paper stands, I assume that production of toxin in C. difficile is all-or-nothing, but prior work on regulation of toxin production in C. difficile has demonstrated that many regulatory cues influence toxin production (Martin-Verstraete et al. 2016) so I expect this to be non-binary. In addition, and considering the regulatory networks that control toxin production, are the C. difficile isolates from asymptomatic patients capable of producing toxin in vitro? Just because the gene is there doesn't mean that it's functional.</p><p>Line 140-142. &quot;Given that C. difficile levels were an overt predictor of CDI…&quot; Are C. difficile levels still a predictor of the Cx+/EIA+ state if the samples where C. difficile was not detectable by metagenomic sequencing were removed (see Figure S1C [bottom right hand corner of the graph], n=2 Cx+/EIA+ samples and n=? Cx+/EIA- samples)? The burdens of C. difficile in these individuals seem to be at least an order of magnitude lower than patients with low-but-detectable burdens and appear to be bimodally distributed. If there is no change to the conclusions of the study if these samples are removed, are there features (metabolites, taxa) that differentiate individuals who do or do not have metagenomically detectable C. difficile?</p><p>Line 144.

Do any of the taxa that associiate with Cx+/EIA- conditions metabolize rhamnopolysaccharides? This could be done by mining the metagenomes for CAZymes or by performing growth assays with isolates of relevant bacteria.</p><p>Lines 248-251: &quot;The observed increased abundance of monosaccharides…&quot; If this is true, shouldn't there be fewer sugars in both high diversity conditions and low diversity conditions?

To address the points raised, we analyzed the ribotype distribution across <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates in our Cx+/EIA- and Cx+/EIA+ patients and also used diagnostic PCR data to characterize the presence or absence of the binary toxin loci (<italic>cdtAB</italic>).

Yet, as the reviewer has indicated it is very possible that the isolate has the locus present but does not express the toxin due to multiple possible levels of genetic/epigenetic variation. To answer the question of whether the Cx+/EIA- express toxin (TcdA and TcdB), we performed in vitro toxin ELISAs on all 102 <italic>C. difficile</italic> isolates for which we had corresponding stool metagenomic data. We found that approximately half of the isolates expressed detectable levels of toxin, and found no significant differences in the proportion of isolates that express toxin between the two study groups (Supplementary Figure 1A, P=0.86, Fisher’s exact test). As has previously been reported [2, 3], toxin expression is highly regulated by environmental cues, and can be difficult to detect during in vitro broth culture. While our in vitro data would indicate that there is no difference in the toxin expression capacity of isolates from the two cohorts, future experiments, outside the scope of this paper, will examine the variability in clinical isolate toxin expression in vivo and under different environmental cues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Given the compositional nature of the sequencing data it is possible that differences in C. difficile are responsible for some of the observed differences in community structure.

As we have not accounted for differences in host diet, we note that we cannot attribute the differences in levels monosaccharides to differences in host diet or differences in cross-feeding rate in the community (lines 299-301).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 253-256: Given the previous reports cited in the manuscript and the range of metabolic capabilities illustrated by the clinical isolates used in this study, it would be worthwhile to assay the sugars from Figure 4 against strains of C. difficile commonly used in the C. difficile research community (at least, C. difficile 630 and difficile R0291).</p></disp-quote><p>We have redone these experiments with <italic>C. difficile</italic> 630, a commonly used reference strain, and also kept <italic>C. difficile</italic> VPI10643, which is a commonly used reference strain for animal experiments [5, 6]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lines 262-264: This is really interesting. How many patients were excluded? Assaying toxin production in these patients (see comment on Lines 67-69, above) before and after diagnosis, or sequencing C. difficile from these patients at each of these time points, would be helpful in thinking about the transitions between asymptomatic carriage and symptomatic CDI. This is, of course, beyond the scope of the current study and only mentioned because it would be of scientific and clinical interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s excitement, and we are in the process of trying to study such transitions both in animal models and in patients.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 320.

What percent of the variation in the data are expressed in this beta diversity metric? Is the conclusion different if a phylogenetically-aware metric (e.g. Weighted/Unweighted UniFrac) is used?</p></disp-quote><p>More variation is incorporated in the principal coordinate analysis of weighted UniFrac distance (a phylogenetically-aware metric, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3B</xref>), compared to that of Bray Curtis dissimilarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A</xref>). We had previously quantified beta-dispersion between groups, but found that it would be more appropriate to quantify the permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) using the adonis package and found that using phylogenetically-aware measures such as unweighted UniFrac distance and weighted UniFrac dissimilarity yielded insignificant differences in community structure (P=654, P=0.233), compared to that of Bray Curtis (P=0.415). For this reason, we have decided to present weighted Unifrac dissimilarity in the main text.</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-72801-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1.
