Globally, the number of adults with hypertension increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015; the increase is especially significant in low-income and middle-income countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration (NCD-RisC), 2017</xref>). As estimated, the number of adults with hypertension is predicted to rise to 1.56 billion by 2025 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kearney et al., 2005</xref>). In China, high systolicblood pressure (SBP) is the leading risk factor for both number of deaths and percentage of disability-adjusted life-years, which accounted for 2.54 million deaths in 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, according to the latest nationwide survey of 451,755 participants from 31 provinces in China, 23.2% (nearly 244.5 million) of Chinese adults have hypertension. The data generated in the China Patient-Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events Million Persons Project have shown more serious results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joint Committee for Guideline Revision, 2019</xref>]. Among individuals with hypertension, while 46.9% are aware of their condition and 40.7% take prescribed antihypertensive medications, only 15.3% are in control of their blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Hypertension has imposed so heavy an economic burden on healthcare systems that it requires urgent attention. Early detection of hypertension is vitally important in its control and effective treatment, especially with high-risk subjects.</p><p>Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, is characterized by a persistent elevation of blood pressure in the systemic arteries. Traditionally, the diagnostic criteria of hypertension were SBP ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolicblood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg for the untreated participants, or those taking medication for hypertension. The criteria were broadly accepted by both the 2018 Chinese Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension and the 2018 European Society of Cardiology/European Society of Hypertension guidelines (2018 ESC/ESH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joint Committee for Guideline Revision, 2019</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). However, in November 2017, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association published a guideline for the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure in Adults (2017 ACC/AHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Whelton et al., 2018</xref>), which redefined the diagnostic criteria of hypertension from 140/90 mmHg to 130/80 mmHg for SBP/DBP. This conspicuous numerically based change results in an increased number of patients being diagnosed with hypertension and in questioning the goal’s clinical applicability given the financial burden and clinical outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">López-Jaramillo et al., 2020</xref>). The applicability and potential impact of ACC/AHA 2017 need to be assessed prior to adopting the guideline, especially in China.</p><p>Hypertension has been deemed as a complex and multifactorial trait. It is well known that the pathophysiology of hypertension is shaped by combined action of environmental, genetic, anatomical, neural, endocrinal, humoral, and hemodynamic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rodriguez-Iturbe et al., 2017</xref>). For example, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet is reported to be closely related to lower risk of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Navarro-Prado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Francisco et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, psychosocial factors are also possible potentiators and triggers of hypertension. It was showed that psychosocial stress, including occupational stress, socioeconomic pressure, anxiety, and depression, was all associated with greater risk of hypertension, and hypertensive patients had higher level of psychosocial stress compared to normotension patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, a simple and reliable model that helps clinicians or subjects to estimate the risk of hypertension is urgently in need.</p><p>In the present study, we aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model for the screening of hypertension by analyzing the routine parameters of physical examination in China.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characteristics of subjects</title><p>In Group<sup>140/90</sup>, as well as the cut-off value of 140/90 mmHg, the total prevalence of hypertension in 2019 was 24.77% (1536 subjects).

Therefore, it is necessary to establish a model to estimate the risk of hypertension to aid in risk stratification and management. Some hypertension risk prediction models have been preliminarily developed in different populations in the past decade, such as in Iranian, Korean, Japanese, and Indian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozorgmanesh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Otsuka et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sathish et al., 2016</xref>). In these models, the risk factors of hypertension varied widely across studies. Age, SBP, DBP, and current smoking status were the most common independent factors in the studied population, and all of them were included in four prediction models. However, there is no agreement among investigators as to what constitutes a major predictor. It is therefore suggested that a hypertension risk prediction model developed in the particular racial, ethnic, or national groups may not be directly applied to other populations.</p><p>In China, some hypertension risk prediction models were also established. In 2016, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2016</xref> constructed a sex-specific multivariable hypertension prediction model based on northern urban Han Chinese population. The predictive model yielded an AUC of 0.761 for men and 0.753 for women. The limitation of their study is that it did not perform internal or external validation. In 2019, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Xu et al., 2019</xref> constructed several predictive models for hypertension among Chinese rural populations. In the training set, AUCs ranged from 0.720 to 0.767 for men and from 0.740 to 0.809 for women. In the testing set, AUCs ranged from 0.722 to 0.773 for men and from 0.698 to 0.765 for women. Two studies mentioned above were carried out either in a single rural area or urban area. Another predicted model for hypertension based on a large cross-sectional study was established recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ren et al., 2020</xref>). In spite of a large group of people (73,158 samples), the prediction performances of the model were simply assessed by probability of disease (POD) index and AUC values (76.52% in the train set and 75.81% in the test set). Therefore, the present study might be the first one to develop nomogram for the prediction of hypertension based on systematic assessment and validation in China.</p><p>In this study, according to two diagnostic criteria of hypertension, we developed and validated two nomograms for the prediction of hypertension based on a 10-year retrospective cohort study in Chinese population. Both nomograms were constructed mainly based on the physical examination data. The nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> incorporated 10 parameters including family history of hypertension, age, SBP, DBP, BMI, MCHC, MPV, TP, TBIL, and TG. The nomogram<sup>130/80</sup> incorporated six parameters including family history of hypertension, age, SBP, DBP, RDWSD, and TBIL. All parameters are readily available in routine health examinations. Therefore, these nomograms will be useful for the in-depth assessment without the assistance of physicians. Notably, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that AUC of nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> was higher than that of nomogram<sup>130/80</sup>. The nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> also displayed excellent discrimination with a C-index of 0.75 and good calibration. High C-index value of 0.772 could still be reached in the internal validation. DCA and clinical impact curve showed that the majority of the threshold probabilities in this model had good net benefits. Moreover, NRI and IDI were originally proposed to characterize accuracy improvement in predicting a binary outcome, when new biomarkers are added to regression models. Most recently, these two indices have been extended from binary outcomes to multicategorical and survival outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in 2020, Zhang et al. compared the predictive ability of a stroke prediction model (China-PAR) with the revised Framingham Stroke Risk Score (R-FSRS) for 5-year stroke incidence in a community cohort of Chinese adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>]. The two prediction models have five same risk factors, as well as two additional factors in R-FSRS and six additional factors in China-PAR. The NRI and IDI values were assessed to compare the discrimination ability of two prediction models. Similarly, to better assess the performance of nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> and nomogram<sup>130/80</sup>, the NRI and IDI were also used to determine the best model. In this study, the NRI and IDI showed that the nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> exhibited superior performance than nomogram<sup>130/80</sup>. Thus, the nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> is the most sensitive hypertension risk prediction tool under the promise of guaranteeing accuracy.</p><p>Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that gender was not an independent predictor for hypertension in our study. Similar to our study, researchers from Iran revealed the same result, reporting that sex was not found to be an independent risk factor for hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Talaei et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, several previous studies have reported gender to be significantly associated with hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fidalgo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kshirsagar et al., 2010</xref>). It is still controversial whether the incidence of hypertension is associated with gender. In the future, the role of gender on blood pressure and its correlation with hypertension need further evaluation with larger population cohorts.</p><p>In our study, the total incidence of hypertension was 24.77% and 37.92% at a cut-off value of 140/90 mmHg and 130/80 mmHg, respectively. The reported prevalence of hypertension in China shows a great geographical variation, ranging from 23.2% to 44.7% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Joint Committee for Guideline Revision, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asgari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Labasangzhu et al., 2020</xref>). The difference between these studies may be caused by the following reasons. Firstly, the surveys mentioned above were conducted in different periods and in different age groups by different organizations, which may result in inconsistencies. Secondly, different dietary habits and lifestyles among different populations may contribute to observed differences. For example, mean sodium intake of northern Chinese was notably higher than that of southerners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Heizhati et al., 2020</xref>]. That excessive salt intake increases the risk of hypertension has been well documented in epidemiological and clinical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>There are also some limitations in our study. Firstly, as mentioned above, the nomogram was constructed based on multivariate analysis of physical examination data between 2009 and 2019. Loss to follow-up and missing data reduced the effective sample size and may threaten the internal validity of the study. Secondly, some subjects who were diagnosed with secondary hypertension may be also included in this study. The diagnosis of hypertension may lack strictness. Thirdly, the nomogram showed medium prediction accuracy may suggest that other factors should be included. Many blood parameters were deleted because of missing data. These may have inevitably caused bias. The prediction accuracy could perhaps be improved in further studies with large sample sizes and more variables. Further multicenter external validation should be performed to verify the discriminating ability and generalizability of our nomogram.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study population and data collection</title><p>The current study was carried out based on a large cohort study, named the Physical Examination Survey.

After rigorous screening, 8020 subjects who underwent medical examination both in 2009 and 2019 were finally enrolled. At a cut-off value of 140/90 mmHg, 6201 subjects who had normal blood pressure in 2009 were enrolled in Group<sup>140/90</sup>. At a cut-off value of 130/80 mmHg, 3771 subjects who had normal blood pressure in 2009 were enrolled in Group<sup>130/80</sup>. The data of Group<sup>140/90</sup> and Group<sup>130/80</sup> were used to construct the nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> and nomogram<sup>130/80</sup> for predicting hypertension, respectively.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Flowchart of the procedure.</title><p>A total of 51,165 and 209,636 subjects who underwent physical examination in 2009 and 2019 were enrolled in this study, respectively. 8020 subjects who underwent medical examination both in 2009 and 2019 were finally enrolled.

All subjects’ data were anonymized and de-identified prior to the analyses. The requirement for informed consent was therefore waived.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Definition and assessment</title><p>Hypertension was defined as two diagnostic criteria: (1) SBP ≥ 140 mmHg or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use according to 2018 Chinese Guidelines and 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines; (2) SBP ≥ 130 mmHg or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg or antihypertensive medication use according to 2017 ACC-AHA guidelines. Blood pressure was measured after a minimum of 5 min rest in sitting position. BMI was computed by the ratio of body weight (kg) to height squared (m<sup>2</sup>). The blood samples were collected in the morning on an empty stomach.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Statistical Aanalysis</title><p>For construction and validation of the nomogram, the subjects were randomly divided into training set and validation set at a ratio of 2:1, respectively. The comparability between the two sets was then evaluated. Continuous variables with normal distribution were described as means ± standard deviation and analyzed with Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test to infer the differences between the two sets. Continuous variables with skewed distribution were described as median (25% percentile, 75% percentile) and analyzed with Mann–Whitney U test. Categorical data were presented as numbers (percent) and analyzed with chi-square test or the Fisher’s exact test for their comparisons.</p><p>The LASSO regression technique was used to select the optimal predictive features in the training set. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent factors by incorporating the feature selected in the LASSO regression. Following the multivariate analysis, factors with a two-sided p value &lt;0.05 were selected for developing the nomograms. The predictive accuracy of nomograms was measured by AUC of the ROC curve and concordance index (C-index) in both the training and validation sets. The consistency between the actual outcomes and predicted probabilities was measured by the calibration curve. The clinical utility of the nomograms was measured by DCA and clinical impact curves for a population size as 1000. To compare the predictive accuracy of the nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> with that of nomogram<sup>130/80</sup>, NRI and IDI were calculated.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed with R software version 4.0.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>), SPSS version 24.0 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_019096">SCR_019096</ext-link>), and MedCalc 19.0.7 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_015044">SCR_015044</ext-link>). Two-sided p value &lt; 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, based on a 10-year retrospective cohort study, we developed and validated a simple and reliable nomogram to predict the risk of hypertension for the population of China. The nomogram demonstrated favorable predictive accuracy, discrimination, and clinical utility in the training set and validation set, indicating good performance in practical application. This visualization model and website will aid the patients and physicians to predict the 10-year risk of hypertension and better clinical management.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Software, Supervision, Validation, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Resources, Software, Supervision, Validation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>After reviewing, this paper conforms to the principles of medical ethics.

authors developed easy-to-use simple nomograms to predict the 10-year probability of hypertension from easily accessible health metrics. The study deposits an important dataset, and carries out classical multivariate analyses to arrive to a usable model.

Biologically, any feature that has an association in defining the hypertension probability, should have a predictive relevance regardless whether the cutoff for the hypertension definition is 140/90 or 130/80. The used approach of feature trimming, and different numbers of features for the two nomograms, may neglect important interactions. Furthermore, the overall low number of features warrant the application of higher-end machine learning techniques for feature selection (if at all deemed to be necessary to eliminate any).

We have changed the title of the article to “Development and validation of a nomogram to better predict hypertension based on a 10-year retrospective cohort study in China”. In addition, for the sake of clarity, the sections of abstract, discussion and conclusion of the article have mentioned that the study was carried out based on a 10-year retrospective cohort and the predicted hypertension probabilities are for the 10-year risk.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The search for independent features zooms in to 10 features for nomogram140/90 and 6 features for nomogram130/80.

(1) Indeed, the human body is a complex biological network. Holistically, all biological features may contribute to or be influenced by blood pressure as well as hypertension. The current study aimed to identify statistically significant variables from aspect of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associated with hypertension, and subsequently developed a simple, reliable nomogram to better predict hypertension probabilities. As mentioned in the article, the nomogram showing medium prediction accuracy may suggest that other factors should be included. Further extensive studies to focus on this issue are needed in the future. (2) We totally agree with your suggestion that decision-tree-based techniques (such as random forests or gradient boosting machines) may have greater promise for finding more useful information contained in variables. The current study aimed to develop a simple nomogram to predict hypertension probabilities. By reducing the number of variables in a model, we can reduce overfitting and the complexity of the model, make it easier to interpret, and decrease operation complexity. Lasso is useful because it is a shrinkage estimator: it shrinks the size of the coefficients of the independent variables depending on their predictive power. Some coefficients may shrink down to zero, allowing us to restrict the model to variables with nonzero coefficients. We performed a systematic review of published literature on PubMed. With the search strategy “(nomogram[Title/Abstract]) AND (lasso[Title/Abstract])”, 594 articles were found. With the search strategy “(nomogram[Title/Abstract]) AND (lasso[Title/Abstract])”, 53 articles were found. However, with the search strategy “(nomogram[Title/Abstract]) AND (gradient boosting machine[Title/Abstract])”, Only 1 article was found. These results may imply that LASSO Cox regression is a widely-used method for high-dimensional predictors selection and nomogram construction. Of course, if you feel that decision-tree-based techniques are essential for this article, we would be willing to carry out the additional experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors should explain their rationale for using the LASSO e.g. that they used it as a variable selection technique to reduce the number of parameters and thereby simply the risk prediction model?

As shown in Figure 4, both in the training set and validation set, the calibration curves showed a good agreement between nomogram-predicted probability and the actual outcome. Although the nomogram-derived curve may overestimate the probability by about 10% for higher risk patients, this model still had a good calibration in the internal validation cohort. As discussed in the article, this bias may be negligible in further studies with large sample sizes and more variables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It seems the NRI and IDI were used to determine the best model using an estimated risk prediction score from 130/80 versus 140/90 as the outcome.

Indeed, the NRI and IDI were originally proposed to characterize accuracy improvement in predicting a binary outcome, when new biomarkers are added to regression models. Most recently, these two indices have been extended from binary outcomes to multi-categorical and survival outcomes (PMID of reference: 33324980). For example, in 2020, Zhang et al. compared the predictive ability of a stroke prediction model (China-PAR) with the revised Framingham Stroke Risk Score (R-FSRS) for 5-year stroke incidence in a community cohort of Chinese adults (PMID of reference: 33192957). The two prediction models have 5 same risk factors, as well as 2 additional factors in R-FSRS and 6 additional factors in China-PAR. The NRI and IDI values were assessed to compare the discrimination ability of two prediction models. Similarly, to better assess the performance of nomogram<sup>140/90</sup> and nomogram<sup>130/80</sup>, the NRI and IDI were also used to determine the best model. According to your suggestion, the above discussion have been added in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How are the cases handled when only the SBP or the DBP falls beyond the cutoff, but not the pair?

According to the 2017 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline, arterial hypertension is defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) equal to or greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) equal to or greater than 90 mm Hg. Similarly, the cases whose SBP or DBP fell beyond the cutoff in 2009 can be explicitly diagnosed as hypertension. The current study aimed to develop a nomogram based on the cases who had normal blood pressure in 2009. Therefore, we specifically excluded the cases who had abnormal blood pressure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The discriminatory power of the model is relatively modest. The authors should describe how the prediction accuracy could perhaps be improved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your professional suggestion. As mentioned in in the Discussion section of our revised manuscript, there are also some limitations in our study. Firstly, the nomogram was constructed based on multivariate analysis of physical examination data between 2009 and 2019. Loss to follow-up and missing data reduced the effective sample size and may threaten the internal validity of the study. Secondly, some subjects who were diagnosed with secondary hypertension may be also included in this study. The diagnosis of hypertension may lack strictness. Thirdly, the nomogram showing medium prediction accuracy may suggest that other factors should be included. Many blood parameters were deleted because of missing data. These may have inevitably caused bias. The prediction accuracy could perhaps be improved in further studies with large sample sizes and more variables. According to your suggestion, the above discussion have been added in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– P-values to 5 decimal places are not necessary – consult the Journal guidelines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your careful checks.
