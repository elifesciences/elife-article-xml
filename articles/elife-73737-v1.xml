After careful inspection of original data, we indeed inadvertently used α-HA band from the preprint version when organizing and updating the Figure 2E file for submitting to eLife. A new α-HA blot band has been obtained from original frozen sample and incorporated into the corrected Figure 2E.</p><p>The results of quantitative comparison of the indicated protein levels were analyzed by gray intensity scanning of the Western blots, including pIKKαβ/Actin, pTBK1/TBK1, pP65/P65 and pIRF3/IRF3, all which are not related to the α-HA band.</p><p>Corrected Figure 2 panel E is shown here:</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73737-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original Figure 2 panel E is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73737-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In Figure 5A, α-HA and α-TRIM25 blot bands were pointed out to be identical with α-HA and α-TRIM25 blot bands in Figure 4E of the preprint version of this article. The Figure 5A in eLife paper was the improved version of Figure 4A in the preprint paper, in which the experiments were repeated with the different treatment. α-HA and α-TRIM25 blot bands in the preprint version were inadvertently incorporated into Figure 5A when submitting to eLife. A new α-HA blot band has now been obtained from original frozen sample, and the correct α-TRIM25 blot band has been found from the original images of the repeated experiments, and then Figure 5A has been corrected with these images.</p><p>Corrected Figure 5 panel A is shown here:</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73737-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>The original Figure 5 panel A is shown here for reference:</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73737-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>These corrections do not change the conclusions, figure legend and the text of the article.
