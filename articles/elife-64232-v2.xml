Our data help explain how the ATPase cycle of a AAA+-family helicase loader is channeled into productive action on its target; comparative studies indicate that elements analogous to the Arg-coupler are present in related, switch-like AAA+ proteins that control replicative helicase loading in eukaryotes, as well as in polymerase clamp loading and certain classes of DNA transposases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>AAA+ ATPase</kwd><kwd>helicase</kwd><kwd>Meier-Gorlin syndrome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-GM71747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Berger</surname><given-names>James M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM098885</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keck</surname><given-names>James L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure-guided biochemistry defines how the coupling between nucleic acid substrate binding and ATPase activity is used by a molecular switch to load ring-shaped motor proteins onto single-stranded DNA.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The proliferation of all cells relies on the accurate and timely copying of DNA by large macromolecular assemblies termed replisomes. Cellular replisomes are complex, multi-functional assemblies that co-localize a number of essential biochemical functions to increase replication efficiency and speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Donnell et al., 2013</xref>). One such function is the unwinding of parental chromosomes to expose template DNA for leading and lagging strand synthesis, a process carried out by specialized, ring-shaped enzymes known as helicases. In Gram-negative bacteria, an enzyme known as DnaB (named DnaC in Gram-positive organisms) serves as the principal helicase for driving replication fork progression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chodavarapu and Kaguni, 2016</xref>). DnaB proteins form hexameric rings and are generally incapable of spontaneously associating with chromosomal replication start sites (origins). As a consequence, DnaB helicases are specifically recruited and deposited onto single-stranded origin DNA by dedicated initiation and loading factors.</p><p>Replicative helicase loading in bacteria depends on at least one of two known types of proteins. One widespread class, comprising factors related to a protein known as DciA, is ATP-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brézellec et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mann et al., 2017</xref>). The second class is composed of DnaC/DnaI-family proteins, which are ATP-dependent and present in model organisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<italic>B. subtilis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brézellec et al., 2016</xref>). Both DnaC and DnaI consist of an N-terminal helicase-binding domain (HBD) fused to a C-terminal AAA+ (ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities) nucleotide-binding fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ludlam et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neuwald et al., 1999b</xref>). The AAA+ region of DnaC contains numerous signature sequence motifs (Walker A, Walker B, Sensor I and II, Arginine-finger), several of which have been reported to be critical for the function of the loader in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mott et al., 2008</xref>). A few of these elements have been examined and found to be important for controlling aspects of DnaC activity in vitro as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mott et al., 2008</xref>); however, a systematic analysis of their individual mechanistic impact on the efficiency of DNA loading and unwinding by DnaB has been lacking.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DnaC functional elements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Domain organization of DnaC.

In the context of DnaB, six DnaC protomers form a cracked hexameric oligomer, generating composite ATPase active sites at five of the six subunit interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). The AAA+ fold of DnaC binds ssDNA directly, at a site distal from its ATP-binding locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ioannou et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mott et al., 2008</xref>). Prior to binding DNA, DnaC protomers latch onto a DnaB hexamer through their HBDs to promote helicase ring opening. In this configuration, electron microscopy studies have shown that DnaB resides in an ADP-like state and DnaC in an ATP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>). DNA binding induces a large conformational rearrangement in the DnaB hexamer and compresses the DnaC ATPase ring, switching the ATPase status of the helicase and the loader into ATP and ADP forms, respectively. Curiously, although DnaB helps promote the local co-association of neighboring DnaC AAA+ domains, the ATPase activity of the loader does not manifest until ssDNA is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobori and Kornberg, 1982</xref>). How DnaB promotes DnaC self-assembly yet does not directly trigger ATPase turnover by the loader is not understood. How DNA binding is relayed to the DnaC ATPase site and whether DnaB ATPase function is important for loading (as structural work has suggested) are similarly unknown. Addressing these questions is important for understanding how replicative helicase loaders exploit nucleotide-coupling mechanisms to generate productive action on client substrates, a question relevant to AAA+ ATPases in general.</p><p>Here, we have shown through a structure-guided biochemical approach that defects in different DnaC ATPase elements have distinct impacts on the ability of the loader to deposit DnaB onto DNA and to activate helicase unwinding of forked substrates. DnaC is shown to be capable of promoting helicase unloading in an ATP-dependent manner; both loading and unloading are additionally found to be influenced by the ATPase activity of the helicase as well. We have identified a set of residues in DnaC that couple loader ATPase activity to the binding of DnaB and ssDNA and that unexpectedly modulate the responsiveness of DnaC to a replication restart factor, and we have shown that analogs of one of these elements, an active site arginine, are present in related AAA+ superfamily members that operate with switch-like properties. Our data collectively explain how the ATPase status of DnaC is coupled to the recognition of its DnaB and ssDNA substrates to ensure tight coupling of helicase loading and DNA unwinding with nucleotide turnover.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conserved AAA+ motifs support DnaC ATPase activity</title><p>We first set out to address the extent to which five canonical AAA+ motifs support the ATP-hydrolysis activity of <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated a panel of individual DnaC variants lacking one of the five key residues found in AAA+ proteins (Walker A (WA) – K112R; Walker B (WB) – E170Q; Sensor I (SI) – N203A; Arg-finger (RF) – R220D; Sensor II (SII) – R237D). We expressed and purified each of these mutants and, using a coupled assay, tested them for ATP-hydrolysis activity in the presence of a hydrolysis-defective DnaB mutant (DnaB<sup>KAEA</sup>) and ssDNA.

The role of each DnaC AAA+ ATPase active site residue was investigated in the loading of DnaB onto a closed-circular M13mp18 ssDNA substrate using a gel-filtration chromatography assay that resolves ssDNA-DnaB-DnaC complexes, free DnaB, and DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). As controls, efficient DnaB loading was observed in the presence of wild-type DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas little ssDNA association was detected for DnaB in the absence of DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For comparison, the loading efficiency of the DnaC HBD, which wholly lacks any ATPase function and has been shown previously to catalyze DnaB deposition onto ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>), was approximately half that of WT DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Investigation of the remaining active site mutants shows that they are largely intermediate in activity between the HBD and WT, with the activity of the Sensor I mutant proving the most compromised (slightly more than the HBD alone) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The loading activities of the Walker-B and Arg-finger mutants were roughly commensurate with or in slight excess of the HBD, whereas the Sensor II and Walker-A mutants were effectively wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). Collectively, these results demonstrate that the AAA+ domain and the ATP-hydrolysis cycle of DnaC increase the efficiency of helicase loading. They also show that, despite being required for ATPase function overall, different AAA+ active site residues contribute to the efficiency of DnaB deposition by varying degrees.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Helicase loading is aided by DnaB’s ATPase activity and results in the topological entrapment of ssDNA</title><p>Prior structural work has indicated that DnaC-associated DnaB switches from an ADP to an ATP state upon binding to DNA, and that the engagement of nucleic acid triggers DnaB to adopt a cracked-ring state that remains topologically linked around its DNA substrate through domain-swapping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). To better define the extent to which the ATPase activity of DnaB is important for loading, we assessed the ability of wild-type DnaC to load either native DnaB or a double Walker-A/B ATPase-defective mutant (DnaB<sup>KAEA</sup>) of the helicase using the M13 association assay. The resultant data show that the ATPase-deficient DnaB is loaded by DnaC, but at a reduced level (~50%) compared to the wild-type helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next increased the concentration of salt in the sizing-column running buffer used to separate DNA-loaded and DNA-free DnaB. A majority of the loaded DnaB remained associated with ssDNA when NaCl was increased from 100 to 250 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results demonstrate that the ability of DnaB to hydrolyze nucleotides is not critical for loading, but does aid the efficiency of the deposition reaction, and that once loaded, DnaB persists in a salt-stable complex with ssDNA. This latter finding indicates that the topologically closed-ring conformation observed structurally for the DnaBC complex on DNA persists in solution.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>DnaB loading is impacted by helicase ATPase status and can be reversed by DnaC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) DnaB loading is compromised in an ATPase-deficient mutant of DnaB.

Our steady-state ATPase assays show that DnaC continuously hydrolyzes nucleotides in the presence of DnaB and DNA, indicating that the loader can cycle from a product state back to an ATP-bound configuration. This behavior raised the possibility that ADP-bound DnaC might be capable of reassociating with ATP and reopening a DnaB ring to promote helicase unloading. To test this idea, we repeated our M13 ssDNA-association reactions with wild-type DnaC, but now using sizing columns pre-equilibrated with ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The presence of ADP in the column buffer still resulted in efficient DnaB loading. By contrast, the inclusion of ATP led to a near-complete loss of DnaB that remained associated with M13 DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>), demonstrating that DnaC can unload DnaB in an ATP-dependent manner. To determine whether the ATPase activity of DnaB might also play a role in unloading, we assessed the effect of ATP in the column running buffer using the DnaB<sup>KAEA</sup> mutant. Interestingly, substantially more ATPase-deficient DnaB remained loaded on the M13 ssDNA in the presence of ATP compared to wild-type DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>).

Unlike closed-circular M13 ssDNA, DnaB can thread onto free ssDNA ends to promote strand separation of downstream duplexes without assistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jezewska et al., 1998</xref>); however, unwinding is inefficient unless DnaB is present in large excess or DnaC is included (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Galletto et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kaplan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaplan and Steitz, 1999</xref>). To define the role of DnaC ATPase in promoting DnaB helicase activity, we conducted DNA unwinding assays with our panel of mutants using a forked substrate bearing a Cy3 fluorophore quenched with BHQ2 at the duplex end. When present at only a twofold molar excess over the forked substrate, DnaB was observed to unwind ~10% of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To determine whether DnaB was inactive in this assay because a fraction of the helicase associates with the 3’ tail of the fork and impedes access to the 5’ tail, we blocked the 3’-end of the fork with a biotin-neutravidin complex and repeated the assay. This block resulted in a higher proportion of observed fork unwinding, but the total amount of unwound product (~45%) was still less than that seen when DnaC was present (~80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

By comparison, the DnaC ATPase mutants were much less capable in their response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For example, the Walker-A mutant showed ~40–50% the stimulatory activity of wild-type DnaC, whereas the charge-reversed Arg-finger mutant failed to stimulate DnaB beyond the basal level of the helicase alone (other mutants were intermediate in their response, with ~25–30% the activity of the native loader). There was no clear trend between the degree to which a particular mutation disrupted both DnaC ATPase activity and the stimulation of DnaB unwinding. However, the one mutant that would be expected to interfere with ATP binding (Walker-A) evinced the highest stimulatory effect, while the mutant that would be most expected to impede inter-subunit communication (Arg-finger) was the most severely compromised. This behavior suggests that the capacity of adjoining DnaC protomers to interact with one another in a nucleotide-dependent manner can influence the extent to which the loader can stimulate DNA unwinding by DnaB.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Multiple sensors link ssDNA binding to DnaC ATPase activity</title><p>Although AAA+ ATPase activity is often tightly coupled to interactions with client substrates, the mechanisms behind this linkage are highly varied and frequently unclear.

A group of enzymes known as AAA+ ATPases are exemplars of such molecular ‘machines,’ participating in events ranging from DNA replication and gene expression to proteolytic homeostasis and vesicle trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neuwald et al., 1999b</xref>). How AAA+ enzymes couple ATP turnover to movement and function is a broadly studied mechanistic question. Although the appropriate engagement of client substrates is clearly important for ATPase coupling, the elements responsible for these interactions are typically far removed (20–30 Å) from the nucleotide-hydrolysis center. The structural linkage elements that relay information over a distance between client occupancy and ATPase status are rarely known.</p><p>Here, we have used structure-guided mutagenesis and biochemical analyses to dissect how DnaC, a bacterial AAA+ ATPase that supports the deposition of the replicative DnaB helicase onto DNA, coordinates its ATPase cycle with helicase loading and activation. The opening of the DnaB ring and its subsequent engagement with DNA can occur independently of ATP hydrolysis by DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), a finding in accord with previous data showing that neither ATP binding nor the DnaC ATPase domains are required for DnaB loading in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). However, ATP turnover does improve the efficiency of helicase loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), an observation in agreement both with early work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wahles et al., 1988</xref> (which reported that an ATP-hydrolysis step is important in the binding of the DnaBC complex to DNA) and with a study showing that the replication factor C (RFC) clamp loader becomes compromised for DNA binding when its D or E subunit bears a mutated Arg-finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson et al., 2006</xref>). Interestingly, the ability to hydrolyze nucleotides also has a potentiating effect on the capacity of DnaC to activate DNA unwinding by DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, hydrolysis-defective DnaC mutants are less capable of activating DnaB than an ATP-binding (Walker-A, K112R) mutant. Moreover, all ATPase mutants are substantially compromised for activating DNA unwinding compared to wild-type DnaC or the helicase-binding domain of DnaC alone. These observations indicate that the HBD is an independent helicase-activating element regulated by its associated ATPase module and that ATP turnover by the loader is important for allowing DnaB to shift into a translocation-competent form.</p><p>Recent images of DNA-free and DNA-bound structures of the DnaBC complex have revealed that the nucleotide status of the helicase flips from an ADP state to an ATP configuration when DNA is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). This observation suggested to us that the loading of DnaB onto DNA might be impacted by the helicase’s ATPase function. In testing this idea with a double Walker-A/Walker-B (KAEA) mutant of DnaB, the ability of the helicase to interact productively with nucleotides indeed impacts DNA loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Although this coupling is not a strict dependency, a role for nucleotide turnover by DnaB is reminiscent of the need for ATP by the eukaryotic Mcm2-7 replicative helicase to support its loading onto DNA by the origin recognition complex (ORC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coster et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, we found that DnaC can also drive helicase unloading as well as loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In contrast to eukaryotes, where unloading of the Cdc45/Mcm2-7/GINS helicase is facilitated by ubiquitylation of MCM7 and removal of the CMG helicase by CDC48/p97 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2019</xref>), relatively little is known about how DnaB helicases are removed from DNA following replication termination in bacteria. Additional studies will be needed to assess a potential role for DnaC in this process.</p><p>Structural work has shown that the AAA+ fold of DnaC associates with DNA directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). Three residues—Phe146, Ser177, and Tyr179—form a small DNA-binding locus on the part of the DnaC ATPase domain that faces the interior pore of the dodecameric DnaBC complex; mutation of these residues ablates DnaB loading by DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). In examining this region further, we found a fourth amino acid, Lys143, that also participates in binding DNA. Lys143 is generally a lysine or arginine in DnaC/DnaI homologs, and a prior genetic screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hupert-Kocurek et al., 2007</xref> noted that the integrity of this residue is important for <italic>E. coli</italic> viability. Here, we have shown that Lys143 is important for supporting the ATPase and DnaB loading activities of <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The inability of a DnaC<sup>K143E</sup> mutant to facilitate DnaB loading onto ssDNA—even though it has an intact HBD and stably binds DnaB—suggests that the alteration allows the loader to maintain a persistent, open-ring state of the helicase. In addition, we found that Lys143 and other amino acids in the DNA-binding patch are critical for DnaC to stimulate fork unwinding by DnaB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Biochemical studies show that disruption of this residue and other amino acids in the region block DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>), thereby short-circuiting the ability of the nucleic acid substrate to stimulate ATP hydrolysis by DnaC when the loader is bound to DnaB. Overall, the integrity of the DNA-binding patch on DnaC supports the ability of ssDNA to activate all known DnaC functions, even though it is situated over 20 Å away from the DnaC ATPase center.</p><p>A long-standing mechanistic question has been to understand why DnaB is required for stimulating ATP turnover by DnaC, yet is incapable of supporting this activity unless ssDNA is also present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). Unlike a majority of AAA+ ATPases, <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC is a monomer on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Galletto et al., 2004b</xref>) and forms stable oligomeric interactions only when templated by a pre-existing DnaB hexamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobori and Kornberg, 1982</xref>). Formation of a higher-order oligomer state is generally a prerequisite for AAA+ ATPase function, as the active site of one subunit typically depends on the contribution of an arginine or lysine from a partner subunit to support nucleotide turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Neuwald, 1999a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neuwald et al., 1999b</xref>). Prior work has shown that mutation of the so-termed ‘Arg-finger’ residue to alanine in <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC does not interfere with the ability of the loader to deliver DnaB to <italic>oriC</italic>, but does interfere with DnaC-dependent DNA replication in vitro and DnaC function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>). Here we have shown that this amino acid is critical for DnaC ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and that while it is only moderately important for DnaB loading, its presence is necessary to activate DNA unwinding by the helicase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, DnaC possesses a second arginine (Arg216) just upstream of its Arg-finger (Arg220). This amino acid is essentially invariant among DnaC/DnaI homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Prior studies have shown that the integrity of this residue is unnecessary for DnaC to bind ATP or associate with DnaB but is important for supporting replication in vitro and for cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>). Here, we have shown that Arg216 is actually an essential element for coupling substrate DNA binding to loader ATPase activity. Mutation of the amino acid to aspartate severely impairs DnaC’s ATPase activity and its ability to mobilize and activate DnaB on DNA. However, substitution with alanine not only increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis by DnaC, but also allows nucleotide turnover to occur even in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The DnaC<sup>R216A</sup> mutant also overrides the ATPase defect imparted by a DNA-binding mutant (e.g., K143E), yet does not degrade the ability of DnaC to assist with either DnaB loading or the stimulation of DnaB-mediated fork unwinding. Inspection of a DNA-free DnaBC structure reveals that Arg216 is positioned where the nucleophilic water would be expected to reside prior to ATP hydrolysis; in the presence of ssDNA, this amino acid shifts away to allow access to the reactive γ-PO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). Thus, Arg216 acts not just as a substrate/ATPase coupler, but also as a steric governor, preventing the DnaC ATPase from firing when oligomerized by DnaB to prevent futile cycling until substrate DNA is bound. The action of the Arg-coupler explains how the ATPase activity of DnaC allosterically responds to the binding of ssDNA at a region distal to the active site. The binding of ssDNA to the tetrad residues elicits a subtle rocking and compression motion between neighboring DnaC protomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>); this action leads the Arg-coupler to shift out of the active site, releasing its repressive action on ATPase function (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). In this regard, the Arg-coupler acts in a manner akin to the ‘glutamate switch’, a residue found in many AAA+ ATPases that controls the conformation of the catalytic glutamate in response to ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang and Wigley, 2008</xref>). Interestingly, a polar amino acid at the position of the glutamate switch is present in <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC (Thr134), but it does not make ideal hydrogen-bonding interactions with the catalytic glutamate (Glu170) in the repressed (DNA-free) ATPase state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, Thr134 forms a contact with an acidic amino acid (Asp 189), which is in turn hydrogen-bonded to the Arg-finger. Neither the glutamate switch threonine nor its acidic anchor residue is particularly well conserved among DnaC/DnaI homologs, although these two amino-acid positions are typically occupied by polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Whether the glutamate switch has been repurposed to control the Arg-finger instead of the catalytic glutamate in bacterial helicase loaders remains to be determined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Molecular mechanism of the DnaC Arg-coupler and the presence of potential functional analogs in related switch-type AAA+ ATPases.</title><p>(<bold>A,B</bold>) Schematics and structures showing how the conformational status of the Arg-coupler switches between apo and DNA-bound states to respectively occlude or allow access to the γ-PO4 moiety of nucleotide in the DnaC ATPase site.

Purified DnaC810 has been shown to load DnaB on SSB-coated ssDNA and on D-loops, bypassing the need for the PriA replication restart protein, and it has been proposed that the DnaB loading activity of this mutant is mediated by a cryptic DNA-binding site in DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu and Marians, 2000</xref>). Inspection of the structure shows that Glu176 sits on a loop that connects one-half of the DNA-binding tetrad (Ser177 and Tyr179) to the Walker-B loop of the ATPase center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, DnaC810 shows a similar pattern of behavior as the alanine substitution of Arg216: DnaB-dependent but ssDNA-independent ATPase activity, and near wild-type efficiency in loading DnaB onto DNA and activating the helicase for fork unwinding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). However, unlike the R216A mutant, the <italic>dnaC810</italic> allele supports cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Makowska-Grzyska and Kaguni, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sandler et al., 1996</xref>). A comparison of structures of the DnaBC complex in DNA-free and -bound states shows that the Walker-B loop on which Glu176 sits switches between two conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>). Although a structure of DnaC810 bound to DnaB is currently unavailable, it seems likely that the substitution of the glutamic acid with glycine alters the flexibility of the Walker-B region, perhaps mimicking a DNA-bound conformational state to relieve DnaC of the repressive action of Arg216. The finding that the DnaC810 can act in a manner similar to that of the arginine-coupler mutant suggests that tight ATPase control by the loader is necessary to properly coordinate its activity with pathways that resuscitate stalled replication forks. Understanding precisely how this action might allow DnaC<sup>810</sup> and the R216A mutant to act independently of replication restart factors awaits further study.</p><p>Given the widespread nature of AAA+ proteins, we were curious as to whether the coupling mechanisms we observed for DnaC might be found in other ATPase family members. Because AAA+ ATPases recognize diverse types of substrates—single- and double-stranded nucleic acids, protein chains—it seemed unlikely that there would be any consensus to their substrate-recognition sites. However, DnaA, a DnaC paralog that serves to reorganize and melt origins to initiate replication in bacteria, does retain a highly conserved arginine in the same position as the Arg-coupler. Sequence analyses show that two proteins used to catalyze replicative helicase loading in eukaryotes, Orc4 and Orc1, also retain such an element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Interestingly, these proteins all belong to the same ‘initiator’ subgroup, or clade, of AAA+ proteins, suggesting that the coupling arginine seen in DnaC may play a similar role in regulating substrate-dependent ATP turnover in these proteins as well. In the case of DnaA, the integrity of the equivalent of DnaC-Arg216 (Arg281 in <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaA) has been shown to be dispensable for ATP binding and melting of <italic>oriC</italic> DNA, but necessary for forming a sufficiently stable complex that can support DnaB loading by DnaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Felczak and Kaguni, 2004</xref>); by comparison, mutation of the neighboring Arg-finger of DnaA, R285A, leads to a failure in unwinding <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kawakami et al., 2005</xref>). These findings echo the retention of certain specific activities but an overall functional defect seen for DnaC<sup>R216A</sup>. Interestingly, although there is no known data on the phenotypic effect of mutating the equivalent residue in human Orc4 (Arg205), mutation of the analogous residue in Orc1 (Arg666, to Trp) has been linked to Meier-Gorlin syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guernsey et al., 2011</xref>). It has yet to be determined biochemically whether Arg-coupler mutations in ORC might also lead to an unlinking of ATPase activity from DNA-binding status (as is seen for DnaC) or to a different functional defect.</p><p>Other proteins in the initiator clade, such as IstB (a transposition helper protein and another DnaC paralog), do not possess a clear homolog of the Arg-coupler, nor do several archetypal AAA+ ATPases of other clades (e.g., clamp loader, classic, pre-Sensor I insert, etc). A review of several representative structures of these proteins nonetheless does reveal a potential common theme shared between DnaC, IstB, and clamp loaders. In addition to blocking access to the reactive γ-PO<sub>4</sub> of bound nucleotide, the Arg-coupler of DnaB-bound DnaC also engages the polar Sensor I amino acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>) and releases this interaction when DNA is bound. The Sensor I amino acid is a conserved feature of AAA+ proteins and is generally important for ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hattendorf and Lindquist, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neuwald et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Steel et al., 2000</xref>). In the case of IstB— whose ATPase is primed by DNA binding but not actuated until it engages its client IstA transposase—a DNA-bound structure of the protein shows that the Arg-coupler is replaced with a small amino acid (e.g., alanine), but that a bulky amino acid (tyrosine) on the Walker-B loop occupies the same general position to occlude the γ-PO<sub>4</sub> moiety and remodel the Sensor I loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arias-Palomo and Berger, 2015</xref>). Clamp loaders, whose AAA+ clade is closely related to that of the initiators, also lack the upstream Arg-coupler; however, in the presence of a client clamp—which is necessary but insufficient for stimulating ATPase activity on its own—access to the γ-PO<sub>4</sub> is again occluded by a Sensor I interaction with a positively charged residue on an adjacent helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). A comparison of clamp loader structures reveals that an arginine or lysine in this highly conserved central helix can, upon DNA binding, swing out to release the Sensor I residue, thereby allowing the Arg-finger to access the γ-PO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gaubitz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Simonetta et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, an N-terminal motif known as ‘RFC box II’ also has been shown in the archaeal clamp loader system to be important for linking ATP hydrolysis to clamp loading: when ablated, the loader shows elevated ATPase activity but is compromised for clamp loading, a behavior similar to that of the DnaC Arg-coupler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seybert et al., 2006</xref>). An interesting distinction of initiators and clamp/helicase/transposase loaders compared to other AAA+ systems is that they are switch-like in their behavior, as opposed to acting in a more processive manner. Restricting access to γ-PO<sub>4</sub> of ATP and sequestering the Sensor I amino acid may thus serve as a general fail-safe in these systems, as it does in DnaC, to allow an active ATPase center to be assembled while avoiding premature hydrolytic events. Whether other switch-like AAA+ proteins have evolved similar regulatory mechanisms remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="top">pET28b</td><td valign="top">Novagen</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">C41(DE3)</td><td valign="top">Lucigen</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21AI</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Chemically competent cells</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">TEV</td><td valign="top">QB3 Macrolab (UC Berkeley)</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Amylose Resin</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase mix</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Bio-Gel A-1.5m Resin</td><td valign="top">Bio-Rad</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>6xHis-MBP-tagged <italic>E. coli dnaC</italic> was cloned into a pET28b-derived plasmid, while <italic>E. coli dnaB</italic> was cloned into pET28b without an affinity tag.

These fractions were considered to contain aberrant or misloaded complexes and were not included in calculating the amount of DnaB loaded compared to wild-type DnaC (which never displayed such behavior)—the DnaB present in these fractions was used for calculating the total amount DnaB only. The experimental data shown reflect the average of three independent experiments. Graphs were generated in Prism (GraphPad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>DNA fork unwinding assay</title><p>Fork unwinding assay was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arias-Palomo et al., 2013</xref>), with minor modifications. Briefly, high-performance liquid chromatography-purified DNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. The forked DNA substrate was formed by annealing 20 μM 5′-Cy3-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-Cy3-<named-content content-type="sequence">TACGTAACGAGCCTGC</named-content>(dT)25–3′) with a 1.2 molar excess of a 3′-black hole quencher (BHQ)-labeled strand (5′-(dT)25-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGGCTCGTTACGTA</named-content>-BHQ2-3′) in annealing buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 mM KCl). A control ‘captured’ fork substrate with 100% maximum fluorescence signal was formed similarly to the forked DNA substrate, but that substituted the BHQ strand with an unlabeled capture strand (complementary to the base-paired region of the Cy3-labeled oligo, 5′-<named-content content-type="sequence">GCAGGCTCGTTACGTA</named-content>-3′). The captured-fork control was used to normalize the signal between experiments. For the reactions, helicase and loader were premixed on ice, followed by the addition of substrate DNA. This reaction mixture was pre-warmed to 37°C; in parallel, the single-stranded capture oligo DNA was mixed with ATP and pre-warmed to 37°C separately. The ATP/capture-strand mixture was then added to the pre-warmed reaction mixture, pipetted gently to mix, and then three 20 μl aliquots were immediately pipetted into and read out from a 384-well black plate using a CLARIOstar (BMG Labtech) microplate reader at 37°C. The final reactions containing 200 nM DnaB hexamer (with or without 1.2 μM loader monomer), 100 nM fork substrate, 200 nM capture strand, and 1 mM ATP were monitored for fluorescence increase at 37°C for 26 min. The final assay buffer consisted of 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mM magnesium acetate, 50 mM potassium glutamate, 5% glycerol, and 0.2 mg/mL BSA. Reads from triplicate wells were averaged and analyzed in Excel (Microsoft) and normalized graphs were generated in Prism (GraphPad). Presented data are from three independent repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DnaC-ssDNA-binding assays</title><p>Fluorescence anisotropy was used to quantitate DNA-binding efficiency of DnaC variants. DnaC interaction assays with ssDNA were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arias-Palomo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mott et al., 2008</xref>). 0–50 μM DnaC was first mixed in a high-salt buffer (50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 500 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) before being rapidly diluted fourfold into the binding buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 0.1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 nM fluorescein-labeled dT25 oligonucleotide (IDT). Protein from the high-salt buffer was diluted in the binding reaction to bring the final salt concentration to 125 mM KCl. Aliquots of the samples were transferred to pre-warmed 384-well, black small-volume polystyrene plates (Greiner Bio-One). The plates were incubated for 10 min and then read in a CLARIOstar (BMG Labtech) microplate reader at 37° C. Averaged delta-anisotropy values were plotted against increasing DnaC concentrations. Data were fit to Hill equation for specific binding using Prism. The experimental data shown are from three independent repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>PriC-dependent unwinding assays</title><p>Reactions were performed in triplicate using DNA substrates as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wessel et al., 2013</xref>) with the final monomeric concentrations of components as follows: 67 nM SSB, 120 nM DnaB, 400 nM DnaC (or variant), and 40 nM PriC. Briefly, a forked DNA substrate (60 bp duplex, 38 nt 3' and 5' overhangs) was made by annealing two oligonucleotides, one of which was labeled with <sup>32</sup>P. The substrate was preincubated with SSB (when included) for 3 min at 25°C. Reactions were initiated by the addition of DnaB, DnaC (or a variant), and PriC (when included) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Unwinding was terminated by the addition of 20 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5% SDS, 0.2 mg/ml of proteinase K, and 2.5 ng/ul of oligonucleotide 3 L-98 (final concentrations) and incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were resolved on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. The gel was then fixed in 10% methanol, 7% acetic acid, and 5% glycerol, dried, and exposed to a phosphorimager screen and imaged on Typhoon FLA 9000. Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant (GE Healthcare) and percent unwinding was determined by dividing the intensity of the single strand product band by the total intensity in the lane.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank current and former members of the Berger lab, in particular Ernesto Arias-Palomo and Frédéric Stanger, for helpful discussions during the analysis and preparation of data.

Your article has been reviewed favorably by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript advances our understanding of loading factors for assembly of ring-shaped helicases around DNA. In particular, using <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaC as a model, the authors identify several key amino acids needed for ATPase function, and a new element for which they coin the term &quot;arginine-coupler&quot;, that enables DnaC to couple productive ATPase action to the loading of the hexameric DnaB replicative helicase onto DNA. This resolved the long standing question of how DnaC retains bound ATP when complexed with DnaB helicase to form the full DnaC hexamer, yet only hydrolyzes the ATP when the DnaB6C6 complex binds to ssDNA. Interestingly, the report also identifies, for the first time, that the ATPase of the DnaB helicase participates in the loading reaction. Furthermore, the report also shows that DnaC can couple ATP to the unloading of the DnaB helicase; this is the first time that helicase unloading has been observed in a bacterial system.</p><p>The authors address DnaC function using assays for ATPase, helicase loading, helicase unwinding, helicase unloading, and an array of 5 mutants in DnaC's: Walker A, Walker B, Arg finger, Sensor I, and Sensor II motifs. The work is systematic, employs many biochemical assays, and joins the results with amino acid homologies and previously determined structures by this group and others. The AAA+ family of proteins is widely dispersed in nature, and they function in many different ways. Typically, AAA+ proteins function as oligomers, and DnaC is no exception. Hence, the findings of this report, while focused on the AAA+ DnaC protein, will have impact on other labs that work on AAA+ factors, and especially helicase and polymerase clamp loaders.</p><p>This report represents a significant advance in our knowledge of helicase loader function, and is quite suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, once the points made below are addressed in a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have identified the following major issues to address. For Point 2, if additional experimental results are available they should be included in the revised manuscript. If such data are not available, then the revised text should clearly point out the limitations of the analysis.</p><p>1. The primary discovery by Puri et al is the Arginine Coupler residue. However, the mechanism by which the Arg coupler controls ATPase activity in response to DNA binding is unclear from the discussion in the paper. Please provide a clearer and more comprehensive discussion of how how you envisage the coupling between DNA recognition and ATP hydrolysis to be accomplished.</p><p>2. It is unclear why a double mutant of DnaB was used to ablate ATPase activity. Mutation of the glutamate of the &quot;Walker B&quot; alone is sufficient to kill ATPase activity, as shown by other labs, but crucially will still allow ATP binding. As the authors themselves point out, mutation of the lysine of the &quot;Walker A&quot; may well affect ATP binding (K→R, although K→A is used here) as well as hydrolysis. The fact that significant ATPase activity persists in the R→A mutant suggests it does still bind at some level, and this seems an unnecessary complication. Although previous work is quoted to suggest ATP binding is not required for loading, it would be reassuring to see data showing ATP binding to DnaB (or hexamer formation?) has not been impaired since hexameric helicase rings are more more stable on nucleotide binding. This would make the results much cleaner. The use of just the E262A mutation would be even better and probably sufficient.</p><p>3. The work is interesting from a DnaB/C viewpoint but also has implications for related systems, as the authors point out. However, their comparisons with related systems show some relevant omissions whose inclusions would strengthen the comparisons. For example, the polymerase clamp loader RFC is compared but it has been shown previously that one of the conserved &quot;RFC&quot; motifs in an archaeal RFC plays a role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to PCNA clamp loading and when mutated the complex shows elevated ATPase but cannot release the clamp. There would seem to be some relevant comparisons with the roles of the mutations described here.

It is unclear why a double mutant of DnaB was used to ablate ATPase activity. Mutation of the glutamate of the &quot;Walker B&quot; alone is sufficient to kill ATPase activity, as shown by other labs, but crucially will still allow ATP binding. As the authors themselves point out, mutation of the lysine of the &quot;Walker A&quot; may well affect ATP binding (K→R, although K→A is used here) as well as hydrolysis. The fact that significant ATPase activity persists in the R→A mutant suggests it does still bind at some level, and this seems an unnecessary complication. Although previous work is quoted to suggest ATP binding is not required for loading, it would be reassuring to see data showing ATP binding to DnaB (or hexamer formation?) has not been impaired since hexameric helicase rings are more more stable on nucleotide binding. This would make the results much cleaner. The use of just the E262A mutation would be even better and probably sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question. A number of published studies that we drew on in planning for this work used Walker A substitutions when creating ATPase-defective mutants of <italic>E. coli</italic> DnaB. Fang et al. (Mol. Cell, 1999) reported that both K→R and K→A mutants are still capable of binding ATP with near wildtype affinity, and that these mutants retain the ability to be loaded onto <italic>oriC</italic> by DnaC. In our hands, the single mutants still displayed sufficient residual ATPase activity that they masked the ATPase activity of DnaC (consistent with their reported ability to bind nucleotide); thus, we added the Walker B E→A mutation to fully ablate hydrolysis by the helicase. The double DnaB mutant behaves identically to the wildtype protein during purification and migrates as a single hexamer by size exclusion chromatography in the absence of ATP, indicating that it is not destabilized by the substitution.</p><p>Nevertheless, we went ahead and generated and tested the single Walker B mutant of DnaB (E262A) in the loading assay. Overall, it behaved very similarly to the double mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). As the outcome seems redundant to the findings obtained with the double mutant, we have elected not include this result in our studies; however, we can do so if the referees feel the distinction is important.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>ssDNA loading assay with wildtype (WT) DnaC comparing WT DnaB vs. a single Walker B mutant (E262A) and a double Walker A/B mutant (KAEA) of the helicase.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-64232-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The work is interesting from a DnaB/C viewpoint but also has implications for related systems, as the authors point out. However, their comparisons with related systems show some relevant omissions whose inclusions would strengthen the comparisons. For example, the polymerase clamp loader RFC is compared but it has been shown previously that one of the conserved &quot;RFC&quot; motifs in an archaeal RFC plays a role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to PCNA clamp loading and when mutated the complex shows elevated ATPase but cannot release the clamp. There would seem to be some relevant comparisons with the roles of the mutations described here. Furthermore, mutation of the Arg finger in RFC creates a complex that binds ATP and PCNA but cannot load onto DNA substrates. This would seem to be complementary, and consistent, evidence to the role of the Arg coupler described in regulating a step in clamp opening.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are relevant comparisons and have noted them in the text (lines 316-318, RFC Arg-finger relationship; lines 486-490, archaeal RFC study).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

As it turns out it’s unclear from sequence analyses whether DnaC/DnaI protein universally retain a glutamate switch. Nonetheless, mention of this feature should have been made.
