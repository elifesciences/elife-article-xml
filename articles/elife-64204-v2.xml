regulators in a wide spectrum of cancers. Recent studies have shown that <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency induces global changes in the epigenetic landscape of enhancers and promoters. These broad and complex effects make it challenging to identify the driving mechanisms of <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency in promoting cancer progression. Here, we identified the anti-senescence effect of <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency in the progression of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) by profiling the transcriptome of individual PanINs in a mouse model. In a human cell line model, we found that <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency upregulates the expression of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 (<italic>ALDH1A1</italic>), which plays an essential role in attenuating the senescence induced by oncogenic KRAS through scavenging reactive oxygen species. As a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, our ATAC sequencing data showed that <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency increases the accessibility of the enhancer region of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic>. This study provides the first evidence that ARID1A deficiency promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis by attenuating <italic>KRAS</italic>-induced senescence through the upregulation of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ARID1A</kwd><kwd>SWI/SNF complex</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>ALDH</kwd><kwd>PanIN-seq</kwd><kwd>pancreatic cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2EB020399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zong</surname><given-names>Chenghang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001234</institution-id><institution>Robert and Janice McNair Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>McNair Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zong</surname><given-names>Chenghang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ARID1A deficiency in SWI/SNF complex promotes pancreatic tumor development by upregulating ALDH protein levels to effectively reduce cellular reactive oxygen species levels, leading to the significant attenuation of oncogenic KRAS-induced senescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) was the third leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States in 2018 and is projected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rahib et al., 2014</xref>). Besides the clear driver mutations of PDAC, which include <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>TP53, SMAD4</italic>, and <italic>KRAS</italic>, there are a large number of genes with low-frequency mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waddell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017</xref>). The statistical significance of a large number of low-frequency mutations suggests that they likely play functional roles in the promotion of tumor development. From the evolutionary perspective of tumor development, the probability of acquiring one of the mutations in low-frequency-mutation genes is significantly higher than the acquisition of one of the mutations in the very few high-frequency-mutation genes such as <italic>TP53</italic>, especially at the very early stage when the number of pre-lesion cells is limited. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that a portion of the low-frequency mutations could be acquired at the early stage and that these mutations could play essential roles in tumorigenesis.</p><p>Among the genes with low-frequency mutations in PDAC, the top hit is <italic>ARID1A</italic> (a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex) with an 8% mutation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition to PDAC, <italic>ARID1A</italic> is also frequently mutated in other cancer types, with 45.2% mutation rate in ovarian cancer, 18.7% in gastric cancer, 18.6% in bladder cancer, 13.7% in hepatocellular cancer, 11.5% in melanoma, 9.4% in colorectal cancer, 8.2% in lung cancer, and 2.5% in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kadoch et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is crucial to study the ubiquitous mechanisms for <italic>ARID1A</italic>-deficiency-facilitated tumorigenesis in various types of cancers.</p><p>ARID1A is involved in the regulation of many biological processes of cells, including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu and Roberts, 2013</xref>). In pancreatic cancer, recent studies have shown that <italic>ARID1A</italic> is necessary to maintain terminal differentiation of pancreatic acinar cells, and knockout of <italic>ARID1A</italic> results in the accelerated formation of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and then pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livshits et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Although <italic>ARID1A</italic> depletion can prime acinar cells for early-stage PanIN lesion formation by facilitating shifts in cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livshits et al., 2018</xref>), the underlying mechanisms for the acceleration of <italic>ARID1A</italic>-deficiency-promoted PanIN progression remain elusive. Besides PanIN lesions, <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency could also facilitate intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) formation through multiple pathways, including MYC-mediated protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2019</xref>) and SOX9/mTOR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kimura et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To dissect the mechanisms whereby <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout drives PanIN progression, we applied the single-cell RNA-seq method to profile the transcriptome of individual early-stage PanIN lesions from <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout and wildtype mice. Our results showed that <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout could effectively reduce KRAS-induced senescence in PanIN lesions. It is important to point out that cellular senescence has been shown to be the major rate-limiting step in KRAS-driven PanIN progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Serrano et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, with significant attenuation of senescence, <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout can achieve significant acceleration of PanIN progression. Mechanistically, we found that aldehyde dehydrogenases play an essential role in attenuating senescence by scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced by oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Individual PanIN lesion RNA-Seq unveils the potential player contributing to the attenuation of <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence in <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout mice</title><p>To identify the mediators that contribute to <italic>Arid1a</italic>-deficiency-promoted PanIN progression, we followed the PanIN progression in conditional <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout mice with mutant <italic>Kras</italic> (<italic>Arid1a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup>;<italic>Lox-Stop-Lox-Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup>;<italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup>CreERT/+</sup>, we abbreviate it as AKC) and mice without <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout (<italic>Arid1a</italic><sup>+/+</sup>;<italic>Lox-Stop-Lox-Kras</italic><sup>G12D/+</sup>;<italic>Ptf1a</italic><sup>CreERT/+</sup>, we abbreviate it as KC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with the findings from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Livshits et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), we observed that <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout facilitated the progression of lesions from ADM to PanIN3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). At as early as the 2-month time point, the percentages of ADM, PanIN-1, and PanIN-2 were 74, 26, and 0%, respectively, in KC mice versus 53, 47, and 0% in AKC mice. At the 6-month time point, the percentages of ADM, PanIN-1, PanIN-2, and PanIN-3 were 77, 23, 0, and 0%, respectively, in KC mice versus 16, 74, 9, and 0.5% in AKC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We observed the decrease in the percentage of ADM and increase in the percentage of high-grade PanIN lesions, indicating the accelerated progression of lesions.</p><p>To profile the transcriptome of individual PanIN lesions, we combined laser capture microdissection (LCM) with a highly sensitive single-cell RNA-seq method (MATQ-seq) developed in our lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sheng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In total, we dissected and profiled 20 lesions from two KC mice and 24 lesions from two AKC mice. We only dissected PanIN-1 and PanIN-2 lesions because their duct-like structures can be easily recognized for dissection from frozen sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We observed that the lesions dissected from KC and AKC mice were clearly separated in the multidimensional scaling (MDS) plot, and 861 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), including 532 genes upregulated and 329 genes downregulated in AKC, were identified, which suggests the successful transcriptome profiling of individual PanIN lesions by MATQ-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesion RNA-seq unveils the potential player contributing to the attenuation of <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence in <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental scheme of transcriptome profiling of single PanIN lesions.

We observed that 25 gene sets were downregulated, and surprisingly, only two gene sets were upregulated in AKC lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.1). It is worth noting that among the 27 gene sets 2 are specifically associated with <italic>Kras</italic> activation: KRAS_SIGNALING_UP (the gene set upregulated upon <italic>Kras</italic> activation) and KRAS_SIGNALING_DN (the gene set downregulated upon <italic>Kras</italic> activation). The gene set KRAS_SIGNALING_UP was downregulated while the gene set KRAS_SIGNALING_DN was upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This observation suggests that the activities of <italic>Kras</italic> signaling are partially impaired by <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed that the <italic>Tp53</italic> signaling pathway was suppressed in AKC lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It has been well established that upregulation of the <italic>Tp53</italic>-related pathway is closely associated with apoptosis or senescence. <italic>ARID1A</italic> mutations have also been shown to be mutually exclusive with <italic>TP53</italic> mutations in endometrial cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether <italic>Arid1a</italic> is involved in the regulation of apoptosis, senescence, or both, we further examined the activity of related pathways in <italic>Arid1a</italic> KO lesions. Interestingly, we found that the senescence-associated signaling pathway is significantly suppressed in lesions from AKC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, the pathway activity associated with apoptosis was not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These observations led us to hypothesize that <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency could promote PanIN lesion progression through the attenuation of <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence.</p><p>Furthermore, senescent cells feature senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), including high levels of inflammatory cytokines and immune modulators. With the attenuation of senescence promoted by <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency, we expected to observe reduced inflammatory response in the GSEA. Indeed, we observed that multiple signaling pathways associated with inflammation, including TNFα signaling, IL6–STAT3 signaling, IL2–STAT5 signaling, IFN-α signaling, and IFN-γ signaling, were significantly suppressed in <italic>Arid1a</italic> KO lesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>In vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro verification of the attenuation of <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence by <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency</title><p>To verify the effect of <italic>Arid1a</italic> deficiency on <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence, we performed senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-Gal) staining on lesions from KC and AKC mice.

Instead of using the percentage of senescence cells, here we quantified the senescence based on the intensity of SA-β-Gal staining of the positive cells. We observed that the intensity of SA-β-Gal staining in acinar cells from AKC mice was significantly less than that from KC mice.

The in vitro result of SA-β-Gal staining is less significant than what we observed both in vivo and ex vivo.

It has been shown that KRAS can upregulate the expression of multiple oxidoreductases via NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2) to counteract oncogenic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeNicola et al., 2011</xref>). Meanwhile, KRAS can also enhance NADPH production by reprogramming the metabolism of glutamine to assist oxidoreductases in scavenging ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Son et al., 2013</xref>). However, the observation that a high percentage of senescent PanIN lesions occur in the pancreas of KC mice suggests that the mechanisms described above likely have limited effects in reducing <italic>Kras</italic>-induced ROS in neoplastic lesions. In the early stage of PDAC development, it is plausible that new mutations can be acquired to help cells to reduce ROS and escape the oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic>-induced senescence.</p><p>In this study, we successfully adapted a high-sensitivity total-RNA-based single-cell RNA-seq method, MATQ-seq, to profile the transcriptome of single lesions. We showed that transcriptome profiling of individual lesions is not only technically feasible but also it can provide important insights about the potential mechanisms of tumor progression. The transcriptome profiling of early lesions directly led us to unveil the effects of <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout in attenuating <italic>KRAS</italic>-induced senescence and identify the important roles of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> in mitigating the ROS stress induced by oncogenic KRAS.</p><p>It is worth noting that <italic>ARID1A</italic> has also been linked to the regulation of ROS through other pathways. Sun et al. found that <italic>ARID1A</italic> overexpression causes an increase in ROS by activating transcription of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450) at the initiation stage of liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, Ogiwara et al. found that <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency results in elevated ROS by inhibiting the transcription of <italic>SLC7A11</italic> (a transporter gene required for the import of cystine and the production of glutathione) in ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ogiwara et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the effects of <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency on ROS are likely tissue-specific.</p><p>Besides reducing ROS levels through the upregulation of ALDH family proteins, we also observed that <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency directly suppresses the activities of KRAS signaling. Our in vitro and in vivo data showed that the activation of Hallmark gene sets KRAS_SIGNALING_UP and KRAS_SIGNALING_DN is remarkably impaired upon <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout. Consistently, the activation of several inflammation-related signaling pathways upon Kras induction is inhibited in PanIN lesions and HPNE cells with <italic>ARID1A</italic> deficiency compared with wildtype counterparts, including TNFα signaling, IL6–STAT3 signaling, IL2–STAT5 signaling, IFN-α signaling, and IFN-γ signaling. Both reduction of KRAS activities and inflammatory cytokine response are also consistent with our observation of the increased attenuation of Kras-induced senescence upon ARID1A knockout.</p><p>Overall, experimental evidence shows that mutant KRAS signaling needs to be tuned to efficiently drive tumorigenesis: too much signaling could lead to cell growth arrest, while too little signaling could limit proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2018</xref>). To find the ‘sweet spot’ of <italic>KRAS</italic> activation, <italic>KRAS</italic> could harness its own activities by changing the mutation pattern (including mutation position and type of substitution) and seeking cooperation with other genes (e.g., mutagenesis of tumor suppressors) through the course of passive selection during tumor development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, our study demonstrates the important roles of epigenetic mutations in harnessing KRAS activities and promoting tumorigenesis. Future studies of such effects in other frequently mutated epigenetic genes are greatly desired.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The mouse with the target allele type of <italic>Lox-Stop-Lox-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup></italic> was ordered from Jackson Laboratory (Stock No: 008179 | LSL-K-ras G12D). The promoter of <italic>Ptf1a</italic> is used to drive the expression of inducible Cre in adult acinar cells (Stock No: 019378 | <italic>Ptf1a<sup>CreERT/+</sup></italic>, denoted as <italic>C</italic>).

Oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> mutant allele is silenced by a floxed STOP cassette (<italic>Lox-Stop-Lox-Kras<sup>G12D/+</sup></italic>, denoted as <italic>K</italic>). The adult mice (6–8 weeks) of the above genotypes were administered with tamoxifen (75 mg/kg/day for five consecutive days) to induce efficient ablation of <italic>Arid1a</italic> and activation of oncogenic <italic>Kras</italic> in pancreatic acinar cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell lines</title><p>We received the HPNE cell line (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:CVCL_C466">CVCL_C466</ext-link>) from Dr. Jennifer Bailey’s lab (UT Health Center), and the line is cultured in media recommended by ATCC. The identity of the cell line has been authenticated by STR profiling, and the mycoplasma contamination in cell lines has been routinely tested. HPNE with inducible KRAS<sup>G12D/+</sup> (iKRAS-HPNE) was generated by transduction of plasmid pInducer20-KRAS<sup>G12D</sup> into parental HPNE cells. After G418 selection for 15 days, the survived cells were then used for single-cell expansion in 96-well plate. For <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout HPNE cells, isogenic clone of iKRAS-HPNE was infected with lentivirus packaged with pL-CRISPR.EFS.tRFP-sgARID1A. After infection for 5 days, the RFP-positive cells were sorted and single-cell expansion was performed. <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of the isogenic clones.

During the incubation. the tissue was pipetted every 5 min. After washing twice with washing buffer (HBSS buffer with 5% FBS), the digested tissue was resuspended with media (Waymouth media with 2.5% FBS and 0.25 mg/ml trypsin inhibitor and 100 U/ml Penicillin-Streptomycin), filtrated with 100 µm strainer and seeded into 10 cm dishes overnight at 37°C to remove fibroblasts and ductal cells. The unattached acinar cells were then transferred into collagen-coated plates for growth. To activate Kras expression, 25 ng/ml EGF was added into the media for 5 days. Cells were then used for SA-β-Gal staining, RT-PCR, and western blot.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot</title><p>Western blot was performed using the standard protocol.

The cells were treated with doxycycline (6 µg/ml for 15 days) with and without DEAB (1.5 µM for 30 days, Stemcell Technologies Inc 01705). The media was changed every 2 days. When the colonies were large enough, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>ROS measurement</title><p>HPNE cells were treated with doxycycline (6 µg/ml for 5 days). ROS level was measured by Flow Cytometry using ROS Detection Assay Kit (BioVision, Cat# K936-250).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>SA-β-Gal staining</title><p>SA-β-Gal staining was performed on slides of freshly frozen tissues or cells using Senescence β-Galactosidase Staining Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, Cat# 9860). Total and SA-β-Gal-positive lesions or cells were counted at random fields under the microscope, and positive rates were calculated. For quantification of SA-β-Gal staining of primary acinar cells, due to the difficulty of recognizing the nuclei, average optical density (OD) was used to quantify the intensity of SA-β-Gal staining. 8-bit images were adjusted for white balance and color-deconvoluted using Feulgen light green vector in ImageJ. The average gray values of the green channel were measured. OD was calculated using the following formula: OD = log10 (255/gray value).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>PanIN quantification</title><p>Tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight, processed, and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin-embedded sections were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&amp;E staining). ADM, mPanIN-1A, mPanIN-1B, mPanIN-2, and mPanIN-3 were quantified using ImageJ for morphometric analysis based on scanned H&amp;E slides at 20× magnification. Grades of lesions were determined based on the characteristic morphology criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gopinathan et al., 2015</xref>) with consulting of pathology core. PanIN-1A: flat epithelium composed of columnar cells with basally oriented nuclei. PanIN-1B: identical to PanIN-1A lesions but exhibit papillary or basally pseudostratified architecture. PanIN-2: show mild nuclear abnormalities, including loss of polarity, nuclear enlargement, nuclear crowding, and nuclear pleomorphism. PanIN-3: show a predominantly papillary or micropapillary architecture with abnormal cribriforming, budding, and luminal necrosis; more severe cytological atypia, such as loss of nuclear polarity, dystrophic goblet cells, nuclear irregularities, and macro nucleoli. In case the lesion harbors more than one PanIN grade, the lesion was graded based on the component with the highest grade. Numbers of lesions of different grades were counted for at least five fields of view. The area of tissue was measured for each field of view. Lymph nodes of the pancreatic area were excluded. Numbers of lesions and tissue areas were summed up to calculate lesion number per area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>IHC quantification</title><p>For quantification of IHC results against ALDH3A1, H-score method was used. In brief, staining intensity (not stained: 0; weakly stained: +1; moderately stained: +2; or strongly stained: + 3) was determined for each lesion of interest in the field. The H-score was calculated by the following formula: 3 × percentage of strongly stained cells + 2 × percentage of moderately stained cells + 1 × weakly stained cells, giving a range of 0–300.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Bulk RNA-seq</title><p>HPNE cells were treated with doxycycline (6 µg/ml) for 5 days. RNA samples were prepared using the standard protocol for Trizol. mRNA was enriched using NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (NEB, E7490), and the library was prepared using the NEBNext Ultra II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, E7770). All libraries were sequenced on Illumina Nextseq500 platform. Reads were aligned to hg19 assembly of the human genome by STAR aligner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>), and transcripts counting was performed by HTseq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>). Differential gene expression analysis was performed by using edgeR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) with a cutoff of FDR at 0.05. To identify the genes with differential response to oncogenic KRAS in KO and WT cells, we also performed the interaction analysis in edgeR.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> expression in normal pancreas and PDAC</title><p>The expression profiles of ALDH genes in normal pancreas were obtained from GTEx database.

After incubation on ice for 3 min, the cell lysates were washed by RSB with 0.1% Tween-20. The cell lysates were then incubated with transposition mixture at 37°C for 30 min. After amplification, the transposed fragments were purified with magnetic beads. Finally, 4 ng fragments were used for the generation of the library. All libraries were sequenced on Illumina Nextseq500 platform.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>ATAC-seq data analysis</title><p>Reads were then mapped to the hg19 assembly by Bowtie2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) after removing the adaptor sequence. The quality control of ATAC-seq data was performed by using the ATACseqQC R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ou et al., 2018</xref>). Next, the mapped reads from three technical replicates of each genotype were combined for the peak calling by MACS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Peaks from wildtype samples and <italic>ARID1A-KO</italic> samples were combined to get a union peak set. All the peaks were then annotated by HOMER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>). HTseq-count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders et al., 2015</xref>) was used for read counting. edgeR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Robinson et al., 2010</xref>) was then used for normalization between different samples and for peak differential analysis. The read density profiles of the differential peaks were plotted by deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>). The motif enrichment analysis was performed by using AME.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>ENCODE data analysis</title><p>The expression levels of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> in the cell lines in ENCODE were obtained from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://portals.broadinstitute.org/ccle">Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia</ext-link> (CCLE) database (file name: file-CCLE_RNAseq_genes_rpkm_20180929.gct.gz; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghandi et al., 2019</xref>). Seven cell lines with RPKM &gt;10 were categorized as ALDH1A1<sup>high</sup> cell lines. Five cell lines with RPKM &lt;0.5 were selected as ALDH1A1<sup>low</sup> cell lines. The A549 H3K27ac and H3K4me1 ChIP-seq data were reanalyzed by using hg19 assembly as described above. The peak files of H3K27ac/H3K4me1 from the other cell lines were directly obtained from the ENCODE database. The ALDH1A1-related differential ATAC peaks, which are overlapped with the H3K27ac/H3K4me1 peaks in at least four out of seven ALDH1A1<sup>high</sup> cell lines, were characterized as functional enhancer regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>PanIN-seq</title><p>We used the MMI CellCut platform to perform LCM. 40–50% laser power was used with the cutting speed of 18 µm/s to dissect microscopic lesions. 1.6 µl of MATQ-seq lysis buffer (1 μl of 0.2% Triton X100 [Sigma-Aldrich], 0.4 μl of primer mix, 0.12 μl dNTP, 0.05 μl 0.1 M DTT [Life Technologies], and 2 U RNaseOUT [Life Technologies]) was added onto the isolation cap where the dissected tissue was attached (MMI, Prod.

Sample tubes were then placed on a thermocycler and incubated at 72°C for 3.5 min, followed by 1 min incubation on ice. 2.4 µl of MATQ-seq first strand synthesis buffer (0.8 μl 5× First Strand Buffer [Life Technologies], 0.2 μl 0.1 M DTT, 4 U RNaseOUT [Life Technologies], 30 U Superscript III [Life Technologies], and 1.15 μl RNase-free water) was then added. The reverse transcription program was same as MATQ-seq. After reverse transcription, the residual primers were then digested by using T4 polymerase at 37° for 40 min and 75° for 20 min. RNA was then digested by using RNase-H and RNase-If at 37° for 15 min and 72° for 15 min. Following that, dC-tailing and second strand synthesis were performed as described in MATQ-seq. The library prep for PanIN-seq samples were same as MATQ-seq.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.

By a combination of sequencing, computational analysis and experimental work they find that ALDH1A is negatively regulated by ARID1A and that loss of ARID1A results in its upregulation and a decrease in intracellular ROS. This highlights another new mechanism that is exploited by PanINs to prevent senescence and drive a pro-growth phenotype.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The conclusion that &quot;a highly complex trans-differentiation occurs following the knockout of Arid1a&quot; is not supported by the evidence provided in Figure S3. It is unclear what panels B and C are referring to (no labels) and there is no scale given. The authors also use the RNA-sequencing data to conclude that &quot;the activities of Kras signaling are partially suppressed by ARID1A deficiency.&quot; This is a major point and should be supported by experimental evidence in their cell models.</p><p>2. Although Figure S5B shows that genetic manipulation of ARID1A was successful, there is no evidence by western blot or PCR that ARID1A has truly been knocked out in their HPNE cells. This model was used for a large portion of the data and must be characterized in a convincing way.</p><p>3. The evidence for senescence in vitro is not strong. Several times throughout, a colony formation assay is used as a measure of senescence, rather than SA-b-gal, molecular markers or secreted factors. It is unclear why the authors measured SA-b-gal staining intensity rather than %-positive cells. In particular, the evidence that ARD1A regulates Kras-induced senescence in HPNE cells is lacking.</p><p>4. It is unclear if the ROS phenotype is mediated by ALDH1A1. Therefore, the conclusion that &quot;ARID1A knockout can effectively reduce cellular ROS level by upregulating the expression of ALDH1A1&quot; is not supported.</p><p>5. There is no functional experimental evidence provided for how ARID1A regulates the expression of ALDH1A1. This is a major point of novelty in the paper and should therefore be supported by experimental evidence.</p><p>6. In the patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, typically one sees point mutations, InDel or structure variations in the cancer genes; can the authors list the mutations in ARID1A in their samples to see if there are any recurrent mutations (i.e, visualized by lollipop plot, using ICGC-PACA-AU or ICGC-PACA-CA whole genome sequencing dataset, https://dcc.icgc.org/)? Can the authors perform an eQTL analysis (for example using FastQTL) to see if any mutations in ARID1A and +/- 1Mb cis-mutations are associated with the expression of ALDH1A1? The mutations and gene expression datasets could be readily downloaded from ICGC-PACA-AU or ICGC-PACA-CA (ICGC data portal).</p><p>7. The authors describe differences in proportions of distinct populations of ADM, PanIN-1, PanIN-2, PanIN-3 populations. At no point in their introduction/results do they describe the PanIN-1/2/3 populations. This would be a good addition for clarity. In addition there are no details on how these were quantified in the methods. In the introduction the authors state that previously ARID1A KO has been found to increased ADM – however Figure S1 shows the opposite that ARID1A KO leads to decreased ADM – while this reflects a trajectory of PanIN progression – not including any background on this is confusing and needs clarification.</p><p>8. How many genes in total were differentially expressed following MATQ-seq? Were lowly expressed genes removed? Was there any requirement that a gene was found to be expressed in at least N samples etc? These kind of filters are standard for scRNA-seq analysis and would seem to be appropriate for this type of data.</p><p>9. Using multiple pairwise comparisons is a restrictive way of analyzing this data – the authors should consider re-analyzing this data using an interaction test – trying to identify genes that respond differently to KRAS induction dependent on whether ARID1A is knocked out or not. Or consider an approach based on clustering of expression across differentially expressed genes to identify patterns of response across all four conditions. One prediction of the model the authors are proposing should be that SASP genes are upregulated in the KRAS vs WT but blunted in KRAS-ARID1A vs WT – is this observed?</p><p>10. Figure 3F: Figure 3F – please add a title containing the gene name – having the y-axis as ABM is confusing at first glance. Any supplementary table/data to show that ALDH1A1 was not in the list of DEG in AKC mice? Or to show that ALDH3A1 was? Is there a difference in regulation between species (i.e. both ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 are expressed, but only ALDH1A1 responds) or that only ALDH1A1 is expressed?</p><p>11. There is no comprehensive analysis linking the results from the in vitro MATQ-seq in mouse and the in vitro work in human. There is no discussion of whether orthologous genes are seen to up/downregulated in both. Linking together the results from the AKC vs KC lesions with KRAS-ARID1A-KO vs KRAS-Wildtype HPNE cells would allow the results from both models to be compared – which would strengthen the results presented.</p><p>12. Figure 4A: What is the expression of ALDH family members in the normal pancreas? This is really needed to make a comparison and statement as presented by the authors. In addition, Figure 4A is really showing high expression of ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 and not all &quot;ALDH family proteins&quot;.</p><p>13. Figure 4H: The authors have demonstrated no evidence that in PanINs KRAS is a target of ARID1A? Was this observed in their analysis of HPFE cells? The origin of this link is not apparent.</p><p>14. ATAC-seq analysis: there is no analysis of the gained or lost regions at all. It is not stated in the text as to the numbers of gained/lost nor is there any analysis of the genes they are near (i.e. using GREAT or something similar). Are the sites that have significant changes in accessibility enriched for specific TFBSs etc.… i.e. other papers have suggested that ARID1A is a co-factor for AP-1 etc.…. (https://clinicalepigeneticsjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13148-019-0690-5).</p><p>15. Figure 5: Figure 5A: the text uses the phrase that Spearmans correlation coefficients are significantly lower.….. this is implying a hypothesis test – please rephrase. Figure 5B/C: needs to be clarified on how it shows &quot;changes in accessibility of regulatory regions were significantly correlated with the alterations in gene expression levels in ARID1A-KO cells&quot;. How many of the 311 gained promoter ATAC regions overlap with genes which are upregulated (and vice versa)?</p><p>16. Supp. Table S4: There are 12 peaks reported in this table of which 10 are significantly &quot;gained&quot; this is different to the numbers reported in the manuscript. Please clarify/correct.</p><p>17. Figure S10: What is significance of identifying TFs? What are the significance of these TFs? Have they appeared in previous publications? Are any of these changing expression in ARID1A-KO RNA-seq? This is an underdeveloped analysis of what looks like good and interesting data.</p><p>18. Not all of the results from the differential expression analyses are available as Supplemental tables – this should be fixed.</p><p>19. In several parts of the manuscript – significance testing was carried out on only two data points (there can be no reliable estimate of variance using only two data points) using parametric methods – this is likely giving a false impression of significance – please either increase N or use a more appropriate test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64204.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, we observed that the difference between ARID1A-KO and WT cells was not as significant as in vivo (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). We have included this staining result in our first version. We attributed this result to the potential inefficiency in using SA-b-gal staining to identify the senescent HPNE.</p><p>The reason that we chose to measure SA-b-gal staining intensity in ex vivo experiment (Figure 2C-D) is as following: we found out that it was difficult to count the SA-b-gal negative cells due to the flat morphology of senescent cells and the large cell-size variations. Without accurate counting of negative cells, we cannot achieve the accurate calculation of the percentage of positive cells.

It is unclear if the ROS phenotype is mediated by ALDH1A1. Therefore, the conclusion that &quot;ARID1A knockout can effectively reduce cellular ROS level by upregulating the expression of ALDH1A1&quot; is not supported.</p></disp-quote><p>To provide the direct support for the role of ALDH1A1 in reducing cellular ROS, we added the ALDH1A1 knockdown experiment in the revision. The knockdown efficiency is shown by qRTPCR in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. We measured Kras-induced ROS level in ARID1A knockout HPNE cells with or without ALDH1A1 knockdown. As a result, ROS level in ALDH1A1 knockdown cells was significantly higher than in the cells with scramble shRNA upon Kras induction, indicating that ALDH1A1 is responsible for the clearance of ROS in HPNE cells with <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout. This new result has been added to Figure 4H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. There is no functional experimental evidence provided for how ARID1A regulates the expression of ALDH1A1. This is a major point of novelty in the paper and should therefore be supported by experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>In our first version of manuscript, we showed that <italic>ARID1A</italic> knockout could significantly increase the chromatin accessibility at the enhancer regions of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> (Figure 6A) in our ATAC-seq analysis. By analyzing the published ChIP-seq datasets of different TFs, we have identified the candidate factors that are involved in the regulation of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> expression. In particular, EP300 and NR3C1 could bind to two enhancer loci of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> (Figure 6C, left panel).</p><p>Here, to verify the predicted TFs based on ATAC-seq data as well as address this criticism for lack of experimental evidence on the role of ARID1A in regulating the expression of ALDH1A1, we have knocked down <italic>EP300</italic> and <italic>NR3C1</italic>, respectively, in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-KO HPNE cells (Figure 6figure supplement 1). As shown in Figure 6C (middle and right panels), knockdown of <italic>EP300</italic> or <italic>NR3C1</italic> significantly impairs the transcription of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> gene. As a control, we also showed that the expression of EP300 and NR3C1 are not changed between ARID1A-KO cells and wild type cells (Supplementary File 3). Therefore, these new experimental data support the following regulatory mechanism: ARID1A deficiency promotes the accessibility of the enhancer regions of ALDH1A1, which leads to the binding of EP300 and NR3C1 to the ALDH1A1 enhancers and the activation of ALDH1A1 expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In the patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, typically one sees point mutations, InDel or structure variations in the cancer genes; can the authors list the mutations in ARID1A in their samples to see if there are any recurrent mutations (i.e, visualized by lollipop plot, using ICGC-PACA-AU or ICGC-PACA-CA whole genome sequencing dataset, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dcc.icgc.org/">https://dcc.icgc.org/</ext-link>)?</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have analyzed the mutation data from two cohorts (ICGC-PACA-AU and TCGA) and plotted the ‘Lollipop’ plots by using the MutationMapper web tool at http://www.cbioportal.org/. First, we didn’t find the recurrent mutations in the coding regions of ARID1A in these PDAC patients (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). It is worth noting that most of these mutations generate truncated proteins, which further support the roles of loss-of-function mutations in ARID1A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors perform an eQTL analysis (for example using FastQTL) to see if any mutations in ARID1A and +/- 1Mb cis-mutations are associated with the expression of ALDH1A1? The mutations and gene expression datasets could be readily downloaded from ICGC-PACA-AU or ICGC-PACA-CA (ICGC data portal).</p></disp-quote><p>To test the eQTL based analysis, we have summarized the somatic mutations identified in ICGCPACA-AU and ICGC-PACA-CA datasets. In total, we identified 1510 somatic SNVs within +/- 1Mb regions of ARID1A. However, only 16 of them are recurrent mutations detected in multiple donors (15 mutations detected in two donors and 1 mutation detected in three donors). In the eQTL analysis, the SNVs in query need to be detected in multiple donors to reduce person-to-person variation and warrant statistical power. Here, considering the low number of recurrent mutations based on the two PDAC somatic SNV datasets, we conclude that we do not have statistical power to identify the mutations that are associated with the expression of ALDH1A1. Furthermore, we also examined whether there is significant enrichment of variants around the potential enhancer elements of ARID1A gene based on ATAC-seq data. However, we did not find any significant clustering of variants, which prevents us from performing meaningful eQTL analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors describe differences in proportions of distinct populations of ADM, PanIN-1, PanIN-2, PanIN-3 populations. At no point in their introduction/results do they describe the PanIN-1/2/3 populations. This would be a good addition for clarity. In addition there are no details on how these were quantified in the methods.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we added the details on lesion quantification in the method section in Supplementary Materials (Section PanIN quantification, Page 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the introduction the authors state that previously ARID1A KO has been found to increased ADM – however Figure S1 shows the opposite that ARID1A KO leads to decreased ADM – while this reflects a trajectory of PanIN progression – not including any background on this is confusing and needs clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s assessment. We have added additional description in the Main text (last paragraph, Page 4). Here, we would like to emphasize that in the previous study by Livshits <italic>et al.</italic> (Reference 8), the authors observed increase of ADM in adult mice two weeks after <italic>Arid1a</italic> was knocked out. In our study, we examined the effects of <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout on PanIN progression at much later stage, from 2 months to 6 months after <italic>Arid1a</italic> knockout. Indeed, as the reviewer pointed out, this reflects a trajectory of PanIN progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. How many genes in total were differentially expressed following MATQ-seq? Were lowly expressed genes removed? Was there any requirement that a gene was found to be expressed in at least N samples etc? These kind of filters are standard for scRNA-seq analysis and would seem to be appropriate for this type of data.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this critique, we have added the number of the differentially expressed genes into our manuscript (Supplementary File S2). The reviewer is also right. As a standard procedure, we do have a hard cutoff to remove lowly expressed genes when we performed DEG analysis on MATQseq. We only retained the genes with APM &gt; 2 in at least five samples for DEG analysis. We apologize for missing some of the analysis information in our first version and we have added the details in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Using multiple pairwise comparisons is a restrictive way of analyzing this data – the authors should consider re-analyzing this data using an interaction test – trying to identify genes that respond differently to KRAS induction dependent on whether ARID1A is knocked out or not. Or consider an approach based on clustering of expression across differentially expressed genes to identify patterns of response across all four conditions. One prediction of the model the authors are proposing should be that SASP genes are upregulated in the KRAS vs WT but blunted in KRAS-ARID1A vs WT – is this observed?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have performed an interaction test by using edgeR to identify the genes that respond differentially to KRAS induction depending on the mutation status of ARID1A and we have added the results in the revised manuscript. To summarize, with the interaction test, we identified 156 genes whose responses to KRAS activation are significantly different between ARID1A-KO and wild type HPNE cells (FDR &lt; 0.05) (Supplementary File S4). Next, we ranked the genes based on their differences in the response to KRAS induction (measured by the fold change in the output of edgeR DEG test) between <italic>ARID1A</italic>-KO and WT cells. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was then performed on the ranked gene list (Figure 3—figure supplement 3A-B). As a result, we observed that the activation of 4 inflammation-related pathways upon Kras induction (including interferon-α response, interferon-γ response, inflammatory response and TNF-α signaling via NF-κB pathways) are significantly suppressed in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-KO HPNE cells compared to WT cells, which suggests that these pathways are blunted in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-KO cells upon KRAS induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10.

Or to show that ALDH3A1 was?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we included the full list of DEG table of our PanIN-seq data in Supplementary File S2 to show that Aldh3a1, but not Aldh1a1, is significantly upregulated in AKC mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a difference in regulation between species (i.e. both ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 are expressed, but only ALDH1A1 responds) or that only ALDH1A1 is expressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, there are species-based differences. ALDH3A1 is not expressed in HPNE cell line, but it is expressed in mouse model, vice versa for ALDH1A1 in HPNE cell line. Therefore, we do not have a scenario that both ALDH1A1 and ALDH3A1 are expressed, but only ALDH1A1 responds. But the species difference still indicates the regulation could be different. In our regulation analysis with ATAC-seq data and experimental verification, we mainly focus on the regulation of ALDH1A1 for human samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. There is no comprehensive analysis linking the results from the in vitro MATQ-seq in mouse and the in vitro work in human. There is no discussion of whether orthologous genes are seen to up/downregulated in both. Linking together the results from the AKC vs KC lesions with KRAS-ARID1A-KO vs KRAS-Wildtype HPNE cells would allow the results from both models to be compared – which would strengthen the results presented.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this critique, we have compared the results from the in vivo mouse model to the in vitro human cell line model. We only find a limited number of genes that are significantly downregulated or upregulated in both (10 genes, the expected number of shared genes is 5.3). We speculate that the reasons for the limited number of orthologous genes sharing similar changes include cell type difference (the cell that we sequenced by PanIN-seq exist in the intermediate state of cell identity changes, while the HPNE has the fully established identity as epithelia cells) and the species difference.</p><p>Despite the limited number of orthologous genes sharing similar changes, we found that the perturbed pathways are quite similar between these two models. Among the 11 pathways significantly downregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05) in <italic>ARID1A</italic>-KO cells under KRAS induction, 8 of them are also significantly downregulated (FDR &lt; 0.05) in AKC lesions compared to KC lesions (the expected number is 3.74) (the shared pathways are labeled with asterisk in Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Here we didn’t compare the upregulated pathways in both models since the number of pathways that are upregulated in AKC lesions is small (only two pathways with FDR &lt;0.1).</p><p>Overall, this new analysis suggests that while there are gene expression differences between these two model systems (mouse versus human, in vivo versus in vitro<italic>,</italic> and the neoplasia versus epithelia like cells), however, the general effects of ARID1A deficiency on the lesion cells are consistent across species as well as between in vivo and in vitro systems. We have clarified these points in the revised manuscript and added the corresponding analysis in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Figure 4A: What is the expression of ALDH family members in the normal pancreas? This is really needed to make a comparison and statement as presented by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we have investigated the expression of ALDH family members in the normal pancreas and found that ALDH1A1 is the main subtype expressed in the normal pancreas (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A). With the published single cell RNA-seq data, we also observed that the expression of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> varies across different cell types, and the endocrine cells have the highest expression level, followed by exocrine glandular cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we also compared the expression of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> in PDAC to normal pancreas. Since the tumor cells are mainly epithelial cells, we only compared PDAC data to pancreatic ductal cells to avoid the confounding factors caused by the cell type difference. As shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, there are four subclusters of ductal cells. The average expression level of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> in normal pancreatic ductal cells (cluster 1,2 and 3) is less than 50. we exclude the cluster 4 since ALDH1A1 positive cells in ductal cells correspond to the stem cell population. In PDAC patient cohort, we observed that 63% of samples have the expression level of <italic>ALDH1A1</italic> larger than 50 TPM and 10% of samples have ALDH1A1 expression higher than 200 TPM (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). These observations strongly suggest that ALDH1A1 plays important roles in a significant portion of PDAC tumors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, Figure 4A is really showing high expression of ALDH1A1 and ALDH2 and not all &quot;ALDH family proteins&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the main text based on the reviewers’ suggestions to make the description more accurate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Figure 4H: The authors have demonstrated no evidence that in PanINs KRAS is a target of ARID1A? Was this observed in their analysis of HPFE cells? The origin of this link is not apparent.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on our PanIN-seq data, we concluded that the activities of KRAS signaling pathway are clearly suppressed in AKC lesions compared to KC lesions. In term of studying the regulation, due to the limited number of cells in PanIN lesion, we were not able to perform ATAC-seq for the lesion cells, which limits our conclusion on whether KRAS is a direct target of ARID1A. On the other hand, since we also observed the similar effect on KRAS pathways upon ARID1A knockout in the cell line model, we can use our cell line data to investigate the potential regulatory relationship between ARID1A and KRAS signaling pathway.</p><p>To do so, we analyzed the changes of chromatin accessibility the genes in KRAS signaling pathway (the genes in Hallmark_KRAS_Signaling_UP gene set from MSigDB) by using the ATAC-seq of our HPNE cell data. As a result, we found that the fold-changes of chromatin accessibility of the genes involved in KRAS signaling pathway are significantly lower than that of randomly selected genes (Figure 5—figure supplement 5). This result suggests that ARID1A engages in the regulation of the genes involved in KRAS signaling pathway by modifying the chromatin accessibility of their regulatory regions. We have modified the description in our revised manuscript to explain this potential regulation mechanism (Page 13, first paragraph, Main text).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14.

To address this critique, we also added the result of the global analysis of our ATAC-seq data using GREAT. Consistent with Figure 5C-D, the peaks with significantly changed accessibility between ARID1A-KO and WT cells are enriched at the distal regions (these new results are added to Figure 5—figure supplement 3A-B). The number of peaks with differential accessibility are all presented in the new figures.

Briefly, we separate the peaks with significant changes into four types: distal peaks with increased accessibility, distal peaks with decreased accessibility, promoter peaks with increased accessibility and promoter peaks with decreased accessibility. We found the peaks with increased accessibility (including both promoter peaks and distal peaks) are enriched with FOX family TFs, SRY, CDX1, SOX5, TEAD4 etc. (Figure 5F, Figure 5—figure supplement 5A and Supplementary File S7). On the other hand, the peaks with decreased accessibility are enriched with FOS/JUN TF family, NFE2, NF2L1 etc., (Figure 5G, Figure 5—figure supplement 5B and Supplementary File S7). These results are consistent with previous reports as mentioned by the reviewers. We also added the suggested reference in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15.

In details, we separated the DEGs identified in RNA-seq between ARID1A-KO and WT cells into two groups based on the fold-change (Figure 5B). The genes with positive log-fold change values are the genes upregulated in ARID1A-KO cells (Up-regulated genes group in Figure 5B) and the genes with negative log-foldchange values are the ones downregulated in ARID1A-KO cells (down-regulated genes group in Figure 5B). Next, we calculated the fold-change of chromatin accessibility for each of these DEGs and plotted the distribution of fold-changes of chromatin accessibility for these two groups of genes. As a result, we observed that the average fold-change of chromatin accessibility of upregulated genes is significantly higher than that of down-regulated genes (Figure 5B), which supports our statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many of the 311 gained promoter ATAC regions overlap with genes which are upregulated (and vice versa)?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the suggested analysis to examine the association between differentially expressed genes and the peaks with differential accessibility for both promoters and enhancers. As shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 4A-D, we observed that DEGs are significantly associated with the promoter peaks and the distal peaks with significantly differential accessibility. Furthermore, we noticed that the number of differentially expressed genes associated with the enhancer elements is larger than the number of genes associated with the promoters. This result is consistent with the observation that ARID1A knockout alters gene expression mainly by modulating the chromatin accessibility of the enhancers elements. A new paragraph describing this result (Page 12, last paragraph, Main text) is added in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16.
