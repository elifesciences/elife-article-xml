MAVS forms large prion-like polymers that activate the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1, which in turn activate NF-κB and IRF3, respectively, to induce interferons. Here we show that MAVS polymers recruit several TRAF proteins, including TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, through distinct TRAF-binding motifs. Mutations of these motifs that disrupted MAVS binding to TRAFs abrogated its ability to activate IRF3. IRF3 activation was also abolished in cells lacking TRAF2, 5, and 6. These TRAF proteins promoted ubiquitination reactions that recruited NEMO to the MAVS signaling complex, leading to the activation of IKK and TBK1. These results delineate the mechanism of MAVS signaling and reveal that TRAF2, 5, and 6, which are normally associated with NF-κB activation, also play a crucial role in IRF3 activation in antiviral immune responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00785.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00785.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00785.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The innate immune system can detect and destroy viruses, bacteria and other pathogens that enter the human body. In particular, inside cells, viral RNA can bind to and activate a protein called RIG-I. This protein switches on another protein, called MAVS, which can activate other copies of itself. These MAVS molecules then aggregate together on the membrane of mitochondria and send a signal that leads to the production of small proteins, called cytokines, which stimulate an inflammatory response and ultimately neutralize the virus.</p><p>Although many of the proteins that are activated by MAVS in the innate immunity signaling pathway have been identified, precisely how MAVS transmits this signal is unknown. Now, Liu et al. explore how this protein can propagate signals in the innate immune response by monitoring activation of the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, which transcribe cytokine genes.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that a protein known as ubiquitin is needed to activate RIG-I, and that this protein collaborates with MAVS to signal through the innate immunity pathway. Liu et al. found that a group of proteins including TRAF2, TRAF5, TRAF6 and LUBAC relay the antiviral signal by binding to MAVS. These so-called ‘E3 ligases’ string ubiquitin together in chains called polyubiquitin, which is essential for activating signaling after, or downstream of, MAVS; however, the association of these E3 ligases with MAVS also requires that multiple copies of MAVS cluster together.</p><p>MAVS, the TRAF proteins and LUBAC collectively recruit other innate immunity pathway proteins to activate IRF3 and NF-κB, and thus transcription of the genes that control the innate immunity response. Together, these results show the intricate interplay of proteins needed to eliminate viruses from the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00785.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00785.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>MAVS</kwd><kwd>innate immunity</kwd><kwd>virus</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Siqi</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Jiaxi</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhijian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP101496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Jueqi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1389</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cai</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhijian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Lijun</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhijian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RP110430</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>You-Tong</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Zhijian J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A cell-free system combined with cell-based assays elucidate the biochemical mechanism of signal transduction mediated by the mitochondrial protein MAVS and delineates the role of ubiquitin E3 ligases in antiviral innate immune responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The innate immune system deploys germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to detect pathogen invasion. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) such as bacterial LPS and viral dsRNA are recognized by PRRs such as membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic retinoic-acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akira et al., 2006</xref>). Upon activation, the receptors trigger the production of type-I interferons (e.g., IFNα and IFNβ) and other cytokines (e.g., TNFα and IL-6) to rapidly restrict the infection and further activate the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pichlmair and Reis e Sousa, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006</xref>).</p><p>RLRs include RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoneyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yoneyama and Fujita, 2008</xref>). All RLRs contain a DEAD/H-box RNA helicase domain, which binds to double-stranded RNA. RIG-I and MDA5, but not LGP2, harbor N-terminal tandem CARD domains that are crucial for triggering type-I IFN production. RIG-I also contains a C-terminal regulatory domain that specifically binds to RNA bearing 5′ triphosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hornung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pichlmair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2008</xref>). Upon binding to different viral RNA ligands, RIG-I and MDA5 activate another CARD-containing protein, mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, VISA, and CARDIF), presumably through CARD–CARD interaction. MAVS in turn activates the transcription factors IRF3 and NF-κB, leading to interferon induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kawai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meylan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seth et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have provided insights into the mechanisms by which RIG-I and MAVS are activated upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gack et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zeng et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kowalinski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Luo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2012</xref>). The sequential binding of RIG-I to viral RNAs and unanchored lysine-63 (K63) polyubiquitin chains promotes RIG-I to form higher order oligomers, which then rapidly induce MAVS polymerization. The MAVS polymers recruit other MAVS molecules on the mitochondrial surface to form larger polymers through a prion-like mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hou et al., 2011</xref>). These MAVS polymers potently activate the cytosolic kinases IKK and TBK1 through mechanisms that remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The ubiquitin system has been shown to be important for RIG-I signaling at steps both upstream and downstream of MAVS. Upstream of MAVS, polyubiquitin binding to RIG-I is required for RIG-I activation as described above. Downstream of MAVS, K63-linked polyubiquitin and the E2 UBC5 are required for IRF3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>). NEMO, the regulatory subunit of IKK and TBK1, functions as a ubiquitin sensor in different pathways that lead to NF-κB and IRF3 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ea et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, several proteins, including TANK, SINTBAD, NAP1, and STING (also known as MITA, ERIS, and MPYS), have been found to associate with TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sasai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Guo and Cheng, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ryzhakov and Randow, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishikawa and Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sun et al., 2009</xref>). Several E3 ligases including TRAF3, TRAF5, cIAP1/2, and MIB1/2 were proposed to regulate IRF3 activation downstream of MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saha et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang and Wang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, LUBAC, an E3 ligase complex that synthesizes linear ubiquitin chains, has been shown to negatively regulate the RIG-I pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belgnaoui et al., 2012</xref>). However, the biochemical mechanism of how ubiquitination regulates the activation of the protein kinases and transcription factors remains unclear.</p><p>We have previously described a cell-free system that mimics cellular response to viral infection. To further dissect the mechanism of how MAVS propagates downstream signaling, we performed conventional purification and identified TRAF6 as an IRF3 activator in the presence of activated MAVS. Moreover, by knocking down TRAF6 in <italic>Traf</italic>2/5-deficient cells, we found that TRAF2 and TRAF5 act redundantly with TRAF6 to activate both IRF3 and NF-κB in response to virus. In addition, we provide evidence that the E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is essential in the TRAF6-dependent activation of IRF3 and NF-κB, whereas the E3 ligase activity of TRAF2 is redundant with that of LUBAC in the <italic>Traf</italic>2-dependent pathway downstream of MAVS. Furthermore, mutations of the binding sites for TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 on MAVS abolished the ability of MAVS to activate downstream signaling after virus infection, without affecting its ability to form prion-like polymers. MAVS polymerization mutants, however, failed to recruit TRAFs. Finally, we found that through its ubiquitin-binding domains, NEMO formed a ubiquitination-dependent complex with TRAFs and MAVS, both in vitro and in cells. These results demonstrate a key role of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6, which form a ubiquitin-dependent signaling complex with NEMO and the kinases, in propagating antiviral signaling downstream of MAVS.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of TRAF6 as an IRF3 activator</title><p>We have previously established a cell-free IRF3 dimerization assay that mimics IRF3 activation in virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>).

This suggests that NEMO and the TBK1 complex function together in IRF3 activation. However, NEMOΔN PD does not fully replace Q-B in IRF3 activation in vitro even in the presence of ubiquitin and E1 (data not shown), indicating that additional factor(s) might be required for IRF3 activation.</p><p>We further fractioned Q-B on Heparin-Sepharose and tested the ability of individual fractions to support IRF3 dimerization in the presence or absence of NEMOΔN PD. In this assay, we replaced Q-A with purified Ubc5 and also included purified ubiquitin and E1 to avoid identifying these known factors. Several fractions from the Heparin column showed IRF3 stimulatory activity, which was dependent on NEMOΔN PD (e.g., fraction 14 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

In contrast, mutations of all known TRAF-binding sites (QN2ED) abolished IRF3 activation. Similarly, QN2ED, but not Q145N or 2ED, mutations in MAVS abolished IFNβ and IL-6 induction by Sendai virus. QN2ED MAVS also permitted higher levels of VSV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–F</xref>).

We have shown previously that both of these domains are important for NEMO to mediate IRF3 activation in response to RNA virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>). To identify ubiquitination target(s) that relays upstream signal to NEMO, we incubated Flag-NEMO with HeLa S100 in the presence of MAVSΔTM. MAVS and TRAF2 were found to co-immunoprecipitate (Co-IP) with Flag-NEMO after incubation at 30°C but not at 0°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The MAVS-TRAF2-NEMO interaction was blocked when a deubiquitination enzyme, which contains the ovarian tumor type (OTU) domain of the Crimean Congo hemorrahagic fever virus, was included in the reaction mixture. Moreover, a NEMO mutant (UBDm; Y308S/H413A/C417A), which contained point mutations in both ubiquitin-binding domains, failed to pull down the TRAF2-MAVS complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that MAVS and TRAF2 form a MAVS-induced ubiquitination-dependent signaling complex with NEMO in vitro.</p><p>To further characterize the MAVS signaling complex, we preformed two sets of stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) experiments to identify proteins that associate with NEMO in a manner that depends on MAVS signaling and NEMO–ubiquitin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>). In the first set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), extracts from MEF cells labeled with ‘heavy’ isotopes (K8R10) were stimulated with MAVSΔTM (A1 and B1) in the presence of WT Flag-NEMO, whereas extracts containing ‘light’ labeled proteins (K0R0) were either not stimulated with MAVSΔTM in the presence of WT Flag-NEMO (A2) or stimulated with MAVSΔTM in the presence of ubiquitin-binding defective NEMO mutant (Flag-NEMO-UBDm: Y308S/H413A/C417A; B2). After immunoprecipitation with the Flag antibody, the precipitates from the ‘heavy’ and ‘light’ samples were combined, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS). Among the proteins enriched in the heavy samples, we found that PLK1, TRAF2, and cIAP1 bound to NEMO in a manner that depended on MAVS and UBD of NEMO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). PLK1 was previously shown as a negative regulator of MAVS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vitour et al., 2009</xref>). All three subunits of the LUBAC complex, HOIP, HOIL-1, and Sharpin, bound to NEMO in a UBD-dependent manner, but this binding was largely independent of stimulation by MAVS. MAVS itself was not identified as a hit because it was not labeled with the heavy isotopes.</p><p>In the second set of SILAC experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we sought to identify proteins that associate with NEMO in living cells infected with VSV. We used <italic>Nemo<sup>−/−</sup></italic> MEFs reconstituted with Flag-NEMOΔN, which lacks the IKK-binding site but remained capable of stimulating TBK1, or Flag-NEMOΔN-UBDm, which is defective in ubiquitin binding. The ‘heavy’ cells expressing Flag-NEMOΔN (A1 and B1) and the ‘light’ cells expressing Flag-NEMOΔN-UBDm (B2) were infected with VSV, whereas the ‘light’ cells expressing Flag-NEMOΔN were uninfected (A2). Extracts from these cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation followed by nanoLC-MS/MS. Among the proteins that associated with NEMO WT, but not NEMO UBDm, after VSV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>), several were known NEMO-interacting proteins, including TRAF6, TRAF3, TRAF2, A20, and MAVS. In addition, several proteins previously not known to associate with NEMO were identified. The role of these proteins in the MAVS pathway requires further investigation.</p><p>A comparison of the NEMO interacting proteins identified by the in vitro and cell-based SILAC experiments revealed only two common proteins, MAVS and TRAF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). At present, we do not know why some proteins such as TRAF6, TRAF3, and A20 interacted with NEMO only in the ‘in vivo’ but not the in vitro SILAC, whereas the LUBAC subunits behaved oppositely. One possibility is that these proteins interact with NEMO in a dynamic manner, which is recapitulated differently between the in vitro and ‘in vivo’ experiments. In any case, as TRAF2 was recruited to NEMO in a manner that depended on MAVS, VSV, and UBD of NEMO, we investigated whether ubiquitination of TRAF2 plays a role in MAVS signaling. We incubated Flag-tagged mouse TRAF2 with S100 from <italic>Traf2/5</italic> DKO MEFs in the presence of MAVSΔTM, followed by Flag immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions (see ‘Materials and methods’). Five ubiquitination sites on TRAF2 were detected by mass spectrometry, including K31, K148, K195, K313, and K481 as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. Among these lysines, K31 was identified as an autoubiquitination site of TRAF2 in the TNF pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2009</xref>). We mutated these lysine residues to arginine in TRAF2 (T2-5KR), and stably expressed the mutants as well as the WT TRAF2 in <italic>Traf2/5</italic> DKO+shTRAF6 MEFs. Both WT and 5KR TRAF2 rescued the induction of IFNβ, IL6, and CXCL10 by VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Further mutation of another lysine (K38; to generate 6KR) also did not impair the function of TRAF2 (data not shown). Interestingly, knockdown of HOIP abolished the expression of these cytokines in cells expressing TRAF2-5KR, but not wild type TRAF2. These results, together with the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, suggest that ubiquitinated TRAF2 may function redundantly with another ubiquitination target of HOIP.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Ubiquitin-binding by NEMO, but not ubiquitination of NEMO, is essential for MAVS signaling</title><p>NEMO has been reported to be ubiquitinated at lysine 285 and 309, and this modification is important for NF-κB activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tokunaga et al., 2009</xref>).

In this report, we demonstrated that compound deletion of TRAF6, TRAF2, and TRAF5 completely abolished IFNβ induction by Sendai virus and VSV, suggesting that these proteins function redundantly in vivo to activate the downstream signaling cascades after they are recruited to the cognate binding sites on MAVS. Such redundant function of the TRAF proteins was not recapitulated in our cell free assay, in which IRF3 activation by MAVS was strongly inhibited in <italic>Traf</italic>6-deficient extracts, and largely abolished in the absence of TRAF2 and TRAF5. It is possible that certain aspects of cell signaling in intact cells, such as the potential involvement of cellular structures (e.g., membrane organelles) and transcriptional amplification, are not recapitulated in the in vitro system that employs soluble cytosolic extracts. Nevertheless, the in vitro assay recapitulates many aspects of MAVS signaling, such as its dependency on MAVS and NEMO. In the assay that involves endogenous MAVS, IRF3 activation occurs only when cytosolic extracts are incubated with mitochondria from virus-infected cells. Thus, the in vitro assays that we have established are valuable tools to dissect the biochemical mechanisms of MAVS signaling. Our finding that MAVS recruits multiple ubiquitin E3 ligases and other signaling proteins to activate IKK and TBK1 further underscores the importance of combining in vitro biochemical approach with cell-based assays to gain a mechanistic understanding of these complex signaling pathways.</p><p>Currently, the prevailing view is that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 mediate the activation of IKK and NF-κB, whereas TRAF3 is important for the activation of TBK1 and IRF3. However, here we showed that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are essential for the activation of both IKK and TBK1 by MAVS, whereas TRAF3 is dispensable. Paz et al. have recently shown that the TRAF6-binding site (455-PEENEY-460) of MAVS also binds to TRAF3 and that this binding is important for MAVS signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paz et al., 2011</xref>). Another recent report confirmed that the PEENEY motif (residues 455–460) of MAVS is important for IFNβ induction when an intermediate domain of MAVS is fused to an artificial oligomerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takamatsu et al., 2013</xref>). However, this study did not directly investigate whether TRAF6 or TRAF3 is important for MAVS signaling. Our data showed that in cells expressing a MAVS mutant lacking the TRAF2/5 binding sites (Q145N), activation of IRF3 and production of IFNβ were completely abolished in cells depleted of TRAF6, indicating that other TRAF proteins, including TRAF3, could not substitute the function of TRAF6. It is possible that the role of TRAF3 in IRF3 activation depends on the cell types and specific signaling pathways. Alternatively, TRAF3 may regulate type-I interferon production through a mechanism that does not affect IRF3 activation.</p><p>Our finding that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 play an essential role in both NF-κB and IRF3 activation by MAVS is surprising because these TRAF proteins are also recruited to other receptors such as TNF receptor, TLRs, IL-1 receptor, and CD40, which only stimulate NF-κB but not IRF3. A possible explanation for these observations is that IRF3 activation requires certain adaptor proteins such as MAVS, STING, and TRIF. Indeed, we have recently shown that STING simultaneously binds to TBK1 and IRF3, thereby specifying IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tanaka and Chen, 2012</xref>). This mechanism explains why several innate immunity pathways, such as the TLR and IL-1 pathways, could lead to activation of TBK1 but not IRF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clark et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our model that MAVS signals through multiple TRAF proteins is further supported by mutagenesis experiments which showed that mutations of both TRAF2/5 and TRAF6 binding sites of MAVS, but not each alone, abolished IRF3 and IKK activation by virus infection. Importantly, MAVS binds to the TRAF proteins in a manner that depends on virus infection and MAVS polymerization. Mutations in the CARD domain of MAVS that disrupt its polymerization also abolish the recruitment of the TRAF proteins. These results explain why MAVS undergoes prion-like polymerization in response to viral infections. Presumably, each TRAF binding motif of MAVS has a low affinity for the TRAF proteins, but the polymerization of MAVS significantly increases the avidity of the interaction, resulting in the recruitment of the TRAF proteins. The recruitment of TRAFs to the MAVS polymers may lead to the oligomerization of TRAFs, which activates their ubiquitin E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sun et al., 2004</xref>). The E3 ligase activity of TRAF6 is likely important for IRF3 activation because mutation of the RING domain in TRAF6 abolishes its activity. Interestingly, the RING domain of TRAF2 is important for IRF3 activation only when the catalytic activity of HOIP is abrogated, suggesting that TRAF2 and HOIP may have redundant functions. HOIP is dispensable for IRF3 activation in cells expressing TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6. Conversely, the loss of TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 completely abolishes IRF3 activation in cells expressing other E3s such as LUBAC, cIAPs, and TRAF3. These results indicate that TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 are the major E3s that mediate the activation of IKK and TBK1 downstream of MAVS.</p><p>How do TRAF2, TRAF5, and TRAF6 activate IKK and TBK1? Both IKK and TBK1 employ NEMO as an essential regulatory subunit for their activation. NEMO contains two ubiquitin-binding domains, which are essential for the activation of IKK and TBK1 in response to virus infection. Although we could detect ubiquitination of NEMO at multiple lysines, mutations of these lysines to arginine did not impair the ability of NEMO to support IRF3 activation by MAVS. In fact, a NEMO mutant containing mutations at 13 conserved lysine residues (13KR) could still activate IRF3 in the presence of MAVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G,H</xref>). We also found that TRAF2 is recruited to NEMO in a manner that depends on ubiquitination and MAVS. TRAF2 is also ubiquitinated at multiple lysine residues. However, mutations of these residues to arginine did not impair its ability to induce cytokines in response to VSV infection unless HOIP was also depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E–G</xref>). Thus, HOIP may have an additional ubiquitination target that functions redundantly with TRAF2 ubiquitination to mediate IRF3 activation. An emerging theme from this work is that multiple ubiquitin E3s are recruited to MAVS, and each E3 targets ubiquitination of distinct proteins, which function cooperatively and redundantly to activate IKK and TBK1. A similar model has recently been proposed for the regulation of DNA repair by sumoylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Psakhye and Jentsch, 2012</xref>). It was shown that sumoylation of a group of DNA repair proteins (‘protein group’), rather than a specific protein target, is responsible for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Rabbit antibodies against human IRF3, TRAF2, TRAF3, TRAF6, NEMO, and mouse antibodies against human MAVS and ubiquitin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX; Rabbit antibody against human HOIP was from Abcam, Cambridge, MA; Flag antibody (M2), M2-conjugated agarose, anti-HA-conjugated agarose, and tubulin antibody were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO; HA antibody was from Covance, Princeton, NJ; antibodies against pIRF3 Ser<sup>396</sup>, pTBK1 Ser<sup>172</sup>, pIκBα Ser<sup>32/36</sup>, and pSTAT-1 Tyr<sup>701</sup> were from Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA; mouse IRF3 antibody was from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; pan cIAP antibody was from R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN; TBK1 antibody was from IMGENEX Corp, San Diego, CA; TANK antibody was from BioVision, Milpitas, CA.

The medium was supplemented with dialyzed FBS, penicillin, streptomycin, and amino acids <sc>l</sc>-lysine and <sc>l</sc>-arginine. The ‘light’ culture was supplemented with Lys0 (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>14</sup>N<sub>2</sub>) and Arg0 (<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>14</sup>N<sub>4</sub>), and the ‘heavy’ culture with Lys8 (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>2</sub>) and Arg10 (<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub><sup>15</sup>N<sub>4</sub>). All SILAC reagents were purchased from Pierce (Thermo Scientific). The in vitro and cell-based SILAC experiments were preformed according to the outline described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>, respectively. After SDS-PAGE and silver staining, 10 to 12 gel slices from each lane were excised and digested with trypsin in situ. Extracted peptides were fractionated on a homemade analytical column (75 μm ID, 100 mm in length) packed with C18 resin (100 Å, 3 μm, MICHROM Bioresources) using Dionex Ultimate 3000 nanoLC system (Thermo Scientific). The column was coupled in-line to a Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a nano-electrospray ion source, which was set at a spray voltage of 2.3 kV. Peptides were eluted with a 78 min gradient as follows: 2–30% B in 68 min, 30–35% B in 4 min, 35–40% B in 2 min, 40–60% B in 3 min, and 60–80% B in 1 min (A = 0.1% formic acid; B = 100% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid). Full scan mass spectra were acquired from <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> 300 to 1500 with a resolution of 70,000 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 200 in the Orbitrap. MS/MS spectra (resolution: 17,500 at <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> = 200) were acquired in a data-dependent mode, whereby the top 10 most abundant parent ions were subjected to further fragmentation by higher energy collision dissociation (HCD). SILAC data were processed using MaxQuant computational platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) version 1.3.0.5 which incorporates the Andromeda search engine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cox et al., 2011</xref>). Proteins were identified by searching the mouse UniProt database supplemented with frequently observed contaminants. The first search tolerance was set at 20 ppm, and main search deviation at 6 ppm. The required minimum peptide length was six amino acids. The false discovery rate (FDR) at both peptide and protein levels was set to 0.01. SILAC quantification of each protein group was based on at least two ratio counts.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Ming Xu for the U2OS

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Liu et al. elucidated the biochemical mechanism for MAVS activation of type I interferon response and NF-κB signaling. Upon innate immune detection of cytoplasmic viral RNA by RIG-I receptors, MAVS, a mitochondrial outer membrane protein, polymerizes and signals NF-κB and IRF3 activation through IKK and TBK1 kinases. This process critically requires ubiquitination, but the nature of the ubiquitination events and the roles of TRAF-family ubiquitin ligases have been controversial and are not clearly defined. In this study, the authors employed cell-free reconstitution and biochemical fraction approaches, and identified TRAF6 being one of the key ubiquitin ligases in mediating MAVS activation of both NF-κB and IRF3 signaling. Using viral infection of different TRAF KO MEFs, the authors further discovered that TRAF2/5, but not TRAF3, play a redundant role with TRAF6 and function cooperatively with TRAF6 to mediate ubiquitination signaling upon MAVS activation. Importantly, all three TRAFs (TRAF2/5/6) are recruited to MAVS upon viral RNA-induced MAVS polymerization, and only when all three TRAFs are depleted is MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling completely blocked. This clarifies the role of different TRAF ubiquitin ligases in MAVS-mediated antiviral signaling. Moreover, the study also demonstrates that K63-linked ubiquitin chains, sensed simultaneously by the two ubiquitin-binding domains in NEMO, play a pre-dominant role in MAVS activation of NF-κB and IRF3 signaling through IKK/TBK1. These findings are of great interest and certainly seem to advance our understanding of the RIG-I-MAVS antiviral signaling. The study is carefully designed and performed, the evidences provided are quite thorough and complete, and the conclusion drawn is reasonably justified. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed before the manuscript can be accepted for publication:</p><p>1) The finding of LUBAC coordinating with TRAF2/5 in MAVS signaling contradicts with two prior reports that instead show a negative role (Inn et al. Mol. Cell 41:354; Belgnaoui et al. Cell Host &amp; Microbe 12:211). The authors should try resolving this discrepancy. The authors should compare the impact of deficiency of each of the three LUBAC components on MAVS signaling as other studies suggested that, although the three proteins associate, they are differentially involved in distinct functions. The authors may also test this using different cell lines.</p><p>2) TRAF2/5 and LUBAC function redundantly in generating ubiquitin chain signals in the absence of TRAF6. Meanwhile, the authors also indicate that K63 ubiquitin chains play a major role in MAVS signaling. TRAF2/5 is suggested in some previous studies to have no E3 activity while LUBAC only produces linear chains. Therefore, the authors should address how K63 ubiquitin chains are generated in the absence of TRAF6. Do the authors really mean that TRAF2/5 and/or LUBAC can make K63 ubiquitin chains? The authors should also perform knockdown experiments to clearly rule out the role of cIAPs in <italic>Traf6</italic>-deficient cells.</p><p>3) The present study disagrees with several prior studies which suggested an essential role of TRAF3 in MAVS signaling. This is rather puzzling as the evidence presented previously was obtained independently by several groups. The authors should better investigate this discrepancy. Is this due to clonal variation and adaption among the TRAF KO cells? Are all different TRAFs expressed in KO cells as expected? The authors should also properly refer to those prior studies so that the contradiction can be more evident. For example, the paper does not give accurate reference to Oganesyan et al. (Nature 439:208). That paper is only referred as that TRAF3 is required for TLR-mediated IFN induction, though it did show that VSV activation of IRF3-dependent genes is markedly reduced in <italic>Traf</italic>3 KO MEFs.</p><p>4) Another major concern is the large quantitative differences among the experiments: The levels of IL6 induction attained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> are in the range of 1000-fold, and in 2H of 60-fold. The levels of IFNβ induction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> approaches 100,000-fold while those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1E are less than 600-fold. The author should clarify if these huge differences reflect just experimental variations or differences intrinsic to the cell clones used. The extent of the inter-clonal variation of response should be assessed by comparing a number of different cell clones of the same genotype. The authors should also clarify whether this large variation in extent of induction reflects differences in actual level of gene expression attained after viral infection or variation in the basal expression levels of the induced gene. In the latter case, the actual values of expression, rather than 'fold induction' should be presented. The exact nature of the differences in the values of gene induction in the various cells used in the same experiment is also not clear. Do the figures present average and standard deviation? In that case, average of what: different cell clones or several replicates of the same clone? In how many independent experiments? Are the various transfected proteins expressed at the same level and how do they compare to the endogenous levels? Western analyses and comparison of the expression levels of the transfected proteins should be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00785.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The finding of LUBAC coordinating with TRAF2/5 in MAVS signaling contradicts with two prior reports that instead show a negative role (Inn et al.

While knockdown of HOIL-1 led to a modest enhancement of IRF3 activation and IFN? induction, knockdown of HOIP or Sharpin in WT MEF cells did not affect IRF3 activation and only modestly inhibited IFN? induction. The positive role of HOIP and Sharpin in IRF3 activation was revealed only in cells expressing TRAF2?RING, but not WT TRAF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1I), supporting our model that HOIP and Sharpin function redundantly with the E3 activity of TRAF2. Overall, our results are consistent with those of Inn et al. that HOIL-1 is a negative regulator of RIG-I signaling (Mol Cell 41:354), but contradict with those of Belgnaoui et al. who showed that Sharpin negatively regulates the RIG-I pathway (Cell Host &amp; Microbe 12:211). To further investigate the role of Sharpin in the RIG-I pathway, we infected the <italic>Sharpin</italic>-deficient (cpdm) MEFs with VSV and Sendai virus (SeV) for different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1C). In each case, IFN? induction by the viruses was significantly reduced in the absence of Sharpin. We also used tetracycline-inducible RNAi to knock down HOIP in U2OS cells and found that IFN? induction by VSV was partially inhibited in the absence of HOIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–figure supplement 1E–1G). Thus, in multiple independent experiments involving different cell lines, viruses and time courses, we consistently found that HOIP and Sharpin played a positive, albeit not indispensable, role in the RIG-I pathway.</p><p><italic>2) TRAF2/5 and LUBAC function redundantly in generating ubiquitin chain signals in the absence of TRAF6. Meanwhile, the authors also indicate that K63 ubiquitin chains play a major role in MAVS signaling. TRAF2/5 is suggested in some previous studies to have no E3 activity while LUBAC only produces linear chains. Therefore, the authors should address how K63 ubiquitin chains are generated in the absence of TRAF6. Do the authors really mean that TRAF2/5 and/or LUBAC can make K63 ubiquitin chains? The authors should also perform knockdown experiments to clearly rule out the role of cIAPs in Traf6-deficient cells</italic>.</p><p>We did not propose that TRAF2/5 and LUBAC generate K63 ubiquitin chains in the absence of TRAF6. In fact, it is quite likely that linear and other types of ubiquitin chains generated in the absence of TRAF6 and Ubc13 could activate IKK and TBK1. This could explain how different TRAF proteins and LUBAC could compensate for each other in MAVS signaling in cells. Our in vitro assay largely recapitulates the K63 polyubiquitination-dependent pathways, but not the linear polyubiquitination-dependent pathway. How LUBAC mediates MAVS signaling in the absence of TRAF6 in vivo requires further investigation.</p><p>We have investigated the role of cIAPs in MAVS signaling using a small molecule SMAC mimetic compound (SM), which is known to bind cIAP1 and cIAP2 and induce their degradation. Treatment of WT, <italic>Traf</italic>6 KO and <italic>Traf</italic>2/<italic>Traf</italic>5 DKO cells with SM did not lead to any significant inhibition of IRF3 dimerization or induction of IFN? or IL6 by VSV (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1I–1L). Thus, cIAPs are largely dispensable for MAVS signaling under all conditions that we have tested. These results have been incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The present study disagrees with several prior studies which suggested an essential role of TRAF3 in MAVS signaling. This is rather puzzling as the evidence presented previously was obtained independently by several groups. The authors should better investigate this discrepancy.

That paper is only referred as that TRAF3 is required for TLR-mediated IFN induction, though it did show that VSV activation of IRF3-dependent genes is markedly reduced in Traf3 KO MEFs</italic>.</p><p>Our previous study using <italic>Traf</italic>3 knockout MEF cells showed that IFN? induction and IRF3 activation by Sendai virus were largely normal, except that at the later time point (9 hours after infection) there was a modest reduction of IFN? in the absence of TRAF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zeng et al., 2009</xref>, Mol Cell 36: 315). In that study, we verified that TRAF3 was indeed not detectable in the <italic>Traf</italic>3 KO MEFs that we used. Using a different approach, here we showed that knockdown of TRAF3 by RNAi in <italic>Traf</italic>2/<italic>Traf</italic>5 DKO cells did not significantly impair IFN? or IL6 induction by VSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig 2</xref>–figure supplement 1E–1G). Similarly, knockdown of Traf6 in <italic>Traf</italic>3-deficient MEF cells also did not inhibit IRF3 activation by Sendai virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1H). Thus, unlike TRAF6 that functions redundantly with TRAF2/5, TRAF3 is not redundant with TRAF2/5 or TRAF6. Overall, although TRAF3 may play some roles in the induction of interferons in certain cells, it is largely dispensable for IRF3 activation under different experimental conditions. We have incorporated these new data into the revised manuscript. We have also revised the Discussion to leave open the possibility that TRAF3 may regulate interferon induction through a mechanism independent of regulating IRF3 activation.</p><p><italic>4) Another major concern is the large quantitative differences among the experiments: The levels of IL6 induction attained in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>are in the range of 1000-fold, and in 2H of 60-fold.

Are the various transfected proteins expressed at the same level and how do they compare to the endogenous levels? Western analyses and comparison of the expression levels of the transfected proteins should be presented</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for this confusion. The large differences in the RNA levels as measured by q-RT-PCR were largely due to the variations in the basal levels (minus virus or 0 hour). For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, the basal level of IL6 RNA in DKO + shTRAF6 + TRAF6-WT cells was ∼36 fold higher than the basal level in DKO-GFP control cells. This higher basal level was likely due to overexpression of TRAF6 in the cells. We have now modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> by indicating the values of the IL6 RNA levels relative to the basal level of IL6 in the GFP control cells. It is apparent from these values that the ‘super-induction’ of IL6 in shTRAF6+TRAF6-WT cell was due to higher levels of TRAF6 in these cells.</p><p>The reviewers correctly pointed out the large differences in the folds of induction of IFN? in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1E. Such a difference was due to the use of different PCR machines which we acquired during the course of these experiments. The q-RT-PCR experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>–figure supplement 1E was performed using BioRad iQ5, whereas the experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> was done using ABI ViiA7. The latter instrument has much higher sensitivity and allowed detection of very low levels of RNA in the samples. Since the basal levels of IFN? RNA were very low in uninfected cells, their detection was quite variable using different instruments. Such variability in the basal levels contributes to the large differences in the folds of induction presented in these figures. Despite such variation in different sets of experiments performed at different times, it is clear that virus infection induced very large and consistent increases of IFN? expression in the same set of experiments, allowing us to draw solid conclusions for each experiment.</p><p>With the exception of the SILAC experiments, the results presented in this paper are representative of at least two independent experiments. The error bars represent standard deviations of triplicate experiments. We have now indicated this fact in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> legend with the following sentence:</p><p>“Unless indicated otherwise, error bars in this and other figures of this paper represent standard deviation of triplicate experiments.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
