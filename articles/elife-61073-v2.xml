Here, a proteomic analysis of 1301 plasma proteins was conducted in 997 individuals between 21 and 102 years of age. We identified 651 proteins associated with age (506 over-represented, 145 underrepresented with age). Mediation analysis suggested a role for partial <italic>cis</italic>-epigenetic control of protein expression with age. Of the age-associated proteins, 33.5% and 45.3%, were associated with mortality and multimorbidity, respectively. There was enrichment of proteins associated with inflammation and extracellular matrix as well as senescence-associated secretory proteins. A 76-protein proteomic age signature predicted accumulation of chronic diseases and all-cause mortality. These data support the use of proteomic biomarkers to monitor aging trajectories and to identify individuals at higher risk of disease to be targeted for in depth diagnostic procedures and early interventions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>healthspan</kwd><kwd>biomarker</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 AG060906</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schilling</surname><given-names>Birgit</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99 AG065484</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Basisty</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of proteomic data identified protein biomarkers of aging, mortality and aging-related diseases, supporting their use to monitor aging trajectories and identify individuals at higher risk of disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The elderly population is rapidly growing around the world, and the age group 80 years and older is expanding faster than any other demographic group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colby and Ortman, 2015</xref>). Advanced age is one of the most powerful predictors shared by many chronic diseases that are highly prevalent in the older population and negatively impact function and quality of life. Understanding mechanisms by which aging increase the risk of chronic morbidity is of utmost importance for the development of new intervention strategies aimed at improving health-span in the general population.</p><p>While, at the population level, the overall risk of pathology increases with chronological age, the age when pathology first emerges clinically, the rates of pathology development and the age at death are highly variable between individuals. Hence, two individuals of the same chronological age may lay on very different health trajectories. While the characterization of risk factors has proven useful for the identification of individuals at high risk of developing specific diseases, there is currently no robust method to distinguish between individuals at risk of global deterioration of health status. For example, chronic inflammation is the only biomarker that predicts the development of multimorbidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fabbri et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, the development of biomarkers that can discriminate, at an early stage, individuals on different health trajectories with aging is a critical challenge in aging research.</p><p>Over the last few years, data from a large number of molecular analytes have been used to screen biomarkers associated with chronological age, specific chronic diseases and global health in relatively large populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). Among these molecular analytes, proteins are particularly attractive because they are direct biological effectors, and dynamic changes with aging or disease are complex and manifold. Indeed, previous studies on circulating proteins have already shown great promise as potential biomarker signatures of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Past studies have used various proteomic platforms to identify novel age- and disease-related protein biomarkers in plasma, serum, and cerebral spinal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Menni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baird et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Di Narzo et al., 2017</xref>). While several promising candidate biomarkers have been reported, reproducibility of the findings and the clinical utility of these biomarkers is still uncertain. Highly robust and clinically useful biomarkers will emerge following repeated studies in genetically and geographically diverse cohorts.</p><p>Since aging is a complex process, it is likely that multiple biomarkers are needed to capture the physiological mechanisms of accelerated aging that eventually lead to the multiplicity of adverse outcomes that typically occur in older persons. Perhaps the best example is the estimation of ‘epigenetic clock’ signatures that were developed by examining DNA methylation across a large number of DNA sites to single out those that in a weighted average reproducibly predict chronological age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvath, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bocklandt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Human Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weidner et al., 2014</xref>). Positive deviations of the epigenetic clock from chronological age are meant to estimate biological age acceleration and have, in fact, been shown that they predict pathologic age-related traits, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and premature death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fauci et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Levine et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perna et al., 2016</xref>). Other epigenetic biomarkers, still based on DNA methylation, were developed by tuning them against health-related characteristics, including risk factors of cardiovascular disease, mortality and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levine et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2019</xref>). While these tools have clearly demonstrated that the aging process determines predictable, non-stochastic epigenetic changes, the predictive power of epigenetic biomarkers are still too limited for extensive clinical use. In addition, the mechanisms for such age-related changes in DNA methylation and their association with health outcomes is unknown, as it is challenging to draw conclusions related to functional pathways. Additionally, ideal clinically useful biomarkers should be directly measurable in highly accessible and non-invasive biological specimens such as plasma or serum.</p><p>Our group recently developed an accurate signature of age using data from 76 plasma proteins in a population of 240 healthy subjects between 22 and 93 years of age. This proteomic signature of age was correlated with age-related clinical parameters such as inflammation and adiposity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). A clear advantage of protein biomarkers compared to other biomarkers is that they are direct biological effectors, and their identification provides important clues to the underlying biological mechanism involved in their association with age and health outcomes. However, whether this proteomic clock is associated with clinically relevant aging outcomes could not be determined because of limited sample size and because the initial study was restricted to extremely healthy individuals.</p><p>To address the limitations of our previous US-based study, here we examined associations between age and abundances of 1301 proteins measured using an aptamer-based method on a representative population sample of 997 participants in the Italy-based InCHIANTI study. We aimed to identify novel age-associated proteins, as well as confirm previously reported age-associated proteins, and to uncover their relationship with age-related outcomes. By using a genetically and geographically distinct cohort, we also aimed to crystallize the most robust biomarkers in diverse populations. We used a Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach to explore genetic evidence of causal relationship between age-associated proteins with key chronic diseases. We also explored DNA methylation as an underlying epigenetic mechanism for age-related changes in protein abundance and show that, for some proteins, methylation can partially explain the observed age associations. We further investigated whether proteomic data can be used to predict chronological age in a geographically distinct cohort using the algorithm from our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we assessed that the deviation between predicted and observed age may reflect rates of aging and could be used as a measure of accelerated biological aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Association of protein abundance and chronological age</title><p>Plasma proteomic profiling was conducted on 997 individuals (45% men, 55% women) between the ages of 21–98 years (average 66.3 ± 15.4 years) from the baseline visit of the InCHIANTI study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata1">Table 1—source data 1</xref>).

Of the 1301 proteins tested, 651 proteins (506 overrepresented and 145 underrepresented with age) were associated with chronological age at Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (B-H FDR)≤0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The percent variation in protein abundances explained by age ranged from 0.3% to 50.6%. When the analysis was adjusted for the burden of chronic disease, 537 proteins (82.5%) remained significantly associated with age, with small effects on the strength of the association. Specifically, the effect size (or beta estimates) of the regression model changed by 30% or more in only 35 of these proteins (6.5%). These findings suggest that the majority of variance in these proteins was accounted by age ‘per se’ rather than age-related differences of health status. To validate the finding, we used data from a cohort 240 healthy subjects from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) and the Genetic and Epigenetic Signatures of Translational Aging Laboratory Testing (GESTALT) using in the previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Of the 651 proteins that were significantly associated with age in the InCHIANTI study, 60% (395 proteins) were significantly associated with age in the BLSA/GESTALT study. To identify additional age-associated proteins, a meta-analysis of associations results from the BLSA-GESTALT and the InCHIANTI study was performed. There were 735 proteins associated with age 596 higher abundance with age, 139 lower abundance with age; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 2</xref>).

Of the 735 age-associated proteins, 511 were measured in the INTERVAL/LonGenity study and 346 (68%) proteins were significantly associated with age, and more importantly for 286 (56%) proteins, the directions of age association were concordant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Given the robust literature indicating that DNA methylation changes systematically with aging, we tested whether the association of protein abundance and age can be explained in part by age-related changes in DNA methylation in circulating white blood cells. In 460 subjects with both methylation and proteomic data, a mediation analysis was conducted to test the hypothesis that changes in protein concentrations with aging are mediated by epigenetic regulation, namely changes in percent methylation in CpG sites located within 10 kb of the protein coding gene. This was performed in four steps. In the first step, we identified proteins that were associated with age in the subcohort with both proteomic and methylation data. Of the 651 age-associated proteins in the full cohort, a subset of 499 proteins were significantly associated with age in this sub-cohort. Of these 499 age-associated proteins, 485 were expressed by genes on autosomal chromosomes. Since some of the aptamer probes target protein complexes, those 485 proteins were encoded by 494 genes. In the second step, we identify age-associated CpG loci. Of the 472,138 CpG sites measured, 170,780 were significantly associated with age. There was significant enrichment of age-associated CpG loci within 10 kb of genes coding for age-associated proteins compared with genes coding for other proteins assayed by the SOMAscan assay used here (41.8% vs 37.9% respectively, p=0.0001). In the third step, the existence of a possible mediation effect was tested by regressing protein abundance with age, adjusted for age-associated CpG. For 449 out of the 494 genes, there was at least one CpG that mediated the association between age and protein abundance (P<sub>sobel</sub> &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). On average 7.8% (range 0.3–31.2%) of the age-associated CpG methylation mediated the association between age and protein abundance. The percent mediation ranged from 2% to 100%. The most significant mediation was observed for ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 7 (ENPP7), member of the ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family implicated in phospholipids and cholesterol metabolism with a CpG cg15739835. There is a positive association of ENPP7 abundance with age, and this association is attenuated when adjusted for cg15739835 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). There is negative association between cg15739835 methylation with age, reflecting lower methylation at older age at this CpG site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These data suggest that the higher abundance in ENPP7 at older age may be explained by lower gene silencing since methylation is reduced at older age.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Association of plasma ENPP7 with age and mediation by cg15739835.</title><p>Mediation analysis in 460 subjects with DNA methylation and proteomic data was conducted with Baron and Kenny method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).

The most frequent pathway annotations among proteins were interleukin-10 signaling (35.71%), EPH receptor signaling (28.57%), and chemokines (7.14%).

The proteomic analysis identified 651 age-associated plasma proteins, many of which had a strong age-relationship independent of the presence of chronic diseases. Many of these proteins were previously described, 224 additional novel age-associated proteins are reported in the InCHIANTI study. Sex-stratified analysis showed that for most proteins, age associations were similar in men and women. Proteins that systematically change with aging are also biomarkers of health longitudinally and risk biomarkers for mortality and accumulation of multimorbidity over time in all subjects as well in persons that appear to be healthy by being free of any chronic diseases at the time of the evaluation. Analysis of DNA methylation data showed that methylation is one of the molecular mechanisms of age-associated differences in protein expression. Exploration of publicly available genetic data to assess the genetic relationship between age-associated protein and aging disease supported the clinical importance of these proteins. Finally, age acceleration measure using proteomic signature of age, which can be interpreted as a proxy measure for biological age, is associated with comorbidity and predicts future rate of change in multimorbidity as well as all-cause mortality over a 18 year follow-up period. These data support the notion that circulating proteins are useful biomarkers to monitor trajectories of health and to identify those individuals who are aging faster than their chronological age. These individuals may be targeted for in depth diagnostic workup to identify novel opportunities for prevention of the impending deterioration of health. Not only are plasma proteins ideal clinical aging biomarker candidates as they are easily accessible, proteins are direct biological effectors and can highlight important mechanisms underlying aging.</p><p>Results from several studies that have investigated the relationship between plasma protein and age are consistent in their findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Menni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>). The current study in a general Italian population yielded results highly correlated with those from our previous study in a highly selective healthy population from the US, and therefore highlighting that this cluster of age-related proteins is not population specific but rather reflects some general physiological mechanisms of aging, which may have important clinical implications. In our study, 32.6% of the age-associated proteins were predictive of all-cause mortality and 45.3% were associated with multimorbidity independent of chronological age, suggesting that their change may reflect a shared biological process between aging and disease. This observation is consistent with the geroscience paradigm that accelerated aging has a causative role in multiple chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sierra and Kohanski, 2017</xref>). The protein most strongly associated with chronological age in the current study was pleiotrophin (PTN), which is a heparin-binding growth factor involved in angiogenesis, tumorigenesis, and neuromodulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bertram et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Souttou et al., 1998</xref>). In our study, PTN was not predictive of either mortality or multimorbidity after adjusting for age. The second most significant protein in our analysis was growth-differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a member of the transforming growth factor‐β cytokine superfamily. GDF15 was the most significant age-associated protein predictive of mortality and multimorbidity. In humans, GDF15 has been suggested as a biomarker of cardiovascular disease mortality, but more recently associated with all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindholm et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">ActiFE study group et al., 2019</xref>).

Increase of cellular senescence burden is hypothesized to be one of the fundamental biological mechanisms underlying aging, thus confirmation of GDF15 as a SASP factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>) supports the utility of this protein as a global biomarker of health and lifespan. We have previously reported an enrichment of SASP factors among circulating protein biomarkers of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Here we have also identified numerous SASP components or other senescence-associated proteins among biomarkers of aging, mortality, and multimorbidity. Among the most robust SASP components we identified 11 proteins in this study - GDF15, MMP1, STC1, IGFBP2, IGFBP4, TIMP1, TIMP2, CST3, CTSB, CLEC11A, and POSTN – which are both core SASP components (secreted by multiple types of senescent cells and senescence inducers) and also associated with all-cause mortality and multimorbidity. IL-6, a classical SASP factor in multiple senescent cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Coppé et al., 2008</xref>), was also associated with all-cause mortality. Several other top SASP components that we identified in plasma are also previously reported health biomarkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basisty et al., 2020</xref>). In addition to aging, MMP1 is a biomarker for several cancers, pulmonary fibrosis and potentially Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosas et al., 2008</xref>), whereas STC1 is a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for cancers, pulmonary fibrosis, renal ischemia/reperfusion injury and Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohkouchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shahim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The recent INTERVAL and LonGenity studies show that there were unique non-linear patterns in the expression proteins across lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically there were three waves of changes in the proteome in the fourth, sixth and eight decade. Moreover, it was shown that the proteins that changed in the older decades were associated with age-related diseases while the proteins that change in the fourth were not. We explored whether similar patterns can be observed in the InCHIANTI study, and strikingly we found a peak shift in the proteome in the eighth decade at 78 years of age replicating the same exact timing of the INTERVAL and LonGenity study. T in the younger ages, however our study may have been limited in identifying a wave in ages before 60 due to the small sample size resulting from the sampling design in the InCHIANTI study. We also found that the proteins that were associated with age in the older years were associated with both all-cause mortality and multimorbidity. In our study, the proteins identified through linear modeling were also enriched in proteins associated with all-cause mortality and multimorbidity thus the linear models did capture important aging biomarkers. However, these data suggest that more emphasis on proteins that change in later years may lead to discovery of clinically important proteomic biomarkers of age.</p><p>MR explores causal relationships between exposure and outcome using the random assortment of genetic alleles associated with exposures of interest, often described as a ‘natural’ RCT study. Two sample MR utilizes large databases of genome-wide association study results to infer causal relationships using genetic data as instrument variables. In this study, we find that genetically elevated brain type natriuretic peptide (NPPB) was protective against hypertension. Circulating NPPB reduces blood pressure and plasma volume through its effect on the adrenal gland, kidney, brain and vasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levin et al., 1998</xref>). Circulating NPPB levels are found at high concentrations in patients with heart failure and was shown to be a useful diagnostic tool in an acute setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davis et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gardner, 2003</xref>). A genome-wide association study of circulating NPPB identified a variants in the NPPB locus, and these variants were also associated with lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as lower risk of hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Newton-Cheh et al., 2009</xref>). The genetic instrument for NPPB used in our study is mapped to the same locus as the variants used in the previous report, and our results are consistent with their findings. We also found genetically higher matrix metalloproteinase-12 (MMP12) to be protective of coronary heart disease, MI, and ischemic stroke. MMP12 is a metalloprotease produced primarily by macrophages and is involved in inflammation and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shapiro et al., 1993</xref>). While circulating levels of MMP12 have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, genetically increased MMP12 has been linked to reduced cardiovascular disease risk in the current report as well as others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chong et al., 2019</xref>). The apparent discrepant association between the genetic instrument for NPPB and MMP12 with their respective age-associated disease may signify reverse-causation where proteins levels are altered in response to development of disease or may reflect possible compensatory protein where protein levels increase with age to protect against development of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bucur et al., 2020</xref>). The discrepancy of the direction of associations should be explored further. We found genetically increased proteinase inhibitor 3 (PI), or elafin, was associated with increased odds of having MI, both ischemic and cardioembolic stroke, lunch cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. PI3 is a skin-derived serine protease inhibitor that plays an important role in hydrolyzing connective tissue components including elastin and collagen through the inhibition of elastase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schalkwijk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wiedow et al., 1990</xref>). PI3 has also been linked to lung tissue repair and is a candidate biomarker for lung diseases including acute respiratory lung disease and asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tsai et al., 2016</xref>), as well as modulator of inflammation through the inhibition of neutrophil derived elastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alam et al., 2012</xref>). Our data support the involvement of PI3 in cardiovascular, lung and immunological diseases through the control of inflammation and tissue repair. We found genetically higher SPARC related modular calcium binding 1 (SMOC1) to be associated with higher bone mineral density, hemoglobin and RDW. Our results are consistent with results from genome-wide association studies of bone mineral density and osteoporosis, where SMOC1 has been identified as the candidate gene underlying the signal on chromosome 14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qiu et al., 2019</xref>). Animal studies have shown that SMOC1 knockout results in disruption of ocular and limb development through reduction in interdigital apoptosis and disruption in BMP signaling. Interestingly, SMOC1 was identified in a genome-wide association study of blood traits in mice, however, this locus has not been a major locus in human genetic studies of blood parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2013</xref>). Further studies are needed to explore the link between SMOC1 and blood traits found in our study. Finally, we find genetically higher growth hormone receptor (GHR) was associated with bone mineral density. GHR knockout animals display disproportional bone growth and lower bone mineral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sjögren et al., 2000</xref>). In humans, administration of growth hormone has been shown to improve bone mineral density in postmenopausal women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joseph et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that the proteomic signature of age (<italic>PROage</italic>) can be effectively used to assess an individual’s rate of aging (<italic>PROaccel</italic>). What was surprising is that the proteomic age signature developed by our group is strikingly similar to another proteomic age signature created in a geographically distinct population by <italic>Lehallier</italic> and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that the circulating age proteome, at least as captured by this aptamer-based platform, is very robust. Using this proteomic signature, subjects who were predicted to be older than their chronological age had higher prevalence of comorbidities, more rapid increase in co-morbidities over time, and higher risk of all-cause mortality. In recent years, several measures of rates of aging have been developed using methylation data. We compared the proteomic signature with three epigenetic clocks. One of the first phase of epigenetic clocks developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Horvath, 2013</xref>, is a multi-tissue methylation signature (mDNA<sub>HORVATH</sub>) that was designed to predict chronological age. The second is an epigenetic marker for phenotypic age developed by Levine and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levine et al., 2018</xref>) that was derived using clinical biomarkers, such as albumin, creatinine, and glucose (mDNA<sub>PHENO</sub>). Phenotype age was designed to predict all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, and other aging measures. The final epigenetic clock is one developed by Ake and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2019</xref>) based on biomarkers and risk factors of mortality including smoking, seven biomarkers including GDF15 and PAI-I (mDNA<sub>GRIM</sub>). Interestingly, aging rate based on proteomic clock (<italic>PROaccel</italic>) was not correlated with aging rates based on mDNA<sub>HORVATH</sub> (mDNA<sub>HORVATHACCEL</sub>), but was moderately correlated with rates based on mDNA<sub>PHENO</sub> (mDNA<sub>PHENOACCEL</sub>) and mDNA<sub>GRIM</sub> (mDNA<sub>GRIMACCEL</sub>). Since both <italic>PROaccel</italic> and mDNA<sub>GRIMACCEL</sub> both include GDF15, these two biological aging measures may be capturing similar aging mechanisms. We compared the <italic>PROaccel</italic> against three methylation age measures in their ability to predict all-cause mortality. <italic>PROaccel</italic> performed better than mDNA<sub>HORVATHACCEL</sub>, but was outperformed by mDNA<sub>PHENOACCEL</sub> and mDNA<sub>GRIMACCEL</sub>. This would suggest that creating a proteomic signature of aging phenotypes, rather than chronological age, could result in a more robust proteomic biomarker for aging and should be explored in future studies. However, our biomarker panels include many SASP proteins that may be utilized as important benchmarks for clinically assessing senescent cell burden. As the development of drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells (senolytics) or modify the SASP (senomorphics) has quickly advanced in recent years, with early trials now in progress, using biomarker panels that include markers of senescence will be an important step in translating these interventions to the clinic.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. While the associations of individual proteins with age have been consistent across different populations, the associations of the <italic>PROaccel</italic> with morbidity and mortality should be confirmed in additional, larger studies. It would also be important to validate whether <italic>PROage</italic> measure can be confirmed using proteomic data generated using different platforms. Since proteomic measurements were only conducted cross-sectionally, we could not determine whether <italic>PROaccel</italic> is a sensitive measure of changes in health status over time. Longitudinal measurement of proteomic data will also be useful determining the trajectories of protein abundances, which could be a more sensitive in capturing rates of aging.</p><p>In summary, in this study 651 age-associated proteins were identified that are also predictive of important aging outcomes including all-cause mortality and multimorbidity. Further examination of the function of these proteins individually or collectively may further shed light to the mechanisms underlying the aging process. Finally, a proteomic signature of age based on abundances of 76 proteins captures the rate of aging and may be useful in identifying individuals who are aging faster than their chronological age. These findings should be confirmed in a longitudinal perspective, with good representation of individual men and women across the lifespan. Finally, clinical studies that use in depth characterization of physiological and pathologic characteristics of individuals who are ‘older’ compared to those who are ‘younger’ than their chronological aging may confirm whether a proteomic signature of aging may be a useful tool in clinical practice.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and methods</title><p>The InCHIANTI study is a community-based cohort study based in the Tuscan region of Italy. This study was conducted in the ‘Invecchiare in Chianti’ (Aging in the Chianti Area, InCHIANTI) study. The InCHIANTI study is a population-based epidemiological study aimed at evaluating factors that influence mobility in the older population living in the Chianti region in Tuscany, Italy. Details of the study have been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ferrucci et al., 2000</xref>). Briefly, 1616 residents were selected from the population registry of Greve in Chianti (a rural area: 11,709 residents with 19.3% of the population older than 65 years of age) and Bagno a Ripoli (Antella village near Florence; 4704 inhabitants, with 20.3% older than 65 years of age). The participation rate was 90% (n = 1453) and subjects' age ranged between 21 and 102 years. Overnight fasted blood samples were used for genomic DNA extraction and genotyping. The study protocol (exemption #11976) was approved by the Italian National Institute of Research and Care of Aging Institutional Review and Medstar Research Institute (Baltimore, MD) and approved by the Internal Review Board of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). All participants provided written informed consent.</p><p>Sociodemographic information (age, sex) was obtained during a structured interview. Mortality data were evaluated for up to 20 years following the baseline visit (1998–2000), assessed using the mortality general registry maintained by the Tuscany Region and through death certificates submitted to the Registry office of the municipality of residence immediately after death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zuliani et al., 2017</xref>). Whole blood white blood cell differential count was assessed using a Coulter Counter (LH 750 Hematology Autoanalyzer, Beckman Coulter Inc, Brea, CA). Multimorbidity was ascertained based on the presence of 15 diseases (hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cancer, Parkinson’s disease, hip fracture, lower extremities joint disease, anemia, PAD, cognitive impairment, chronic kidney disease, and depression) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fabbri et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Proteomic assessment</title><p>Proteomic profiles for 1322 SOMAmers were assessed using the 1.3 k SOMAscan Assay at the Trans-NIH Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammation (CHI), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD, USA) using the same methods as previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>). Out of the 1322 SOMAmer reagents, 12 hybridization controls, four viral proteins (HPV type 16, HPV type 18, isolate BEN, isolate LW123) and 5 SOMAmers that were reported to be non-specific (P05186; ALPL, P09871; C1S, Q14126; DSG2, Q93038; TNFRSF25, Q9NQC3; RTN4) were removed, thus leaving 1301 SOMAmer reagents in the final analysis. There are 46 SOMAmer reagents that target multicomplex proteins of two or more unique proteins. There are 49 UniProt IDs that are measured by more than one SOMAmer reagent. Thus, the 1301 SOMAmer reagents target 1297 UniProt IDs. Of note, there are four proteins (P05413; FABP3, P48788; TINNI2, P19429; TINNI3, P01160; NPPA) in the final protein panel that are rat homologues of human proteins.</p><p>The experimental process for proteomic assessment and data normalization has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Candia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>). The data reported are SOMAmer reagent abundance in relative fluorescence units (RFU). The abundance of the SOMAmer reagent represents a surrogate of protein concentration in the plasma sample. Data normalization was conducted in three stages. First, hybridization control normalization removes individual sample variance on the basis of signaling differences between microarray or Agilent scanner. Second, median signal normalization removes inter-sample differences within a plate due to technical differences such as pipetting variation. Finally, calibration normalization removes variance across assay runs. Furthermore, there is an additional inter-plate normalization process that utilizes CHI calibrators that allows normalization across all experiments conducted at the CHI laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Candia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheung et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Genome-wide DNA methylation assessment</title><p>Details of DNA methylation assessment and QC filtering in the InCHIANTI study have been described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moore et al., 2016</xref>). In brief, genomic DNA was extracted from buffy coat samples (white blood cells) collected at the baseline visit and methylation status of ~480,000 CpG were assessed with Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (Illumina Inc, San Diego, CA) using manufacturer’s protocol. Quality filtering (bead count, detection rate) and normalization was performed using the DASEN method in the watermelon R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pidsley et al., 2013</xref>). After filtering CpG with cross-reactive probes, on polymorphic position, and on X or Y chromosomes, 472,139 markers in 460 subjects with both proteomic and methylation data were used for analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless noted otherwise, statistical analysis was performed using R, a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Protein RFU abundances were natural-log transformed and outliers outside 4SD were removed. Associations of protein with chronological age were assessed by linear regression using the lm function adjusting for sex and study site (base model). A second model was examined with further adjustments for the presence of chronic diseases. The proportion of variation explained by age was calculated as the difference between the adjusted R-square between a model with and without age, while adjusting for sex and study site. To test for differences in age-protein association by sex, an age-by-sex interaction term was included in the base model. For all analyses, a Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) was applied using the p.adjust function to adjust for multiple testing. Associations were considered significant at FDR &lt; 0.05. A meta-analysis of results from the BLSA/GESTALT study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>) and InCHIANTI study was performed using a fixed effect inverse-variance meta-analysis using the command-line tool METAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Willer et al., 2010</xref>). Differential expression or non-linear association of proteins with age was conducted using Differential Expression - Sliding-Window ANalysis (DE-SWAN) R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lehallier et al., 2019</xref>) using an age window of 10, 20 and 30 years. A q-value threshold of ≤0.05 was considered significant.</p><p>Association of protein with all-cause mortality was analyzed using follow-up time to death as the time variable. Cox proportional hazard models were assessed adjusting for covariates (age, sex, and study site) using the coxph function from the survival package. For each fully adjusted model, the proportional hazards assumption was tested by examining the correlation of scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time using the cox.zph function. A global p-value≤0.05 was considered a violation of proportional hazard assumption (26 proteins). For these proteins, a stratified analysis was conducted by splitting the follow-up period into two or three intervals and including an interaction term between protein and time-interval strata in the model. Based on the plots of the Schoenfeld residuals versus transformed time, follow-up time was split into two intervals at the mean follow-up year (15 years) for 18 proteins, or into 3 intervals at 12 and 18 years (1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter) for the remaining eight proteins. To investigate the association of age-related protein with trajectories of multimorbidity, the slope was extracted from a linear mixed model that repeated measurement of number of multi-morbidities over a 10 year period. The associations between slope and age-related protein levels were modeled using linear regression adjusting for covariates. In addition to the single-protein model, for both all-cause mortality and multimorbidity, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO) method (implemented via the glmnet function) to perform variable selection and construct parsimonious multi-protein models. To compare the effect sizes of each protein on mortality or multimorbidity, protein abundances were z-transformed to zero mean and unit variance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mendelian randomization</title><p>To explore the causal relationship between age-related plasma proteins with chronic diseases, we used a two-sample MR approach. This is accomplished by identifying genetic instrument variable for the exposure (plasma protein levels) and outcome variable (chronic diseases) the estimating the causal effect. The plasma proteins that were associated with all-cause mortality and multimorbidity in the multi-protein models (protein list here) were targeted for MR analysis. Protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL) for these plasma protein levels were selected from a pQTL analyses conducted in the INTERVAL study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sun et al., 2018</xref>). For all proteins except GDF15, there was only one genetic variant that was significantly associated with protein levels; NPPB (rs198389), GDF15 (rs45543339, rs1227734), MMP12 (rs28381684), PI3 (rs16989763), GHR (rs150036324), TNFRSF1B(rs5746017), and SMOC1(rs1958078; Table S4). The chronic disease outcomes tested included 18 trait/diseases (hypertension, type 2 diabetes, ischemic heart disease, coronary heart disease, ischemic heart disease, cardioembolic stroke, chronic kidney disease, prostate cancer, lunch cancer, ovarian cancer, Parkinson’s disease, depressive disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, spine bone mineral density, hemoglobin, bone mineral density, red blood cell distribution width) that reflect the 15 diseases used to ascertain multimorbidity status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hemani et al., 2018</xref>). For genetic instrument with one genetic variant, the causal effect was estimated using the Wald ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lawlor et al., 2008</xref>). For GDF15, where two genetic variants comprised the genetic instrument, an inverse-variance weighted (IVW) linear regression was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bowden et al., 2015</xref>).

The residuals of proteins and methylation values after adjustment for key covariates were used for this analysis. That is, for protein RFU, residuals after adjustment for sex and study site, and for methylation residual after adjustment for sex, study site, batch, and percentage of neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils were used. For all age-associated proteins, DNA methylation site (CpGs) positioned 10 kb within each gene (cis-CpG) were tested for association with age. Enrichment of age-associated CpG was tested using fisher’s exact test. The age-associated CpG identified were used in subsequent mediation analyses. In the first step, age-associated proteins were identified by regressing protein residuals on age using a linear regression model. In the second step, age-associated CpG methylation was identified by regressing methylation residuals on age using a linear model. In the final step, a linear model regressing protein residual on age adjusting for methylation residuals was tested. Significance of the mediation effect was tested using the Sobel test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sobel, 1982</xref>). A non-significant direct effect of age on protein in the final model (adjusted for methylation) was considered as complete mediation, while a significant direct effect in the final model was considered as partial mediation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proteomic signature of age</title><p>A predicted proteomic age (<italic>PROage</italic>) signature was constructed as a linear combination of the regression coefficients for 76 proteins from the penalized regression model that was previously published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tanaka et al., 2018</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well-written article that analyzes a proteomics data set of a large number of individuals and conduct several analyses to identify protein biomarkers of aging, mortality and aging related diseases. They also integrate the result with genetic and other data. The work adds to the growing field of biomarkers of aging and related diseases. There are, however, some concerns about statistical methods used that need attention before the manuscript can be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A general concern is that it is not clear what the authors controlled in various hypothesis tests. Different names and possibly different methods were presented for statistical significances as &quot;FDR&quot;, &quot;FDR-q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;, &quot;P&quot;, &quot;pfdr&quot;, &quot;FDR_P&quot;, and so on. Multiple testing correction was not likely applied in some analyses, for examples, mediation analysis and Mendelian randomization. It would be much easier to understand the results if only one method, e.g. B-H FDR, and label was used for all analyses.</p><p>2) The authors report an analysis of sex specific aging proteins. It would be important to replicate the results in an independent population. The interval study should have data to replicate the sex-specific aging signature.</p><p>3) Mediation by methylation. This analysis is interesting but there are some points that need clarification. Specifically, how did the author test for the enrichment of the age-associated CpG within 10 kb of aging proteins? Also, was the mediation tested only for CpG sites near genes, so only &quot;cis&quot; relations were tested but not &quot;trans&quot; relations? Finally, the claim about ENNP7 would be more believable if the authors show the relation between protein data versus the methylation data for this gene.</p><p>4) Association of age-related proteins with multimorbidity. A clean analysis would model the number of diseases using a Poisson regression and there is no need to run a two steps analysis, the authors could model the number of diseases over time using mixed effect models, or more easily GEE.</p><p>5) Cox proportional hazards models. The time variable of the models was not clarified. A crucial assumption of the Cox models, proportional hazards, was not checked by a test such as Schoenfeld residuals.</p><p>6) Differential protein expression across age. The plots show that the distribution of their population is not uniform over age. Their plots in Figure 6 shows a very suspicious correlation between the peak of the number of significant proteins and the larger concentration of individuals in their samples. The number of expressed proteins in a set is a function of the sample size, and the claim of the authors about the age pattern of significant proteins is not valid. The effects of the non-linear correlation were not taken into account in other analyses. Because of the effects, the adjustment for age was likely not enough for the Cox models, assuming follow-up time was the time variable. In Figure 8A, PROaccel cannot be independent from chronological age. Possibly this explains why the authors observed a significant mortality association in the older group only. At least quadratic effects of age, possibly higher orders, should be considered.</p><p>7) Proteomic signature of age. First, the authors have a proteomic score of age, not a signature, which is essentially a set with patterns. In addition, the analysis of negative and positive residuals is not valid statistically. The authors should use an interval about the predicted chronological age, and then define the groups of slower and faster age based on their statistically significant difference from the predicted age.</p><p>8) Pathway enrichment analysis. Some pathways were presented to be overrepresented in the set without any detailed information of the analysis. Background set and annotated sets for each pathway should be described possibly in a table.</p><p>9) It is not apparent which part of the findings or observations were new. It seems some parts e.g. aging signatures with 76 proteins, were supportive replications of previous findings of the authors or others. Any discussion about novel findings would be helpful to understand the significance of this paper.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Plasma proteomic biomarker signature of age predicts health and life span&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed and discussed among the reviewers and the Reviewing Editor and Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>We believe the manuscript has improved but some concerns were still raised that are listed below. These needs to be taken into consideration before the paper can be accepted for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) It seems the authors simply replaced those various labels with &quot;B-H FDR&quot;. Hence, some values in the columns &quot;B-H FDR&quot; cannot be correct. For example, the values of &quot;B-H FDR&quot; are identical to &quot;p&quot; in Supplementary file 1B.</p><p>2) No violation of the proportional hazards assumption should be clearly stated in the manuscript. As only the global p-value was given in the response, it is not clear whether the authors had checked the significance of every variable in their Cox model or not.</p><p>3) The text &quot;did not affect the results&quot; is too vague. It should be clearly stated with more explanation about the model and results.</p><p>4) All genes should not be used as the background reference because those included the genes for the proteins the authors didn't measure at all. When all genes were used as the reference set, such enrichment analysis likely identifies the enrichment among the 1301 measured proteins, which were proteins in plasma, comparing to all proteins. This explains why the authors found strong enrichments of inflammatory pathways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61073.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A general concern is that it is not clear what the authors controlled in various hypothesis tests.

We initially ran a mixed effects model for the first step for the trajectories of multimorbidity. Therefore, we ran a LASSO variable selection using glmmLasso. However, using this approach we had convergence issues. We therefore took the approach of initially extracting the slope from the mixed model then running a linear model. The results from single protein analysis are comparable between the two-step analysis and single mixed model results therefore we opted to present this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Cox proportional hazards models.

A crucial assumption of the Cox models, proportional hazards, was not checked by a test such as Schoenfeld residuals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the descriptions of the models were lacking. We have clarified the time variable in the Materials and methods section. Before the analysis, we tested the proportionality of the hazards assumption in the base model with covariates age, sex, and site, and found that these assumptions were not violated (global p=0.48).</p><p>“In order to explore the association of protein with all-cause mortality, using follow-up time to death as the time variable”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Differential protein expression across age. The plots show that the distribution of their population is not uniform over age. Their plots in Figure 6 shows a very suspicious correlation between the peak of the number of significant proteins and the larger concentration of individuals in their samples. The number of expressed proteins in a set is a function of the sample size, and the claim of the authors about the age pattern of significant proteins is not valid.

At least quadratic effects of age, possibly higher orders, should be considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these comments, and we agree that our population by design is weighted with subjects that are older and may not be the ideal population to test for this question. However, we wanted to see if we can observe similar trends that were reported by Lehallier et al. as we found these results to be fascinating. We did observe a similar peak in the 8<sup>th</sup> decade but not the younger peaks. We do consider issues of power due to sample size at younger ages and include this as a limitation in our analysis in the text.</p><p>“There were no clear waves in the younger ages, however our study may have been limited in identifying a wave in ages before 60 due to the small sample size resulting from the sampling design in the InCHIANTI study.”</p><p>We included mortality analysis with both quadratic and cubic age effects and the results were unchanged. We included this discussion in the Results section.</p><p>“To account for non-linear effects, inclusion of quadratic and/or cubic effects of age did not affect the results.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Proteomic signature of age. First, the authors have a proteomic score of age, not a signature, which is essentially a set with patterns. In addition, the analysis of negative and positive residuals is not valid statistically. The authors should use an interval about the predicted chronological age, and then define the groups of slower and faster age based on their statistically significant difference from the predicted age.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that signature may not be the most accurate description of what we are describing. However, to keep consistency from our previous publication, we would prefer to keep the reference to a “signature” in this new manuscript.</p><p>In regards to the use of residuals, we agree that the residuals will not have any biological significance in the training set, as these are random variables with a mean of 0. However, this is only true if all sources of variability in the outcomes measures are considered in the in the regression. Here, we hypothesize that some of the residual variability is related to an unobserved variable that is the “non chronological rate of aging”. Thus, the residuals (or alternatively the difference between the predicted and chronological age) carry some biological meaning. In this manuscript we show that those who are younger in proteomic age compared to chronological age do better than those who are older. We implemented this strategy to complement many papers working on “aging clocks” including the epigenetic clocks. Since the clock is tuned on chronological age, getting an interval around the predicted age and seeing whether the predicted age is significantly lower or higher than the actual age would be difficult since the proteomic clock predicts age with high accuracy, there will probably not be many people who would fall into the slower or faster aging group. This begs the question of whether chronological age is the correct variable for tuning the clock and obtaining information on biological age. This is something that our group is actively discussing, and we are in the process of creating other scores that may capture rates of non-chronological aging more effectively. This is an important point that we discuss in the text.</p><p>“This would suggest that creating a proteomic signature of aging phenotypes, rather than chronological age, could result in a more robust proteomic biomarker for aging and should be explored in future studies.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Pathway enrichment analysis. Some pathways were presented to be overrepresented in the set without any detailed information of the analysis. Background set and annotated sets for each pathway should be described possibly in a table.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this missing information. We have now altered the text in the Materials and methods section to describe the background set used for enrichment analysis and included supplemental tables (Supplementary file 1E) corresponding to the pathway enrichment figures (Figures 4A and 5A) that contain detailed information regarding the pathway names, annotations, statistics, source databases, statistics, total genes, and observed genes.</p><p>“Pathway enrichment, network analysis, and visualization</p><p>Gene ontology, pathway, and network analysis was performed using the ClueGO package, version 2.5.6, in Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), version 3.7.2 (74, 75). Curated pathways for enrichment analysis were referenced from the following databases: WikiPathways, and Kegg pathways, and Reactome. Pathways were required to have a minimum of three observed proteins. Some redundant or duplicate pathways appearing from multiple source databases were omitted manually. For background reference, the total number of genes associated with all terms included in the ontology source were used. Tables containing the pathways, observed molecules, reference pathway annotations, statistics, and source databases are included as a supplemental table (Supplementary file 1E). The statistical cutoff for enriched pathways was Bonferroni-step-down-adjusted p-values &lt;0.001 by right-sided hypergeometric testing. Pathway-connecting edges were drawn for kappa scores &gt;40%. Kappa scores are a measure of inter-pathway agreement among observed proteins that indicate whether pathway agreement is greater than expected by chance based on shared proteins. Pathways with the same color indicate ≥50% similarity in terms.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) It is not apparent which part of the findings or observations were new. It seems some parts e.g. aging signatures with 76 proteins, were supportive replications of previous findings of the authors or others. Any discussion about novel findings would be helpful to understand the significance of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. One of the most exciting findings is that measures of proteins (either single proteins or multiple proteins) were associated with longitudinal health outcomes that are considered putative phenotypic metrics of aging (multimorbidity and death). We explore one molecular mechanisms of age-associated differences in protein levels by using methylation data. In addition, also leveraged publicly available genetic data to explore further the relationship between age-associated protein and aging disease. We have summarized this in the first paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>“A proteomic analysis of chronological age was conducted to identify individuals who are experiencing accelerated health deterioration with aging based on their proteomic profile. The proteomic analysis identified 651 age-associated plasma proteins, many of which had a strong age-relationship independent of the presence of chronic diseases. Many of these proteins were previously described, 224 additional novel age-associated proteins are reported in the InCHIANTI study. Sex-stratified analysis showed that for most proteins, age-associations were similar in men and women. Proteins that systematically change with aging are also biomarkers of health longitudinally and risk biomarkers for mortality and accumulation of multi-morbidity over time in all subjects as well in persons that appear to be healthy by being free of any chronic diseases at the time of the evaluation. Analysis of DNA methylation data showed that methylation is one of the molecular mechanisms of age-associated differences in protein expression. Exploration of publicly available genetic data to assess the genetic relationship between age-associated protein and aging disease supported the clinical importance of these proteins. Finally, age acceleration measure using proteomic signature of age, which can be interpreted as a proxy measure for biological age, is associated with comorbidity and predicts future rate of change in multi-morbidity as well as all-cause mortality over a 18-year follow-up period.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>1) It seems the authors simply replaced those various labels with &quot;B-H FDR&quot;.

As only the global p-value was given in the response, it is not clear whether the authors had checked the significance of every variable in their Cox model or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We had not checked the proportionality assumption for each model. However, we agree with the reviewer that this is an important step in ensuring the validity of the results. We included a test for proportionality for each model and included this information in Figure 4—source data 1. Of the 651 proteins tested, there was a violation for 26 proteins. For these proteins, the follow-up time interval was split into two (at the median) or three (1<sup>st</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter) based on the plot of the Schoenfeld residuals. Then a stratified analysis was conducted by including an interaction terms between time interval and proteins. Interestingly, the associations were only observed in the early time interval. These results are submitted as Figure 4—source data 2 and described in the text. The details are outlines in the Materials and methods, and the results changed to reflect the changes as shown below:</p><p>“The association of age-associated proteins with all-cause mortality was tested with cox proportional hazards model. Of the 651 age-associated proteins in the InCHIANTI study, the model for 26 proteins violated the proportional hazards assumption. Of the remaining 625 proteins, 497 proteins were associated with all-cause mortality and 193 of them remained significantly associated with mortality after adjusting for covariates (age, sex, study site) (Figure 4—source data 1). For the 26 proteins where the proportional hazard assumption was not met, stratified analyses showed that 25 of the proteins were predictive of all-cause mortality in the first time interval of 12 or 15 years (Figure 4—source data 2).”</p><p>“Association of protein with all-cause mortality was analyzed using follow-up time to death as the time variable. Cox proportional hazard models were assessed adjusting for covariates (age, sex, and study site) using the coxph function from the survival package For each fully adjusted model, the proportional hazards assumption was tested by examining the correlation of scaled Schoenfeld residuals against time using the cox.zph function. A global p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered a violation of proportional hazard assumption (26 proteins). For these proteins, a stratified analysis was conducted by splitting the follow-up period into two or three intervals and including an interaction term between protein and time-interval strata in the model. Based on the plot of the Schoenfeld residuals versus transformed time, follow-up time was split into two intervals at the mean follow-up year (15 years) for 18 proteins, and into 3 intervals for at 12 and 18 years (1st and 3rd quarter) for the remaining 8 proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The text &quot;did not affect the results&quot; is too vague. It should be clearly stated with more explanation about the model and results.</p></disp-quote><p>We included a clearer statement about the changes in the model and results when non-linear effects were accounted for.</p><p>“ The association of PROaccel remained significant and the point estimate remained at an annual change of 0.03 after account for non-linear effects with the inclusion of quadratic and/or cubic term for age in the model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) All genes should not be used as the background reference because those included the genes for the proteins the authors didn't measure at all. When all genes were used as the reference set, such enrichment analysis likely identifies the enrichment among the 1301 measured proteins, which were proteins in plasma, comparing to all proteins. This explains why the authors found strong enrichments of inflammatory pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have performed new pathway over-representation analysis using the 1301 protein SOMAscan panel as a background reference instead of the entire human proteome. We appreciate the reviewer’s request for this re-analysis as it has significantly impacted the pathways. The new analysis remains enriched with inflammation pathways, albeit reduced from the previous analysis, and has highlighted several new pathways involved in regulation of gene expression. We have revised the supplemental table (Supplementary file 1E), figures (Figures 4A and 5A) and text, including the Results and Materials and methods sections, to reflect the new changes, summarized below:</p><p>“Among the proteins that were associated with age, there was an enrichment for inflammatory pathways (TNF-activated receptor activity and chemokine receptor binding), regulation of gene expression (DNA methylation, meiosis, epigenetic regulation of gene expression), and extracellular matrix (activation of matrix metalloproteinases, basement membrane, extracellular matrix organization) (Figure 4A).”</p><p>“Morbidity-associated proteins were strongly enriched for inflammatory pathways (interleukin-7 signaling, cytokine receptor interaction, senescence-associated secretory phenotype), regulation of IGF transport and uptake by IGFBPs, regulation of gene expression (HDMs demethylate histones, meiosis, SIRT1 negatively regulates rRNA, histone modifications, DNA methylation), and amyloid fiber formation (Figure 5A).”</p><p>“Pathway enrichment, and visualization</p><p>Gene set over-representation analyses were performed using the ConsensusPathDB-human tool, release 34 (15.01.2019)(70). Curated pathways for enrichment analysis were referenced from the following databases: Gene Ontology, WikiPathways, and Kegg pathways, and Reactome. Pathways were required to have a minimum of three observed proteins and a p-value &lt; 0.01. Gene ontology terms were restricted to levels 3-5. For morbidity-associated proteins (Figure 5A), all pathways with enrichment q-values &lt; 0.05 were kept, and the top 25 pathways were plotted. For mortality- associated proteins (Figure 4A), all pathways with enrichment q-values &lt; 0.25 were kept. One duplicate named pathway appearing from multiple source databases was omitted manually. For background reference, a list of all 1301 proteins measured in the SOMAscan assay were used. Tables containing the pathways, observed corresponding proteins, reference pathway annotations, statistics, and source databases are included as a Supplementary file (Supplementary file 1E).</p><p>Heatmaps and dotplots were generated in R with the “ggplot2” package (70) and by comparing with SASP profiles on SASP Atlas (21) (www.saspatlas.com).
