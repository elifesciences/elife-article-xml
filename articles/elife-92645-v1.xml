incomplete. Analysis of serum exosomal small RNA sequencing data from clinical patients and gene expression data from OA patient serum and cartilage obtained from the GEO database revealed a common dysregulated miRNA, miR-199b-5p. In vitro cell experiments demonstrated that miR-199b-5p inhibits chondrocyte vitality and promotes extracellular matrix degradation. Conversely, inhibition of miR-199b-5p under inflammatory conditions exhibited protective effects against damage. Local viral injection of miR-199b-5p into mice induced a decrease in pain threshold and OA-like changes. In an OA model, inhibition of miR-199b-5p alleviated the pathological progression of OA. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis and experimental validation identified <italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> as potential target genes of <italic>MiR-199b-5p</italic>. Thus, these results indicated that <italic>MiR-199b-5p</italic>/<italic>Gcnt2</italic> and <italic>Fzd6</italic> axis might be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of OA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>extracellular matrix</kwd><kwd>miRNA-199b-5p</kwd><kwd>animal</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFC1709000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Shu-Guang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFC3500703</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qiao-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fund of Science and Technology Department of Sichuan Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZDZX0033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qiao-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Xinglin Scholar Foundation of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QNTD2022003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qiao-Feng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serum exosomal sequencing combined with cell and animal experiments indicate that miRNA-199b-5p is a novel miRNA associated with osteoarthritis (OA) and can modulate the onset and progression of the disease.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease characterized by the deterioration of articular cartilage and affecting all components of the joint, including the synovium, subchondral bone, and meniscus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Knee OA (KOA) is the leading cause of disability and increased living costs among elderly patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hunter and Osteoarthritis, 2019</xref>). Currently, the treatment options for osteoarthritis are limited to symptomatic relief and joint replacement. However, the insufficient relief of symptoms, potential medication side effects, and the economic burden and complications associated with joint replacement surgeries have prompted the need to identify new, effective, and safe treatment methods and explore unknown targets for individuals with KOA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ito et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Exosomes are extracellular vesicles that are distributed in body fluids such as serum and play a crucial biological role by delivering molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). They serve as vital carriers for intercellular communication and transfer of genetic information. miRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs ranging from 18 to 24 nucleotides in length, which exert inhibitory effects on the expression of target genes through interactions with mRNA. Studies have demonstrated that miRNAs play a crucial role as a pathogenic factor in OA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2021</xref>). For instance, miR-199b-5p was found to contribute to the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) another miR-140 showed cartilage-specific expression, and its expression was significantly reduced in OA cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Miyaki et al., 2009</xref>). Recently, intra-articular injection of antisense oligonucleotides of miR-181a-5p produced chondroprotective effects in OA mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakamura et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we initially screened miR-199b-5p as a potential key miRNA based on clinical data by detecting differentially expressed exosomal miRNAs. To elucidate the role and function of miR-199b-5p, we investigated its impact on chondrocytes and identified its molecular targets through in vitro experiments. Furthermore, we explored its role in vivo. Hence, this article not only identifies miR-199b-5p as a potential micro-target for KOA but also provides a potential strategy for future identification of new molecular drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and enrichment analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs in serum exosomes</title><p>To investigate the dysregulated miRNAs in serum exosomes of KOA patients, we extracted exosomal miRNAs from serum and performed sequencing. Serum samples from 15 patients with KOA and 10 healthy subjects were collected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Supplement table 2). After extraction, the serum exosomes were observed under transmission electron microscopy and nanoparticle tracking analysis, revealing a diameter ranging from approximately 70–150 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Furthermore, the surface marker proteins CD9, CD63, and CD81 were found to be expressed on the exosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we performed sequencing of miRNAs in serum exosomes.</p><p>The results showed that 88 miRNAs were up-regulated and 89 miRNAs were downregulated in KOA patients compared with the control group based on fold change &gt;1.5 and p&lt;0.05 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Afterwards, we performed bioinformatics Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses on these differentially expressed miRNA. Among the top five enriched results of up-regulated differentially expressed miRNAs, the CC (Cell GO:0044297, intracellular GO:0005622, and cytoplasm GO:0005737) GO terms were notable. The MF (Translation activator activity GO:0008494, binding to ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes GO:0031624, and possessing transferase activity GO:0016740) GO terms, and BP (Cell differentiation GO:0045595 and the stabilization of mRNA through 3'-UTR mediation GO:0070935) GO terms were also significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The top 10 enriched KEGG pathways, PI3K-AKT signaling, Ras signaling, apoptosis, and other types of O-glycan biosynthesis are considered to be of significant importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The analysis of the top five down-regulated differential miRNAs reveals interesting findings. the CC (Cell GO:0005623, intracellular GO:0005622) GO terms were particularly noteworthy.

The protocol was approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (2019–04). After randomization, the KOA mouse model was established by orthotopic injection of MIA (sigma) into the knee joint of mice. After the animals were anesthetized with isoflurane in a small animal anesthesia machine, the right knee joint of the mouse was shaved, the knee joint was flexed 90°, and 10 μL of MIA solution was injected into the knee joint cavity using a 28 G microsyringe. The syringe needle was slowly withdrawn and the knee joint was gently moved. Baseline testing of behavioral pain thresholds was conducted prior to model establishment. After the model was established, the behavioral pain threshold testing was on days 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28 after model establishment. After the 3rd day and 14th day after the start of the experiment, the experimental mice were injected with adenovirus (total volume 10 μL) in the knee joint, and the control mice were injected with empty adenovirus as a control (Hanbio tech, Shanghai, China) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Choi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Thermal pain threshold detection</title><p>A pain threshold detection instrument was used to measure the latency of the right plantar leg raising reflex of mice under heat radiation. Three days before the experiment, mice were cut off from water for half a day and adapted to the environment for 1 hr. A certain intensity of pyrogen was used to irradiate the plantar position of the mouse’s right limb, and a machine was used to automatically record the time when the mouse moved the limb from thermal pain. The resting intensity of the thermal pain stimulator was set to 10%, and the maximum duration was set to 20 s to avoid prolonged heating and burning of skin. After the light source is aimed at the sole of the mouse, we observed the mouse in real-time. If paw raising, paw licking, or paw retraction was observed, the irradiation was stopped and the irradiation time of the instrument was recorded. The right limb of each mouse was tested five times, with an interval of 10 min each time; outliers were eliminated, and the average value was calculated and included in the statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cheah et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ELISA and μCT scanning</title><p>Mice were sacrificed after four weeks, and serum was collected for ELISA assay (Jiangsu Jingmei Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Yancheng, China).

We acknowledge that a comprehensive identification of extracellular vesicles should include both positive and negative samples. However, in some of the initial studies we referenced, the positive and negative control were not mentioned1;2. In our study, we identified extracellular vesicles using a combination of electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, and marker detection of exosomes. We agree that having negative samples would make our results more convincing, and we will include a negative control group in our future experiments. Additionally, we have provided clearer images in the revised version. (supplemental fig1 A)</p><p>Reference</p><p>(1) Ying W, Riopel M, Bandyopadhyay G, et al.

Figure 2 legend did not clearly elucidate what those represent and why the authors chose those five miRNAs to further validate although they did mention it with several words in line 108 'based on the p-value and exosomal'.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, our study included two additional groups: the acupuncture treatment group (4 weeks of continuous acupuncture treatment) and the waiting treatment group (no intervention, followed by acupuncture treatment after 4 weeks), in addition to the healthy control and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patient groups. After comparing these four groups, we found that 11 genes (hsa-miR-504-3p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-887-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-34c-3p, hsa-miR-3168, hsa-miR-518e-3p, hsa-miR-1296-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-199b-5p) were upregulated in KOA patients but downregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Additionally, 7 genes (hsa-miR-448, hsa-miR-514a-3p, hsa-miR-4440, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7d-5p, and hsa-miR-15b-3p) were downregulated in KOA patients but upregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Considering the improvement in clinical symptoms of KOA patients after acupuncture treatment, we believe that these 18 genes are of significant value. Based on overall expression abundance and species specificity, we finally selected 5 genes, namely the 5 genes mentioned in this article. Regarding this result, we have already included it in the supplementary fig5(fig. S5).</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Venn diagram showing differentially expressed miRNAs in the OA group compared with healthy patients and patients who recovered after acupuncture treatment.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92645-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 3 legend and methods, the authors did not mention how they performed the cell viability assay.

In Figure 3, cell viability was determined using the CCK-8 assay. We used second-generation chondrocytes for this analysis. The chondrocytes were obtained from young mice aged 3-5 days after birth. The cartilage tissues were extracted, and the cells were cultured in complete medium after digestion with collagenase. The detailed description of the cell viability assay, cell culture procedures, specific timing, and treatment methods of the cells used can be found in our revised manuscript. (page14-15，line304-313)</p><p>Besides, we have made thorough revisions to all figure legends to provide a clearer explanation of the relevant content.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors claimed that Gcnt2 and Fzd6 are two target genes of miR-199b-5p. However, there is no convincing evidence such as western blot to support their bioinformatics prediction.</p></disp-quote><p>In the current study, we first identified six potential target genes by intersecting the predicted targets obtained from six bioinformatics websites. Subsequently, q-PCR was employed to test all six genes, revealing two genes with significant changes, namely Fzd6 and Gcnt2. We then predicted the binding sites of these genes and validated their existence through luciferase assays. Moreover, we examined the expression of these two potential targets in human KOA samples using a human database and found them to be expressed specifically in the samples. These results suggest that Fzd6 and Gcnt2 are potential target genes for KOA. However, we didn’t do western blot assay to verify the results. Based on your suggestions, we have further discussed the limitations of our study in this regard and proposed future research strategies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) To verify the binding site on 3'UTR of two potential targets, the authors designed a mouse sequence for luciferase assay, but not sure if it is the same when using a human sequence.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank for your great advice. We carried out the comparative analysis of sequence conservatism between human and mouse, and find the binding site on 3'UTR matches to human sequence very well. The sequence conservation between hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p was as high as 95.65%. We added the methods and results in the revised manuscript. (page9, line181-184; page17, line361-365) (supplemental fig6).</p><p>In detail: Firstly, the sequence information of mmu_miRNA-199b-5p was used to locate the human homologous sequence in the UCSC database. The homologous sequence was found to be located in the human genome at chr9:128244721-128244830 (supplemental fig6 A). Based on this positional information and the source gene, a further comparison was conducted in miRbase to identify the nearest miRNA at the position of the human genome. It was discovered that hsa_miR-199b-5p is positionally conserved and located at chr9:128244721-128244830 (supplemental fig6 B). The sequence of hsa_miR-199b-5p was obtained from the miRbase database (supplemental fig6 C), and a comparative analysis was performed between the sequences of humans and mouse (supplemental fig6 D). Besides being positionally conserved, the sequence conservation between hsa_miR-199b-5p and mmu_miR-199b-5p was as high as 95.65%, indicating a good sequence conservation.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparative analysis of sequence conservatism between human and mouse.</title><p>(A) The position of its human homologous sequence in the UCSC database.

While this study has the potential to provide valuable knowledge to the fields of miRNAs and joint diseases, significant improvements in several areas are required.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your constructive comments, and we have made a substantial improvement to the manuscript. We thank all the reviewers for their advice as well as their criticisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>(1) According to the Authors, miR-199b-5p is identified by the results from their own miRNA-sequencing as well as comparison with other publicly available datasets (both synovium and cartilage datasets). It is unclear to me why the synovium dataset was used here as it appears that the entire manuscript was mainly focused on chondrocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your question. As we are aware, cartilage degradation is the initial pathological change in knee osteoarthritis (KOA), which subsequently leads to other pathological changes such as synovial inflammation4. These factors are interrelated, and current research on KOA encompasses cartilage, synovium, and system inflammation et al. Therefore, when we identified a large number of dysregulated miRNAs in extracellular vesicles isolated from serum, it was crucial to determine whether these dysregulated miRNAs were also altered in cartilage or synovium. To address this, we compared our findings with publicly available databases and found a higher overlap with the cartilage cell dataset, including miRNA-199b. Consequently, we decided to focus our subsequent investigations on cartilage-related research.</p><p>Reference</p><p>(4) Hunter D, Bierma-Zeinstra S. Osteoarthritis. Lancet (London, England). 2019;393(10182):1745-1759.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Also, 169 of 177 differentially expressed exosome miRNAs were intersected with differentially expressed miRNAs from OA cartilage datasets. It is surprising that in the 5 selected miRNAs for further qRT-PCR validation, 3 out of 5 were not in the exosome miRNA dataset (i.e., hsa-mir-1296-5p, hsa-mir-15b-3p, and hsa-mir-338-3p; page 5, line 109 and Fig. 1B). Isn't that selecting the miRNAs that both differently expressed in exosome and cartilage datasets for validation more essential? Furthermore, from the Authors' exosome miRNA dataset, only 5 out of 15 KOA patients actually exhibited up-regulated miR-199b-5p vs. health controls. Please elaborate on how the target was determined.</p></disp-quote><p>In fact, our study included two additional groups: the acupuncture treatment group (4 weeks of continuous acupuncture treatment) and the waiting treatment group (no intervention, followed by acupuncture treatment after 4 weeks), in addition to the healthy control and knee osteoarthritis (OA) patient groups. After comparing these four groups, we found that 11 genes (hsa-miR-504-3p, hsa-miR-1915-3p, hsa-miR-103a-2-5p, hsa-miR-887-3p, hsa-miR-1228-5p, hsa-miR-34c-3p, hsa-miR-3168, hsa-miR-518e-3p, hsa-miR-1296-5p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-199b-5p) were upregulated in KOA patients but downregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Additionally, 7 genes (hsa-miR-448, hsa-miR-514a-3p, hsa-miR-4440, hsa-let-7f-5p, hsa-let-7a-5p, hsa-let-7d-5p, and hsa-miR-15b-3p) were downregulated in KOA patients but upregulated after acupuncture treatment, with no change in the waiting treatment group. Considering the improvement in clinical symptoms of KOA patients after acupuncture treatment, we believe that these 18 genes are of significant value. Based on overall expression abundance and species specificity, we finally selected 5 genes, namely the 5 genes mentioned in this article. Regarding this result, we have already included it in the supplementary fig5(fig. S5).</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Venn diagram showing differentially expressed miRNAs in the OA group compared with healthy patients and patients who recovered after acupuncture treatment.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92645-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There is also a lack of description for bioinformatic analysis regarding how miRNA sequencing datasets were analyzed. What R/python packages or algorithms were used? What were the QC criteria?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any confusion caused. We have now included a clear description of the method employed, and R was utilized for this data analysis (revised in Page14, Line301-305). To ensure consistency, we compared our findings with publicly available human serum data from the database (GSE105027) using a fold change threshold of &gt; 1.5 and a significance level of p &lt; 0.05. In the cartilage data (GSE175961), we observed a list of miRNAs with shared expression patterns, yet the precise differential values could not be determined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Another major concern is the chondrocyte culture method. Chondrocytes should be cultured in a 3D manner (i.e., a 3D pellet culture system or a micro mass culture method). 2D cultured chondrocytes tend to de-differentiate into MSC-like cells and thus lose their chondrocyte phenotype. This is evident from Fig. 3B and C. Cells started to spread out and only a few cells were positive for COL2A1 with a deep brown staining color. Thus, the results from the in vitro studies may not be representative of chondrocyte response to the treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>We admit that 3D culture system will be more accurate and reliable. However, according to Liu Qianqian et al researches3, the 2D culture systems were also used and work well. Besides, the second-generation primary mice chondrocytes we used in the current study did not exhibit a significant dedifferentiated morphology. So, considering the experiment condition in our lab, we chose the second-generation cultured primary mouse chondrocytes in the whole process of cell experiment. To show the reliability of the cells, we provided more pictures in the supplement fig 7(fig. S7) In the future study, we will adopt 3D culture system for experiments. Thank you for your advices and we have added this limitation in the revised manuscript.
