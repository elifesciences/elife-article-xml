Here, we found that regulatory T cells (Tregs) integrate concurrent signaling initiated by IL-2 and IL-4 to generate a response divergent from the sum of the two pathways in isolation. IL-4 stimulation of STAT6 phosphorylation was blocked by IL-2, while IL-2 and IL-4 synergized to enhance STAT5 phosphorylation, IL-10 production, and the selective proliferation of IL-10-producing Tregs, leading to increased inhibition of conventional T cell activation and the reversal of asthma and multiple sclerosis in mice. These data define a mechanism of combinatorial cytokine signaling and lay the foundation upon which to better understand the origins of cytokine pleiotropy while informing improved the clinical use of cytokines.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system is essential to defend our bodies from attacks of microbial invaders. It contains many types of cells that communicate with each other through proteins called cytokines. Cytokines act as messages that can promote or suppress the immune response. Since several types of immune cells can exist within the same environment, many different signals are sent simultaneously, from which each individual cell must tease out the correct message. So far, it has been unclear how cells decode simultaneous messages, which may be key for improving therapeutics for inflammatory diseases.</p><p>To investigate this, Zhou et al. studied the effect of two cytokines (IL-2 and IL-4) on a major type of suppressive immune cell called regulatory T cell or Treg. This revealed that when Tregs grown in the laboratory were simultaneously exposed to IL-2 and IL-4, the cytokine duo boosted the production of new Tregs much more than using either cytokine alone. Together, the cytokines also increased the production of another cytokine (IL-10), and over time, Treg cells producing IL-10 divided more frequently, leading to an even more robust ability to suppress overactive immune responses.</p><p>Zhou et al. then validated the experiments in cells using mouse models of asthma and multiple sclerosis. Treatment with an IL-2 and IL-4 cytokine cocktail not only prevented but reversed the symptoms of the diseases to a greater extent than either cytokine alone, suggesting that this could be a significantly improved therapy for patients affected by these conditions.</p><p>This study provides important insights into how cytokines can work together to substantially improve the activity of immune cells and reduce inflammation. It also introduces a promising new treatment strategy to dampen or even eliminate a range of devastating symptoms caused by inflammatory diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>Treg</kwd><kwd>STAT5</kwd><kwd>STAT6</kwd><kwd>interleukin-4</kwd><kwd>interleukin-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM115234</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI154899</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI089474</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Julie Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Alvarez</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006792</institution-id><institution>Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cobb</surname><given-names>Brian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous cytokine signaling results in unexpected transcription factor changes that fuel a cellular response divergent from the sum of each cytokine alone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>IL-2 and IL-4 are both pleiotropic cytokines and members of a family in which Î³C (CD132) is a shared receptor subunit. These and many other cytokines have undergone intensive study because of their ubiquitous and essential roles in health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leonard et al., 2019</xref>), yet their functions can be highly divergent and context dependent.</p><p>IL-2 signals optimize effector and memory T cell responses as a part of normal immune protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyman and Sprent, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boyman et al., 2010</xref>). From a pro-inflammatory perspective, IL-2 can drive the proliferation of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morgan et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liao et al., 2013</xref>), enhance natural killer cell cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henney et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Siegel et al., 1987</xref>), and augment B cell proliferation and antibody secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mingari et al., 1984</xref>). However, IL-2 is also potently anti-inflammatory, driving Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Refaeli et al., 1998</xref>) while promoting Treg survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chinen et al., 2016</xref>), with its loss resulting in severe autoimmunity and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horak, 1995</xref>). Its pleiotropy can be partly explained by the strategic and context specific expression of its receptors, with IL-2 receptor Î± (IL-2RÎ±; CD25) being a common marker for activated conventional T cells (Tconv) as well as an established constitutive marker for Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malek, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spolski et al., 2017</xref>). CD25 is part of the high affinity receptor complex with IL-2 receptor Î² (IL-2RÎ²; CD122) and Î³C, although it can function as a low-affinity receptor in isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waldmann, 1989</xref>). An intermediate affinity IL-2R excluding CD25 is also known, and it consists of a heterodimer of IL-2RÎ² and IL-2RÎ³ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyman and Sprent, 2012</xref>). The activity of IL-2 is dependent upon JAK/STAT signaling, with STAT3 and STAT5 being the primary mediators of its transcriptional regulation of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnston et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>IL-4 has perhaps an even broader impact and has two receptor forms. The type I IL-4 receptor is comprised of IL-4 receptor Î± (IL-4RÎ±; CD124) and Î³C, whereas the type II receptor contains IL-4RÎ± and IL-13 receptor Î±1 (IL-13RÎ±; CD213A1)Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nelms et al., 1999</xref>). Like many cytokines, signaling is mediated by the JAK/STAT pathway, with STAT6 being a main transcriptional mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hou et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gadani et al., 2012</xref>). IL-4 is historically associated with allergy through its ability to stimulate class switching to IgE and expression of the IgE receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geha et al., 2003</xref>), although it is also critical for parasite clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Urban et al., 1991</xref>) and differentiation of naÃ¯ve T cells into a type two helper (Th2) phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paul, 2015</xref>), all of which are considered pro-inflammatory. Yet, IL-4 is also a key differentiating factor for wound healing macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gordon, 2003</xref>), which is essential for tissue repair, and is known to oppose IL-17-mediated inflammatory diseases like psoriasis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogelgesang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weigert et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, IL-4R signaling has been shown to inhibit neutrophil effector functions in vivo, which pertains to inflammatory diseases where significant neutrophil infiltrates are found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woytschak et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Impellizzieri et al., 2019</xref>). In fact, IL-4 has been shown to elicit IL-10 in both macrophages and T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krzyszczyk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell et al., 2017</xref>), helping to explain how IL-4 is also potently anti-inflammatory.</p><p>Although much is known about the signaling initiated by these and most other cytokines, understanding of how multiple cytokine signals integrate in complex environments remains limited. For many cytokines, the JAK/STAT cascades underlie their transcriptional impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rawlings et al., 2004</xref>), although a small number of JAK and STAT proteins belies the divergent nature of the responses. STAT homo- and hetero-multimerization is one mechanism that exponentially expands the available transcription outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Shea et al., 2015</xref>). There is also evidence that cytokines can lead to the transcriptional enhancement or diminution of the signaling machinery for other cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin and Leonard, 2019</xref>). For example, IL-2 stimulation drives the expression of IL-4RÎ±, thereby enhancing subsequent responses to IL-4 through serial activation of STAT5 and STAT6, respectively, ultimately leading to Th2 T cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhu et al., 2001</xref>). This is additive signaling, whereby the canonical pathways act in concert to drive T cell differentiation, and follows our knowledge of each pathway in isolation. These mechanisms partially explain how a small number of STAT molecules can drive diverse cellular outputs, but do not account for the possibility of simultaneous stimulation that may occur in the complex array of cytokines that exist in any biological environment.</p><p>Here, we have discovered that the combination of IL-2 and IL-4 stimulation in Tregs culminates in a synergistic enhancement of Treg function and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. This effect is driven by a uniquely integrated response requiring simultaneous rather than serial stimulation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism underlying cytokine signaling which can drive unexpected outcomes that are differential to the simple combination of pathways, thereby laying the groundwork for a more complete picture of cytokine pleiotropy and potentially leading to enhancements to the use of cytokines in the clinical setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-2 and IL-4 synergistically promote IL-10 production by Tregs</title><p>Our previous findings demonstrated that IL-4 impacts IL-10 production in FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2019</xref>), but the nature of the functional interaction between IL-4 and IL-2, a key survival factor for Tregs in vitro and in vivo, remained obscure. Thus, we created a novel dual reporter mouse by crossing <italic>Foxp3<sup>RFP</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wan and Flavell, 2005</xref>) and <italic>Il10<sup>GFP</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kamanaka et al., 2006</xref>) mice, thereby enabling live sorting of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells and analysis of IL-10 production on a per-cell basis. CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs isolated from the spleens of naÃ¯ve dual reporter mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AÂ andÂ B</xref>) by magnetic bead and sterile fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) were cultured with T cell receptor (TCR) activation using Î±CD3Îµ antibody and all combinations of IL-2 and IL-4 for 3 days. We found that Tregs cultured with combinatorial cytokine stimulation resulted in synergistically higher numbers of IL-10 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>) and IL-10 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) compared to single cytokine stimulation. However, analysis of IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells revealed that IL-10 expression as measured by GFP median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was equivalent between IL-2 and IL-2 with IL-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that the cytokines in combination do not elicit a synergistic increase in IL-10 production on a per-cell basis. The sex-independent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and TCR-stimulation-dependent synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâD</xref>) was present in FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs but not FoxP3<sup>-</sup> Tconv (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and no loss of FoxP3 expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that the machinery required for this effect was unique to FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs. Notably, neither titration of IL-2 concentration from 0.01-fold to 100-fold nor supplementing with Î±CD28 co-stimulation changed the synergistic and robust effect the combination of IL-2 and IL-4 (IL-2/IL-4) had on IL-10 production by Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AÂ andÂ B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IL-2 and IL-4 synergistically promote IL-10 production by Tregs.</title><p>(<bold>AâC</bold>) IL-10 expression of Tregs purified from <italic>Foxp3<sup>RFP</sup></italic>/<italic>Il10<sup>GFP</sup></italic> dual reporter mice (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>) cultured for 3 days with the designated stimulants as analyzed by flow cytometry.Â The IL-2/IL-4 condition is twofold the concentration of the single cytokines.

Looking at the IL-4 receptor subunits, the IL-4RÎ± expression pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) mirrored that observed for the Î³C chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), with a positive correlation with IL-10 for the individual cytokines, but less so with the combination.

Since the type II IL-4R is used by both IL-4 and IL-13, we tested whether IL-13 could achieve the same synergistic Treg outcome as IL-4 in combination with IL-2. Supplementation of Treg cultures with recombinant IL-13 in any combination with IL-2 and IL-4 did not impact IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5GÂ andÂ H</xref>), suggesting that the response is specific for IL-4.

In order to determine whether IL-10-IL-10R autocrine signaling may also be playing a role in synergistic IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we blocked the IL-10R via neutralizing antibody at two concentrations. We found a profound loss of IL-10 expression downstream of IL-2/IL-4 on a per-cell basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>), but only a modest decrease in proliferation using high concentrations of the IL-10R antibody compared to isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Mechanistically, previous studies have shown that two cytokines can cooperate by sharing the same STAT proteins to either enhance or interfere with the other to form a different outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin and Leonard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnston et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liao et al., 2011</xref>), thereby demonstrating the importance of understanding how cytokines may influence each other. While our study focuses on Tregs, others have reported optimal differentiation of Th2 cells with sequential IL-2 and then IL-4 stimulation, which upregulates IL-4RÎ± and is mediated by combined STAT5 and STAT6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cote-Sierra et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhu et al., 2003</xref>). Compared to sequential nature of these and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lin and Leonard, 2019</xref>), our principal findings required simultaneous stimulation by both cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Furthermore, while FoxP3<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells undergo a Th2-skewing response to IL-4 and IL-2 (52), we found that this combination failed to induce IL-10 production in FoxP3<sup>-</sup> Tconv cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) while programming FoxP3<sup>+</sup> Tregs toward an IL-10<sup>+</sup> and suppressive phenotype. Therefore, our data reveal that not only can the integration of multiple cytokine pathways diverge from the sum of the parts, the combinatorial nature is further complicated by an enormous variety of responding cell types and disease states.</p><p>Interestingly, our data indicate that simultaneous administration of IL-2 and IL-4 in vivo suppressed the severity of not only IL-17-dependent EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Komiyama et al., 2006</xref>), but also several models of murine asthma in both Th1 and Th2-skewed backgrounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gueders et al., 2009</xref>). This initially appears at odds with the notion that administration of IL-4 in asthmatic mice aggravates disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steinke and Borish, 2001</xref>). However, we found that the combination of IL-2 and IL-4 develops Tregs with highly effective suppression of IL-4 production in Tconv cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). With the loss of IL-4-driven STAT6 phosphorylation in Tregs stimulated by both cytokines, we have demonstrated that the IL-4 signal leading to STAT6 activation is dramatically inhibited upon concurrent IL-2 exposure within Tregs. This data dovetails with many reports aligning IL-4 with the suppressive activity of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thornton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pace et al., 2005</xref>) and reinforces the notion that the functional outcome of multiple cytokines is highly context dependent and may not reflect the outcome of the cytokine in isolation, leading to pleiotropy in complex systems.</p><p>The dosing of the combinatorial cytokines in this study was based off of our previously published findings detailing CD4<sup>+</sup>FoxP3<sup>-</sup>CD45Rb<sup>lo</sup> T effector/memory cell cytokine production in vitro following polysaccharide A (PSA) stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2019</xref>). Although IL-2 and IL-4 have independently shown efficacy in suppressing EAE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouse et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Racke et al., 1994</xref>), the dosing used in this paper was substantially lower. For example, IL-2 limited EAE severity using an i.v. treatment regimen of 10,000 IU/dose, three times per day, for 3 days, totaling to 90,000 IU over the course of the trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rouse et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we use a total of 2500 IU of IL-2 over the course of the trial as a therapy. For IL-4, we administered 16.24 ng (1.2 pmol) of IL-4 per dose, every other day, whereas one commonly cited study utilized 1.0 Î¼g (74.1 pmol) of IL-4 every 8 hr over the course of 11 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Racke et al., 1994</xref>). At the low doses used in the present study, IL-2 and IL-4 alone were ineffective at suppressing disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7AÂ andÂ B</xref>); however, when administered together, the cytokine combination significantly suppressed disease. This robust cytokine synergism translates into using far less cytokine to achieve therapeutic efficacy, potentially decreasing any unwanted side effects in clinical applications.</p><p>In the case of IL-2 and IL-4, the net functional result of the discovered pathway is a greatly enhanced population of immune inhibitory IL-10<sup>+</sup> Tregs. The cellular activity was potent enough to not only reduce disease prophylactically, but also reverse ongoing inflammation in both asthma and EAE models. It is therefore interesting to note that the use of both IL-2 and IL-4 appears to be a characteristic of some beneficial microbiota antigen responses. For example, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, which is native to a healthy human gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wexler and Goodman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Troy, 2010</xref>), is known to regulate the peripheral immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Johnson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ochoa-RepÃ¡raz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tzianabos et al., 1994</xref>) and even benefit the gut-brain axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiao et al., 2013</xref>) through T cell recognition of its capsular polysaccharide PSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cobb et al., 2004</xref>). It is now clear that PSA-specific effector T cells require communication with Tregs, and that immune suppression and inflammatory disease reversal depends upon both IL-4 (33, 45) and IL-2 (67), thereby providing a biological context in which the use of cytokines in combination has evolved to direct a healthy immune tone.</p><p>From a translational perspective, cytokine therapies have been limited in part due to the short half-life in circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donohue and Rosenberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conlon et al., 1989</xref>). As such, our findings suggest that IL-2- and IL-4-induced combinatorial signaling may be best harnessed for autologous Treg transfer therapies, which itself has been limited by poor expansion and survival of Tregs ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tang and Bluestone, 2013</xref>). Here, Tregs that underwent stimulation by both IL-2 and IL-4 together not only retained their activated and IL-10-producing state, but also exponentially expanded and survived for almost 2Â weeks in culture with 3 days of cytokine stimulation and 9 days of co-culture with Tconv cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M</xref>). Moreover, the IL-2 and IL-4 combination appears to re-program Tregs with a receptor expression and STAT signaling pattern that facilitates and promotes continued suppressive capacity over extended periods of time through enhanced sensitivity to both cytokines.</p><p>In conclusion, we identified a novel mechanism of cell signaling integration controlling the transcriptional and proliferative response of regulatory T cells. While this is demonstrated in T cells using only two cytokines, these findings indicate that combinatorial signaling with other cytokines and cell types is possible, and is even beginning to emerge in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karki et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, while these differences in response may underlie cytokine pleiotropy, they also provide an intriguing guide for new therapeutic applications of combinatorial cytokines in the clinical setting ranging from ex vivo support of autologous cell transfers to immune activation in cancer and inhibition for autoimmunity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C56Bl/6J</td><td>JAX</td><td>JAX 000664, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Il10</italic><sup>-/-</sup></td><td>JAX</td><td>JAX 002251, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:002251">IMSR_JAX:002251</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Il10<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td>PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15534372">15534372</ext-link>, PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28783045">28783045</ext-link></td><td>from Dr. Werner Muller via Dr. Asma Nusrat</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Foxp3<sup>creYFP</sup></italic></td><td>JAX</td><td>JAX 016959, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:016959">IMSR_JAX:016959</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Il10<sup>fl/fl</sup> x Foxp3<sup>creYFP</sup></italic> (IL-10 cKO)</td><td>This paper</td><td>JAX 016959, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:016959">IMSR_JAX:016959</ext-link> and from Dr. Werner Muller via Dr. Asma Nusrat</td><td>We crossed IL-10fl/fl mice obtained from Dr. Asma Nusrat with commercially available FoxP3-creYFP mice.

To assess the suppressive ability of a Treg on a per cell basis, Tregs were counted after stimulation and before placing in co-culture. To determine the suppressive ability of Tregs on a population level, Tregs were counted prior to stimulation so that the number of cells introduced into co-culture with Tconv reflected the proliferation induced by the cytokine conditions. CellTrace signal in Tconv cells was detected by flow cytometry after 3 days of co-culture, and secretion of cytokines was quantified by ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>EAE model of multiple sclerosis</title><p>Age-matched female mice between 11Â andÂ 23 weeks underwent EAE induction using the MOG<sub>35-55</sub>/CFA Emulsion and pertussis toxin (PTX) kit from Hooke Laboratories (Lawrence, MA) according to manufacturerâs instructions. Mice were immunized with 200 Î¼g of MOG<sub>35-55</sub>/CFA emulsion s.c. in two locations in the back on day 0 and were administered 100 ng of PTX i.p. on days 0 and 1 of the trial. Negative controls for disease received a CFA emulsion and PTX according to the same schedule.

IL-2 and IL-4 at the designated doses and time intervals were delivered i.n. in a mixed cocktail according after animals were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane (Baxter, Deerfield, IL) with an anesthesia system (VetEquip, Livermore, CA). In the chronic triple antigen combination model, mice were sensitized intraperitoneally with 20 Âµg Ovalbumin (OVA, Albumin from chicken egg white, Millipore Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany), 2.5 Âµg cockroach antigen (CRA, American, <italic>Periplaneta Americana,</italic> GREER, Lenoir, NC), and 2.5 Âµg of HDM in PBS. Immediately following sensitization, mice were challenged intranasally with HDM, CRA, or OVA in a rotating schedule for 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duechs et al., 2014</xref>). For Flexivent (SCIREQ, Montreal, Quebec) studies, mice were anesthetized with a cocktail of Ketamine/Xylazine/Acepromazine, the trachea was exposed and catheterized, andÂ methacholine was administered via nebulization in increasing doses. Airway resistance was measured on a Flexivent respirator over time. After mice were euthanized, bronchial alveolar lavage fluid (BALf) was recovered in three lavages of 1 mL each, and lung tissues underwent FFPE processing or were reduced to a single cell suspension for flow cytometric analysis. BALf cell differentials were acquired by a HemaVet 950 Hematology Analyzer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry and cell sorting</title><p>For splenic Treg cell sorting, magnetic bead-mediated positively selected CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted by endogenously expressed FoxP3<sup>RFP</sup> and/or IL-10<sup>GFP</sup>. For IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, CD4<sup>+</sup> cells were stained and sorted with CD25-PE-Cy7 (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were washed in MACS buffer (Miltenyi Biotec) before sterile cell sorting using a FACSAria-SORP (BD Biosciences). For flow cytometric analysis of tissue compartments, cells were passed through a sterile 70 ÂµM nylon mesh cell strainer (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH) for homogenization into a single cell suspension. Blood and spleen were RBC-lysed (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and brain and spinal underwent a 30%/70% Percoll gradient centrifugation (GE, Boston, MA). For intracellular staining, cells were fixed and permeabilized with the FoxP3/transcription factor staining buffer set (eBioscience). Commercial antibodies used included: CD4-PE (eBioscience), CD4 â AF647 (Biolegend), F4/80 â BV711 (BD), CD25-PE (eBioscience), CD25 â PE-Cy7 (BD), CD124 â BB700 (BD), CD122 â APC (BD), CD132 â BV421 (BD), CD213a1 â Biotin (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA), IL-10R-biotin (Biolegend), streptavidin â BV605 (BD), streptavidin â APCefluor780 (eBioscience), pSTAT3 â AF647 (BD), pSTAT5 â AF647 (BD), and pSTAT6 â AF647 (BD). Additional flow cytometry reagents purchased commercially include: Sytox Red (Invitrogen), CellTrace Violet (Invitrogen), and Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD). Tetramers obtained from the NIH Tetramer Core include MOG<sub>35-55</sub> Tetramer â BV421, I-A(b) Tetramer â BV421 (Atlanta, GA). Cells were acquired on an Attune NxT cytometer (Invitrogen). Cytometer usage was supported by the Cytometry and Imaging Microscopy Core Facility of the Case Comprehensive Cancer Center.

While it is well established that Tregs rely on IL-2 for their function, how combination of other cytokines contribute to their differentiation and function is less well understood. Zhou and colleagues demonstrate that IL-4 may, in combination with IL-2, support the proliferation of Tregs and their IL-10 production, and suggest that IL-4 may be used to help treat autoimmunity and allergy by either direct administration with IL-2 or by ex-vivo expansion of Tregs. This report thus shows a novel effect of combined IL-2 and IL-4 signaling on IL-10<sup>+</sup> Tregs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vitro effects largely focused on the effect on Treg cells, while the in vivo experiment failed to show the Treg-specific in vivo relevance. The IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice that were used as control have been described with chronic colitis conditions that may bring additional caveats due to the difference in cellular activation at steady state. Therefore, more functional and mechanistic studies are required to show that the combinatorial effect of IL-2/IL-4 is acting through Treg cells. In Figure 1, more IL-10 production comes from 36-72hr of treatment. is the co-treatment of IL-2 and IL-4 only essential in later time of culturing, and initial activation is sufficient with IL-2 or IL-4 alone?</p><p>The authors reported higher proliferative capacity and viability from IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg cells with dual IL-2/IL-4 treatment. Does IL-10 cytokine itself stimulate Treg cell proliferation and IL-10 production autonomously? Would the effect be abrogated by anti-IL-10?</p><p>2) In Figure 2, the levels of Treg proliferation are very low. The authors used plate-bound anti-CD3 alone together with or without a relatively low concentration of IL-2. The culture conditions seem to be the same throughout the manuscript. Have the authors performed dosing experiments to see if the Tregs are given more IL-2, or anti-CD28 etc., the same effects are seen? There is a concern that the culture conditions may be suboptimal so that much of the in vitro data can be interpreted as IL-4 rescuing Tregs in these low proliferation, low survival conditions. There may be a case for using limiting conditions in some settings to model in vivo conditions with limited stimuli but the interpretation would be somewhat different.</p><p>In addition it is unclear whether the concentration of IL-2 + IL-4 was 2x, i.e. double the concentration of the single cytokine conditions. Please complete this information in the figure legend and the Materials and methods.</p><p>3) In Figure 3, the authors claim that IL-2/IL-4 increase Treg suppressive activity. However, it is difficult to see this in Figure 3A-F, as the level of suppression appears to be the same between the IL-2 and IL-2/IL4 groups. In Figure 3G-J some differences do emerge but this may likely reflect changes in a poor condition of the Tregs after prolonged culture with IL-2/IL-4. The authors should consider if what they are seeing here is a real gain of suppressive function or a retention of suppressive function/Treg survival after prolonged culture.</p><p>The suppressive assay in Figure 3 showed that there is no increased suppressive capacity when Treg cell number was normalized prior to assay, but when the increased proliferative capacity were accounted for without pre-normalization of cell numbers, there was an increase in suppression. This was, however, contradicting with the hypothesis of IL-10 dependency. IL-2/IL-4 treatment should have increased %IL-10 producing Treg cells, and would have resulted in increased suppression in Figure 3A if IL-10 is the key dependent factor.</p><p>Also, IL-10 KO mice have been reported with chronic colitis, and may bring additional caveats to the in vitro suppressive assay conducted in Figure 3. Are the conventional T cells from the IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice? Do the Treg cells from IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice have altered functionality to begin with? Would treatment with anti-IL-10 give similar results?</p><p>To pinpoint that there is specific IL-2/IL-4 dual effect specific for Treg cells, the authors should consider Treg cell specific KO of IL-4R and see if observed effects are abolished.</p><p>4) In Figure 4, STAT5 inhibitor affects general Treg cell viability, is this IL-10 specific or inhibitor specific? If treated with another irrelevant inhibitor (ex: STAT6i), would it have similar effect of decreasing IL-10?</p><p>In Figure 4C, why does IL-2 alone not induce pSTAT5? What is the concentration of IL-2 used here? There is a clear synergistic effect of IL-2 and IL-4 but again the lack of a baseline response to IL-2 is a concern. Dose response experiments would help immensely. Please also show isotype staining to insure minimal background staining effect and fair comparison.</p><p>Figure 4A-C, it is unclear whether the heatmaps represent percentages or MFIs. Please complete this information in the figure legend.</p><p>5) In Figure 5, does IL-10R expression change play a role in the synergistic increase of IL-10?</p><p>6) In Figure 6A, what were the cell types analyzed? The legend did not describe them.</p><p>In the house dust mite experiment, is the protective effect Treg cell-specific? For instance, alveolar macrophages and Th2 cells are known to take roles in the house dust mite-driven asthma model, and may also be producers of IL-10 in certain context. Does IL-4 and IL-2 treatment alter these cellular population, phenotype and infiltration that may attribute to the observed histology?</p><p>In Figure 6D, many of the cell number figures lack a comparison between IL-4 alone at a high dose. Is IL-2 needed? The authors show data of IL-10 and Tregs from separate groups but all the total cell number analysis is combined.</p><p>7) In Figure 7, the EAE experiments lack comparison between IL-2/IL-4 and either of these cytokines alone. IL-2 in particular has been used in many EAE experiments with varied effects, without some indication that the IL-2/IL4 combination has differential effects to the separate cytokines. Any of this data is hardly interpretable.</p><p>Previous article suggested that systemic administration of IL-4 and IL-2 alone improves EAE, possibly through DCs and Treg cells, respectively. Is there data to suggest the in vivo phenotype observed in Figure 7 is a synergy with IL-4 and IL-2? Or are they offering similar degree of protection against EAE disease development?</p><p>Do conventional T cells express IL-10 in asthma model and EAE model in vivo? Would they attribute to the loss of effect in IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> model?</p><p>8) Several other reports have looked at the role of IL-4 in Treg function and demonstrated its role in supporting Treg proliferation and suppressive function in both mice and humans. The current Discussion should include a greater overview of the current literature.</p><p>Thornton, Piccirillo and Shevach, 2004; Pace, Pioli and Doria, 2005; Yang et al., 2017.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57417.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The in vitro effects largely focused on the effect on Treg cells, while the in vivo experiment failed to show the Treg-specific in vivo relevance.

All new experiments indicate that IL-10 production by Tregs is necessary for in vitro and in vivo suppression of disease induced by IL-2/IL-4.</p><p>Pertaining to the spontaneous development of colitis in IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mice, we have added colon lengths, which is a common measure of colitis, of IL-10<sup>-/-</sup>, IL-10 cKO, and WT mice in our colony. These data suggest that the mice at the age of sacrifice do not have active colitis (Figure 3âsource data 1CâD). According to JAX website for the IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mouse used in our study (Stock No: 00225):</p><p>âThe onset and severity of both spontaneous and experimentally-induced inflammatory phenotype of IL10-deficient mice is strongly influenced by the genetic background and the husbandry conditions (specific health status/commensal flora) of the vivarium in which mice are maintained.â</p><p>We have not observed colitis in our colony for the years that we have maintained the IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> mouse. We have edited the language in our manuscript to reflect the confounding factors that colitis may introduce. We also hope that by including a second and cell type-specific model of IL-10 ablation, our results will be more convincing, especially since no intestinal pathology was seen is these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1, more IL-10 production comes from 36-72hr of treatment. is the co-treatment of IL-2 and IL-4 only essential in later time of culturing, and initial activation is sufficient with IL-2 or IL-4 alone?</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the sequential cytokine experiment in Figure 1 to include incubation of Tregs with all cytokine conditions for 36 hours, then a switch to all other cytokine conditions for the remainder of the 72 hr. (3 day) incubation (Figure 1H). In the early culture period (0-36 hr.), IL-2/IL-4 supplemented Tregs have already produced more IL-10 than the other cytokine supplementation conditions. During the later culture period (37-72 hr.), IL-2/IL-4-supplementation also leads to greater IL-10 production by Tregs. The presence of IL-2/IL-4 appears to be necessary during all phases of the 72-hour time course.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors reported higher proliferative capacity and viability from IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg cells with dual IL-2/IL-4 treatment.

Combined with our observation that IL-10<sup>+</sup> Tregs have higher proliferative capacity with IL-2/IL-4 supplement (Figure 2D, F), our data supports a model in which IL-10 production is linked to enhanced proliferation of Tregs upon stimulation with IL-2 and IL-4 in combination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 2, the levels of Treg proliferation are very low.

There may be a case for using limiting conditions in some settings to model in vivo conditions with limited stimuli but the interpretation would be somewhat different.</p></disp-quote><p>This question prompted us to re-evaluate our flow data. In so doing, we altered the gating strategy to better identify live Tregs within each dataset. In the original version, we included too many signals that were CellTrace negative; therefore, in the revised manuscript, we excluded a population of signals that were too low on the FSC/SSC plot to be considered live Tregs. In so doing, the number of dividing Tregs, as a percentage, increased substantially. The patterns we reported originally did not change. Likewise, the interpretation does not change. Nonetheless, we believe that the data more accurately represents whatâs actually happening in each experiment. The revised gating is provided (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A) and is used throughout all relevant data and figures in this revised submission.</p><p>To directly address the reviewerâs concern that the IL-2 concentrations in our experiments are suboptimal, we stimulated Tregs with an IL-2 concentration gradient ranging from 0.01x to 100x of the dose used (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). Increasing the concentration of IL-2 markedly does not alter the observed phenomenon of synergistic IL-10 production and enhanced Treg proliferation due to the IL-2/IL-4 combination.</p><p>We also evaluated whether the addition of co-stimulation (plate-bound Î±CD28) to Treg cultures changes the phenotype resulting from IL-2/IL-4 stimulation. It did not (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition it is unclear whether the concentration of IL-2 + IL-4 was 2x, i.e. double the concentration of the single cytokine conditions.

The relevant figure legends and the Materials and methods have been edited to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, the authors claim that IL-2/IL-4 increase Treg suppressive activity. However, it is difficult to see this in Figure 3A-F, as the level of suppression appears to be the same between the IL-2 and IL-2/IL4 groups. In Figure 3G-J some differences do emerge but this may likely reflect changes in a poor condition of the Tregs after prolonged culture with IL-2/IL-4. The authors should consider if what they are seeing here is a real gain of suppressive function or a retention of suppressive function/Treg survival after prolonged culture.</p></disp-quote><p>Poor condition of the Tregs after prolonged culture is a possible interpretation, but we do not believe this is the case. The frequency of IL-10<sup>+</sup> Tregs increases over the course of 3 to 7 days, with IL-10<sup>+</sup> Tregs accounting for &gt;90% of the culture at day 7 (Figure 1L). Furthermore, we see an increase in the number of FoxP3<sup>+</sup> cells in culture, as well as an increase in cell viability, IL-10 MFI, and IL-10 production over time (Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). Combined with the observation that IL-10 expression increases with Treg division, which is enhanced by IL-2/IL- 4 (Figure 2C), our interpretation is that the Tregs are thriving, producing a lot of IL-10, are robustly suppressing Tconv cells, and the increase in suppressive behavior of the population is due to the combination of IL-10<sup>+</sup> Treg proliferation and IL-10 release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The suppressive assay in Figure 3 showed that there is no increased suppressive capacity when Treg cell number was normalized prior to assay, but when the increased proliferative capacity were accounted for without pre-normalization of cell numbers, there was an increase in suppression. This was, however, contradicting with the hypothesis of IL-10 dependency. IL-2/IL-4 treatment should have increased %IL-10 producing Treg cells, and would have resulted in increased suppression in Figure 3A if IL-10 is the key dependent factor.</p></disp-quote><p>In the WT suppression assays (Figure 3A-C), we found that inhibition of cytokine production was enhanced by the IL-2/IL-4 combination treatment of the Tregs prior to co-culture with Tconv cells compared to either cytokine alone, but that changes in proliferation were not different between IL-2 and IL-2+IL-4 (but were different from IL-4 alone). Using both complete IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> and FoxP3-specific IL-10 cKO mice/Tregs (Figure 3D-I), however, we found a complete loss of all inhibitory activity (cytokine production and proliferation).</p><p>While the reviewer is correct in pointing out that the proliferation inhibition in Figure 3A does not perfectly track with IL-10 production in Figure 3B, we interpret this as meaning that inhibition of cytokine production (IL-4 especially â see Figure 3C) is more sensitive to IL-10-mediated inhibition. Our reasoning is that all IL-10 is washed away after the initial 3-day stimulation with IL-2, IL-4 or both in order to setup the co-cultures with Tconv cells. This means that the amount of IL-10 in the initial co-cultures is zero. It is true that the Tregs continue to produce IL-10, but the amount reported in Figure 3B is the accumulated IL-10 over the co-culture period. We believe that the lag time in reaching higher IL-10 concentrations disconnects the final IL-10 value from the proliferation measured at the end of the assay, whereas the cytokine production is more easily inhibited â hence the more robust effect. This is speculation, but considering the complete absence of inhibitory activity in both IL-10-deficient systems, we feel confident in our conclusion that the protective efficacy of IL-2/IL-4 combination therapy in our mouse models of disease is dependent upon IL-10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, IL-10 KO mice have been reported with chronic colitis, and may bring additional caveats to the in vitro suppressive assay conducted in Figure 3.

Would treatment with anti-IL-10 give similar results?</p></disp-quote><p>The conventional T cells used in all of the suppression assays are from wild type FoxP3-RFP mice to enable Treg exclusion via flow sorting FoxP3- T cells. The Tregs are the only cells in the assay that originate from the indicated strains. We have edited the manuscript to make this clearer. As mentioned in our response to question 1, we have added colon lengths of IL-10<sup>-/-</sup>, IL-10 cKO, and WT mice in our colony, suggesting that the mice at the age of sacrifice do not have active colitis (Figure 3âsource data 1CâD). We have edited the language in our manuscript to reflect the confounding factors that colitis may introduce. Moreover, we have added the FoxP3-specific IL-10 knockout mouse/cells (which also do not develop colitis in our vivarium) to our dataset, which we believe further supports our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To pinpoint that there is specific IL-2/IL-4 dual effect specific for Treg cells, the authors should consider Treg cell specific KO of IL-4R and see if observed effects are abolished.</p></disp-quote><p>Adding yet another novel mouse strain and the substantial number of relevant experiments in this manuscript is simply beyond our resources and not necessary to reach the conclusions reported herein.

In our hands, both inhibitors appeared extremely toxic to Tregs as measured by Sytox exclusion in flow cytometry, much more than STAT5i (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).

IL-10R blockade decreased the expression of IL-10 in Tregs and obliterated the IL-2/IL-4-induced synergy measured by IL-10 production (Figure 5J), suggesting that there is some degree of autocrine signaling occurring through the IL-10/IL-10R axis in Tregs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 6A, what were the cell types analyzed?

For instance, alveolar macrophages and Th2 cells are known to take roles in the house dust mite-driven asthma model, and may also be producers of IL-10 in certain context. Does IL-4 and IL-2 treatment alter these cellular population, phenotype and infiltration that may attribute to the observed histology?</p></disp-quote><p>We further investigated the Treg-specificity of IL-2/IL-4 therapy in the house dust mite model using the IL-10<sup>fl/fl</sup> x FoxP3<sup>creYFP</sup> (IL-10 cKO) mouse. In these mice, IL-2/IL-4 does not have a therapeutic effect seen through cellular infiltration into the bronchiolar space or histology (Figure 6D-F). It is possible that other cells provide IL-10, but when Tregs lack the ability to make IL-10, IL-2/IL-4 is not able to reach therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we included analyses of the IL-10 expression of CD4- cells in the lungs and spleens (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B). It does not appear that IL-2/IL4 increases the IL-10 expression in these cells as a population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 6D, many of the cell number figures lack a comparison between IL-4 alone at a high dose. Is IL-2 needed? The authors show data of IL-10 and Tregs from separate groups but all the total cell number analysis is combined.</p></disp-quote><p>The original Figure 6D is now 6C. The data shown in Figure 6A-D is a <italic>therapeutic</italic> dosing of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-2/4 combination, meaning therapy was started after disease induction. In that setting, which uses a 1:1 ratio of IL-2 and IL-4 (1x each), we show the individual cytokine controls (see Figure 6A-C). In the revised Figure 6D, we abbreviate the presentation to just the combination to make two points. First, the absence of IL-10 leads to a loss of therapeutic efficacy. Second, even in a Th2-skewed asthma system (BALB/c), the combination of IL-2 and IL-4 reduces disease severity.</p><p>The âhigh doseâ (10x) IL-4 is only used in a preventative administration, meaning the animals were pre-treated with cytokines before disease induction. It is true that we donât have the individual cytokines in these experiments, and due to the fact that this work hasnât been funded in nearly 2 years now, we are unable to complete those experiments. However, we believe that the data remains valuable despite the lack of individual cytokine conditions, but have reduced the âfootprintâ of this data to a single graph (Figure 6G) and have pointed to the caveats of our interpretation in the Results text. We believe that the data should remain in the manuscript because it demonstrates IL10-dependent prophylactic efficacy, but if the reviewers and editors feel strongly otherwise, we are willing to simply omit this single graph in a final revision. While it does add to the story, it is not necessary to make the conclusions reported.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 7, the EAE experiments lack comparison between IL-2/IL-4 and either of these cytokines alone. IL-2 in particular has been used in many EAE experiments with varied effects, without some indication that the IL-2/IL4 combination has differential effects to the separate cytokines. Any of this data is hardly interpretable.</p><p>Previous article suggested that systemic administration of IL-4 and IL-2 alone improves EAE, possibly through DCs and Treg cells, respectively. Is there data to suggest the in vivo phenotype observed in Figure 7 is a synergy with IL-4 and IL-2? Or are they offering similar degree of protection against EAE disease development?</p></disp-quote><p>We added a new experiment comparing IL-2/IL-4 and the individual cytokines alone in the MOG model of EAE (Figure 7A-B). We found that combined IL-2/IL-4 has therapeutic efficacy, and IL-2 and IL-4 alone do not reduce EAE severity. The important distinction between our data and published findings using each cytokine is the dosing and treatment schedules:</p><p>1) IL-2 has been shown to limit the severity of EAE (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22954711/">22954711)</ext-link> at a treatment regimen of 10,000 IU/dose, 3x per day i.v. for 3 days, totaling to 90,000 IU over the course of the trial. Our experiment entails administering a mere 2,500 IU of IL-2 over the course of the trial.</p><p>2) The same came be said about IL-4. We administered 16.24 ng of IL-4 per dose, every other day. The study by Racke et al. that is commonly cited administered 1ug of IL-4 every 8 hours on days 0-11 or 6-11 (doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2191757/">10.1084/jem.180.5.1961)</ext-link>. At the low doses we used, IL-2 and IL-4 alone were not effective at suppressing disease, however in conjunction with the other, the dual cytokine cocktail significantly suppressed disease through synergistic action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do conventional T cells express IL-10 in asthma model and EAE model in vivo? Would they attribute to the loss of effect in IL-10<sup>-/-</sup> model?</p></disp-quote><p>We ran the analyses and saw that while conventional T cells do express some amounts of IL-10 in the surveyed tissues (lung and spleen for HDM-induced asthma, and CNS for EAE), the expression levels do not increase with IL-2/IL-4 treatment, in either naÃ¯ve or challenged mice (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B, Figure 7âfigure supplement 3A). Combined with the results of IL-2/IL-4 lacking efficacy in the new IL-10 cKO asthma and EAE trials, the IL-10 produced by Tregs appears to be the essential component (Figure 6D-E, Figure 7I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Several other reports have looked at the role of IL-4 in Treg function and demonstrated its role in supporting Treg proliferation and suppressive function in both mice and humans.
