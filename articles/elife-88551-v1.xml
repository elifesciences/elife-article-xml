Our present understanding of motor control has grown rapidly thanks to new methods for recording and analyzing populations of many individual neurons over time. In contrast, current methods for recording the nervous system’s actual motor output – the activation of muscle fibers by motor neurons – typically cannot detect the individual electrical events produced by muscle fibers during natural behaviors and scale poorly across species and muscle groups. Here we present a novel class of electrode devices (‘Myomatrix arrays’) that record muscle activity at unprecedented resolution across muscles and behaviors. High-density, flexible electrode arrays allow for stable recordings from the muscle fibers activated by a single motor neuron, called a ‘motor unit,’ during natural behaviors in many species, including mice, rats, primates, songbirds, frogs, and insects. This technology therefore allows the nervous system’s motor output to be monitored in unprecedented detail during complex behaviors across species and muscle morphologies. We anticipate that this technology will allow rapid advances in understanding the neural control of behavior and identifying pathologies of the motor system.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Critical to these advances have been tools to record neural activity at scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Steinmetz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Urai et al., 2022</xref>), which, when combined with novel algorithms for behavioral tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Machado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pereira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mathis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wiltschko et al., 2020</xref>), can reveal how neural activity shapes behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hernández et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Vyas et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, current methods for observing the nervous system’s motor output lag far behind neural recording technologies. The nervous system’s control of skeletal motor output is ultimately mediated by ‘motor units,’ each of which consists of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it activates, producing motor unit action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) that generate muscle force to produce movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Manuel et al., 2019</xref>). Because each action potential in a motor neuron reliably evokes a single spike in its target muscle fibers, action potentials recorded from muscle provide a high-resolution readout of motor neuron activity in the spinal cord and brainstem. However, our understanding of motor unit activity during natural behaviors is rudimentary due to the difficulty of recording spike trains from motor unit populations.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Myomatrix arrays record muscle activity at motor unit resolution.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The nervous system controls behavior via motor units, each consisting of a single motor neuron and the muscle fibers it innervates.

Myomatrix arrays (right) bearing 32 electrode contacts on a flexible substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) can be targeted to one or more muscles and yield high-resolution recordings of motor activity during free behavior.

Layers of insulating polymer (polyimide) and conductive metal (gold) are successively deposited on a carrier wafer to form a flexible, 20- or 40-μm-thick electrode array of gold electrode contacts, which receive a surface treatment of PEDOT to improve recording properties (see ‘Methods’). Electrodes are connected via thin gold traces to a receiving pad for a high-density connector (Omnetics Inc), which is then bonded to the array. The completed array is then peeled off the carrier wafer.

(<bold>c–e</bold>) Expanded views of the electrode array also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which has four ‘threads’ each bearing eight electrode contacts. This array design can be used for either acute or chronic recordings. For chronic implantation, the surgeon grasps the ‘pull-through tabs’ when tunneling the threads subcutaneously. For intramuscular implantation in either acute or chronic settings, a needle is used to pull each thread through the target muscle. In this use case, the ‘depth-restrictor tabs’ prevent the thread from being pulled any further into the muscle, thereby determining the depth of the electrode contacts within the muscle. (<bold>d, e</bold>) Detailed views highlighting sub-millimeter features used to increase electrode stability within the muscle (barbs, suture holes) and labels to indicate which channel/thread labels have been implanted in which muscles. (<bold>f, g</bold>) Design variations. The fabrication process shown in (<bold>a</bold>) can easily be modified to alter size and shape of the electrode array. Each Myomatrix design in (<bold>f</bold>) and (<bold>g</bold>) has 32 electrode contacts. (<bold>f</bold>) Two array designs customized for chronic recording applications in different muscle groups in rodents. (<bold>g</bold>) Injectable array for recording forelimb muscles in nonhuman primates. (<bold>h</bold>) For chronic implantation in mice, the connector end of the array is attached to the skull using dental acrylic (1) and the flexible array threads are then routed subcutaneously to a small distal incision located near the targeted muscle or muscles (2). For intramuscular implantation, the surgeon secures each thread to a suture and needle, which are then inserted through the target area of muscle tissue (3). The surgeon then pulls the suture further through the muscle, eventually drawing the array thread into the muscles such that the depth-restrictor tabs prevent further insertion and ensure that the electrode contacts are positioned at the correct depth within the muscle (4). In contrast, for epimysial (as opposed to intramuscular) implantation, the array threads are sutured to the surface of the muscle fascia rather than being inserted with a suture needle. After all threads are secured to the muscle, the distal incision site is sutured closed (5). (<bold>i</bold>) For percutaneous insertion of injectable arrays, the array’s thin ‘tail’ is loaded into a modified hypodermic syringe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loeb and Gans, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muceli et al., 2015</xref>). During insertion, the tail is secured by bending it back over the plastic needle holder and securing it with either the surgeon’s fingers or an additional syringe inserted into the cannula. After electrode array insertion the needle is gently pulled out of the muscle, leaving the electrode-bearing part of the array thread within the target muscle for the duration of the recording session. After recording, the electrode and tail are gently pulled out of the muscle together as with injectable fine-wire EMG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loeb and Gans, 1986</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88551-fig1-figsupp1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Spike sorting.</title><p>Action potential (‘spike’) waveforms from individual motor units can be identified (‘sorted’) using analysis methods that are commonly used to sort spikes from neural data. (<bold>a–d</bold>) Single-channel spike sorting. In some cases, a single motor unit’s spike will dominate the recording on an individual Myomatrix channel, as shown in an example bipolar recording from mouse triceps during locomotion (<bold>a</bold>, top). In such cases, a simple voltage threshold (dashed line) can be used to isolate spike times of the largest recorded unit (blue dots) from a single channel. In contrast (<bold>a</bold>, bottom), fine-wire EMG typically does not yield isolated single units during active behaviors. (<bold>b</bold>) Single-channel spike sorting using principal components analysis (PCA) of the data shown in (<bold>a</bold>). Each data point in (<bold>b</bold>) represents a single-voltage waveform represented in the dimensions defined by the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) of the set of all spike waveforms. As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sober et al., 2008</xref>), k-means clustering can discriminate the waveforms from individual motor units (cyan dots in <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold>) and waveforms from other motor units and/or background noise (black dots in <bold>b</bold>). If one of the clusters has less than 1% overlap with any other cluster (based on fitting each cluster with a 2D Gaussian as described previously) and displays an absolute refractory period (less than 1% of inter-spike intervals less than 1 ms), it is classified as a single unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sober et al., 2008</xref>). When applied to the Myomatrix data in (<bold>a</bold>), PCA-based sorting method produced identical spike times as the thresholding method (cyan dots in <bold>a</bold>). In contrast, the same analysis applied to the fine-wire data shown in (<bold>a</bold>) did not produce any well-isolated clusters in PCA space (<bold>b</bold>, right), indicating that this method could not extract any single motor units. Myomatrix and fine-wire data shown in (<bold>a, b</bold>) are from the same datasets as the examples shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a and b</xref>. (<bold>c, d</bold>) Single-channel spike sorting applied to bipolar Myomatrix recordings from the ventral syringeal (VS) muscle, a songbird vocal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>). Here again, PCA-based sorting of Myomatrix data method produced identical spike times as the thresholding method (orange dots in <bold>c</bold> and <bold>d</bold>). In contrast, the same analysis applied to fine-wire data recorded from VS shown in (<bold>c</bold>) did not produce any well-isolated clusters in PCA space (<bold>d</bold>, right), Other plotting conventions for (<bold>c, d</bold>) are the same as for the mouse data in (<bold>a, b</bold>). (<bold>e–h</bold>) Multichannel spike sorting using Kilosort. We used Kilosort version 2.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pachitariu et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Steinmetz et al., 2021</xref>) and custom MATLAB and Python code to sort waveforms into clusters arising from individual motor units. (<bold>e</bold>) Spike times (top) and mean waveforms (bottom) of six motor units recorded simultaneously from mouse triceps during locomotion (same dataset as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Mean waveforms for the six motor units (columns at bottom) are shown from six different EMG channels (rows) and illustrate the distinct pattern of spike waveforms across channel associated with the discharge of each identified motor unit. (<bold>f</bold>) Left: feature space projection of individual waveforms (colored dots), projected onto the space of singular values (‘factors’) that describe the space of all recorded waveforms. The clustering of waveforms from Kilosort-identified units (colors) further illustrates the distinctness of voltage waveforms assigned to each of the identified motor units. Right: autocorrelograms (colors) and cross-correlograms (gray) of the six motor units shown in (<bold>e</bold>). In addition to examining the consistency of each candidate motor unit’s spike waveforms, we also inspected autocorrelations to ensure that each identified unit showed an absolute refractory period (zero or near-zero autocorrelations at lag zero) and that cross-correlograms did not have strong peaks at zero lag (which might indicate the same motor unit being detected by multiple Kilosort clusters). (<bold>g, h</bold>) Myomatrix recordings from nonhuman primate and rat (unipolar and bipolar recordings, respectively, same datasets as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3 and 2c</xref>), respectively. These examples (along with the mouse data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) highlight the finding that Myomatrix arrays typically record the same motor unit on multiple channels simultaneously. This redundancy is critical for Kilosort and related methods to isolate single motor unit waveforms, particularly when waveforms from multiple units overlap in time.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88551-fig1-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Longevity of Myomatrix recordings.</title><p>In addition to isolating individual motor units, Myomatrix arrays also provide stable multiunit recordings of comparable or superior quality to conventional fine-wire EMG. (<bold>a, b</bold>) Bipolar Myomatrix recordings from the triceps muscle of a mouse recorded during treadmill locomotion over a period 61 d. Colored regions in (<bold>b</bold>) highlight the ‘stance’ phase (when the paw from the recorded forelimb is in contact with the treadmill surface) and ‘swing’ phase (when the paw is lifted off the treadmill surface). To quantify changes in recording quality over time, we computed a ‘signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)’ for each of each stride cycle as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pack et al., 2023</xref>). Here, the ‘locomotor SNR’ for each swing-stance-cycle is defined as the root mean square (RMS) amplitude of the multiunit EMG signal during each single-stance cycle divided by the RMS of the EMG signal during the immediately subsequent swing phase.

(<bold>e</bold>) Although individual motor units were most frequently recorded in the first 2 wk of chronic recordings (see main text), Myomatrix arrays also isolate individual motor units after much longer periods of chronic implantation, as shown here where spikes from two individual motor units (colored boxes in bottom trace) were isolated during locomotion 65 d after implantation.

These methods can resolve the activity of individual motor units in only a limited range of settings. First, to prevent measurement artifacts, traditional EMG methods require that a subject’s movements be highly restricted, typically in ‘isometric’ force tasks where subjects contract their muscles without moving their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bräcklein et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Farina and Holobar, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Marshall et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Negro et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, fine-wire electrodes typically cannot detect single motor unit activity in small muscles, including the muscles of widely used model systems such as mice or songbirds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pearson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Srivastava et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pack et al., 2023</xref>), and surface electrode arrays are poorly tolerated by freely behaving animal subjects.

In other cases, waveforms from individual motor units appeared on multiple electrode channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), allowing – and in many cases necessitating – more advanced spike-sorting approaches that leverage information from multiple channels to identify larger numbers of units and resolve overlapping spike waveforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pachitariu et al., 2023</xref>), as detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e–h</xref>. These methods allow the user to record simultaneously from ensembles of single motor units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>) in freely behaving animals, even from small muscles including the lateral head of the triceps muscle in mice (approximately 9 mm in length with a mass of 0.02 g; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mathewson et al., 2012</xref>). Myomatrix recordings isolated single motor units for extended periods (greater than 2 mo, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3e</xref>), although highest unit yield was typically observed in the first 1–2 wk after chronic implantation. Because recording sessions from individual animals were often separated by several days during which animals were disconnected from data collection equipment, we are unable to assess based on the present data whether the same motor units can be recorded over multiple days.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Myomatrix arrays record motor units during active movements</title><p>Myomatrix arrays outperform traditional fine-wire electrodes in mice by reliably recording isolated single units in behaving animals. First, Myomatrix arrays isolate the activity of multiple individual motor units during freely moving behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c and d</xref>). In contrast, wire electrodes typically cannot resolve individual motor units during muscle lengthening and shorting, as occurs in naturalistic movements such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tysseling et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> illustrates a comparison between Myomatrix (top) and fine-wire (bottom) data recorded during locomotion in the mouse triceps.

Similarly, while Myomatrix recordings robustly isolated motor units from a songbird vocal muscle, fine-wire EMG electrodes applied to the same muscle did not yield isolatable units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c and d</xref>). This lack of resolution, which is typical of fine-wire EMG, severely limits access to motor unit activity during active behavior, although wire electrodes injected through the skin can provide excellent motor unit isolation during quiet stance in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ritter et al., 2014</xref>). Second, because wire-based EMG requires inserting an additional wire for each additional electrode contact, only a single pair of wires (providing a single bipolar recording channel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, bottom) can be inserted into an individual mouse muscle in most cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Miri et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tysseling et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tysseling et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, at least four Myomatrix ‘threads’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), bearing a total of 32 electrodes, can be inserted into one muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> shows 5 of 32 channels recorded simultaneously from mouse triceps), greatly expanding the number of recording channels within a single muscle.

Moreover, in multiunit recordings, Myomatrix arrays have significantly higher signal-to-noise ratios than fine-wire EMG arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Myomatrix arrays therefore far exceed the performance of wire electrodes in mice in terms of both the quality of recordings and the number of channels that can be recorded simultaneously from one muscle.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Myomatrix arrays record from a wide range of muscle groups, species, and behaviors</title><p>Myomatrix arrays provide high-resolution EMG recordings across muscle targets and experimental preparations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

For ease of insertion into larger muscles, we modified the ‘thread’ design used in our mouse arrays so that each Myomatrix array could be loaded into a standard hypodermic syringe and injected into the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and i</xref>), inspired by earlier work highlighting the performance of injectable arrays in primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loeb and Gans, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Farina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muceli et al., 2015</xref>).

Moreover, although fine-wire EMG signals varied across trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>, bottom), the lack of motor unit resolution makes it impossible to assess how individual motor units vary (and co-vary) across trials.

In recordings from rodents during locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2c</xref>), we did not observe voltage artifacts at any point in the stride cycle (e.g. when the paw of the recorded limb first touches the ground in each stride cycle; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, black arrowhead). Movement artifacts were similarly absent during active arm movements in monkeys (peak fingertip speeds ~15 cm/s; peak elbow angle velocity ~40°/s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and e</xref>), during passive jaw displacement in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), or in the other anesthetized preparations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

In each of these datasets, the duration of single-unit EMG recording was limited by the willingness of the animal to continue performing the behavior, rather than a loss of signal isolation. Recordings in acute preparations were similarly stable. For example, the songbird dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref> includes single-unit data from 8101 respiratory cycles collected over 74 min, and, like the other acute recordings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, recordings were ended by the experimenter rather than because of a loss of signal from individual motor units.</p><p>The diversity of applications presented here demonstrates that Myomatrix arrays can obtain high-resolution EMG recordings across muscle groups, species, and experimental conditions, including spontaneous behavior, reflexive movements, and stimulation-evoked muscle contractions. Although this resolution has previously been achieved in moving subjects by directly recording from motor neuron cell bodies in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hoffer et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robinson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hyngstrom et al., 2007</xref>) and using fine-wire electrodes in moving insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pflüger and Burrows, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Putney et al., 2023</xref>), both methods are extremely challenging and can only target a small subset of species and motor unit populations. Exploring additional muscle groups and model systems with Myomatrix arrays will allow new lines of investigation into how the nervous system executes skilled behaviors and coordinates populations of motor units both within and across individual muscles. These approaches will be particularly valuable in muscles in which each motor neuron controls a very small number of muscle fibers, allowing fine control of oculomotor muscles in mammals as well as vocal muscles in songbirds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), in which most individual motor neurons innervate only 1–3 muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 2021</xref>). Of further interest will be combining high-resolution EMG with precise measurement of muscle length and force output to untangle the complex relationship between neural control, body kinematics, and muscle force that characterizes dynamic motor behavior. Similarly, combining Myomatrix recordings with high-density brain recordings or targeted manipulations of neural activity can reveal how central circuits shape and reshape motor activity and – in contrast to the multiunit signals typically obtained from traditional EMG in animals – reveal how neural dynamics in cortical, subcortical, and spinal circuits shape the spiking patterns of individual motor neurons.</p><p>Applying Myomatrix technology to human motor unit recordings, particularly by using the minimally invasive injectable designs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g and i</xref>, will create novel opportunities to diagnose motor pathologies and quantify the effects of therapeutic interventions in restoring motor function. Moreover, because Myomatrix arrays are far more flexible than the rigid needles commonly used to record clinical EMG, our technology might significantly reduce the risk and discomfort of such procedures while also greatly increasing the accuracy with which human motor function can be quantified. This expansion of access to high-resolution EMG signals – across muscle groups, species, and behaviors – is the chief impact of the Myomatrix project.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Myomatrix array fabrication</title><p>The microfabrication process (schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>) consists of depositing and patterning a series of polymer (polyimide) and metal (gold) layers using a combination of spin coating, photolithography, etching, and evaporation processes, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zia et al., 2018</xref>). These methods allow very fine pitch escape routing (&lt;10 µm spacing between the thin ‘escape’ traces connecting electrode contacts to the connector), spatial alignment between the multiple layers of polyimide and gold that constitute each device, and precise definition of ‘via’ pathways that connect different layers of the device. Once all the metal and polyimide layers have been deposited and patterned on carrier wafers, the gold EMG recording electrode sites are formed by removing the top polyimide layer over each electrode site using reactive ion etching process (O<sub>2</sub> and SF<sub>6</sub> plasma, 5:1 ratio). Electrode sites are then coated with a conductive polymer, PEDOT:PSS (Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene-sulfonate)), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cui and Martin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dijk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rossetti et al., 2019</xref>) to reduce the electrode impedance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ludwig et al., 2011</xref>). PEDOT:PSS was deposited on the electrode contacts to a thickness of 100 nm using spin coating, resulting in final electrode impedances of 5 kOhm or less (100 × 200 um electrode sites). Once all layers have been deposited on the carrier wafer, the wafer is transferred to an Optec Femtosecond laser system, which is used to cut the electrode arrays into the shape/pattern needed based on the target muscle group and animal species. The final device thickness was ~40 µm for the injectable (primate forelimb) design and ~20 µm for all other design variants. The final fabrication step is bonding a high-density connector (Omnetics, Inc) to the surface of the electrode array using a Lambda flip-chip bonder (Finetech, Inc). This fabrication pipeline allows the rapid development and refinement of multiple array designs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–g</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Myomatrix array implantation</title><p>For chronic EMG recording in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2a, c, and d</xref>), arrays such as those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–f</xref> were implanted by first making a midline incision (approximately 10 mm length) in the scalp of an anesthetized animal. The array’s connector was then secured to the skull using dental cement (in some cases along with a headplate for later head-fixed chronic recordings), and the electrode array threads were routed subcutaneously to a location near the target muscle or muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>). In some electrode array designs, subcutaneous routing is facilitated with ‘pull-through tabs’ that can be grasped with a forceps to pull multiple threads into position simultaneously. For some anatomical targets, a small additional incision was made to allow surgical access to individual muscles (e.g. a 2–5 mm incision near the elbow to facilitate implantation into the biceps and/or triceps muscles). Once each thread has been routed subcutaneously and positioned near its target, any pull-through tabs are cut off with surgical scissors and discarded. Each thread can then either be sutured to the surface of the thin sheet of elastic tissue that surrounds muscles (‘epimysial attachment’) or inserted into the muscle using a suture needle (‘intramuscular implantation’). For epimysial attachment, each electrode thread is simply sutured to the surface of each muscle (with electrode contacts facing the muscle tissue, suture sizes ranging from 6-0 to 11–0) in one of the proximal suture holes (located on the depth-restrictor tabs) and one of the distal suture holes. For intramuscular implantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1h</xref>), a suture (size 6-0 to 11-0 depending on anatomical target) is tied to the distal-most suture hole. The needle is then passed through the target muscle and used to pull the attached array thread into the muscle. In some designs, a ‘depth-restrictor tab’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>) prevents the thread from being pulled any further into the muscle, thereby limiting the depth at which the electrodes are positioned within the target muscle. The array is then secured within the muscle by the passive action of the flexible polyimide ‘barbs’ lining each thread and/or by adding additional sutures to the proximal and distal suture holes.</p><p>Acute recording in small animals (including rodents, songbirds, cats, frogs, and caterpillars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and e–j</xref>) used the same arrays as chronic recordings. However, for both epimysial and intramuscular acute recordings, the Myomatrix array traces were simply placed on or within the target muscle after the muscle was exposed via an incision in the overlying skin of the anesthetized animal (rather than routed subcutaneously from the skull as in chronic applications).</p><p>For acute recordings in nonhuman primates, prior to recording, the ‘tail’ of the injectable array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>) was loaded into a sterile 23-gauge cannula (1″ long) until fully seated. The upper half of the cannula bevel, where contact is made with the electrode, was laser-blunted to prevent breakage of the tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Muceli et al., 2015</xref>). During insertion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>), the tail was bent over the top of the cannula and held tightly, and the electrode was inserted parallel to bicep brachii long head muscle fibers at an angle of ~45° to the skin. Once the cannula was fully inserted, the tail was released, and the cannula slowly removed. After recording, the electrode and tail were slowly pulled out of the muscle together. Insertion and removal of injectable Myomatrix devices appeared to be comparable or superior to traditional fine-wire EMG electrodes (in which a ‘hook’ is formed by bending back the uninsulated tip of the recording wire) in terms of ease of injection, ease of removal of both the cannula and the array itself, and animal comfort. Moreover, in over 100 Myomatrix injections performed in rhesus macaques, there were zero cases in which Myomatrix arrays broke such that electrode material was left behind in the recorded muscle, representing a substantial improvement over traditional fine-wire approaches, in which breakage of the bent wire tip regularly occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loeb and Gans, 1986</xref>).</p><p>For all Myomatrix array designs, a digitizing, multiplexing headstage (Intan, Inc) was plugged into the connector, which was cemented onto the skull for chronic applications and attached to data collection devices via a flexible tether, allowing EMG signals to be collected during behavior. By switching out different headstages, data from the same 32 electrode channels on each Myomatrix array could be recorded either as 32 unipolar channels or as 16 bipolar channels, where each bipolar signal is computed by subtracting the signals from physically adjacent electrode contacts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Data analysis: Spike sorting</title><p>Motor unit action potential waveforms from individual motor units were identified with analysis methods previously used to sort spikes from neural data.

When the voltage trace from a single Myomatrix channel is dominated by a single high-amplitude action potential waveform (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), single units can be isolated using principal components analysis (PCA) to detect clusters of similar waveforms, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sober et al., 2008</xref>).

These modifications include the following:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><italic>Modification of spatial masking</italic>: Individual motor units contain multiple muscle fibers (each of which is typically larger than a neuron’s soma), and motor unit waveforms can often be recorded across spatially distant electrode contacts as the waveforms propagate along muscle fibers. In contrast, Kilosort – optimized for the much more local signals recorded from neurons – uses spatial masking to penalize templates that are spread widely across the electrode array. Our modifications to Kilosort therefore include ensuring that Kilosort searches for motor unit templates across all (and only) the electrode channels inserted into a given muscle. In the GitHub repository linked below, this is accomplished by setting parameter <bold>nops.sigmaMask</bold> to infinity, which effectively eliminates spatial masking in the analysis of the 32 unipolar channels recorded from the injectable Myomatrix array schematized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>. In cases including chronic recording from mice where only a single eight-contact thread is inserted into each muscle, a similar modification can be achieved with a finite value of <bold>nops.sigmaMask</bold> by setting parameter <bold>NchanNear</bold>, which represents the number of nearby EMG channels to be included in each cluster, to equal the number of unipolar or bipolar data channels recorded from each thread. Finally, note that in all cases Kilosort parameter <bold>NchanNearUp</bold> (which defines the maximum number of channels across which spike templates can appear) must be reset to be equal to or less than the total number of Myomatrix data channels.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Allowing more complex spike waveforms</italic>: We also modified Kilosort to account for the greater duration and complexity (relative to neural spikes) of many motor unit waveforms. In the code repository linked below, Kilosort 2.5 was modified to allow longer spike templates (151 samples instead of 61), more spatiotemporal PCs for spikes (12 instead of 6), and more left/right eigenvector pairs for spike template construction (6 pairs instead of 3) to account for the greater complexity and longer duration of motor unit action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Loeb and Gans, 1986</xref>) compared to the neural action potentials for which Kilosort was initially created. These modifications were crucial for improving sorting performance in the nonhuman primate dataset shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and in a subset of the rodent datasets (although they were not used in the analysis of mouse data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–f</xref>).</p></list-item></list><p>Individual motor units were identified from ‘candidate’ units by assessing motor unit waveform consistency, SNR, and spike count, inspecting autocorrelograms to ensure that each identified units displayed an absolute refractory period of less than 1 ms, and examining cross-correlograms with other sorted units to ensure that each motor unit’s waveforms were being captured by only one candidate unit. Candidate units with inconsistent waveforms or &gt;1% of inter-spike intervals above 1 ms were discarded. Candidate units with highly similar waveform shapes and cross-correlation peaks at lag zero were merged, resulting in sorted units with well-differentiated waveform shapes and firing patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e and f</xref>). Our spike-sorting code, which includes the above-mentioned modifications to Kilosort, is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/JonathanAMichaels/PixelProcessingPipeline/releases/tag/v0.9">https://github.com/JonathanAMichaels/PixelProcessingPipeline/releases/tag/v0.9</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Michaels, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Our approach to spike sorting shares the same ultimate goal as prior work using skin-surface electrode arrays to isolate signals from individual motor units but pursues this goal using different hardware and analysis approaches. A number of groups have developed algorithms for reconstructing the spatial location and spike times of active motor units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Negro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">van den Doel et al., 2008</xref>) based on skin-surface recordings, in many cases drawing inspiration from earlier efforts to localize cortical activity using EEG recordings from the scalp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Michel et al., 2004</xref>). Our approach differs substantially. In Myomatrix arrays, the close electrode spacing and very close proximity of the contacts to muscle fibers ensure that each Myomatrix channel records from a much smaller volume of tissue than skin-surface arrays. This difference in recording volume in turn creates different challenges for motor unit isolation: compared to skin-surface recordings, Myomatrix recordings include a smaller number of motor units represented on each recording channel, with individual motor units appearing on a smaller fraction of the sensors than typical in a skin-surface recording. Because of this sensor-dependent difference in motor unit source mixing, different analysis approaches are required for each type of dataset. Specifically, skin-surface EMG analysis methods typically use source-separation approaches that assume that each sensor receives input from most or all of the individual sources within the muscle as is presumably the case in the data. In contrast, the much sparser recordings from Myomatrix are better decomposed using methods like Kilosort, which are designed to extract waveforms that appear only on a small, spatially restricted subset of recording channels.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional recording methods: Mouse forelimb muscle</title><p>All procedures described below were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Emory University (IACUC protocol #201700359; data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) or were carried out in accordance with the European Union Directive 86/609/EEC and approved by the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown Ethics Committee and the Portuguese Direção Geral de Veterinária (ref. no. 0421/000/000/2020; data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2e</xref>).

Following this, rats received a subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg meloxicam, a subcutaneous injection of 1% lidocaine and topical application of lidocaine ointment (5%) at each incision site. Myomatrix threads were implanted in the triceps muscle using the ‘intramuscular’ method. EMG data were then recorded while animals walked on a treadmill at speeds ranging from 8 to 25 cm/s. Kinematics were quantified using a circular arrangement of four high-speed FLIR Black Fly S USB3 cameras (BFS-U3-16S2M-CS, Mono), each running at 125 fps. We used DeepLabCut to label pixel locations of each of the 10 anatomical landmarks on the limbs and body, which we then transformed into 3D Cartesian coordinates using Anipose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Karashchuk et al., 2021</xref>).

Rodents were food-restricted for 17–18 hr prior to training. During the task, rats used the right arm to reach for sucrose pellets through a vertical slit (width = 1 cm) in a custom-built acrylic chamber. Individual Myomatrix threads were implanted on the right flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) muscle using the ‘epimysial’ method described above under 2.0–3.0% isoflurane anesthesia in oxygen gas. The arrays were then connected to data collection hardware via a flexible tether and EMG data were recorded while unrestrained animals performed the reaching task.

As described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lenschow et al., 2022</xref>), spinal optogenetic stimulation of the motor neurons innervating the BSM was performed on 2–3-month-old male BL6 mice that had received an injection of a rAAVCAG-ChR2 into the BSM on postnatal days 3–6. Individual Myomatrix threads were implanted in the BSM using the ‘intramuscular’ method described above.

Individual Myomatrix threads were implanted in hindlimb muscles using the ‘intramuscular’ method described above.

One male rhesus monkey (Monkey M, <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, 10 kg) was trained to perform a range of reaching tasks while seated in a robotic exoskeleton (NHP KINARM, Kingston, ON). As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scott, 1999</xref>), this robotic device allows movements of the shoulder and elbow joints in the horizontal plane and can independently apply torque at both joints. Visual cues and hand feedback were projected from an LCD monitor onto a semi-silvered mirror in the horizontal plane of the task and direct vision of the arm was blocked with a physical barrier.</p><p>An injectable Myomatrix array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>) was inserted percutaneously as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1i</xref>. Then, using his right arm, Monkey M performed a reaching task similar to previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pruszynski et al., 2014</xref>). On each trial, the monkey waited with its fingertip in in a central target (located under the fingertip when the shoulder and elbow angles were 32° and 72°, respectively; size = 0.6 cm diameter) while countering a constant elbow load (–0.05 Nm). The monkey was presented with one of two peripheral goal targets (30/84° and 34/60° shoulder/elbow, 8 cm diameter), and after a variable delay (1.2–2 s) received one of two unpredictable elbow perturbations (±0.15 Nm step-torque) which served as a go cue to reach to the goal target. At the time of perturbation onset, all visual feedback was frozen until the hand remained in the goal target for 800 ms, after which a juice reward was given. In 10% of trials, no perturbation was applied, and the monkey had to maintain the hand in the central target. In addition to Myomatrix injectables, we acquired bipolar electromyographic activity from nonhuman primates using intramuscular fine-wire electrodes in the biceps brachii long head as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Maeda et al., 2021</xref>), recording in this instance from the same biceps muscle in the same animal from which we also collected Myomatrix data, although in a separate recording session. Fine-wire electrodes were spaced ~8 mm apart and aligned to the muscle fibers, and a reference electrode was inserted subcutaneously in the animal’s back. Muscle activity was recorded at 2000 Hz, zero-phase bandpass filtered (25–500 Hz, fourth-order Butterworth) and full-wave rectified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The main objective of this paper is to report the development of a new intramuscular probe that the authors have named Myomatrix arrays. The goal of the Myomatrix probe is to significantly advance the current technological ability to record the motor output of the nervous system, namely fine-wire electromyography (EMG). Myomatrix arrays aim to provide large-scale recordings of multiple motor units in awake animals under dynamic conditions without undue movement artifacts and maintain long-term stability of chronically implanted probes. Animal motor behavior occurs through muscle contraction, and the ultimate neural output in vertebrates is at the scale of motor units, which are bundles of muscle fibers (muscle cells) that are innervated by a single motor neuron. The authors have combined multiple advanced manufacturing techniques, including lithography, to fabricate large and dense electrode arrays with mechanical features such as barbs and suture methods that would stabilize the probe's location within the muscle without creating undue wiring burden or tissue trauma. Importantly, the fabrication process they have developed allows for rapid iteration from design conception to a physical device, which allows for design optimization of the probes for specific muscle locations and organisms. The electrical output of these arrays is processed through a variety of means to try to identify single motor unit activity. At the simplest, the approach is to use thresholds to identify motor unit activity. Of intermediate data analysis complexity is the use of principal component analysis (PCA, a linear second-order regression technique) to disambiguate individual motor units from the wide field recordings of the arrays, which benefits from the density and numerous recording electrodes. At the highest complexity, they use spike sorting techniques that were developed for Neuropixels, a large-scale electrophysiology probe for cortical neural recordings. Specifically, they use an estimation code called kilosort, which ultimately relies on clustering techniques to separate the multi-electrode recordings into individual spike waveforms.</p><p>The biggest strength of this work is the design and implementation of the hardware technology. It is undoubtedly a major leap forward in our ability to record the electrical activity of motor units. The myomatrix arrays trounce fine-wire EMGs when it comes to the quality of recordings, the number of simultaneous channels that can be recorded, their long-term stability, and resistance to movement artifacts.</p><p>The primary weakness of this work is its reliance on kilosort in circumstances where most of the channels end up picking up the signal from multiple motor units. As the authors quite convincingly show, this setting is a major weakness for fine-wire EMG. They argue that the myomatrix array succeeds in isolating individual motor unit waveforms even in that challenging setting through the application of kilosort.</p><p>Although the authors call the estimated signals as well-isolated waveforms, there is no independent evidence of the accuracy of the spike sorting algorithm. The additional step (spike sorting algorithms like kilosort) to estimate individual motor unit spikes is the part of the work in question. Although the estimation algorithms may be standard practice, the large number of heuristic parameters associated with the estimation procedure are currently tuned for cortical recordings to estimate neural spikes. Even within the limited context of Neuropixels, for which kilosort has been extensively tested, basic questions like issues of observability, linear or nonlinear, remain open. By observability, I mean in the mathematical sense of well-posedness or conditioning of the inverse problem of estimating single motor unit spikes given multi-channel recordings of the summation of multiple motor units. This disambiguation is not always possible. kilosort's validation relies on a forward simulation of the spike field generation, which is then truth-tested against the sorting algorithm. The empirical evidence is that kilosort does better than other algorithms for the test simulations that were performed in the context of cortical recordings using the Neuropixels probe. But this work has adopted kilosort without comparable truth-tests to build some confidence in the application of kilosort with myomatrix arrays.</p></disp-quote><p>Kilosort was developed to analyze spikes from neurons rather than motor units and, as Reviewer #1 correctly points out, despite a number of prior validation studies the conditions under which Kilosort accurately identifies individual neurons are still incompletely understood. Our application of Kilosort to motor unit data therefore demands that we explain which of Kilosort’s assumptions do and do not hold for motor unit data and explain how our modifications of the Kilosort pipeline to account for important differences between neural and muscle recording, which we summarize below and have included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, both here and in the revised paper we emphasize that while the presented spike sorting methods (thresholding, PCA-based clustering, and Kilosort) robustly extract motor unit waveforms, spike sorting of motor units is still an ongoing project. Our future work will further elaborate how differences between cortical and motor unit data should inform approaches to spike sorting as well as develop simulated motor unit datasets that can be used to benchmark spike sorting methods.</p><p>For our current revision, we have added detailed discussion (see “Data analysis: spike sorting”) of the risks and benefits of our use of Kilosort to analyze motor unit data, in each case clarifying how we have modified the Kilosort code with these issues in mind:</p><p>“Modification of spatial masking: Individual motor units contain multiple muscle fibers (each of which is typically larger than a neuron’s soma), and motor unit waveforms can often be recorded across spatially distant electrode contacts as the waveforms propagate along muscle fibers. In contrast, Kilosort - optimized for the much more local signals recorded from neurons - uses spatial masking to penalize templates that are spread widely across the electrode array. Our modifications to Kilosort therefore include ensuring that Kilosort search for motor unit templates across all (and only) the electrode channels inserted into a given muscle. In this Github repository linked above, this is accomplished by setting parameter nops.sigmaMask to infinity, which effectively eliminates spatial masking in the analysis of the 32 unipolar channels recorded from the injectable Myomatrix array schematized in Supplemental Figure 1g. In cases including chronic recording from mice where only a single 8-contact thread is inserted into each muscle, a similar modification can be achieved with a finite value of nops.sigmaMask by setting parameter NchanNear, which represents the number of nearby EMG channels to be included in each cluster, to equal the number of unipolar or bipolar data channels recorded from each thread. Finally, note that in all cases Kilosort parameter NchanNearUp (which defines the maximum number of channels across which spike templates can appear) must be reset to be equal to or less than the total number of Myomatrix data channels.”</p><p>“Allowing more complex spike waveforms: We also modified Kilosort to account for the greater duration and complexity (relative to neural spikes) of many motor unit waveforms. In the code repository linked above, Kilosort 2.5 was modified to allow longer spike templates (151 samples instead of 61), more spatiotemporal PCs for spikes (12 instead of 6), and more left/right eigenvector pairs for spike template construction (6 pairs instead of 3). These modifications were crucial for improving sorting performance in the nonhuman primate dataset shown in Figure 3, and in a subset of the rodent datasets (although they were not used in the analysis of mouse data shown in Fig. 1 and Supplemental Fig. 2a-f).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, as the paper on the latest version of kilosort, namely v4, discusses, differences in the clustering algorithm is the likely reason for kilosort4 performing more robustly than kilosort2.5 (used in the myomatrix paper). Given such dependence on details of the implementation and the use of an older kilosort version in this paper, the evidence that the myomatrix arrays truly record individual motor units under all the types of data obtained is under question.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to modify Kilosort 2.5, which has been used by many research groups to sort spike features, rather than the just-released Kilosort 4.0. Although future studies might directly compare the performance of these two versions on sorting motor unit data, we feel that such an analysis is beyond the scope of this paper, which aims primarily to introduce our electrode technology and demonstrate that a wide range of sorting methods (thresholding, PCA-based waveform clustering, and Kilosort) can all be used to extract single motor units. Additionally, note that because we have made several significant modifications to Kilosort 2.5 as described above, it is not clear what a “direct” comparison between different Kilosort versions would mean, since the procedures we provide here are no longer identical to version 2.5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is an older paper with a similar goal to use multi-channel recording to perform sourcelocalization that the authors have failed to discuss. Given the striking similarity of goals and the divergence of approaches (the older paper uses a surface electrode array), it is important to know the relationship of the myomatrix array to the previous work. Like myomatrix arrays, the previous work also derives inspiration from cortical recordings, in that case it uses the approach of source localization in large-scale EEG recordings using skull caps, but applies it to surface EMG arrays.

A number of groups have developed algorithms for reconstructing the spatial location and spike times of active motor units (Negro et al. 2016; van den Doel, Ascher, and Pai 2008) based on skin-surface recordings, in many cases drawing inspiration from earlier efforts to localize cortical activity using EEG recordings from the scalp (Michel et al. 2004). Our approach differs substantially. In Myomatrix arrays, the close electrode spacing and very close proximity of the contacts to muscle fibers ensure that each Myomatrix channel records from a much smaller volume of tissue than skin-surface arrays. This difference in recording volume in turn creates different challenges for motor unit isolation: compared to skin-surface recordings, Myomatrix recordings include a smaller number of motor units represented on each recording channel, with individual motor units appearing on a smaller fraction of the sensors than typical in a skin-surface recording. Because of this sensordependent difference in motor unit source mixing, different analysis approaches are required for each type of dataset. Specifically, skin-surface EMG analysis methods typically use source-separation approaches that assume that each sensor receives input from most or all of the individual sources within the muscle as is presumably the case in the data. In contrast, the much sparser recordings fromMyomatrix are better decomposed using methods like Kilosort, which are designed to extract waveforms that appear only on a small, spatially-restricted subset of recording channels.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The incompleteness of the evidence that the myomatrix array truly measures individual motor units is limited to the setting where multiple motor units have similar magnitude of signal in most of the channels. In the simpler data setting where one motor dominates in some channel (this seems to occur with some regularity), the myomatrix array is a major advance in our ability to understand the motor output of the nervous system. The paper is a trove of innovations in manufacturing technique, array design, suture and other fixation devices for long-term signal stability, and customization for different muscle sizes, locations, and organisms. The technology presented here is likely to achieve rapid adoption in multiple groups that study motor behavior, and would probably lead to new insights into the spatiotemporal distribution of the motor output under more naturally behaving animals than is the current state of the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this positive evaluation and for the critical comments above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Motoneurons constitute the final common pathway linking central impulse traffic to behavior, and neurophysiology faces an urgent need for methods to record their activity at high resolution and scale in intact animals during natural movement. In this consortium manuscript, Chung et al. introduce highdensity electrode arrays on a flexible substrate that can be implanted into muscle, enabling the isolation of multiple motor units during movement. They then demonstrate these arrays can produce high-quality recordings in a wide range of species, muscles, and tasks. The methods are explained clearly, and the claims are justified by the data. While technical details on the arrays have been published previously, the main significance of this manuscript is the application of this new technology to different muscles and animal species during naturalistic behaviors. Overall, we feel the manuscript will be of significant interest to researchers in motor systems and muscle physiology, and we have no major concerns. A few minor suggestions for improving the manuscript follow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for this positive overall assessment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors perhaps understate what has been achieved with classical methods. To further clarify the novelty of this study, they should survey previous approaches for recording from motor units during active movement. For example, Pflüger &amp; Burrows (J. Exp. Biol. 1978) recorded from motor units in the tibial muscles of locusts during jumping, kicking, and swimming. In humans, Grimby (J. Physiol. 1984) recorded from motor units in toe extensors during walking, though these experiments were most successful in reinnervated units following a lesion. In addition, the authors might briefly mention previous approaches for recording directly from motoneurons in awake animals (e.g., Robinson, J. Neurophys. 1970; Hoffer et al., Science 1981).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have revised the manuscript to discuss these and other prior use of traditional EMG, including here [lines 164-167]:</p><p>“The diversity of applications presented here demonstrates that Myomatrix arrays can obtain highresolution EMG recordings across muscle groups, species, and experimental conditions including spontaneous behavior, reflexive movements, and stimulation-evoked muscle contractions. Although this resolution has previously been achieved in moving subjects by directly recording from motor neuron cell bodies in vertebrates (Hoffer et al. 1981; Robinson 1970; Hyngstrom et al. 2007) and by using fine-wire electrodes in moving insects (Pfluger 1978; Putney et al. 2023), both methods are extremely challenging and can only target a small subset of species and motor unit populations. Exploring additional muscle groups and model systems with Myomatrix arrays will allow new lines of investigation into how the nervous system executes skilled behaviors and coordinates the populations of motor units both within and across individual muscles…</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For chronic preparations, additional data and discussion of the signal quality over time would be useful. Can units typically be discriminated for a day or two, a week or two, or longer?</p><p>A related issue is whether the same units can be tracked over multiple sessions and days; this will be of particular significance for studies of adaptation and learning.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the yields of single units are greatest in the 1-2 weeks immediately following implantation, in chronic preparations we have obtained well-isolated single units up to 65 days post-implant. Anecdotally, in our chronic mouse implants we occasionally see motor units on the same channel across multiple days with similar waveform shapes and patterns of behavior-locked activity. However, because data collection for this manuscript was not optimized to answer this question, we are unable to verify whether these observations actually reflect cross-session tracking of individual motor units. For example, in all cases animals were disconnected from data collection hardware in between recording sessions (which were often separated by multiple intervening days) preventing us from continuously tracking motor units across long timescales. We agree with the reviewer that long-term motor unit tracking would be extremely useful as a tool for examining learning and plan to address this question in future studies.</p><p>We have added a discussion of these issues to the revised manuscript [lines 52-59]:</p><p>“…These methods allow the user to record simultaneously from ensembles of single motor units (Fig. 1c,d) in freely behaving animals, even from small muscles including the lateral head of the triceps muscle in mice (approximately 9 mm in length with a mass of 0.02 g 23). Myomatrix recordings isolated single motor units for extended periods (greater than two months, Supp. Fig. 3e), although highest unit yield was typically observed in the first 1-2 weeks after chronic implantation. Because recording sessions from individual animals were often separated by several days during which animals were disconnected from data collection equipment, we are unable to assess based on the present data whether the same motor units can be recorded over multiple days.”</p><p>Moreover, we have revised Supplemental Figure 3 to show an example of single motor units recorded &gt;2 months after implantation:</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Longevity of Myomatrix recordingsIn addition to isolating individual motor units, Myomatrix arrays also provide stable multi-unit recordings of comparable or superior quality to conventional fine wire EMG….</title><p>(e) Although individual motor units were most frequently recorded in the first two weeks of chronic recordings (see main text), Myomatrix arrays also isolate individual motor units after much longer periods of chronic implantation, as shown here where spikes from two individual motor units (colored boxes in bottom trace) were isolated during locomotion 65 days after implantation.

For chronic implants in small animals, the target muscles (e.g. triceps in mice) are so small that the surgeon often has little choice about the site and angle of array insertion, preventing a systematic analysis of this question. For acute array injections in larger animals such as rhesus macaques, we did not quantify the precise orientation of the arrays (e.g. with ultrasound imaging) or the muscle fibers themselves, again preventing us from drawing strong conclusions on this topic. This question is likely best addressed in acute experiments performed on larger muscles, in which the relative orientations of array threads and muscle fibers can be precisely imaged and systematically varied to address this important issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can muscle fiber conduction velocity be estimated with the arrays?</p></disp-quote><p>We sometimes observe fiber conduction delays up to 0.5 msec as the spike from a single motor unit moves from electrode contact to electrode contact, so spike velocity could be easily estimated given the known spatial separation between electrode contacts. However (closely related to the above question) this will only provide an accurate estimate of muscle fiber conduction velocity if the electrode contacts are arranged parallel to fiber direction, which is difficult to assess in our current dataset. If the arrays are not parallel, this computation will produce an overestimate of conduction velocity, as in the extreme case where a line of electrode contacts arranged perpendicular to the fiber direction might have identical spike arrival times, and therefore appear to have an infinite conduction velocity. Therefore, although Myomatrix arrays can certainly be used to estimate conduction velocity, such estimates should be performed in future studies only in settings where the relative orientation of array threads and muscle fibers can be accurately measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest their device may have applications in the diagnosis of motor pathologies. Currently, concentric needle EMG to record from multiple motor units is the standard clinical method, and they may wish to elaborate on how surgical implantation of the new array might provide additional information for diagnosis while minimizing risk to patients.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have modified the manuscript’s final paragraph accordingly [lines 182-188]:</p><p>“Applying Myomatrix technology to human motor unit recordings, particularly by using the minimally invasive injectable designs shown in Figure 3 and Supplemental Figure 1g,i, will create novel opportunities to diagnose motor pathologies and quantify the effects of therapeutic interventions in restoring motor function. Moreover, because Myomatrix arrays are far more flexible than the rigid needles commonly used to record clinical EMG, our technology might significantly reduce the risk and discomfort of such procedures while also greatly increasing the accuracy with which human motor function can be quantified.

This point relates to another claim made by the authors (correctly) that EMG provides better quality information about muscle motor output in isometric settings than in more dynamic behaviors.

A barb-like structure is formed in traditional fine-wire EMG by bending the wire outside the canula of the needle used to place it within the muscle. But when the wire is pulled out, it is common for the barb to break off and be left behind. This is because of the extreme (thin) aspect ratio of the barb in fine wire EMG and low-cycle fatigue fracture of the wire. From the schematic shown here, the barb design seems to be stubbier and thus less prone to breaking off.

Moreover, in over 100 Myomatrix injections performed in rhesus macaques, there were zero cases in which Myomatrix arrays broke such that electrode material was left behind in the recorded muscle, representing a substantial improvement over traditional fine-wire approaches, in which breakage of the bent wire tip regularly occurs (Loeb and Gans 1986).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The Abstract states the device records &quot;muscle activity at cellular resolution,&quot; which could potentially be read as a claim that single-fiber recording has been achieved.
