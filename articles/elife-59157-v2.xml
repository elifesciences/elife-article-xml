Cross-species transgenesis indicated strong levels of conservation, except in <italic>Molgula</italic>, in gene regulation despite lack of sequence conservation of the enhancers. Developmental system drift in ascidians is thus higher for gene regulation than for gene expression and is impacted not only by phylogenetic distance, but also in a clade-specific manner and unevenly within a network. Finally, considering that <italic>Molgula</italic> is divergent in our analyses, this suggests deep conservation of developmental mechanisms in ascidians after 390 My of separate evolution.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ascidians</kwd><kwd>evo-devo</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>developmental system drift</kwd><kwd>cis-regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. intestinalis</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11-JSV2-007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darras</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-17-CE13-0027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darras</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fondation des Treilles</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Coulcher</surname><given-names>Joshua F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBM2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darras</surname><given-names>Sébastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Developmental regulatory mechanisms for peripheral nervous system formation appear to be conserved in ascidians despite extensive genomic divergence after 390 MY of separate evolution.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of an animal during embryonic development is controlled by the exquisitely precise deployment of regulator and differentiation genes in space and time. This coordinated expression of developmental genes is controlled through gene regulatory networks (GRNs). It has been proposed that these networks are encoded in the genome and control body plan, organs, and cell type formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Levine and Davidson, 2005</xref>). It is thought that, in the course of evolution, essential GRNs or sub-modules have been conserved and control the formation of homologous structures, and that rewiring of the GRNs explains acquisition of novelties and morphological diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davidson and Erwin, 2006</xref>). Understanding control of gene expression is central to comparative developmental approaches. Hence, specific domains of the non-coding genome called <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory modules (CRMs) that serve as docking platforms for transcription factors (TFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buffry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rebeiz and Tsiantis, 2017</xref>) have been deeply studied. It is generally considered that during evolution and species diversification the key functional role of CRMs leads to their persistence and indirectly contributes to maintaining genes together (synteny) and to the existence of conserved non-coding DNA. Indeed, the presence of TF-binding sites (TFBS) in the CRMs for genes with conserved expression and regulation defines regions of conserved sequence; and searching for conservation in non-coding DNA is often used to identify CRMs (phylogenetic footprint: defined as DNA sequence conservation between related species following alignment using tools such as lastz or lagan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brudno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schwartz et al., 2003</xref>]). Such conserved CRMs have been identified in closely related species but also to a fewer extent for very distantly related species (ultraconserved elements); and in many cases, gene regulation relies on the usage of a similar combination of TFBS.</p><p>By contrast, a number of comparative studies performed in several group of animals (chordates, insects, nematodes…) have revealed that development is flexible and that formation of homologous characters may rely on different mechanisms, a process known as developmental system drift (DSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buffry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">True and Haag, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haag, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bradley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">José-Edwards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lusk and Eisen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>). In some cases, key GRN nodes have changed (for example the role of <italic>Snail</italic>/<italic>Slug</italic> genes in vertebrate neural crest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nieto, 2018</xref>]). Focusing on GRN edges — gene expression regulation — various situations have been described, and conservation of CRM sequence at the DNA level does not necessarily correlate with conservation of activity. First, conservation of DNA sequence across species, does not imply a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory activity (for example, ultraconserved elements do not necessarily function as CRMs or may be dispensable for gene expression) or an identical regulatory logic (conserved activity may not involve the same TFBS; conserved CRMs may control different expression patterns depending on the species). On the contrary, DNA sequence conservation is not a necessary feature of CRMs. First, bona fide CRMs may not be conserved, even between closely related species. Second, orthologous CRMs with conserved activity harboring similar combinations of TFBS exist despite an absence of sequence conservation because of extensive turnover of TFBS.</p><p>Ascidians are marine invertebrates that are particularly interesting for investigating the evolution of gene regulation during embryonic development. They belong to the tunicate phylum, and together with vertebrates and cephalochordates (amphioxus) they constitute the chordate super-phylum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemaire, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Satoh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Satoh et al., 2014</xref>). These animals share a body plan characterized by a notochord and a dorsal neural tube during embryonic life. Ascidians, however, took a significantly different evolutionary path from other chordates resulting in divergent morphological, embryological, and genomic features. The development of these animals is fast (hatching of the larva after 18 hr at 18°C in <italic>Ciona robusta</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hotta et al., 2007</xref>]) and stereotyped with very few cells (around 100 cells in gastrulae and 2500 cells in larvae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nishida, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamada and Nishida, 1999</xref>]), and ascidian genomes have undergone compaction and extensive rearrangements when compared to vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dehal et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brozovic et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, ascidians have extensively diversified (around 3000 species) and their genomes have been reshuffled to the point that there is very little DNA conservation outside of the coding parts of the genome (except for closely related species such as the ones from the same genus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shenkar and Swalla, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dardaillon et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, their embryos are virtually identical. This paradoxical situation represents an excellent case to study the evolution and diversification of developmental mechanisms, CRMs and DSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">José-Edwards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stolfi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madgwick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colgan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Takahashi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hudson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Racioppi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oda-Ishii et al., 2005</xref>). Ascidians are simple tractable organisms and are excellent models for functional genomics, in particular with plasmid DNA electroporation that allows the easy generation of thousands of transient transgenic embryos. Moreover, several species at various phylogenetic distances with sequenced and annotated genome are amenable to experimentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dardaillon et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kourakis and Smith, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Several in details developmental studies have already been performed in ascidians, and the comparative conclusions are contrasted (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lemaire, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kourakis and Smith, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hudson and Yasuo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lemaire et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lemaire and biology, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Satoh, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Razy-Krajka and Stolfi, 2019</xref>). First, comparisons with vertebrates suggest that the 550 My of separate evolution has led to significant differences in the early specification of major chordate tissues, such as the notochord or the central nervous system. But deep similarities have been uncovered in the GRN controlling heart or placode formation for example. Second, comparisons between distantly related ascidian species suggest that although the embryological and cellular processes are highly similar, the developmental regulators (TFs and signaling molecules) may change. Third, while conservation of developmental gene expression has been reported even at large phylogenetic distance, the mechanisms for such conservation relies on shared regulatory mechanism (i.e. conserved but shuffled TFBS in possibly non-alignable CRMs), or by contrast on different mechanisms (extensive DSD).</p><p>Comparative studies within ascidians are largely based on data from the most studied species <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> that have been compared with equivalent results obtained from another species belonging to a different family. Importantly, the estimated divergence times with <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> are considerable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delsuc et al., 2018</xref>): 110 My for <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>, 275 My for <italic>Phallusia mammillata</italic> or <italic>Corella inflata</italic> and 390 My for <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic> or <italic>Molgula</italic> species.</p><p>Here, we have tried to expand the phylogenetic range by comparing gene expression regulation in several ascidian species, mainly <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>, <italic>P. mammillata</italic> and <italic>Molgula appendiculata</italic>. We have studied a subset of the GRN controlling caudal peripheral nervous system (PNS) formation. Caudal PNS formation is well understood in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> both at the level of the developmental and cellular processes, and at the level of the molecular regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pasini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feinberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joyce Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horie et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Candiani et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Torrence and Cloney, 1982</xref>). First, dorsal and ventral epidermis midlines are induced as neurogenic territories by Fgf and Bmp signals from the underlying endomesodermal cells, respectively. Then, the number of glutamatergic PNS neurons (caudal epidermal sensory neurons or CESNs) that form in these neurogenic midlines is controlled by the Notch pathway. Molecular markers including a number of developmental regulators have been described for these two key phases of caudal PNS formation. However, their functions and direct interactions have been determined for only a limited number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Focusing on seven midline TFs, we identified CRMs that are active in neurogenic midlines from both <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>P. mammillata</italic>. Reciprocal cross-species transcriptional assays pointed to a strong conservation of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory logic between these species despite a lack of sequence conservation in these CRMs. Conserved activity was also observed in two additional species that both belong to the Phlebobranchia order. However, conserved activity was observed for only a minority of CRMs for some nodes of this GRN in <italic>M. appendiculata</italic> that belongs to the Solidobranchia order. Surprisingly, CRMs isolated from another Solidobranchia, <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>, did show remarkable activity in the <italic>P. mammillata</italic> midlines but not in <italic>M. appendiculata</italic>. Overall, our results suggest deep conservation of gene regulation in caudal PNS formation within ascidians and advocate for broad phylogenetic sampling in comparative studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of midline CRMs in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic></title><p>As described above, caudal PNS formation is initiated by two inductive events: Fgf9/16/20 as the inducer of the dorsal neurogenic midline (DML) and Admp as the inducer of the ventral neurogenic midline (VML). While function and regulatory interactions have been determined for several genes, direct interactions, and associated CRMs are unknown for the most part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Joyce Tang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>). Here, we have focused our work on seven TFs that are expressed in both ventral and dorsal caudal neurogenic midlines (VDML) and for which we have already described regulatory interactions that generated a provisional GRN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>). These genes are — ordered by their onset of expression in VDML — <italic>Msx</italic>, <italic>Ascl.b</italic>, <italic>Klf1/2/4</italic>, <italic>Nkxtun3</italic>, <italic>Tox</italic>, <italic>Dlx.c</italic> and <italic>Bhlhtun1.

We aimed at identifying regions of genomic DNA that behave as midline CRMs. Previous work in the ascidian community has shown that selecting a few kb in conserved non-coding DNA generally upstream of the gene of interest had high chance of identifying most, if not all, regulatory regions. We thus selected upstream regions of up to 7 kb containing phylogenetic footprints between <italic>C. robusta</italic> and <italic>C. savignyi</italic> that we placed upstream of the minimal promoter of the <italic>Ciinte.Fog</italic> gene and <italic>LacZ</italic> as a reporter, and tested in vivo before further reduction in size. After our work was performed, open chromatin regions from ATAC-seq data were identified from whole embryos up to neurula stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madgwick et al., 2019</xref>) and it turned out that most of the midline CRMs that we identified correspond to conserved regions with enrichment in ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).

We have previously described a Nodal/Otx-regulated CRM located immediately upstream of the gene responsible for the early expression in DML precursors (Ci-msxb-b6.5 line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that the entire upstream intergenic region is active early in the DML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) but also later in the VML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A distal fragment, up1, adjacent to the early CRM was active in both VML and DML at tailbud stages but inactive at gastrula/neurula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). These results show that the seemingly continuous expression of <italic>Msx</italic> in the DML is in fact under the control of two separate CRMs that are likely regulated differently (see below). We next generated various deletions of this VDML CRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We could observe VDML activity for most regions, with generally a decrease of strength when the size of the fragment was reduced, or a lack of activity. The smallest fragment active in VDML, up10, was 291 bp long. Interestingly, two overlapping regions, up2 and up11, were active only in the DML. Consequently, even if we did not identify a CRM specific for the VML, this deletion analysis suggests that ventral and dorsal expressions of <italic>Msx</italic> are uncoupled, a conclusion in agreement with the proposed role of <italic>Msx</italic> as an upstream regulator of the neurogenic GRN and an integrator of dorsal and ventral inducing cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>). This scenario is further supported by the presence of conserved TFBS for candidate ventral and dorsal regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>; Material and methods). Ciinte.Msx-up10 contains two putative Msx-binding sites that could account for activation in the DML.

There are previous examples in ascidians that clearly show that such conserved activity relies on conserved upstream regulators but that extensive binding site turnover explains the lack of sequence conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madgwick et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colgan et al., 2019</xref>).

Our approach was simply based on isolating conserved regions (with <italic>C. savignyi</italic>) close to the gene of interest. Similarly to numerous reports, active CRMs were found mostly within the first few kilobases immediately upstream of the gene (a single region was located downstream). Interestingly, the largest CRMs that we have tested contain activity for several expression domains where the gene is expressed and do not usually display ectopic activity. We further reduced the size of these CRMs through classical 'promoter bashing' guided by sequence conservation. Activity in different domains usually partitioned during this deletion process while we have not documented this in detail (for example for <italic>Dlx.c</italic>, palp expression in the large region Ciinte.Dlx.c-A2 is lost from the small region Ciinte.Dlx.c-upstream; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). Interestingly, the conserved active CRMs that we have identified systematically matched with open chromatin as determined by enrichment in ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Madgwick et al., 2019</xref>). Tissue- and stage-specific ATAC-seq data should certainly facilitate active CRM discovery and allow exhaustive identification of CRMs regulating a given expression pattern.</p><p>Although our approach was not exhaustive, important conclusions could be drawn. First, the seemingly continuous expression of <italic>Msx</italic> in the b6.5 lineage and its derivative, the DML, is actually under the control of two separate CRM: an early proximal element active from the 64-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>) and a late distal element active from gastrula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). TFBS analysis using our current understanding of <italic>Msx</italic> regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) supports a model of maintenance of gene expression by autoregulation whereby Msx protein produced through the early proximal CRM activates late <italic>Msx</italic> expression via the distal CRM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, we could classify the genes in two classes: <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> with uncoupling of regulation in dorsal and ventral midlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>); and <italic>Klf1/2/4</italic>, <italic>Nkxtun3</italic>, <italic>Tox</italic> and <italic>Dlx.c</italic> regulated in a 'pan-midline' manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">4</xref>). These observations are in agreement with previous predictions based on regulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Feinberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Waki et al., 2015</xref>): <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> are upstream regulators that integrate inputs from the dorsal and ventral midline inducers and regulate the expression of the other four downstream factors. Surprisingly, we did not identify VML-specific CRMs. While the reason is still unclear, a possible explanation would be that there is a physical overlap between VML and DML CRMs with the DML being embedded in the VML CRM. Prediction of TFBS for putative <italic>trans</italic> acting factors in the <italic>Msx</italic> VDML minimal CRM (Ciinte.Msx-up10) supports this hypothesis: binding sites for dorsal and ventral factors are intermingled or overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Targeted mutagenesis of these putative binding sites should enable testing such an hypothesis. Third, analysis of conserved TFBS in small active CRMs provides interesting hypotheses that will need to be tested experimentally using finer and possibly quantitative approaches. Although both <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> are likely to integrate initial inducing cues, they do not seem to be regulated similarly: <italic>Msx</italic> is possibly a direct Bmp signaling target in the VML like vertebrate <italic>Msx</italic> in some tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Esteves et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brugger et al., 2004</xref>), but <italic>Ascl.b</italic> is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). <italic>Klf1/2/4</italic> and <italic>Nkxtun3</italic> are possibly directly activated by Msx, and <italic>Tox</italic> by Ascl.b. Finally, it is most likely that additional TFs remain to be identified to understand gene regulation in the VDML since the activity of several CRMs and deletions cannot be explained using the TFs that we currently know.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>High conservation of PNS formation in Phlebobranchia</title><p>Expression patterns, overexpression experiments and CRMs identification in <italic>P. mammillata</italic> showed high similarities with <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>).

Since non-coding DNA does not show sequence conservation, for example between <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>P. mammillata</italic> CRMs that we identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>), it is difficult to define homologous CRMs. This is likely explained by extensive turnover of the binding sites for upstream transcription factors, a situation that we have previously described for the regulation of the early <italic>Msx</italic> CRMs by Otx and Nodal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Roure et al., 2014</xref>). The newly identified <italic>Msx</italic> CRM from <italic>A. mentula</italic> actually contains a region dense in Otx and Smad binding sites like their counterparts in <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic> (not shown). This phenomenon has been described for other CRMs between <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and other species and outside ascidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buffry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Colgan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oda-Ishii et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Given the modular nature of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation and the increased recognition of the existence of 'redundant', 'shadow' or distributed enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barolo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cannavò et al., 2016</xref>), namely multiple CRMs with seemingly similar activity for a given gene, caution has to be taken for pairwise comparisons in TFBS composition of genomic pieces originating from different species. We could nevertheless apply the above approach for two other CRMs. In both <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic>, the late <italic>Msx</italic> CRMs with VDML activity are distal and share binding sites for Msx and Bmp regulation (SBE and BRE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). CRMs for <italic>Tox</italic> are localized upstream, close to the transcription start in both species (at least for one of the two isoforms in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic>), and are characterized by an enrichment in E-box sites, possibly mediating activation by Ascl.b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). These observations are in agreement with conserved regulation at the base of Phlebobranchia and we propose that the above CRMs are orthologous.</p><p>We thus aimed at using such a strategy using candidate orthologous minimal midline CRMs to define shared motifs and identify <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. However, the 'swap' and overexpression experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> refrained us from pursuing since such CRMs were not robust to phylogenetic and genetic perturbations. Whether these observations are general to ascidian minimal CRMs remains to be explored. A possible interpretation could be linked to the modular nature of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation. The largest CRMs that we tested are likely to contain most, if not all, the regulatory information for VDML expression. By contrast, shorter elements contain only a subset of the regulatory information, and would consequently not behave identically to the gene following genetic challenge. The fact, that such short elements may not be active when placed in another species while larger regions are, suggests that drift has occurred at the level of individual modules making them silent. Independently of our current understanding of this phenomenom, reciprocal in vivo transcriptional assays between <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic> offer a direct way to identify and determine the properties of the DNA elements that confer robustness.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Global conservation of PNS formation in ascidians?</title><p>In situ hybridization in two members of the Stolidobranchia revealed strong conservation in gene expression. However, while the patterns were virtually identical between <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic>, we could detect several differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). First, in both <italic>Molgula</italic> and <italic>Halocynthia</italic>, the genes <italic>Ascl.b</italic> and <italic>Tox</italic> were not expressed throughout the VDML but had a spotted expression. Such an expression pattern is correlated with the number and location of future PNS neurons. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref> and already known for <italic>Halocynthia</italic>, presumptive neurons labeled by <italic>Celf3.a</italic> expression are present in a very small number and only in the posterior tail, at least on the ventral side, when compared to <italic>Ciona</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pasini et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohtsuka et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yagi and Makabe, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akanuma et al., 2002</xref>). This would suggest a variation at the level of the Stolidobranchia family and that the function of <italic>Ascl.b</italic> and <italic>Tox</italic> would possibly be different from the other 'pan-midline' transcription factors and from their orthologs in Phlebrobranchia. Interestingly, in Phlebobranchia, we have seen above a possible direct regulation of <italic>Tox</italic> by Ascl.b, suggesting that PNS formation in ascidians could be controlled by the following VDML sub-networks: <italic>Ascl.b</italic> and <italic>Tox</italic> on one side, and <italic>Msx</italic>, <italic>Klf1/2/4</italic>, <italic>Nkxtun3</italic>, and <italic>Dlx.c</italic> on the other side. Second, in <italic>Molgula</italic>, <italic>Nkxtun3</italic> expression was restricted to the posterior VDML. Third, <italic>Moappe.Dlx.c</italic> was not expressed in the VDML, while palp expression was conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). These two latter observations suggest a genus- or species-specific variation.</p><p>When focusing on gene regulation, we detected again stronger conservation within Phlebobranchia than between Phlebobranchia and Stolidobranchia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This is particularly true when considering large CRMs of several kilobases that have better chance of capturing the widest regulatory information. This difference between ascidian orders could be the result of increased drift because of larger evolutionary distance and/or because of discrete changes linked to taxonomical level change. We were nevertheless surprised to see that CRMs from <italic>Halocynthia</italic> were active in midlines when tested in <italic>Phallusia</italic> but not in <italic>Molgula</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Although we have obtained these results on a limited number of CRMs and while we have not tested CRMs from <italic>M. appendiculata</italic> whose genome has not been sequenced, we believe that, taking expression patterns into account, <italic>M. appendiculata</italic> is the divergent species among all species that we have used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Our hypothesis is in agreement with previous CRM swap experiments between <italic>Ciona</italic> and other <italic>Molgula</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stolfi et al., 2014</xref>), with the facts that <italic>Molgula</italic> is a fast evolving genus within ascidians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delsuc et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alié et al., 2018</xref>) and that Molgulids is a family where loss of chordate body plan has occurred several times independently (tail-less larvae) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, we did not detect obvious correlations between points of conservation in gene regulation and gene expression or GRN structure. <italic>Nkxtun3</italic> and <italic>Dlx.c</italic> are the two genes whose CRMs are active in <italic>Molgula</italic> midlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). They are not the genes with the best conserved expression; and while <italic>Dlx.c</italic> is in a downstream position of the network, <italic>Nkxtun3</italic> has an intermediate position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roure and Darras, 2016</xref>). Interestingly, in <italic>M. appendiculata Nkxtun3</italic> is found only in posterior VDML and <italic>Dlx.c</italic> is not expressed in the VDML, but CRMs from both <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic> were active throughout <italic>M. appendiculata</italic> VDML. Consequently, it is likely that upstream factors are likely expressed throughout the VDML and that changes in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory landscapes have occurred for both genes in <italic>M. appendiculata</italic>. Similarly, a CRM from <italic>Halocynthia Tox</italic> (expressed in a spotted manner) was active throughout the VDML in <italic>Phallusia</italic>.</p><p>Given the phylogenetic positions of the species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>) and the divergent behavior of <italic>Molgula</italic> (see above), a parsimonious analysis of our results (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) implies that PNS gene expression and regulation are globally conserved in ascidians despite extensive genomic divergence in the course of almost 400 My of evolution. This is a similar time window that separates mammals from teleosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delsuc et al., 2018</xref>), and several developmental processes including CRM activity have been shown conserved between mouse and zebrafish for example, or even between more divergent vertebrate species (zebrafish and lamprey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hockman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fisher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gehrke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McGaughey et al., 2008</xref>). While some of the cited examples refer to CRM conserved activity despite lack of sequence conservation, in vertebrates CRMs are usually associated with sequence conservation. In ascidians, the situation is the opposite with an absence of non-coding DNA conservation and lack of synteny.</p><p>We would like to conclude by stressing two operational points for comparative studies in ascidians that may be relevant more broadly. The CRMs are interesting tools to probe gene regulation especially during swap experiments in species with efficient transgenesis. However, the lack of fidelity of small CRMs that we have uncovered may blur comparative conclusions. Finally, the choice of species for comparisons is also essential. While divergent species are highly informative to understand evolution at work, they may lead to inaccurate conclusions at a broader level. Although the established model species <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>H. roretzi</italic> appear to be relevant species to instruct the status of ancestral ascidians, we would advocate for broad taxonomic sampling in functional comparative studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Embryo obtention and manipulation</title><p>Adults from <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> (formerly referred to <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> type B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brunetti et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Ascidia mentula</italic> were provided by the Centre de Ressources Biologiques Marines in Roscoff (EMBRC-France). <italic>Phallusia fumigata</italic> and <italic>Molgula appendiculata</italic> were provided by the Centre de Ressources Biologiques Marines in Banyuls-sur-mer (EMBRC-France). <italic>Phallusia mammillata</italic> were collected during trawling by professional fishermen in the Banyuls-sur-mer area.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Because of the extensive textual revisions requested by all reviewers, we refer you to the detailed reviews for specific changes that should be make.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary</p><p>In this study, Coulcher et al. analyzed the cis-regulatory regions for determinants of dorsal and ventral peripheral nervous system (PNS) in several species of ascidians. Starting with the Phlebobranch Ciona intestinalis, they identified active enhancers for 6 out 7 transcription factor-coding genes that were previously characterized to various extent. They showed that homologous transcription factors have conserved expression patterns in a distant Phlebobranch, <italic>P. mammillata</italic>, and identified corresponding cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that drive reporter gene expression in the caudal PNS. Using cross-species reporter gene expression assays, between <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>P. mammillata</italic>, but also in <italic>Ascidia mentula</italic> and <italic>Phallusia fumigata</italic>, the authors conclude that the identified regulatory DNAs have largely conserved enhancer activities within Phlebobranchs. However, minimal elements showed deprecated activity in cross-species assays, and the Ciona elements also responded differently from endogenous genes in response to perturbations of trans-acting regulators in C. intestinalis.</p><p>Next, the authors inspected the spatial and temporal expression patterns of homologous genes in two Stolidobranch species, <italic>Molgula appendiculata</italic> and <italic>Halocynthia roretzi</italic>. They observed a reduced number of caudal epidermal sensory neurons (CESN) in <italic>M. appendiculata</italic> and a restriction to the tip of the tail, which was consistent with restricted patterns of <italic>Nkx</italic>, <italic>Ascl</italic> and <italic>Tox</italic>. Finally, the authors performed CRM swaps between Phlebobranchs and Stolidobranch species, which represent longer evolutionary distances, and showed preliminary evidence that Stolidobranch species interpreted Phlebobranch sequences differently.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study explored the regulatory mechanisms for the peripheral nervous system of ascidians from an evolutionary viewpoint. The authors of this study performed an impressive suite of laboratory experiments and bioinformatic analyses, covering four ascidian species with more than 250 million years of evolutionary divergence. They report possible conservation of the regulatory mechanism over this evolutionary period, while they revealed some dissimilarities. I found a large value of publishing this study, while I recognized quite a few problematic descriptions of their data, lacking objective and quantitative grounds. I suggest a substantial revision of the manuscript to enhance the objectivity of their arguments based on the points listed below.</p><p>1) In many parts of the manuscript, the results are described in too obscure expressions, including “simple”, “conserved”, “divergent”, “typical”, “very few”, “fast”, and “large” that do not accompany quantitative or comparative information. For example, the word “conserved” appears seven times in the Introduction, and they do not provide any logical and testable meaning. Those parts of the manuscript should be carefully rewritten to logically convey the intension.</p><p>2) Among vertebrates, we already know quite a few cases of evolutionary conservation of regulatory mechanisms over 300 million years, e.g., between mouse and zebrafish. To me, the scope of this study seems confined to urochordate biology and evolution, but it is advisable to discuss the conservation levels across the ascidian and other lineages along the timeline.</p><p>3) The citation in paragraph four of the Introduction should be limited to the references about the divergence time, that is, Delsuc et al., 2018.</p><p>4) What ascertains the orthology between genes and genomic regions of different species analyzed in this study? State if not done in the manuscript.</p><p>5) The use of the words “player” and “actors” are too abstract and should be refrained.</p><p>6) Clarify what “phylogenetic footprints” means.</p><p>7) Enrichment of particular genomic regions revealed by ATAC-seq should be called “enrichment”, but not “peak”.</p><p>8) Splice isoforms are mentioned only for Tox. Consider mentioning the isoform multiplicity for the other genes, if any.</p><p>9) The word “manuscript” in subsection “Expression and regulation of caudal PNS genes” should be replace with “study”.</p><p>10) In subsection “Expression and regulation of caudal PNS genes”, is it clear from which species the sequence of the recombinant Bmp4 protein is derived? State which species, if not included in Materials and methods.</p><p>11) It was not clear to me what this part means “if Molgula as a divergent species is a valid hypothesis”. The word “divergent” without any quantitative basis does not provide any chance for validating it. This part needs to be elaborated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Coulcher et al. present an in-depth identification of PNS midline enhancers in divergent ascidians. They use cross-species transgenesis to obtain evidence that enhancer DNAs with very little sequence conservation nonetheless produce similar patterns of gene expression. The study is exhaustive and exhausting and should be of interest to specialists in the field, but the authors will need to rework the presentation in order to engage a broader audience.</p><p>A few specific comments follow:</p><p>The identification of separate early and late Msx enhancers for expression in the b6.5 lineage is a highlight of the study and should be emphasized in a revised manuscript. The authors should discuss why separate enhancers are used and whether they are likely to interact with different classes of sequence-specific transcription factors.</p><p>It is curious that the authors identified dorsal-specific midline enhancers but no ventral-specific enhancers. They do not provide a very compelling explanation for this finding. The ventral midline PNS might be a &quot;throwback&quot; to simpler Deuterostomes that contain both dorsal and ventral nerve cords.</p><p>I'm not convinced that the authors have done the most thorough job of identifying TFs that recognize the different enhancers. As a result, it remains an open question whether divergent enhancers use a similar logic to produce similar expression profiles, or if there have been substantive changes in the gene regulatory networks governing the specification of ventral midline in divergent ascidians.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a very rich study, reporting on heroic efforts to characterize gene expression patterns, enhancers and their activity across multiple species of ascidians, while focusing on the peripheral nervous system, which is of broad interest. The specific data reported in this manuscript will thus be of interest for both specialists in the field, and outside.</p><p>For example, it is interesting to identify distinct ventral vs. dorsal elements for genes like <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic>, but pan-midline elements for <italic>Tox</italic> and <italic>Klf</italic>, which indeed suggests that the more &quot;upstream&quot; factors integrate distinct regional inputs, while they a common logic controls the core midline factors. However this model needs further support and clarification.</p><p>Besides the large amount of specific new information, it is quite intriguing to observe that minimal enhancers are more likely to fail in cross-species assays, and show more discrepancies with endogenous gene expression in experimental conditions that perturb trans-acting factors. These observations suggest that, even when the activity entire cis-regulatory systems is conserved, individual elements are subjected to drift, which is in keeping with the lack of sequence conservation and could be discussed more explicitly in the light of emerging concepts about complex cis-regulatory systems (e.g. so-called shadow enhancers).</p><p>Finally, a key merit of the comparison with Stolidobranch is to show evolutionary changes in gene expression patterns (e.g. restriction to the tip of the tail in Molgula, reduced domain of neurogenic competence in Halocynthia), in addition to CRM drift, which has been documented in several other contexts before. The two are difficult to disentangle though, and this last section seems more preliminary; the paper would thus probably benefit from focusing on the sections on Phlebobranchs.</p><p>In sum, this is a very rich manuscript with numerous strengths, which would nonetheless benefit from extensive modifications for clarity, a better focus and more in-depth analysis of key points as detailed below.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The paper is often very difficult to follow, especially because critical information regarding endogenous and reporter gene expression, ATAC-seq peaks, deletions and reporter activity are scattered across different figures, especially when cross-species comparisons are evoked. Specific cases are listed below:</p><p>Figure 1F: difficult to relate the deletions to the peaks of conservation and accessibility if they are not aligned.</p><p>Indicate clearly (in main text and figure) what is the core promoter used.</p><p>The arrangement of figures makes it very difficult to follow. E.g. in Supplementary file 2, <italic>Klf</italic> comes after Nkx-tun3 but it comes before in the text.</p><p>Figure 3—figure supplement 2: <italic>Klf</italic> very hard to connect the pattern, with the ATAC-seq data, with the deletions and the scoring. There should be a way to better integrate these informations and make the figures easier to follow.</p><p>Nomenclature needs to be consistent across text and figures, especially for gene names (Tox vs CAGF, Dll.C vs. Dlx.c, etc…). Use published guidelines, and for TFs, the names used in the latest version of the genome.</p><p>Not clear from Figure 5 and supplement what the authors mean by &quot;The topology of early and late <italic>Msx</italic> CRMs is strikingly similar between <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>P. mammillata</italic>&quot;.</p><p>Main conclusion on &quot;strong similarities&quot; would be better illustrated by placing the diagram representing genes and CRMs of <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>P. mammillata</italic> side-by-side to highlight said similarities, and give the reader a chance to evaluate the differences.</p><p>Summary table of stages and tissues stained for each gene between species would be useful to compare patterns across species. And differences could be presented as heatmaps, similar to other panels in the paper (e.g. Figure 7C). Currently the extensive in situ panels are very nice but difficult to compare to each other.</p><p>An important aspect of the paper is the relative contribution of individual CRMs to endogenous expression. While there is evidence that genes like <italic>Msx.b</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> are regulated differently, and part through separate elements in the ventral and dorsal midline, this should still be clarified. Specifically:</p><p>The importance of individual elements is never tested using CRISPR/Cas9 mutations followed by in situ hybridization, while this would strongly complement some of the conclusions based exclusively on reporter assays. For no gene is it entirely clear how the identified elements contribute to endogenous regulation, also since there are several other peaks in the regions that were not included in the analysis. E.g. <italic>Dlx.c</italic> had &gt;14 peaks in the ATAC-seq data, out of which one (1) was included in the reporter constructs.</p><p>The existence of separate vs. shared CRMs is intriguing and interesting, except this is not as clear for <italic>Ascl.b</italic>, since both CiAshdo4 and CiAshdo5 are still active in the VML, and an intronic accessible region has not been tested. Moreover, Nkx.C is presented as an upstream regulator and absent from the <italic>Msxb</italic> GRN in Roure and Darras, 2016, but here it is incorporated in the core midline PNS network.

The authors of this study performed an impressive suite of laboratory experiments and bioinformatic analyses, covering four ascidian species with more than 250 million years of evolutionary divergence. They report possible conservation of the regulatory mechanism over this evolutionary period, while they revealed some dissimilarities. I found a large value of publishing this study, while I recognized quite a few problematic descriptions of their data, lacking objective and quantitative grounds. I suggest a substantial revision of the manuscript to enhance the objectivity of their arguments based on the points listed below.</p><p>1) In many parts of the manuscript, the results are described in too obscure expressions, including “simple”, “conserved”, “divergent”, “typical”, “very few”, “fast”, and “large” that do not accompany quantitative or comparative information. For example, the word “conserved” appears seven times in the Introduction, and they do not provide any logical and testable meaning. Those parts of the manuscript should be carefully rewritten to logically convey the intension.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the text trying to be more precise and specific by bringing additional information and references. We have also added two summary figures (Figure 8—figure supplement 3 and Figure 10) that allow to evaluate the degree of conservation in a visual way.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Among vertebrates, we already know quite a few cases of evolutionary conservation of regulatory mechanisms over 300 million years, e.g., between mouse and zebrafish. To me, the scope of this study seems confined to urochordate biology and evolution, but it is advisable to discuss the conservation levels across the ascidian and other lineages along the timeline.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a short reference to comparative studies in vertebrates in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The citation in paragraph four of the Introduction should be limited to the references about the divergence time, that is, Delsuc et al., 2018.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What ascertains the orthology between genes and genomic regions of different species analyzed in this study? State if not done in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>To identify orthologous genes, we have performed reciprocal blast and used phylogenies available on the Aniseed database (for <italic>Ciona</italic>, <italic>Phallusia</italic> and <italic>Halocynthia</italic>). For <italic>Molgula appendiculata</italic>, we have only performed reciprocal blast but no proper phylogenetic analysis. This has been added in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>In our study, we have not directly adressed the issue of orthologous genomic regions. We have guided our choice for CRM candidates by DNA sequence conservation in non-coding regions. These “phylogenetic footprints” could be obtained from sister species (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> and <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>; <italic>Phallusia mammillata</italic> and <italic>Phallusia fumigata</italic>). However, non-coding DNA does not align between <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic>. This is one of the difficulty and interest of comparative CRM studies in ascidians. We have discussed this aspect in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The use of the words “player” and “actors” are too abstract and should be refrained.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used more specific terms in all instances.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Clarify what “phylogenetic footprints” means.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Enrichment of particular genomic regions revealed by ATAC-seq should be called “enrichment”, but not “peak”.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Splice isoforms are mentioned only for Tox. Consider mentioning the isoform multiplicity for the other genes, if any.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Tox</italic> is the only case with evidence for isoforms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The word “manuscript” in subsection “Expression and regulation of caudal PNS genes” should be replace with “study”.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) In subsection “Expression and regulation of caudal PNS genes”, is it clear from which species the sequence of the recombinant Bmp4 protein is derived? State which species, if not included in Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used recombinant Bmp4 protein from zebrafish. This was included in the Material and Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It was not clear to me what this part means “if Molgula as a divergent species is a valid hypothesis”. The word “divergent” without any quantitative basis does not provide any chance for validating it. This part needs to be elaborated.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry of the confusion, we have modified the text. The divergent status of <italic>Molgula</italic> was developed in a previous paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Coulcher et al. present an in-depth identification of PNS midline enhancers in divergent ascidians. They use cross-species transgenesis to obtain evidence that enhancer DNAs with very little sequence conservation nonetheless produce similar patterns of gene expression. The study is exhaustive and exhausting and should be of interest to specialists in the field, but the authors will need to rework the presentation in order to engage a broader audience.</p><p>A few specific comments follow:</p><p>The identification of separate early and late Msx enhancers for expression in the b6.5 lineage is a highlight of the study and should be emphasized in a revised manuscript. The authors should discuss why separate enhancers are used and whether they are likely to interact with different classes of sequence-specific transcription factors.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have examined TFBSs for the active CRMs that we have identified in this study (see below). An interesting hypothesis (schematized in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) is as follows. The early/proximal <italic>Msx</italic> CRM is activated following neural induction and allows expression in DML precursors. The late/distal CRM would initiate <italic>Msx</italic> expression in DML at gastrula/neurula stages by Msx itself.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is curious that the authors identified dorsal-specific midline enhancers but no ventral-specific enhancers. They do not provide a very compelling explanation for this finding. The ventral midline PNS might be a &quot;throwback&quot; to simpler Deuterostomes that contain both dorsal and ventral nerve cords.</p></disp-quote><p>We were also disappointed of not finding ventral-specific enhancers for <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> through rather extensive deletion analyses. We had proposed in the first version of the manuscript that ventral and dorsal CRMs were overlapping. Following the reviewer's suggestion for TFBS identification (see below), we now show in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 that candidate sites for ventral TFs are more abundant than sites for dorsal TFs, and that both types of sites are intermingled or even overlapping. It is thus possible that “by chance” we have eliminated ventral TFBS and revealed dorsal-specific activity, while other deletions have eliminated both dorsal and ventral TFBS. Site-specific mutagenesis will be required to test this hypothesis.</p><p>Regarding the evolutionary interpretation of the ventral <italic>vs</italic> dorsal PNS, we feel it is still difficult comparing ascidian tail PNS with nervous systems from echinoderms and hemichordates. However, the existence of a Bmp-induced ventral neurogenic territory is evident in both ascidians and amphioxus, suggesting an ancestral origin at least in chordates. Since this territory does not exist in vertebrates, it is likely that it has been lost. In our group, we are currently working on a comparative project on ascidians and amphioxus to test the hypothesis that this ancestral ventral program has been co-opted at the dorsal neural plate border and has led to the emergence of vertebrate neural crest and placodes. An attractive hypothesis would be that sites for dorsal TFs (<italic>Msx</italic> for example) have appeared in an “ancestral” ventral neurogenic epidermis enhancer. However, the results that we present in the current study do not bring results strong enough to discuss this evolutionary aspect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I'm not convinced that the authors have done the most thorough job of identifying TFs that recognize the different enhancers. As a result, it remains an open question whether divergent enhancers use a similar logic to produce similar expression profiles, or if there have been substantive changes in the gene regulatory networks governing the specification of ventral midline in divergent ascidians.</p></disp-quote><p>We also thought that comparing TFBS composition of enhancers with conserved activity but originating from different species would be straightforward in determining whether the regulatory logic is conserved or not. We did not show any data on this aspect in the first version because of the following weaknesses:</p><p>– the caudal PNS GRN is still poor, mainly built from expression data, overexpression of midline TFs and loss-of-function of a few genes. Hence, direct regulations and the identity of TFs that are actually involved are not known.</p><p>– gene regulation is modular with redundant, shadow or distributed enhancers. Given that DNA sequence conservation between ascidian species from different genera (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> and <italic>Phallusia mammillata</italic> for example) is virtually absent, it is not possible to define orthologous CRMs. While topology, sequence conservation (between closely related species: <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> and <italic>Ciona savignyi</italic>) and accessibility (ATAC-seq) could be used to propose orthologous CRMS; we are not sure that we will be comparing equivalent functional units.</p><p>We nevertheless did our best to address this question:</p><p>– we have gathered available information and proposed some hypotheses for gene regulation to improve the VDML GRN (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and Materials and methods)</p><p>– we have gathered TF binding specificities (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) and mapped TFBS on CRMs aligned with their counterpart from closely related species (<italic>C. intestinalis</italic> and <italic>C. savignyi</italic> alignment on one side, and <italic>P. mammillata</italic> and <italic>P. fumigata</italic> alignment on the other side). We have restricted our analysis to CRMs smaller than 1 kb and to TFBS that would be conserved in the alignments (assuming that regulatory logic is conserved for close species).</p><p>This analysis in <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> allowed us to:</p><p>– propose some direct regulations for a number of genes</p><p>– suggest that each gene of the VDML network is regulated differently (in particular, the early genes <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> do not seem to be regulated similarly)</p><p>– propose that unidentified TFs are likely to play important roles</p><p>Unfortunately, given that our in vivo analysis of CRMs is not exhaustive, we could make comparisons between <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic> for only 2 genes. However, this gave support for a similar logic in both species: <italic>Msx</italic> (direct activation by Bmp signaling in the VML and by <italic>Msx</italic> in the DML) and <italic>Tox</italic> (direct activation by <italic>Ascl.b</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Major comments</p><p>The paper is often very difficult to follow, especially because critical information regarding endogenous and reporter gene expression, ATAC-seq peaks, deletions and reporter activity are scattered across different figures, especially when cross-species comparisons are evoked. Specific cases are listed below:</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that the rather large amount of data that we present may make the reading difficult. We had tried to present the actual data without simplification, while trying at the same time to keep systematic graphical representations for clarity. We have now followed reviewer's advice and made several changes that are described below. We have also added two new summary figures (Figure 8—figure supplement 3 and Figure 10) that schematize the comparative part. We also have added new analyses (TFBS, see below) that we hope will not make the paper even more confusing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1F: difficult to relate the deletions to the peaks of conservation and accessibility if they are not aligned.</p></disp-quote><p>Conservation and accessibility have now been reported in all schemes describing various CRMs and their activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Indicate clearly (in main text and figure) what is the core promoter used.</p></disp-quote><p>In all cases, except 3 CRMs (Ciinte.Nkxtun3-upstream, Ciinte.Ascl.b-upstream and Ciinte.Bhlhtun1-upstream), the core promoter is the one of <italic>Ciinte.Fog</italic> (Rothbacher et al., 2007). This information can be found in Materials and methods and Supplementary file 1. We have now added a sentence at the beginning of the Results section. We have chosen not to repeat this redundant information in every figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The arrangement of figures makes it very difficult to follow.

The idea that regulatory landscapes were similar emerged from the position of the CRMs active in VDML relative to the gene of interest, and from the <italic>Msx</italic> locus. While the <italic>Msx</italic> case is striking, the position of CRMs for other genes (within 3 kb upstream) might correspond to real similarities, but might be simply due to the fact that this is where we looked for them in the first place. Since other VDML CRMs might exist (see below), we removed this idea of “regulatory landscape”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary table of stages and tissues stained for each gene between species would be useful to compare patterns across species.

While there is evidence that genes like Msx.b and Ascl.b are regulated differently, and part through separate elements in the ventral and dorsal midline, this should still be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>We do agree with the reviewer that transcriptional regulation is complex and involves multiple CRMs that may or may not have similar activity in time and space. But we did not claim that we have exhaustively analyzed the CRM landscape for PNS expression of our genes of interest. The reviewer has to keep in mind that resources or tools to explore CRMs is still limited in ascidians: ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq are just beginning to be used, others techniques like Chromosome Conformation Capture are not yet established. Very little was known for gene regulation and <italic>cis</italic>-regulation of the genes we studied; and we have only used phylogenetic footprints and in vivo transcriptional assays. We have nevertheless reached interesting conclusions that together with cross-species tests bring new hypotheses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The importance of individual elements is never tested using CRISPR/Cas9 mutations followed by in situ hybridization, while this would strongly complement some of the conclusions based exclusively on reporter assays.</p></disp-quote><p>This is obviously the next step that we would like to reach. However, CRISPR/Cas9 has proven very frustrating in our hands, possibly because a higher polymorphism rate in <italic>C. intestinalis</italic> compared to <italic>C. robusta</italic>. In addition, we have so far reached at best 30% mutagenesis rate using electroporation. We also feel that such experiments would be part of a future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For no gene is it entirely clear how the identified elements contribute to endogenous regulation, also since there are several other peaks in the regions that were not included in the analysis. E.g. Dlx.c had &gt;14 peaks in the ATAC-seq data, out of which one (1) was included in the reporter constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed below, currently available ATAC-seq data (whole embryos up to neurula stages) may not actually fit our needs: some important regions may not be apparent, and at the same time regions with visible enrichment may not correspond to VDML expression. Tissue-specific ATAC-seq or 3C data should prove better staring points for an extensive analysis of candidate CRMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The existence of separate vs. shared CRMs is intriguing and interesting, except this is not as clear for Ascl.b, since both CiAshdo4 and CiAshdo5 are still active in the VML, and an intronic accessible region has not been tested. Moreover, Nkx.C is presented as an upstream regulator and absent from the Msxb GRN in Roure and Darras, 2016, but here it is incorporated in the core midline PNS network. Since its intron has not been tested, one cannot rule out that there is regulatory activity that would distinguish between ventral and dorsal midlines, which is also true for Dlx.c. This basically casts doubt on the model shown in Figure 4A.</p><p>For Ascl.b, the Supplementary file 2 makes it look like the intron should be added to the upstream region for thorough testing. In general, one intronic region also appears accessible for Nkx-tun3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the situation for <italic>Ascl.b</italic> is not as sharp as <italic>Msx</italic> since ventral activity is strongly reduced but not abolished for do4 and do5 CRMs. Yet we have not observed such a situation for the other four genes that we have analyzed and that are expressed later. Of course, we cannot rule out that unidentified CRMs with pan-midline regulation exist for <italic>Msx</italic> and <italic>Ascl.b</italic> and that unidentified dorsal CRMs and ventral CRMs also exist for the other midline TFs. We thus believe that deeper understanding of midline TFs transcriptional regulation will require a substantial amount of work with much finer resolution (in time and space with quantitative approaches) involving much heavier experimental approaches. For example, we propose that the DML expression at gastrula/neurula stage of <italic>Ciinte.Msx</italic> is initiated by Msx itself through the distal CRM (see below). Once <italic>Msx</italic> expression has been launched in both dorsal and ventral midlines, it is possible that the same element is used for maintenance through positive autoregulation. Thus the same genomic element would be at the same time a DML enhancer and a “pan-midline” enhancer.</p><p>Regarding the <italic>Ciinte.Ascl.b</italic> gene structure, we have fully sequenced the cDNA clone cien82323; and this indicated that the intron was wrongly predicted in the transcript models (shown in the modified Supplementary file 2). That is why we have selected the CRMs as shown. Yet this clone might be an artifact since it is not well supported by RNA-seq data. Nevertheless, a genomic region covering this region had been previously tested in transcriptional assay and was not active in the tail epidermis (https://www.aniseed.cnrs.fr/aniseed/cisreg/show_cisreg?feature_id=11170652).</p><p>The network in Roure and Darras, 2016 is based on overexpression and lacks information on direct interactions. Several structures were actually proposed with <italic>Nkxtun3</italic> (previously <italic>Nkx-C</italic>) included in most.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Multiple CRMs in Msx, Klf, Nkx and Dlx.c also begs the question as to whether these play redundant roles (like shadow enhancers), or have seemingly overlapping activities in reporter assays, but contribute to different aspects of gene expression.</p><p>X-gal staining does not report on the dynamics of enhancer activity: could the two CRMs act at different times?

The role of “redundant” CRMs has been first linked to robustness, their specific roles being revealed following genetic or environmental challenges. Quantitative approaches are now revealing that similar CRMs are intrinsically different. In ascidians, we are aware of only three studies reporting “shadow”/distributed enhancers (Farley et al., 2016; Madgwick et al., 2019; Harder et al., https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.07.242016). It seems that we have identified additional ones. However, their analysis would be a separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In general, the authors need to integrate the sequence of elements, including conservation, putative binding sites, and known regulators to paint a more complete and clearer picture of enhancer function in the first part, and of possible conservation -or divergence- of regulatory linkages in the comparative part, especially with regards to the ventral vs. dorsal inputs and the pan-medial/core network for PNS specification.</p><p>BMP and Notch signaling regulate ventral MDL and PNS, although crude assays do not allow for refined spatial and temporal resolution, so strictly speaking the time of space at which these regulators act could vary.

We would like to stress that we have not come to a definitive conclusion in terms of conservation of regulatory logic. The main reasons are 1) uncertainties of the GRN given the small number of validated direct interactions between a TF and a target gene, and the likely existence of unknown regulators, and 2) the impossibility to define homology relationships between CRMs from <italic>Ciona</italic> and <italic>Phallusia</italic> since non-coding DNA regions do not align.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the analysis of Stolidobranchia CRMs is cursory at this point, and one notes that presumably CRMs for the same genes could be obtained from the sequenced genomes of other tailed Molgula species (e.g. Molgula oculata or Molgula occidentalis). Considering the density of the current manuscript, the cursory analysis of Stolidobranch vs. Phlebobranch comparisons, and the fact that this has been done before, I would probably recommend focusing on the within Phlebobranch comparisons and strengthening the paper by better integrating the endogenous and reporter expression data with previously established regulatory linkage, sequences and putative TF binding sites. The latter is mentioned as future work in the Discussion, but it is not clear why it cannot be incorporated here, in a focused but clarified version of the study.</p><p>Drift between Phlebobranch and Stolidobranch enhancers for conserved gene expression patterns has been described qualitatively before, so the key novelties are the within order comparisons and the evolutionary changes, especially the seemingly reduced neurogenic compartments in Stolidobranchs.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that comparison between Phlebobranchs and Stolidobranchs is not as deep as the <italic>Ciona</italic>/<italic>Phallusia</italic> part.

Importantly, our results suggest that, contrary to some of the above reports (comparing possibly non-equivalent CRMs or using unusually divergent species), regulatory mechanisms might be broadly conserved in ascidians despite extensive drift. We thus consider that this part of the study is of strong interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Localized expression of Tox and Ascl.b in Halocynthia, as opposed to pan-VMDL in Phlebobranch is also a potentially interesting difference (i.e. not the whole midline has neurogenic potential). =&gt; possible conservation of the midline program, but drift in its linkage to the neurogenic program in CESNs? This would be very interesting, but difficult to address in a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests an interesting possibility. Another scenario could be “parallel” GRNs in the caudal PNS (Pan-midline: <italic>Msx</italic>-&gt;<italic>Klf1/2/4</italic>-&gt;<italic>Nkxtun3</italic>-&gt;<italic>Dlx.c</italic> and posterior midline: <italic>Ascl.b</italic>-&gt; <italic>Tox</italic>) that would be both required for acquiring a neurogenic potential. In <italic>H. roretzi</italic>, it has been shown that activating Notch inhibits PNS neuron formation (Akanuma et al., 2002). However, Notch inhibition has not been performed, and it is not known whether the entire midline is neurogenic. Such an experiment together with midline TFs loss-of-function would be required to further explore these hypotheses.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>The authors took a lot of the main comments to heart in the previous revision, but the manuscript became loaded with details and unnecessarily lengthy. For the sake of clarity of keys in the original data and the conclusion, the manuscript should now be streamlined before making a decision. I advise the authors to achieve this by deleting speculative sentences in Results, for example, “the loss of these sites might thus be responsible of the absence of activity in the VML.” and “and this may explain why we did not observe CRM active only in the VML.” in the Msx section This type of information also in the other TF sections should be deleted if not directly linked to the main conclusion, or substantially shortened after moving to Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the suggestion of two reviewers we had included an extensive analysis of transcription factor binding sites in the revised manuscript. Unfortunately, adding more information in an already dense manuscript led to a study even more difficult to follow. Following your suggestion, we have kept the description of this aspect minimal in the main text. We nevertheless believe that this new aspect of the study has brought interesting insights, and we have not simply deleted the data but transferred the details to the supplemental figure legends.</p></body></sub-article></article>
