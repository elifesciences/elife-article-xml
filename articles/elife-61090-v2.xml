the H3.1 or H3.3 histone genes are characteristic of pediatric diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs). These oncohistone mutations dominantly inhibit histone H3K27 trimethylation and silencing, but it is unknown how oncohistone type affects gliomagenesis. We show that the genomic distributions of H3.1 and H3.3 oncohistones in human patient-derived DMG cells are consistent with the DNAreplication-coupled deposition of histone H3.1 and the predominant replication-independent deposition of histone H3.3. Although H3K27 trimethylation is reduced for both oncohistone types, H3.3K27M-bearing cells retain some domains, and only H3.1K27M-bearing cells lack H3K27 trimethylation. Neither oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic> as a model, we demonstrate that inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation occurs only when H3K27M oncohistones are deposited into chromatin and only when expressed in cycling cells. We propose that oncohistones inhibit the H3K27 methyltransferase as chromatin patterns are being duplicated in proliferating cells, predisposing them to tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>diffuse midline glioma</kwd><kwd>pediatric cancer</kwd><kwd>histone variants</kwd><kwd>replication-coupled histone deposition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM108699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>Kami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001445</institution-id><institution>Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation for Childhood Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarthy</surname><given-names>Jay F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarthy</surname><given-names>Jay F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 CA009351</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarthy</surname><given-names>Jay F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deposition of mutant oncohistones by alternative nucleosome assembly pathways results in dramatic local differences in histone methylation in pediatric diffuse midline gliomas.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) are lethal pediatric brain tumors associated with mutations in genes encoding either histone H3.1 or H3.3, most frequently the lysine 27-to-methionine (H3K27M) âoncohistoneâ substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schwartzentruber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). H3K27M oncohistones cause the global reduction of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), a covalent modification that marks silenced regions in the genome. Since H3K27M oncohistones comprise onlyÂ ~5â15% of the total H3 histone within DMG cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>), they are thought to dominantly inhibit the H3K27 methyltransferase Enhancer of Zeste Homologue-2 (EZH2). Indeed, an H3K27M peptide binds in the active site of EZH2 and inhibits catalytic activity in vitro, and ectopic expression of either oncohistone inhibits H3K27 methylation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lewis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Justin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stafford et al., 2018</xref>). These studies have led to the hypothesis that oncohistones inhibit Polycomb-mediated repression of oncogenes, predisposing cells to tumorigenesis.</p><p>Most DMG patients carry K27M mutations in the genes encoding the histone variant H3.3, and onlyÂ ~20% of mutations are in histone H3.1 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fontebasso et al., 2014</xref>). This ratio is surprising given that there are only two genes encoding H3.3 and 12 genes encoding H3.1 in the human genome. In addition, although these two histones are very similar, H3.3 or H3.1 K27M mutations are associated with distinct sets of secondary mutations in cancers, and H3.1 mutations are associated with earlier onset gliomagenesis. Finally, while the H3.3 mutations are restricted to gliomas, H3.1 mutations have also been identified in AML and melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackay et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nacev et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lehnertz et al., 2017</xref>). These differences suggest that the two oncohistones differ in tumorigenic effects.</p><p>Studies in mammalian cells suggest that both H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M oncohistones require cell cycle progression in order to inhibit EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagaraja et al., 2019</xref>), although the etiology of this dependency remains unknown. Histone H3.1 is massively produced only in S phase of the cell cycle, but histone H3.3 is produced constitutively. While the bulk of histone deposition occurs during DNA replication as new chromatin is assembled, the H3.3 histone is deposited both during DNA replication and at sites of active histone turnover, and these are evolutionarily conserved properties of the two histone types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DranÃ© et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ClÃ©ment et al., 2018</xref>). Capitalizing on this conservation, we use <italic>Drosophila</italic> to show that overexpressing either H3K27M oncohistone inhibits H3K27 methylation only in cells progressing through S-phase and only if deposited into chromatin. To directly assess the genomic distribution of H3.3 and H3.1 K27M oncohistones, we appliedÂ CUT&amp;RUN chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>) to a panel of patient-derived DMG cell lines. We demonstrate that the H3.1 K27M oncohistone is distributed across the genome, consistent with replication-coupled deposition, and these cells have very low H3K27 methylation throughout the genome. In contrast, the bulk of H3.3 K27M oncohistone localizes to sites of active histone turnover, although we also detect the oncohistone at a low level genome-wide, which is consistent with H3.3 deposition during DNA replication. While H3.3K27M-bearing cells have low global levels of H3K27 methylation, they retain high level methylation at a small number of domains. Finally, we find that neither H3K27M oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding to chromatin in DMG cells. These results support a model where H3K27M oncohistones inhibit PRC2 on chromosomes, helping to explain the origin of gliomas during proliferative periods in development and the spectra of secondary mutations in these gliomas.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Chromatin-bound K27M histone inhibits H3K27 trimethylation in cycling cells</title><p>Histone H3 variants are highly conserved across evolution, and identical H3.3 histones are produced in both humans and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>). Humans have two replication-dependent H3-type histones â H3.1 and H3.2 â while <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only one, which is identical to H3.2. Therefore, to dissect the inhibition of H3K27 methylation by oncohistone variant types, we used <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell and animal models. We first transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells to overexpress FLAG epitope-tagged wild-type or H3K27M oncohistone constructs, and allowed cells to progress through twoÂ toÂ three cell cycles with expression of the transfected constructs. Nuclei that overexpress tagged histone H3.2 or H3.3 show broad staining for H3K27 trimethylation at similar levels as untransfected control nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, the same constructs with a K27M mutation show dramatic reduction of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). These results show that both H3.2 and H3.3 K27M oncohistones can inhibit H3K27 methylation to similar degrees, at least when similarly overexpressed.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chromatin-bound K27M histones inhibit H3K27 trimethylation.</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells were transfected with epitope-tagged histone constructs, and immunostained for H3K27 trimethylation (green) after 2 days of protein (red) expression.

This H3 tail protein cannot incorporate into nucleosomes as it lacks a histone fold domain, but a large fraction of it localizes within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We observed that H3K27 trimethylation levels are unaffected in cells expressing either the wild-type histone tail or the K27M histone tail fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Thus, we infer that while the H3K27M oncohistone can block H3K27 trimethylation, it must be incorporated into chromatin to do so.</p><p>Incorporation of H3.1 and H3.2 histones into chromatin is coupled to DNA replication as new nucleosomes are assembled behind replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad and Henikoff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Expression of a H3.3K27M mutant histone in developing wing imaginal discs inhibits H3K27 trimethylation and Polycomb-mediated silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ahmad and Spens, 2019</xref>). To determine if the H3K27M oncohistone can inhibit methylation in both cycling and in non-dividing cells, we used the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye as a system where we could control induction of histone proteins during the last developmentally-instructed cell division. Following proliferation of eye progenitor cells, one last synchronized wave of cell division moves across a disc just posterior to the morphogenetic furrow (MF) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The lateeye-specific <italic>GMR-GAL4</italic> driver produces the GAL4 activator only in the posterior portion of the disc, and thus induction of a GAL4-responsive histone transgene will produce the protein only in cells that are destined to go through only one more division before terminally differentiating into photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since we found that H3 and H3.3 oncohistones behave similarly when overexpressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell culture, we used this GAL4 system to overexpress wild-type H3.3 or H3.3K27M histones from identical transgene constructs inserted at the same landing site in the genome, so that we could directly compare their effects on H3K27 trimethylation. Expression of either H3.3 or H3.3K27M at this late time in development had no effect on eye morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Eye imaginal discs from wild-type larvae show similar staining of H3K27 trimethylation in both the anterior and posterior differentiating regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), and induction of a wild-type H3.3 transgene had no effect on this pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). In contrast, induction of the H3.3K27M oncohistone dramatically inhibits H3K27 trimethylation posterior to the morphogenetic furrow in the eye disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inhibition of H3K27 methylation by K27M histones is limited to cycling cells.</title><p>Eye imaginal discs from late larvae are divided by the morphogenetic furrow (MF, yellow arrowhead) into an anterior region (left) with asynchronously dividing cells and a posterior region (right).

The monoclonal antibody we used to detect the K27M substitution reacts with the mutated residue in both H3.1 and in H3.3 histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Venneti et al., 2014</xref>), and we therefore examined K27M oncohistone abundance and distribution in two H3.3K27M-carrying (SU-DIPG-XIII and SU-DIPG-XVII; âXIIIâ and âXVIIâ) patient-derived cell lines, and in two H3.1K27M-carrying (SU-DIPG-IV and SU-DIPG-XXXVI; âIVâ and âXXXVIâ) lines to compare the effects of histone subtypes.</p><p>We first confirmed that the K27M epitope was present in all four H3K27M oncohistone DMGs by Western blotting, with different amounts of oncohistone between lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In contrast, two high-grade glioma (HGG) cell lines (VUMC and PBT) with wild-type H3.1 and H3.3 genes show no detectable K27M signal, demonstrating the specificity of the anti-K27M antibody. The effects on abundance of H3K27me3 are not related to the amount of K27M oncohistone expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), but appear related to the oncohistone type. We then used the anti-K27M antibody to map distribution of the epitope across the genome in the panel of cell lines, using CUT&amp;RUN chromatin profiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skene et al., 2018</xref>). CUT&amp;RUN relies on binding of a specific antibody to chromosomal sites to tether a proteinÂ A-micrococcal nuclease (pA-MNase) fusion protein in samples of unfixed cells. Subsequent activation of the nuclease cleaves DNA around the binding sites with high specificity and sensitivity. Cleavage at antibody-targeted chromatin can be detected as nucleosomal fragments released from cells after nuclease activation, and we observed abundant fragments released from both H3.3K27M- and H3.1K27M-bearing cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast, there is no detectable DNA released from VUMC cells, which express wild-type H3.1 and H3.3 histones, or from cells incubated with a control IgG antibody, indicating that the CUT&amp;RUN reactions specifically cleave chromatin containing K27M oncohistones.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Global K27M distributions depend upon histone H3 types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western detection of K27M and H3K27me3 in glioma cell lines.Â K27M epitope amounts were normalized to histone H3 signal on the same blot, and H3K27me3 was normalized to tubulin on the same blot.

CUT&amp;RUN profiling of the K27M epitope showed moderate signal across the genome in both H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This genome-wide signal is absent in cells lacking K27M oncohistones, and thus represents oncohistone that is broadly distributed. In addition, the XIII H3.3K27M line displayed 7,411 distinct peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Notably, many of these peaks correspond to promoters, and overall these promoters are substantially enriched for K27M signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). These peaks indicate that the H3.3K27M oncohistone is incorporated at sites of active histone turnover, superimposed upon a genome-wide background signal. To confirm that these peaks correspond to active sites, we generated profiles for the histone H3K4me2 modification â a marker of active chromatin â in H3.3K27M cells. Indeed, 44% of the K27M oncohistone peaks fall precisely at called peaks of H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Although H3K27M-targeted CUT&amp;RUN released abundant amounts of nucleosome-sized DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and 4â8 million fragments were sequenced and mapped, these reads are uniformly distributed across the genome for each of the two H3.1K27M-bearing cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Thus, we conclude that while both H3.1 and H3.3 K27M mutations result in the incorporation of the H3K27M epitope into chromatin, the distributions of the two oncohistones are consistent with replication-coupled histone deposition for both H3.1 and H3.3 oncohistones, and additional replication-independent deposition of H3.3K27M at active sites. Finally, we noted that the widespread K27M signal in both H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M lines is present in H3K27me3 domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>H3K27 trimethylation is globally reduced in H3.1K27M-bearing cell lines</title><p>The K27M epitope inhibits the H3K27 methyltransferase EZH2 in vitro, in cell culture, and in H3.3K27M-bearing cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Funato and Tabar, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mohammad and Helin, 2017</xref>).

However, as these two mutant cell lines have very different distributions of H3K27M oncohistone, we compared their genomic profiles of H3K27me3.

However, it is apparent that H3K27me3 is greatly reduced at the <italic>HOXD</italic> locus in H3.1K27M-bearing cells. Strikingly, it is also apparent that many methylation domains present in VUMC cells are lacking in H3.3K27M cells. To analyze differences between cell lines more thoroughly, we defined differentially methylated chromatin domains between the H3.1K27M (SU-DIPG-IV), H3.3K27M (SU-DIPG-XIII), and histoneÂ wild-type (VUMC-10) glioma lines. Unsupervised clustering of these variable H3K27me3 domains generated four major groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The largest clusters (Clusters I-II) comprise 17,534 domains which are present in VUMC cells but absent in H3.3K27M cells, including numerous tissue-specific transcription factors. The remaining two clusters include regions where H3K27me3 is present in H3.3K27M cell lines. Cluster III includes 156 domains that are found both in VUMC and in H3.3K27M cells, and encompass genes that are typically silenced in many cell types, including those for the <italic>CDKN2A</italic> cell cycle inhibitor, the <italic>WT1</italic> tumor suppressor, and the <italic>HOXD</italic> transcription factors.

Thus, while H3.3K27M cells do have some H3K27 methylated domains, they are distinguished from other high-grade gliomas by the lack of a large number of H3K27me3 domains across the genome.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Shared and distinct H3K27me3 domains in K27M histone-expressing cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heat maps of <italic>Drosophila</italic> normalized H3K27me3 domains in glioma, embryonic stem cell (H1) and neural stem cell (U5) cell lines.

Indeed, DMG cells do express transcription factors of both pluripotency and differentiated cell types, suggesting developmental similarity to both stem cells and to differentiated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filbin et al., 2018</xref>).

We then examined the enrichment of histone methylation across the differential domains we defined between VUMC and K27M mutant histone gliomas. We found that 5,259 domains (21.3%) of the 24,733 domains found in U5 NSCs are found in VUMC cells, while only 1,287 (5.20%) are shared with H3.3K27M cells. In contrast, 375 domains (26.8%) of 1,401 domains in H1 ESCs are present in H3.3K27M-bearing cells. Additionally, both H3.3K27M and ES cells are distinctive in lacking H3K27 trimethylation from most Cluster I and II domains, and thus have a very limited global H3K27me3 profile.</p><p>Epigenomic changes are much more severe in H3.1K27M cells.

Thus, the H3.3K27M and H3.1K27M oncohistones have dramatically different effects on Polycomb-regulated domains. This quantitative effect appears to be a conserved property of H3K27M mutant histones, as replication-coupled H3.2K27M oncohistones are more potent inhibitors of H3K27 trimethylation than H3.3K27M oncohistones in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaney et al., 2019</xref>).

Furthermore, quantitative profiling demonstrates that H3K27me3 is much lower in H3.1K27M- than in H3.3K27M-bearing cells, although neither the H3.1K27M nor H3.3K27M oncohistones appear to trap or prevent PRC2 binding to chromatin.</p><p>Competing models have suggested that H3K27M oncohistones sequester (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2018</xref>) or poison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2019</xref>) PRC2.

The H3.1 histone is exclusively used for replication-coupled assembly, and so deposited throughout the genome at higher levels. Thus, H3.1K27M mutants incorporate high levels of the K27M (âMâ) epitope in polycomb domains, where it binds and inhibits the histone methyltransferase activity of the PRC2 complex. In contrast, most K27M epitope in H3.3K27M mutants is incorporated at active sites far from polycomb domains, resulting in weaker inhibition of PRC2 in these cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61090-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Our results imply that H3K27M oncohistones inhibit the EZH2 methyltransferase at its chromatin-binding sites within pPolycomb-regulated domains. A critical time for maintaining epigenomic patterns is during S phase of the cell cycle, when histone modifications must be established on newly assembled nucleosomes behind the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alabert et al., 2015</xref>). It is striking that H3K27M oncohistones inhibit H3K27 trimethylation only in proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nagaraja et al., 2019</xref>). Existing H3K27me3 levels generally remain stable in the absence of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jadhav et al., 2020</xref>), thus EZH2 activity is only needed in cycling cells. Perhaps new H3K27M oncohistones deposited behind the replication fork inhibit the EZH2 methyltransferase, thereby blocking re-establishment of H3K27me3 domains. In this model, only H3K27M oncohistones that undergo replication-coupled deposition near the sites of PRC2 recruitment are toxic to EZH2 activity. As H3.1K27M oncohistones are deposited throughout the genome, PRC2 poisoning in these cells eliminates H3K27 trimethylation genome-wide. In contrast, the less potent effect of H3.3K27M oncohistones on H3K27 trimethylation in DMG cells may be due to the smaller fraction of H3.3K27M oncohistones that undergo replication-coupled deposition, as most of this oncohistone is sequestered at active promoters far from H3K27me3 domains. The finding that human histone H3.3 localize over replication foci in early-S-phase cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ray-Gallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">ClÃ©ment et al., 2018</xref>) is consistent with our model.</p><p>That only H3K27M oncohistones deposited during DNA replication are toxic to EZH2 activity also explains why particular secondary mutations are associated with either H3.1K27M- or H3.3K27M-bearing gliomas. For example, H3.3K27M but not H3.1K27M gliomas have a significantly increased frequency of <italic>ATRX</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Khuong-Quang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mackay et al., 2017</xref>). ATRX is a chromatin remodeler involved in alternative telomere lengthening pathways in some cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heaphy et al., 2011</xref>), but also mediates replication-independent histone deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldberg et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, we expect that <italic>ATRX</italic> mutations may enhance the amount of H3.3K27M oncohistones deposited during DNA replication, thereby increasing inhibitory effects on H3K27 trimethylation. Similarly, <italic>CDKN2A</italic> loss in H3.1K27M-bearing cells suggests that this oncohistone requires different secondary mutations to compensate for the loss of Polycomb silencing at tumor suppressor genes. Such a dependency would explain why H3.1K27M mutations are more rare than H3.3 ones. A therapeutic corollary is that H3.1 and H3.3 oncohistones may confer distinct cellular sensitivities to chromatin modification inhibitors, either by affecting chromatin silencing or by affecting histone deposition pathways, thereby reshaping epigenomic landscapes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological materials</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Patient-derived K27M SU-DIPG-IV (IV, H3.1K27M), SU-DIPG-XXXVI (XXXVI, H3.1K27M), SU-DIPG-XIII (XIII, H3.3K27M) and SU-DIPG-XVII (XVII, H3.3K27M) cell lines were generously provided by the laboratory of M.

Peaks were called using SEACR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meers et al., 2019</xref>). For datasets for which biological replicates were available, peak lists from two replicates were merged using the bedops merge (-m) utility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neph et al., 2012</xref>). For genome-wide assessment of CUT&amp;RUN signal, we used deepTools to sum basepair counts in 5 kb bins, and plotted the ranked counts in MS Excel. Differential H3K27me3 regions used for K-means clustering were generated as follows: (1) We used the bedops partition (-p) utility to determine unique overlapping segments between merged H3K27me3 peak lists from VUMC, XIII, and IV datasets; (2) From the partitioned peak list, for any two partitioned regions that were directly adjacent to one another, we filtered out any that were less than 10 kb in length, in order to select only the âdominantâ segment in each region of partitioning overlaps, and to avoid doubly mapping adjacent partitioned regions; (3) For all other free-standing regions, we filtered out any that were less than 3 kb in length. This resulted in 18,482 regions used for clustering. K-means clustering was carried out using the âkmeansâ utility in R. Four clusters were selected as the optimal cluster solution based on selecting the âkneeâ of the curve in a plot of the number of clusters vs. within-cluster distance, tested across all possible solutions between 2 and 15 clusters.

Fragments mapped to cluster III in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> were first scaled by fragments per kilobase (1000/length of region), and then by a scaling constant that is inversely proportional to the number of spike in reads mapped (VUMC-H3K27me3: 0.786, SUDIPG-XIII-H3K27me3: 0.292, SUDIPG-IV-H3K27me3: 0.046, VUMC-SUZ12: 0.104, SUDIPG-XIII-SUZ12: 0.385, SUDIPG-IV-SUZ12: 0.185, VUMC-MTF2: 0.244, SUDIPG-XIII-MTF2: 0.333, SUDIPG-IV-MTF2: 0.084).

They provide evidence that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, H3.2 inhibition of K27 methylation requires incorporation of H3.2 into nucleosomes and in a separate series of experiments they show that over-expressed H3.3 inhibition of K27 methylation requires proliferation. They then perform Cut&amp;RUN experiments for H3K27M, H3K4me2 and H3K27me3 in several human glioblastoma cell lines. These experiments show different patterns of K27me3 inhibition in H3.3K27M vs. H3.1 K27M harboring cell lines.

My biggest problem with the manuscript is the incompleteness and incongruency of some of the approaches being cobbled together into universal conclusions that are not entirely warranted.

I am also not clear on what are the truly novel findings here. The proliferation-dependence of H3.3 mutant incorporation is intriguing but the one experiment is rather preliminary. It has been known that the H3.1 and 3.3 -associated gliomas have different transcriptomes and epigenomes and that is not really a surprise.

The authors need to rule out that the effect is not due to the over-expression of H3.3 is driving its incorporation via the CAF1 pathway in their experiments and they need to demonstrate that it is replication directly that is the dependency and not some indirect effect of p21 expression which surely changes many things. The authors rely strongly on this result in their model in the Discussion, which they present as conserved fly to human, but this experiment in flies is not convincing and whether the same is true in human is not addressed. Then in light of the human cell results, where the patterns of change in H3K27me3 are more consistent with replication independent and dependent incorporation of the H3.3 variant in hot areas while the 3.1 variant is widespread; I don't understand why they insist that the fly results be incorporated into the model of what they see in the human cell lines.</p><p>2) The authors look at only one variant in each <italic>Drosophila</italic> approach, but draw universal conclusions.</p><p>3) Subsection âG cells maintain PRC2 targetingâ â how are we to judge what number of domains &quot;highlights developmental similarity&quot; â we need statistics and negative and positive controls to conclude this. Otherwise all we know is that some are similar and some are different as I suspect would be true in any comparison. Also, for the phrase &quot;akin to stem cells&quot; do the authors refer to embryonic or neural stem cells. If both, then negative controls are very necessary. The total numbers of domains are very different between these two types of stem cells so I'm not even sure that statistics (not discussed) would be helpful but they at least should be stated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate how oncohistones carrying K27M mutations inhibit K27me3, focusing on the role of histone variant subtypes. This work is of high quality and the findings are interesting to the chromatin field. Several of the results in this manuscript cooperates previous work on oncohistones, and the novelty lies in the finding that H3K27M oncohistones only reduce K27me3 level in proliferating cells and the quantitative comparison of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M cells. The proposed model is interesting, but needs further support. Further dissection of features that distinguish sites that maintain/loose K27me3 in H3.3K27M cells would also strengthen the manuscript. With these revisions the work could be recommended for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors propose a model that entails replication-coupled incorporation of H3.3 at a low level. However, this work does not provide evidence to support this claim (it does not investigate this point directly) and evidence for this in the literature is weak â Drane et al. show that CAF-1 binds H3.3 in DAXX KO cells and Ray-Gallet et al., explores HIRA dependent GAP filling following replication when CAF-1 function is impaired.</p><p>The experiment in Figure 2 shows convincingly that replication is required for H3.3K27M to exert its negative effect on PRC2 and K27me3 levels. However, this could be explained without invoking replication-coupled deposition of H3.3K27M:</p><p>- Existing K27me3 levels generally remain stable in absence of DNA replication despite reduced PRC2 function (Jadhav et al., 2020). The major requirement for PRC2 function arises with incorporation of large numbers of unmodified histones, likely explaining why H3.3K27M interferes with K27me3 maintenance only in dividing cells. Moreover, H3.3 incorporation is also expected to increase after replication â via a replication-independent mechanism but due to replication-dependent doubling of the genome.</p><p>The authors should either provide evidence to support H3.3 incorporation genome-wide through a replication-coupled mechanism or consider to revise the model. They should also investigate the possibility that replication-dependent incorporation of new histones is required to see any effect of PRC2 inhibition in their setup â e.g. would they see loss of H3K27me3 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system in Figure 2 if EZH2 was inhibited in the presence of p21 expression?</p><p>- The authors show that K27me3 patterns in H3.3K27M cells is more similar to H1 ESCs than VUMC glioma cells. Is this reflecting that the cells are blocked at an earlier developmental stage and if so do gene expression analysis support this notion? what would be the alternative explanation for a specific lack of K27me3 in cluster I and II.</p><p>Is there a difference in H3.3K27M occupancy (histone exchange) across cluster I-IV that may explain why some clusters are more prone to K27me3 loss?</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Histone deposition pathways determine the chromatin landscapes of H3.1 and H3.3 K27M oncohistones&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and Jerry Workman (Reviewing Editor}.</p><p>Please note that reviewers 2 and 3 were not reviewers on the previously submitted version of the manuscript. However, they had access to the previous reviews and your responses, which they judged were appropriate.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In this work, the authors use both <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells/tissues and human patient-derived DMG cells to study two oncohistones H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M. The main conclusions are: (1) Inhibition of oncohistone on K27me3 only happens in cis when mutant histones are incorporated into chromatin and only in dividing cells. (2) They showed that the distinct deposition modes of H3.1 and H3.3 determine their genome distribution with H3.1K27M showing a more global distribution while H3.3K27M having more localized enrichment. (3) Neither H3.1K27M nor H3.3K27M oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding.</p><p>The experimental strategies combined individual cell assay such as immunostaining and genomic analysis such as CUT&amp;RUN, the later gave out clean results with high S/N ratio. The results are presented in a logic manner and the main conclusions are made carefully (except the third one, see Essential revision #4 below). However, for several places, the presentation of the results needs revision or improvement. Overall, this work should be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> after revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: In transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2, if cells are not allowed to progress &quot;2-3 cell cycles&quot;, do they lose or maintain H3K27me3? This would be good to include as a control, and for the conclusion cell cycle progression is required.</p><p>2) Figure 2 uses eye imaginal discs to study the effect of oncohistones. This is a great design as cells either exit cell cycle or undergo active mitosis can be visualized all together. A few suggestions on this figure: (1) Only H3.3K27M is studied here, why leaving H3K27M out for this experiment? (2) Figure 2A-B need to improve image resolution, it is quite blurry. (3) The H3S10 phosphorylation immunostaining signal is unclear, it is hard to tell the synchronously dividing cells right posterior to the MF. It would be better to show a better resolution image with this channel separate in gray scale. (4) In Figure 2 legend, it is said that &quot;at least 10 eye discs were examined for each genotype&quot;. In the figure, only one eye or eye disc was shown. First, N=10 is not a large sample size; second, quantification on them should be shown or mentioned in the text, such as what percentage of the samples show what phenotype, etc.</p><p>3) Figure 3E: Further analysis on H3.3K27M-enriched promoters should be informative to understand the molecular mechanisms of this oncohistone.</p><p>4) For this conclusion-- &quot;Neither oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding.&quot; The authors examined binding of SUZ12 and MTF2 in Figure 5, however, the key PRC2 component that should be studied is EZH2, the methyl-transferase. It would be very informative to examine EZH2's binding here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61090.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

However, the effects of p21 expression in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye have been extremely well-studied (PMID: 7481802), and this previous work has demonstrated that p21 expression reduces the number of cells in the eye but does not affect differentiation of those cells. We now show images of these eyes in Figure 2C-F, and the size of these eyes is as expected, with no effect on differentiation of adult ommatidia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors rely strongly on this result in their model in the Discussion, which they present as conserved fly to human, but this experiment in flies is not convincing and whether the same is true in human is not addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>The relevant experiments in human cell lines have been published, and demonstrate that cell cycle dependence of oncohistone effect is conserved (PMID: 23603901, 2013; PMID: 31588023, 2019): induced H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M expression in human oligodendrocyte precursor cells or in 293T cells only inhibit EZH2 after progression through at least one cell cycle, although no dissection of cell cycle phases was performed and no explanation for this dependence was presented in either study. We now cite these studies (subsection âChromatin-bound K27M histone inhibits H3K27 trimethylation in cycling cellsâ) as the impetus for our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, since fly retina provides a unique opportunity for probing cell cycle dependencies not afforded by mammalian systems.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Then in light of the human cell results, where the patterns of change in H3K27me3 are more consistent with replication independent and dependent incorporation of the H3.3 variant in hot areas while the 3.1 variant is widespread; I don't understand why they insist that the fly results be incorporated into the model of what they see in the human cell lines.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new analysis demonstrating that the H3.3K27M oncohistone is in fact widespread through the genome (Figure 3C,F). This is the central point, because this widespread protein must be incorporated during DNA replication, and this analysis should make clear why we are focused on replication. The importance of this finding combined with the fly results is that it provides a simple explanation for why glioma cells with H3.3K27M are less severe than H3.1K27M ones: The inhibition of EZH2 is proportional to the amount of oncohistone incorporated by replication in silenced domains. Note that there is no alternative explanation in the literature for why H3.3K27M oncohistone cells retain H3K27me3 modification at some domains while H3.1K27M ones lack it. We have also included new data (Figure 2C-F) showing that development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye with late K27M oncohistone expression appears normal, indicating that differentiation in this tissue still occurs normally.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors look at only one variant in each <italic>Drosophila</italic> approach, but draw universal conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>No, we looked at both variants in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in Figure 1 and demonstrated that when overexpressed they act the same. For this reason, we go on with just the H3.3K27M transgene in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. We now highlight this logic in the text in subsection âChromatin-bound K27M histone inhibits H3K27 trimethylation in cycling cellsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection âG cells maintain PRC2 targetingâ â how are we to judge what number of domains &quot;highlights developmental similarity&quot; â we need statistics and negative and positive controls to conclude this. Otherwise all we know is that some are similar and some are different as I suspect would be true in any comparison. Also, for the phrase &quot;akin to stem cells&quot; do the authors refer to embryonic or neural stem cells. If both, then negative controls are very necessary. The total numbers of domains are very different between these two types of stem cells so I'm not even sure that statistics (not discussed) would be helpful but they at least should be stated.</p></disp-quote><p>We now limit our statements to state the lack of background H3K27me3 in oncohistone gliomas (subsection âDistinct K27M distributions in H3.1 and H3.3 mutant patient-derived cell linesâ) and have removed the comment of developmental similarity to stem cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate how oncohistones carrying K27M mutations inhibit K27me3, focusing on the role of histone variant subtypes. This work is of high quality and the findings are interesting to the chromatin field. Several of the results in this manuscript cooperates previous work on oncohistones, and the novelty lies in the finding that H3K27M oncohistones only reduce K27me3 level in proliferating cells and the quantitative comparison of H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M cells. The proposed model is interesting, but needs further support. Further dissection of features that distinguish sites that maintain/loose K27me3 in H3.3K27M cells would also strengthen the manuscript. With these revisions the work could be recommended for publication in eLife.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>- The authors propose a model that entails replication-coupled incorporation of H3.3 at a low level. However, this work does not provide evidence to support this claim (it does not investigate this point directly) and evidence for this in the literature is weak â Drane et al. show that CAF-1 binds H3.3 in DAXX KO cells and Ray-Gallet et al., explores HIRA dependent GAP filling following replication when CAF-1 function is impaired.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide this evidence in Figure 3C, where we document genome-wide distribution of the K27M epitope in H3.3K27M-bearing cells. These data directly address this concern. In fact, published images of DNA replication and H3.3 in human cells show colocalization of H3.3 at newly replicated DNA, specifically in early S phase but not late-S phase. This was originally shown by Ray-Gallet et al., (PMID: 22195966, 2011) in wild-type cells, and the same group has extended these results with super-resolution microscopy (PMID: 30093638, 2018; Figure 3). These lines of evidence in support of our model are not based on impaired CAF-1 function, unlike the Drane et al., study, which we no longer cite as evidence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiment in Figure 2 shows convincingly that replication is required for H3.3K27M to exert its negative effect on PRC2 and K27me3 levels. However, this could be explained without invoking replication-coupled deposition of H3.3K27M:</p><p>- Existing K27me3 levels generally remain stable in absence of DNA replication despite reduced PRC2 function (Jadhav et al., 2020). The major requirement for PRC2 function arises with incorporation of large numbers of unmodified histones, likely explaining why H3.3K27M interferes with K27me3 maintenance only in dividing cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer, and now cite the Jadhav et al. reference where we raise these issues in the Discussion section. The new histones deposited after DNA replication must be modified to maintain epigenomic patterns, and this may explain why blocking S phase also blocks the loss of H3K27me3 in the eye disc. However, a crucial component of our model is that K27M oncohistones must be distributed within Polycomb domains to inhibit the histone methyltransferase, and the mammalian data we have added argues that the toxic fraction of the oncohistone gets there by replication-coupled deposition. We have reworded this section to make clear that we are only showing a requirement for cycling, not replication, and that our findings support our model of replication-coupled deposition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, H3.3 incorporation is also expected to increase after replication â via a replication-independent mechanism but due to replication-dependent doubling of the genome.</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of the images shows similar levels of H3.3K27M incorporation in proportion to DNA amount with or without cyclin E inhibition. In contrast we show a quantitatively dramatic drop in H3K27me3 relative to DAPI that is restored when Cyclin E is inhibited (Figure 2I-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors should either provide evidence to support H3.3 incorporation genome-wide through a replication-coupled mechanism,</p></disp-quote><p>We have added data in mammalian cells showing incorporation of H3.3K27M throughout the genome (Figure 3C and F). In previous studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells we showed deposition of H3.3 in S phase cells that coincides with PCNA and with newly incorporated nucleotides (PMID: 12086617, 2002).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>or consider to revise the model. They should also investigate the possibility that replication-dependent incorporation of new histones is required to see any effect of PRC2 inhibition in their setup â e.g. would they see loss of H3K27me3 in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model system in Figure 2 if EZH2 was inhibited in the presence of p21 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting experiment, and we were happy to try it. We used an inducible RNAi transgene to knock down E(z) in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye just before the last division.</p><p>Unfortunately, this only eliminates mRNA and does not affect perduring E(z) protein. There is no effect on H3K27me3 levels in the eye disc with this late knockdown of E(z). We have not included this negative experiment in the manuscript. In contrast, the K27M oncohistone interferes with the activity of existing protein, and so reveals the need for E(z) activity at this stage of development that other strategies cannot.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors show that K27me3 patterns in H3.3K27M cells is more similar to H1 ESCs than VUMC glioma cells. Is this reflecting that the cells are blocked at an earlier developmental stage and if so do gene expression analysis support this notion? what would be the alternative explanation for a specific lack of K27me3 in cluster I and II.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the comment that DMG epigenomes are similar to that of H1 ESCs, based on criticism of this point from other reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there a difference in H3.3K27M occupancy (histone exchange) across cluster I-IV that may explain why some clusters are more prone to K27me3 loss?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added clustered heatmaps showing K27M oncohistone occupancy (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C). There is a low level of H3.3K27M distributed across all clusters, but this does not explain why some clusters have lost H3K27me3 while others have not.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what follows is the authorsâ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved, but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>In this work, the authors use both <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells/tissues and human patient-derived DMG cells to study two oncohistones H3.1K27M and H3.3K27M. The main conclusions are: (1) Inhibition of oncohistone on K27me3 only happens in cis when mutant histones are incorporated into chromatin and only in dividing cells. (2) They showed that the distinct deposition modes of H3.1 and H3.3 determine their genome distribution with H3.1K27M showing a more global distribution while H3.3K27M having more localized enrichment. (3) Neither H3.1K27M nor H3.3K27M oncohistone interferes with PRC2 binding.</p><p>The experimental strategies combined individual cell assay such as immunostaining and genomic analysis such as CUT&amp;RUN, the later gave out clean results with high S/N ratio. The results are presented in a logic manner and the main conclusions are made carefully (except the third one, see Essential revision #4 below). However, for several places, the presentation of the results needs revision or improvement. Overall, this work should be appropriate for eLife after revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1: In transfected <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2, if cells are not allowed to progress &quot;2-3 cell cycles&quot;, do they lose or maintain H3K27me3? This would be good to include as a control, and for the conclusion cell cycle progression is required.</p></disp-quote><p>This experiment requires control of cell cycle progression and of histone construct induction. This is difficult to do in cell culture, which is why we turned to the eye system. Nevertheless, we used a set of heat-shock-inducible constructs (similar to the set of constitutive constructs we described in the manuscript) to lipofect S2 cells, expand those cells, then arrest cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle with the small molecule inhibitor mimosine, and then induce expression of histone constructs. With H3.3K27M, cell cycle inhibition by mimosine switches the histone deposition to an entirely replication-independent pattern (the puncta represent active rDNA genes (PMID: 12086617), and reduces inhibition of H3K27 trimethylation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>]). With H3K27M, cell cycle inhibition similarly reduces heat-shock-induced H3K27 trimethylation. These results visually resemble what we have seen in eye discs, but quantification shows that induced inhibition in both cycling and arrested cells is marginal, and for this reason we have not included S2 cell cycle arrest in the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>H3K27M fails to inhibit H3K27 trimethylation in G1-arrested cells.</title><p>S2 cells were lipofected with heat-shock-inducible epitope-tagged histone (red) constructs and allowed to progress through cell cycles or arrested with mimosine for 24 hrs before construct induction or 1 hr at 37Â°, and then allowed to recover for 8 hrs at 25Â°.

However, while EZH2 is enriched at H3K27me3 peaks, the signal-to-noise ratio is low, as demonstrated in the heatmaps below where EZH2 CUT&amp;RUN signal was mapped on H3K27me3 domains. We only see EZH2 signal over the strongest H3K27me3 domains (Cluster 3). The noise in this profiling is due to the anti-EZH2 antibody, as we observe similar high background in the H3WT cell lines. However, EZH2 has been previously profiled in H3.3K27M-mutant cells by Piunti et al., (2017), where it coincides with SUZ12 and H3K27me3 and is anti-correlated with K27M.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Enrichment of EZH2 in H3K27me3 domains.</title><p>CUT&amp;RUN signal for EZH2 (blue) in differential H3K27me3 domains defined in Figure 4A.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61090-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
