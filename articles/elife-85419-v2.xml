Imaging-based neuroanatomical tracing identifies area-to-area or sparse neuron-to-neuron connectivity patterns, but with limited throughput. Barcode-based connectomics maps large numbers of single-neuron projections, but remains a challenge for jointly analyzing single-cell transcriptomics. Here, we established a rAAV2-retro barcode-based multiplexed tracing method that simultaneously characterizes the projectome and transcriptome at the single neuron level. We uncovered dedicated and collateral projection patterns of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) neurons to five downstream targets and found that projection-defined vmPFC neurons are molecularly heterogeneous. We identified transcriptional signatures of projection-specific vmPFC neurons, and verified <italic>Pou3f1</italic> as a marker gene enriched in neurons projecting to the lateral hypothalamus, denoting a distinct subset with collateral projections to both dorsomedial striatum and lateral hypothalamus. In summary, we have developed a new multiplexed technique whose paired connectome and gene expression data can help reveal organizational principles that form neural circuits and process information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd><kwd>connectome</kwd><kwd>mPFC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wiring diagrams of a brain can be divided into three levels: (1) the macroscale connectome that describes inter-areal connections, (2) the mesoscale connectome that describes connections between cells, and (3) the microscale connectome that describes connections at the synaptic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zeng, 2018</xref>). Studying circuit architecture at the level of the mesoscale connectome describes how information flows between brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). Traditionally, neuroanatomical tracers are used to characterize regional connectivity matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cowan, 1998</xref>). To obtain cell-type-specific connectivity, one can use recombinant virus-based tracer in transgenic model organisms or more precisely trace a specific component of a neural circuit using viral-genetic tracing tools to dissect the input-output organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghosh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nassi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schwarz et al., 2015</xref>). However, these methods are highly reliant on complex recombinant virus design and genetically modified model organism, and often are not at a single-neuron resolution.</p><p>While recent advances have brought invaluable insights into understanding neuronal circuits at single-neuron resolution, existing methods have limitations. High-throughput fluorescence imaging, such as fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography (fMOST), can reconstruct detailed neuron morphologies but requires specialized expertise and equipment and lack transcriptomic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rompani et al., 2017</xref>). Barcode-based methods like MAPseq, BRICseq (multiplexed MAPseq), BARseq, and ConnectID utilize sequencing to map projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>). However, MAPseq and BRICseq can only provide connectome information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Huang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>), BARseq is constrained to assessing a handful of genes via in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>), and ConnectID has low recovery of cells with dual connectome-transcriptome data (~16%, 391 cells with connectome barcode identity in 2450 cells with scRNA-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>). VECTORseq, a Retro-seq-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>), is limited by its number of transgenic barcodes used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung et al., 2021</xref>). The updated BARseq protocol enables detection of up to 100 genes, but throughput remains lower and oligo synthesis costs remain higher compared to scRNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). In summary, despite significant progress, existing methods fall short in efficiently integrating high-throughput projectomes and transcriptomes at the single-neuron level, hindering a comprehensive understanding of the connectomic and transcriptomic interplay in neuronal circuitry.</p><p>Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is an intricate brain region involved in higher order cognitive functions, information processing (e.g., memory and emotions) and driving goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Merre et al., 2021</xref>). For example, mPFC neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens encoding punishment-related internal states were located in more superficial layer 5a, and mPFC neurons projecting to the ventral tegmental area encoding aversive learning were located in deeper layer 5b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Although previous studies have extensively investigated the anatomical and functional diversities of mPFC, the relationship between anatomical and molecular features of mPFC neurons remains elusive. Do mPFC neurons projecting to different downstream brain regions differ in their transcriptomes? Are these projection-defined mPFC neurons homogeneous or composed of different neuron subtypes? The answer to these questions may be further complicated by the finding that mPFC neurons can send collateral axons to multiple brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cornwall and Phillipson, 1988</xref>). So, what are the principles of target selection or target combination for these collateral projection mPFC neurons? What are the cell type and molecular features of these ‘broadcasting’ neurons?</p><p>To address these challenges, we designed a multiplexed tracing method capable of characterizing single-neuron transcriptome and projectome at the same time, which we called MERGE-seq (Multiplexed projEction neuRons retroGrade barcodE). We used MERGE-seq to interrogate the projectome and the corresponding transcriptome of ventral mPFC neurons. We injected five rAAV2-retro viruses with distinct barcodes into the five known downstream targets of ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), including agranular insular cortex (AI), dorsomedial striatum (DMS), basolateral amygdala (BLA), mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), and lateral hypothalamus (LH), in the same mouse brain such that each target region received a unique barcoded rAAV2-retro. We found that vmPFC neurons projecting to each downstream target are heterogeneous, which are composed of transcriptionally different subtypes of neurons. Approximately 65% of barcoded vmPFC neurons exhibited dedicated projection patterns based on MERGE-seq data, sending axonal projections exclusively to one of the five selected targets. It is important to note that this characterization of ‘dedicated projection’ neurons is specifically defined in the context of the five target regions examined in this study. Approximately 35% of barcoded vmPFC neurons sent collateral projections to multiple brain regions, most of which are dual-target projection neurons (bifurcated projection). We further uncovered the cell type compositions and layer distributions of these dedicated and collateral projection vmPFC neurons, and revealed their molecular signatures. We validated complex MERGE-seq-inferred projection patterns by joint analysis with recently published single-neuron projectome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, dual-modal interrogation using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and dual-color retrograde AAV labeling allowed us to confirm vmPFC neuron bifurcations to DMS and LH, demonstrating layer 5 <italic>Pou3f1</italic><sup>+</sup> neurons collateralize between these targets. Finally, we implemented a machine learning-based methodology and uncovered specific gene clusters for predicting certain projection patterns. As MERGE-seq bridges the gap between single-neuron projectome and transcriptome data, it can uncover new molecular properties of anatomical neural circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MERGE-seq characterizes single neuron transcriptome and projectome simultaneously</title><p>In order to use the 10x Genomics scRNA-seq system to analyze transcripts from cells infected with rAAV2-retro virus, we modified the viral vector by adding a 15 bp barcode index and polyadenylation signal sequences to the 3’ end of the EGFP sequences, which was driven by a short CAG promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, see Materials and ethods). Then, five rAAV2-retro viruses with different barcodes were individually injected into five brain regions of the same mouse, including AI, DMS, BLA, LH, and MD. These brain areas are the known downstream brain regions of vmPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hunnicutt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hurley et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reppucci and Petrovich, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). A period of six weeks was set to allow efficient retrograde labeling of vmPFC neurons by these barcoded viruses.

Next, we showed that there were sufficient sequence differences to distinguish one barcode from others and sufficient sequences difference to identify the right barcode among five references during sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Since each downstream brain region of vmPFC received a unique and predetermined barcoded virus, each virus barcode identified in a vmPFC neuron represents the specific corresponding downstream brain region that the neuron projects to. We found abundant zero counts for projection barcodes in scRNA-seq libraries, contrasting robust detection in projectome libraries generated by targeted amplification from full-length cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To determine validly barcoded cells, we first calculated the 95th nUMI percentile across all barcodes and removed outlier cells with exceptionally high nUMI (see Materials and methods). We used ‘EGFP-negative’ FAC-sorted cells (defined by nUMI EGFP = 0) and non-neuronal cells from scRNA-seq as negative controls to calculate 99.9th percentile UMI thresholds per barcode using empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). By taking the higher threshold for each barcode from these two negative control analyses, we classified cells exceeding these values as validly barcoded. It is worth mentioning that the UMI threshold differs for different targets due to different magnitude of barcode expression of each projection target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Across all detected cell types, barcoded cells were primarily excitatory neurons rather than inhibitory neurons or non-neuronal cell types (2116 validly barcoded in 8805 excitatory neurons, and 5 validly barcoded in 2738 endothelial cells, 3 validly barcoded in 1780 oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, 7 validly barcoded in 1773 oligodendrocytes, and 17 in 1420 inhibitory neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). This is consistent with the finding that mPFC projection neurons are excitatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gabbott et al., 2005</xref>). Using this stringent threshold, 49.0% of FAC-sorted and 18.7% of unsorted cells were classified as barcoded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In parallel, we calculated EGFP<sup>+</sup> ratios (nUMI of <italic>EGFP</italic> RNA &gt;0) as 81% for FAC-sorted and 26% on average for unsorted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). The lower fraction of barcoded versus EGFP<sup>+</sup> cells suggests our conservative threshold increases false negatives, classifying some low UMI cells as non-barcoded. Therefore, we focused analyses on reliably barcoded cells, though conclusions may not capture the full heterogeneous projection repertoire. Together, these results demonstrate that MERGE-seq can record single neuron transcriptome and projectome simultaneously.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>MERGE-seq reveals transcriptomic heterogeneity and cell type composition of vmPFC neurons projecting to different targets</title><p>Previous studies have shown that vmPFC neurons project to multiple brain regions including AI, DMS, BLA, LH, and MD; however, the cell type composition of these projection neurons remains largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Le Merre et al., 2021</xref>).

High correlation allows us to infer the spatial localization of our annotated subtypes detected in scRNA-seq data. We also found that excitatory neuronal subtypes are transcriptionally similar to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2021</xref>). All these integrated analyses suggest that multiple viral infections will not significantly affect the transcriptional state of these retrogradely labeled vmPFC neurons. For the L5-Htr2c subtype, only nine neurons were recovered with valid barcodes, possibly due to cell loss during single-cell dissociation or tropism of AAV2-retro, or these neurons may intrinsically not project to any target we chose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Neurons projecting to DMS were abundant (n=1242), whereas neurons projecting to BLA were rare (n=163; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).

By calculating the projection properties of each vmPFC neuron subtype, we found that each transcriptome-defined neuron subtype can project to specific but multiple targets.

We therefore analyzed the projection pattern of each barcoded vmPFC neuron by calculating the number of valid barcode types (see Materials and methods). We defined the dedicated projection neuron as a neuron containing only one type of barcode, the collateral projection neuron as a neuron containing more than one type of barcode. We found 64.88% of 2050 viral-barcoded neurons belonged to dedicated projection and the remaining belonged to collateral projection.

It is worth mentioning that the definition of ‘dedicated’ and ‘collateral’ projections relies solely on the analysis of MERGE-seq data. The quantitative resolution of dedicated and collateral projections of vmPFC neurons will depend on the comprehensiveness of retrograde labeling from all postsynaptic targets and labeling efficiency. By calculating the conditional probability that the same neuron projects to two targets (see Materials and methods), we found that vmPFC neurons projecting to AI or BLA were more likely to have collateral projection to DMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

We further categorized projection patterns by number of targets and found no significant differences versus imaging-based reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating MERGE-seq faithfully identifies projection patterns.</p><p>Next, we focused our analysis on the 5 dedicated projections (DMS, AI, MD, LH, and BLA) and most frequent five collateral projections (DMS + AI, DMS + MD, DMS + LH, DMS + AI + MD, and DMS + AI + MD + LH). We conducted a principal component analysis (PCA) of the projection matrix and mapped binary projection labels on PC embeddings. Results from binary projection clustering aligned well with clusters at PC1- and PC2-defined embeddings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M</xref>). We further clustered cells according to projection strength (defined as normalized projection barcode UMI counts; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We found that cells exhibited collateral projections to DMS + AI, or DMS + MD, or DMS + LH, or DMS + AI + MD, or DMS + AI + MD + LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), a pattern very similar to that we observed in binary projection model, indicating that projection strength-based clustering is comparable to binary projection pattern model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We next explored the cell type composition of the top 10 dedicated or collateral projection neurons. We mapped transcriptomic clusters to projection patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). While dedicated and collateral projection neurons were largely transcriptionally diverse (≥3 subtypes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), certain projections like MD-projecting and DMS + MD-projecting were highly homogeneous, composed of &gt;90% L6-Syt6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Overall, MERGE-seq elucidated dedicated and collateral vmPFC neuron projections at the single-neuron level, demonstrating diversity in projection patterns within individual vmPFC neurons. Furthermore, projection-defined (collateral or bifurcated) neurons have specific cell type composition and layer distributions. It is worth noting that as a proof of concept, we only acquired the vmPFC projectome from five downstream targets. Definitions of dedicated or collateral projections are thus limited to these five targets and some collateral projections may be underestimated.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Transcriptional profiling of projection target-specific vmPFC neurons</title><p>Next, we sought to determine the molecular features of neurons projecting to different downstream targets.

MERGE-seq overcomes these challenges by acquiring high-throughput gene expression and projection pattern in the same neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To evaluate potential relationships between the transcriptome and projectome, we used a probabilistic classifier, Naïve Bayes classifier, to predict binary projection patterns for each projection target based on transcription profiles. First, we encoded binary projection labels for each target region, encompassing both barcoded and non-barcoded projections, and subsequently trained a separate set of models for each of the five targets: AI, DMS, BLA, LH, and MD (see Materials and methods). Subsequently, we conducted a systematic evaluation of the impact of varying numbers of highly variable genes (HVGs), ranging from 2 to 5000, on model performance. This analysis revealed that employing the top 50 HVGs for modeling yielded the the highest F1 score (a harmonic mean of precision and recall), area under the curve (AUC), and a comparatively high prediction accuracy (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we chose top 50 HVGs as features to build the model. As a control model, we chose 50 randomly chosen genes. Five projection targets models were independently trained by splitting cells into training (70%) and test dataset (30%). Using top 50 HVGs also gave rise to significantly better model performance in regarding to prediction accuracy, AUC and F1 score, compared to using randomly chosen 50 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also performed 100 iterations randomly sampling 1000 cells and swapping barcoded with non-barcoded labels, which substantially decreased model predictive performance across various evaluation metrics (see Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This outcome underscores the critical importance of label accuracy for the predictive capabilities of the model, suggesting the authenticity of current barcoded cells labels despite potential false positives from stringent UMI thresholding.

Information including neuronal projection patterns (i.e. region-to-region connectivity), physiological properties, gene expression, and how they encode information in behavioral paradigms, are essential to understand functional brain circuits. Therefore, it is inevitably difficult to acquire a complete picture of brain circuits when only one analytic modality is considered. In this study, we have developed a multiplexed barcoding method that is integrated with scRNA-seq, enabling simultaneous transcriptome and projectome analyses. Retrograde AAVs are injected into multiple target regions simultaneously, thereby labeling projection neurons within the brain region of interest and facilitating their transcriptional analysis. Here, by comparing to other methods, we highlight distinct features of MERGE-seq and key biological insights that MERGE-seq can provide.</p><p>Early approaches of barcode-based neuronal projection mapping mainly focus on elucidating the projections of individual neurons in a single brain without providing the transcriptional signatures corresponding to those individual neurons (MAPseq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kebschull et al., 2016</xref>). We therefore developed MERGE-seq to connect single-neuron transcriptome and projectome with high throughput. While there are some conceptual similarities to BARseq or ConnectID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>), MERGE-seq has its unique features and advantages. BARseq can acquire single-neuron transcriptome and projectome, but with only a number of genes due to limited throughout of in situ sequencing. An improved version of BARseq can allow tens of genes to be detected, but still with a low throughput compared to scRNA-seq and a high cost in regards to synthesizing RNA probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sun et al., 2021</xref>). ConnectID (scRNA-seq combined with MAPseq) improves the detection of transcriptome using scRNA-seq but has a relatively low recovery rate of cells with transcriptome and projectome simultaneously (~16%, 391 cells with barcode identity in 2450 cells with scRNA-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klingler et al., 2021</xref>). In contrast, MERGE-seq enables transcriptional profiling of thousands of genes per neuron, with valid projectome barcode information recovered from approximately 50% of FAC-sorted cells passing stringent determination criteria. Another advantage of MERGE-seq is that users only need to sequence one brain region – the source area. While, in BARseq or ConnectID, users need to perform numerous tissue homogenization and sequencing for downstream brain regions to query target area barcodes information (projection).</p><p>MERGE-seq is a retro-AAV-based scRNA-seq approach. Previous research has employed retro-AAV techniques to probe the projection-specific transcriptome or epigenome of individual neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tasic et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>). Yet, these studies have not developed a multiplexed approach for investigating the complex collateral projection patterns of neurons. Another retro-AAV based-approach, VECTORseq, was recently developed to associate neuronal projectome and transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung et al., 2021</xref>). VECTORseq used several viral transgenes including three recombinases (DreO, Cre, Flpo) and two fluorescent proteins (tdTomato and EGFP) to barcode neurons. However, these transgenes are variable in length (DreO, ~1000 bp; Cre, ~1000 bp; FLPo, ~1200 bp; tdTomato, ~1400 bp; EGFP, ~700 bp) and driven by different promoters with different strength (EF1a, hSyn, CAG). Such an approach will inevitably result in differential expression of these different transgenes in labelled neurons, which in turn leads to different rates of transgene recovery in these neurons. In addition, viral-mediated overexpression of these recombinase may lead to toxic to the labeled neurons due to non-specific recombination events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, the transgenes used in VECTORseq method should be carefully selected to avoid any potential interferences with neuronal function or gene expression by these different transgenes. In contrast, MERGE-seq used 15-nucleotide barcode sequences in the 3’UTR region of EGFP as projection index driven by the same promoter to label different projection neurons. The expression of these different barcoded EGFP mRNA is comparable, and the number of these barcoded retro-AAV is unlimited. Therefore, MERGE-seq allows users to examine more populations (theoretically unlimited) in one brain and more extensive analysis of collateralization. Further, MERGE-seq can reveal projectome of single collateral projection neurons and identify molecular features of these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the collateral projection patterns of single neurons were not reported in VECTORseq and Retro-seq-based method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheung et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2021</xref>). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2021</xref>. used Retro-seq to investigate the correspondence between transcriptomics and projection patterns of vmPFC neurons, and inferred collateral projection based on the finding that transcriptome-defined neuron subtypes can project to different targets (or neurons projecting to different targets share common transcriptome-defined neuron subtype). However, the population level multi-target projections of a transcriptome-defined neuron subtype do not necessarily reflect collateral projection of individual neurons within a subtype. For instance, individual neurons within a subtype could project to distinct targets (dedicated projection), but their collective projections show multiple targets. In contrast, in MERGE-seq, individual neurons that were retrogradely labeled multiple projection barcodes are determined as collateral projection neurons. By MERGE-seq analysis, we uncovered dedicated and collateral projection patterns of individual vmPFC neurons to the five downstream targets, and revealed molecular features associated with these dedicated or collateral projection neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In addition, MERGE-seq strategy can be readily applied to other animal models, which is especially beneficial for research in models (e.g. non-human primate) where genetic manipulation is challenging. In summary, while Retro-seq methods provide valuable population-level insights, they do not capture the complex collateral projections that MERGE-seq can discern at the single-cell level. Our findings build upon and extend those of Lui et al. by demonstrating that individual neurons within transcriptome-defined subtypes exhibit a diverse range of projection patterns. This contributes a new layer of understanding to the intricate architecture of PFC circuits, emphasizing the nuanced interplay between divergence and convergence in neuronal pathways.</p><p>Although MERGE-seq does not offer spatial information of neurons currently, it leverages widely accessible droplet-based scRNA-seq, avoiding specialized equipment. Meanwhile, the extensive spatially resolved mouse brain atlases available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) allow for easy spatial annotation of cell populations using DEGs identified by scRNA-seq, as we demonstrated by mapping neuronal subtypes with MERFISH data of PFC. Compared to imaging-based spatial transcriptomics like MERSCOPE with constrained gene numbers, or next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based methods that are lack of true single-cell resolution (e.g. 50 µm 10 x Genomics Visium or 10–50 µm for DBiT-seq-based methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al., 2023</xref>), we believe our method stands out as a robust solution and offers an advantageous balance between resolution and scope.</p><p>There are several potential concerns and limitations of current study. First, a recognized limitation of using retro-AAV-based methods, including MERGE-seq, is the imperfect retrograde labeling efficiency in target regions. Labeling efficiency could be variable depending on the different source brain regions, projection strength, the distance between source and target brain regions and different AAV serotypes or tropism. For example, only nine neurons of the L5-Htr2c subtype were recovered with valid barcodes, which may be attributable to technical factors including cell loss during dissociation or AAV2-retro tropism. Alternatively, this subtype may intrinsically lack projections to the selected target regions examined in this study. Furthermore, single-cell dissociation for scRNA-seq can result in cell loss, thereby reducing the recovery rate of barcoded neurons. All these factors could influence the extent to which the complete range of neuronal projections is captured. Consequently, the quantitative conclusions drawn here might not fully represent the true extent of neuronal projections.</p><p>Second, the robust detection of projection barcodes and its recovery rate in neurons labeled with barcoded AAV-retro viruses is indeed a critical and challenging aspect of our methodology. As mentioned above, this challenge is largely due to the differential viral transduction efficiency across neurons, leading to inconsistent barcode expression. Neurons with low barcode expression may fall beneath the detection threshold of conventional sequencing methods. A suboptimal recovery rate can potentially lead to underrepresentation of certain neuron populations or projection patterns in the analyzed data. This in turn could impact the interpretation of neuronal connectivity and function, as projections that are less efficiently labeled or harder to detect might be overlooked. For instance, if a subset of neurons with low barcode expression is systematically missed, it could erroneously suggest that these neurons do not participate in specific projection patterns. Conversely, overrepresentation of certain barcodes due to higher transduction efficiency could falsely indicate a predominance of certain projections. One potential solution to improve barcode detection is to include FAC-sorted EGFP-negative cells as a negative control, which may help to differentiate between true signal and background noise. Enhancements in sequencing technologies, offering increased read lengths and deeper sequencing, could potentially improve barcode detection sensitivity. In parallel, applying single-molecule FISH technologies like MERFISH to spatially resolve barcodes offers a robust and direct detection method. This technology can provide detailed coverage and resolution of individual RNA molecules within single cells, bypassing additional PCR amplification steps and reducing cell loss during physical isolation. Furthermore, carefully controlling the viral titer and refining the procedures of single neuron suspension preparation, as performed in this study, is required to control the labeling efficiency and recovery rate.</p><p>DMS is en route from vmPFC to subcortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shepherd, 2013</xref>), thus raising another concern about the transducing ability of AAV2 in axons of passages. However, the retrograde transport of AAV has been effectively demonstrated to target projection neurons at axonal terminals, with injections into the DMS exhibiting labeling patterns and efficiencies that match those of synthetic tracers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Further, it has been experimentally verified that AAV2 spread is confined to the vicinity of synaptic terminals and does not affect axon fibers in passages, especially as evidenced by retro-AAV injections in the cervical spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). While these findings are reassuring, additional research is needed to unequivocally eliminate the possibility of transduction along axon fibers of passage. The five distinct injection sites we chose for our study are spatially disparate, encompassing both cortical and subcortical regions, and span a range from the anterior (Bregma,+2 mm) to the posterior (Bregma, –1.5 mm) brain regions. This separation mitigates the potential overlap in labeling when examining spatially proximate nuclei, such as those in the hypothalamus. Nevertheless, examining such closely situated targets would necessitate meticulous quantification of virus injection volumes to prevent cross-target viral dissemination, ensuring the specificity required for accurate projection mapping.</p><p>In summary, we develop MERGE-seq, a powerful multiplexed projectome and transcriptome analysis platform that will help researchers perform big-data research at low cost. This will enable researchers to understand organizing principles and molecular features of neural circuits across modalities, and to construct more comprehensive mesoscale connectomes.</p></sec><sec

Probes of RNA-Scope used in this study include, Mm-Syt6 (449641), Mm-Pou3f1-C2 (436421-C2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>scRNA-seq data pre-processing</title><p>scRNA-seq data were aligned with the customized mouse reference genome mm10-3.0.0 adding five projection barcodes as separate genes. Further projection barcode expression was obtained as described in (Projection barcode library preparation and Projection barcode FASTQ alignment). scRNA-seq data were demultiplexed using the default parameters of Cellranger software (10x Genomics, v3.0.2). Obtained filtered transcription count matrix was used for downstream analysis. For unsorted samples, we used three mice with three GEM wells in one Chromium Single Cell 3' Chip (v3). Among unsorted samples, sample mouse #1 recovered 8040 cells, 447,984,945 read pairs were aligned, mean reads per cell is 55,719, median genes per cell is 2382; sample mouse #2 recovered 7443 cells, 399,187,134 read pairs were aligned, mean reads per cell is 53,632, median genes per cell is 2379; sample mouse #3 recovered 7243 cells, 410,627,696 read pairs were aligned, mean reads per cell is 56,693, median genes per cell is 2385. For FAC-sorted samples, we used three mice with one GEM well in one Chromium Single Cell 3' Chip (v3). FAC-sorted sample recovered 2075 cells, 410,434,792 read pairs were aligned, mean reads per cell is 197,799, median genes per cell is 6533.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Projection barcode FASTQ alignment</title><p>Demultiplexing of projection index barcode was performed using deMULTIplex R package (v1.0.2) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq">https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">mcGinnis, 2023</xref>) with modifications. Briefly, we have revised the MULTIseq.align function to count the UMI of each projection barcode separately. We adopted a minimal Hamming distance of 2 for the MULTIseq.align function to improve the matching accuracy between detected and designed barcodes. Tag parameters in ‘MULTIseq.preProcess’ function were adjusted according to our user-defined position of index barcode length and position. Based on our primer design, the expected format is: cell barcode in Read 1 (bases 1–16), UMI in Read 1 (bases 17–28), and projection barcode in Read 2 (bases 31–45).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>scRNA-seq transcriptional expression analysis</title><p>The filtered count matrix was analyzed and processed using Seurat and Scanpy, including data filtering, normalization, highly variable genes selection, scaling, dimension reduction, and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wolf et al., 2018</xref>). First, scRNA-seq data from three samples of unsorted cells and one sample of sorted EGFP-positive cells were created as Seurat object separately; genes with less than three counts were removed and cells with fewer than 200 genes detected were removed. Second, four Seurat objects were merged using the ‘merge’ function in Seurat. Downstream analysis of merged Seurat objects were as follows: (1) Data filtering: cells with a mitochondrial gene ratio of greater than 20% were excluded. We kept cells for which we detected between 500 and 8000 genes (cells with more than 8000 genes detected were considered potential doublets), and between 1000 and 60,000 counts (cells with more than 60,000 counts detected were considered potential doublets). (2) Data normalization: for each cell, counts were log normalized with the ‘NormalizeData’ function in Seurat; ‘scale.factor’ was set to 50,000. (3) Highly variable gene selection: 2000 highly variable genes were calculated using the ‘FindVariableFeatures’ function in Seurat. (4) Data scaling: the Seurat object was performed using the ‘ScaleData’ function with default parameters. The number of counts, number of genes, mitochondrial gene ratio, and sorting condition were regressed out in ‘ScaleData’. (5) Principal component analysis: highly variable genes were used to calculate principal components in the ‘RunPCA’ function. A total of 100 principal components (PCs) were obtained and stored in Seurat object for computing neighborhood graphs and uniform manifold approximation and projection (umap) in following section. (6) Leiden clustering: Seurat object was converted into loom file and imported by Scanpy. A neighborhood graph of observations was computed by ‘scanpy.pp.neighbors’ function in Scanpy. Then, leiden algorithm was used to cluster cells by ‘scanpy.tl.leiden’ function in Scanpy. (7) Cluster merge and trimming: The top 200 DEGs for each cluster were calculated using the ‘scanpy.tl.rank_genes_groups’ function in Scanpy using parameters method=‘wilcoxon’ and n_genes = 200. Cluster annotation was performed manually based on previously reported markers of PFC all cell types, layer, neuron subtypes, and mouse brain atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sorensen et al., 2015</xref>). Cell clusters with similar marker genes were merged into one cluster. Complete marker lists for all cell types and all excitatory neuron subtypes calculated using ‘FindAllMarkers’ function in Seurat were provided (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 2 and 3</xref>).</p><p>Two rounds of clustering were performed. In the first round, we clustered all cells detected by scRNA-seq to generate major cell type classification, that is excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia. Then we use the annotated ‘Excitatory neuron’ cluster to further cluster excitatory neuronal subtypes. In the 2nd round clustering, we found several clusters expressed a lower number of counts per cell, a lower number of genes per cell, a higher percentage of mitochondria genes, and ribosome protein genes as DEGs, which indicates cell clusters with low cell quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ilicic et al., 2016</xref>). We also found several other clusters with a small number of cells expressing typical markers of non-neuron cells, such as microglia (<italic>C1qa</italic>, <italic>C1qb</italic>) oligodendrocytes (<italic>Olig1</italic>, <italic>Olig2</italic>) and endothelial cells (<italic>Flt1</italic>, <italic>Cldn5</italic>), which indicated ‘contamination’ of other cell types mixed in ‘Excitatory neuron’ in the initial clustering results. We then filtered out those cells from ‘Excitatory neuron’ cluster and redid clustering to generate excitatory neuronal subtypes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Cell type correspondence assessment</title><p>To evaluate whether the transcriptional cell types we recovered and annotated correlated with cell types from spatial transcriptomics of PFC or other scRNA-seq datasets of PFC, we used a previously reported comparison analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacherjee et al., 2023</xref>). Briefly, we integrated our dataset and previously reported datasetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhattacherjee et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bhattacherjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yao et al., 2021</xref>) into a harmonized PCA space using the Harmony algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). We then constructed a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph incorporating all cells from the two datasets. We used the first 30 harmonized principal components as inputs for FindNeighbors function of Seurat to calculate the KNN. For each cluster of public dataset, we found its 30 nearest neighbor cells and determined the percentages of those cells belonging to each scRNA-seq cluster of our dataset. This created a correspondence matrix showing the transcriptional similarity of each public dataset cluster to each cluster of our dataset.</p><p>In this matrix, rows represent our scRNA-seq clusters, columns represent public dataset clusters, and the matrix values reflect the degree of similarity between the clusters. This process was reciprocally conducted for clusters of our dataset, comparing them to public dataset clusters to form a secondary correspondence matrix. The mean of these two matrices provided a quantifiable measure of the similarity between cell clusters identified by our annotation and public dataset annotation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Binary projection pattern classification</title><p>To determine valid barcoded cells, we first calculated the 95th percentile of the total number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI) that were mapped with five barcodes, and removed the unusually high numbers of UMIs, which might indicate doublets or PCR-biased amplification. Next, we used two set of cells as negative control, that is, cells supposed not to contain projection barcodes. First set of negative control cells we used is non-neuronal cells classified by coarse clustering based on single-cell transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>). Second set of negative control cells we used is ‘EGFP-negative’ cells in FAC-sorted dataset. Basically, we calculated the total five projection barcodes counts determined by cellranger of FAC-sorted dataset, then we assigned the cells with zero projection barcodes (nUMI of <italic>EGFP</italic> RNA = 0) counts as ‘EGFP-negative’ cells. For two set of negative control cells, we searched for the value in the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) that is closest to the 99.9th percentile agains each projection barcode, respectively. We selected the higher UMI threshold from the two given sets of threshold values. A cell is determined to be validly barcoded if the number of the barcode UMIs within the cell is larger than the threshold. For example, the calculated threshold of UMIs for barcode 0 (AI) is 28, which means if a cell contains more than 28 UMIs of barcode 0, then this cell is validly barcoded by AI. UMIs threshold for DMS, 101; for MD, 114; for BLA, 35; for LH, 103. Finally, we dropped UMI counts of determined non-barcoded cells to zero to obtain the index barcode counts matrix used for downstream analysis. Binary projection patterns were calculated by five projection targets set intersections of corresponding barcoded cells. Only the top 10 frequent binary and collateral projection patterns were kept for reliable inference.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Projection pattern-specific DEGs analysis</title><p>DEGs were calculated using the default parameters of the ‘FindMarkers’ function in Seurat, except the MAST algorithm was used to do DE testing.

Projection patterns were quantified by calculating the percentage of each pattern relative to total patterns. Patterns were categorized by number of targets (1, 2, 3, or ≥3 targets). MERGE-seq and fMOST projection pattern percentages were statistically compared within each category using two-sided Wilcoxon tests with Holm correction for multiple comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Machine learning implementation on projection and transcription data</title><p>Naïve Bayes was applied to perform a machine learning classification task. We first encoded binary projection labels for each projection target (barcoded and non-barcoded) and five set of models (AI, DMS, BLA, LH and MD) were independently trained. We explored a parameter range of number of the top highly variable genes (HVGs) (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000) to fit the model. A total of 1000 cells were randomly sampled from 8210 excitatory neurons and top HVGs were selected by default order of results based on ‘FindVariableFeatures’ function of Seurat per trial. In total, 100 trials were repeated.</p><p>To interpret contribution of important genes for each HVGs-based Naïve Bayes model, data matrix for modeling building was constructed as below: for each projection target, 8210 excitatory neurons × (normalized expression of the top 50 HVGs + binary projection labels), or 8210 excitatory neurons× (normalized expression of 50 random genes +binary projection labels). Each data matrix was shuffled first and split by training-testing data in a ratio of 0.7. Machine learning workflow was implanted in pycaret python package (v2.3.4) ‘pycaret.classification’ module. First, for each model, we used ‘setup’ function to initialize the training environment and created the transformation pipeline by setting ‘target’ parameter to column name of input data matrix corresponding to binary projection labels. Then we used ‘create_model’ function to train and evaluate the performance of a given model by setting ‘estimator’ parameter to ‘nb’ and other parameters by default.</p><p>To validate barcode/non-barcode label integrity, we performed 100 iterations of random sampling 1000 cells and swapping barcoded with non-barcoded labels. Prediction accuracy, AUC, and F1 scores were compared between original models using the top 50 HVGs with true labels versus models with swapped labels. For each of the 100 trials, 1000 cells were randomly sampled from the 8210 total cells, and barcoded/non-barcoded labels were swapped to the extent possible based on the smaller group. Models were built for each target using original or swapped labels and the top 50 HVGs.</p><p>We implemented kernel explainer of SHAP python package (v0.40.1) to summarize the effects of genes. SHAP explainer was created using ‘shap.KernelExplainer(model.predict, training data)’ function. SHAP values were calculated using ‘explainer.shap_values(testing data)’ function, and plotted by ‘shap.summary_plot()’ function to create a SHAP beeswarm plot by displaying top 20 features. Training data and testing data for calculating SHAP values were subsampled with 1500 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.

projEction neuRons retrograde barcodE (MERGEseq) that combines transcriptome and projectome data at a single-cell resolution. The authors provide solid evidence that MERGEseq can be used to identify projection targets and cell type/layer/transcriptome differences of projection neurons in the mouse prefrontal cortex, and validation experiments are rigorous. While this report is a proof-of-principle that MERGEseq is useful for circuit mapping and profiling and many potential details will influence conclusions, this technique could easily be adapted to other regions with known projection targets and adds to a growing arsenal of combinatorial circuit mapping and profiling tools.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85419.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Day</surname><given-names>Jeremy J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/008s83205</institution-id><institution>University of Alabama at Birmingham</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.05.16.444258">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.16.444258v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. Please accompany your revision with a point x point response to each point raised by the reviewers in the public and private reviews, paying special attention to the essential revisions noted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript builds upon several prior approaches, only some of which are discussed and cited. The scholarship of the manuscript needs to be improved by incorporating a more robust review of other approaches, as suggested by reviewers to place these findings in context. The scholarship of the manuscript should also be improved by including a more transparent discussion of the limitations of MERGE-seq relative to other approaches.</p><p>2) Reviewers raised several issues related to the efficiency of retrograde labeling and barcode recovery that have the potential to affect the conclusions reached in the manuscript. These issues should be addressed in the manuscript with new data and/or analysis.</p><p>3) A revision should incorporate requested information to provide clarity about the experimental details and analysis methods.</p><p>4) Please ensure your manuscript complies with the <italic>eLife</italic> policies for statistical reporting: https://reviewer.elifesciences.org/author-guide/full &quot;Report summary statistics (e.g., t, F values) and degrees of freedom, exact p-values, and 95% confidence intervals wherever possible. These should be reported for all key questions and not only when the p-value is less than 0.05.</p><p>5) Please include a key resource table.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The introduction discusses current techniques like BARseq but makes no mention of the current retrograde tracing and sequencing techniques which is what MERGEseq is actually improving upon. While these retro techniques are discussed in detail in the discussion, it seems odd that they are left out of the introduction as MERGEseq is really an extension of these techniques rather than MAPseq/BARseq.</p><p>2. Figure 1 – Supplement 1 shows that very different UMI cutoffs were used to call a cell &quot;positive&quot; for each barcode index. This would presumably preclude direct comparison across regions with different barcodes, at least for purposes of determining the density of projections (since a different degree of projections will be excluded for each virus region). This should be mentioned more explicitly in the manuscript.</p><p>3. Lines 170-171 note that &quot;stressed&quot; 637 neurons were filtered out from the Slc17a7 population. It is not clear what this means, and Figure 2 – Supplement 1A does not explain this. This should be clarified.</p><p>4. In the discussion, authors might comment on the added value of capturing the &quot;full&quot; transcriptome at the cost of spatial resolution.</p><p>5. It may be good to mention that retro-AAV2 has not been reported to infect fibers of passage.</p><p>6. Please include a color scale for Figure 5a.</p><p>7. Please include axis labels for Figure 5c.</p><p>8. Figure 5F shows the DMS+LH Pou3f+ cells, what about the DMS only and LH only? Are there any Pou3f+ cells that lack fluorescence?</p><p>9. Please enlarge Figure 3e.</p><p>10. For scRNA-seq, please provide detail on the depth of sequencing, the number of GEMwells used, and the number of technical or biological replicates.</p><p>11. Please include a color scale for Figure 6e-f.</p><p>12. Typo, line 536 &quot;despite of chosen&quot;; should be &quot;in spite of chosen&quot; or &quot;despite chosen&quot;.</p><p>13. Supplemental Figure 2 panel E, missing cell type labels going across.</p><p>14. Please cite the original retro seq paper (Tasic, 2018, PMCID: PMC6456269).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Based on their detection of barcodes in single-cell RNA-sequencing, the authors conclude that &quot;about 74% of barcoded vmPFC neurons projected to one of these five targets (dedicated projection) and 26% of barcoded vmPFC neurons sent collateral projections to multiple brain regions…&quot; (lines 92-94 in Introduction, lines 242-244 in Results). These conclusions are contingent upon 100% of neurons that project to a specific region being labeled by retrograde barcoded viruses and barcodes are detected at 100% efficiency. The authors did not provide an estimation of either efficiency. In the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion, the authors raised this as &quot;A potential technical concern&quot; but conclude that &quot;the overall dedicated and collateral projection pattern…will not be greatly affected by the labeling efficiency or recovery rate.&quot;</p><p>I disagree with the authors' conclusion. Suppose that retrograde labeling efficiency is 70%, and the barcode recovery rate is also 70% (both very optimistic estimates). Suppose further that all neurons of a particular type send collateral branches to two target regions, X and Y. The experiment will yield the results that 25% of the neurons will be labeled by barcodes injected at X only, 25% by barcodes injected at Y only, 25% labeled by both barcodes, and 25% labeled by neither. The conclusion from the above experiment would be that 2/3 of neurons are &quot;dedicated&quot; to either X or Y, and 1/3 of the neurons send axons to both regions. This simple back-of-the-envelope calculation reveals how much collateralization is underestimated by incomplete retrograde labeling!</p><p>Without reading the penultimate Discussion paragraph, readers will be misled twice about the fraction of &quot;dedicated projection.&quot; Even after reading it, the readers will still be misled by the authors' conclusions.</p><p>If the authors wish to make a quantitative conclusion about the true &quot;dedicated&quot; vs. &quot;collateral&quot; projections, they must determine the efficiency of retrograde barcoding. They can inject AAVretro carrying two different types of barcodes into the same region (via two separate injections, rather than injecting a mixture, which will artificially raise the co-transduction efficiency) and quantify individual cells that are labeled by both types of barcodes. They can then use such efficiency to calibrate their estimation of &quot;dedicated&quot; vs. &quot;collateral&quot; projections. (Note that retrograde labeling efficiency may differ for different sites.) Without such calibration, the authors should caution the readers about the (likely large) underestimation of true collateralization whenever such data are presented and discussed.</p><p>Another issue with &quot;dedicated&quot; projections: the authors only examined 5 targets. Each of the &quot;dedicated&quot; projections is true within these 5 targets, these neurons can send collateralized axons to other, unstudied targets.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Please provide a better context for the presented method. Clarify how the transcriptomic cell type definition in this paper corresponds to previous papers and clarify how the presented method differs from previous methods and what the advantages and disadvantages are.

The paper should start with cell type definition and present consistent nomenclature from the beginning.</p><p>6) Caution should be exercised when interpreting under-represented cell types in MERGE-seq. Figure 2 shows that only 8 neurons of the L5-Htr2c subtype were validly barcoded. However, in addition to the possibility that this subtype does not project to the five targets included in this study, the small number of barcoded L5-Htr2c subtype could also be caused by the tropism of AAV2-Retro viruses, or the selective loss of L5-Htr2c neurons in tissue processing due to cell death. Comparison with the in situ hybridization patterns of marker genes in Supplementary Figure 2 and the proportions of neuronal subtypes in Figure 2b suggests bias in sampling of cell subtypes by scRNA-seq. Therefore, independent approaches should be utilized to further investigate the projection targets of L5-Htr2c neurons before reaching a conclusion.</p><p>7) We suggest replacing &quot;unbarcoded&quot; with &quot;non-barcoded&quot;. &quot;Un-barcoded&quot; sounds like the cells were barcoded and then the barcode was removed.

Using thresholds calculated based on barcode counts in non-neurons, they found that the percentage of barcoded cells in FACS sorted or unsorted groups are 54% and 12%, respectively. Given that almost all cells sorted by FACS should have been infected with the barcoded GFP AAV viruses, the recovery rate for barcodes is low. Therefore, labeling neurons as barcoded and unbarcoded based on the detection of barcodes will create false negatives, that is, classifying many retrograded labeled neurons as &quot;unbarcoded&quot; (we suggest changing this to &quot;non-barcoded&quot;). It seems that the projectomes of neurons cannot be simply derived from barcode detection through sequencing. Many &quot;unbarcoded&quot; projection neurons were in fact retrogradely labeled by AAV viruses injected into a specific target but were negative for barcodes due to technical limitations.</p><p>One immediate issue caused by the false negative rate of barcode detection is whether the machine learning-based modeling is provided with the right training data (Figure 6). For this model to predict projectomes based on transcriptomes, it first requires a good correlation between barcoding and projectome.</p><p>More discussion should be given to the recovery rate of barcodes, and its potential impact on data analysis.</p><p>14) Additional analysis and control experiments related to barcode detection:</p><p>The low barcode recovery rate could be due to the low number of copies for AAV-encoded transcripts in the transcriptome of single cells, or it is specific for the detection of short barcode sequences. With the current scRNAseq data, one additional analysis is to measure the percentage of neurons positive for GFP transcripts from both FAC-sorted and non-sorted samples and compare the GFP+ neuron frequency to barcode+ neuron frequency.</p><p>15) To enrich cDNA fragments composed of the barcode index, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and the barcode, the authors prepared expressed virus barcode libraries with special primers. The authors also tried to detect barcodes directly in single-cell transcriptional libraries. What was the barcode detection frequency without this additional amplification, that is, in regular single-cell transcriptional libraries? It would be good to comment on how much this approach (we assume) improves barcode detection compared to the regular 10x single-cell libraries without additional barcode amplification.</p><p>16) The authors hypothesized that the non-neuronal cells would not be transduced by rAAV2-retro. The barcode counts in these non-neuronal cells were used to generate the thresholds for projection neurons. However, such cells, especially microglia, could be positive for AAV transcripts perhaps by phagocytosing dying infected neurons. A better control cell population could be cells negative for GFP after FACS. If sequencing data are available for such GFP-negative cells, it would be useful to examine the detection of barcodes in these cells and use them as the negative control for thresholding.</p><p>17) In the section on Projection barcode FASTQ alignment, the authors stated that deMULTIplex R package (v1.0.2) (https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq) was used to count UMIs associated with barcodes. This method was designed to detect the Sample index and needs to be further adjusted for barcode reading. The current method did not reveal the fact that a single UMI could be associated with multiple barcodes, which could raise the need for thresholding at this stage.</p><p>MULTIseq.preProcess was used to identify the barcode sequence based on its position relative to the P7 primer. The result is a readTable with each row showing the Cell ID, UMI, and barcode sequence. The same UMI appeared in multiple rows and could have different barcodes.</p><p>MULTIseq.align function was used to match the barcode sequence in each row of readTable to the 5 barcodes, and to find the numbers of UMI associated with each barcode in each sample. This function utilizes a minimal Hamming distance of 1 to call a match between barcodes detected in the sequencing samples and the list of designed barcodes. We would suggest a minimal hamming distance of 2. Many of the sequences with a minimal Hamming distance of 2 have a frameshift of 1 nucleotide as compared to the designed barcodes. If the parameter of MULTIseq.preProcess is adjusted to change the position of the expected barcode, we would expect to find the full-length barcode. A specific example is:</p><p>&quot;<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGGCACAGACTTTG</named-content>&quot; has a Hamming distance of 2 as compared to barcode 2 &quot;<named-content content-type="sequence">GAAGGCACAGACTTT</named-content>&quot;, and should also be considered as a match.</p><p>More importantly, MULTIseq.align does not consider the complication that multiple barcodes could be detected for the same UMI, and simply uses the barcode of the first duplicated UMI. Taking the FAC-sorted pfc_4 dataset as an example, the readTable generated using this dataset contains 30272582 rows. The third column represents sequences detected at the specified barcode position.</p><p>After aligning to the 5 barcodes with a max hamming distance of two, 26443131 of the sequences detected at the specified barcode position can be matched, leading to 474012 unique combinations of Cell/UMI, each combination with a set of detected barcodes.</p><p>Many of the UMIs are associated with multiple barcodes. In the pfc_4 dataset, 68955 of the 474012 unique combinations of Cell/UMI are associated with multiple barcodes (14.5%).</p><p>When we used the data above to compare the density distributions of barcode counts per UMI per cell for the pfc_4 dataset and that of non-neuronal cells, we find that low barcode counts may not be specific. The best negative control here would be to use GFP-negative cells after FACS.</p><p>Depending on the threshold values to eliminate these false barcode counts, we reached an even smaller number of barcoded neurons at the end of the analysis.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;High-throughput mapping of single-neuron projection and molecular features by retrograde barcoded labeling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The approach involves multiplexed retrograde tracing by injecting distinctly barcoded rAAV-retro viruses into different target areas, followed by scRNAseq of neurons in the source area on the 10xGenomics platform. The projection targets of barcoded neurons in the source area can be inferred by matching the detected barcodes to the barcode sequences to of rAAV-retro viruses injected into the target areas.</p><p>Validation of this approach was conducted by injecting rAAVs carrying five distinct 15-nt barcodes to five known ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) targets. This revised version has performed integration analysis with previously existing vmPFC scRNA-seq and MERFISH dataset, and compared vmPFC scRNA clusters and the 7 excitatory neuron subtypes analyzed in this study with those in prior datasets. MERGEseq facilitated the identification of vmPFC cell types projecting to distinct areas, revealing that each of the seven identified excitatory neuron subtypes projects to multiple targets, and the five targets receive projections from multiple transcriptomic types. MERGE-seq derived projection patterns were validated through dual-color retro-AAV tracing and were correlated successfully with fMOST-based single-neuron tracing data. Additionally, marker genes for projection-specific cell subclasses were validated in retrogradely labeled vmPFC using RNA FISH for marker detection.</p><p>This revised version has effectively tackled the previously raised concerns. Significant efforts have been dedicated to performing an integrated analysis with existing datasets, enhancing the data analysis methodology, and imposing more stringent criteria for barcode determination. The revised manuscript places greater emphasis on acknowledging and incorporating several prior approaches that influenced the development of the MERGE-seq concept. While the efficiency of retrograde barcoding wasn't experimentally addressed by injecting rAAV-retro viruses with different barcodes into the same region, the limitations and potential concerns of MERGE-seq are now explicitly discussed. Additionally, the revised manuscript provides clarity on essential technical aspects, including QC criteria and parameters for evaluating scRNA data quality. In sum, this manuscript is rigorous and thorough, offering a valuable approach for the multiplexed investigation of neuronal transcriptomics and projection targets.</p><p>In addition, I suggest that QC criteria should be explicitly listed in the main text. The number of cells passing each QC step should also be listed either in the main text or in the related figures. My understanding is that there is a general QC step for scRNAseq quality based on gene count, total UMI count, and mitochondrial gene expression and that there is another step to identify low-quality cells and contaminated non-neuron cells. It would be very helpful that such information is readily available in the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.85419.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The manuscript builds upon several prior approaches, only some of which are discussed and cited.

The introduction discusses current techniques like BARseq but makes no mention of the current retrograde tracing and sequencing techniques which is what MERGEseq is actually improving upon.

In the revised introduction, we reiterate the technological gap in currently existing methods of mapping neuronal projections, including MAPseq (Kebschull et al., Neuron, 2016), BARseq (Chen et al., Cell, 2019; Sun et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2021), ConnectID (Klingler et al., Nature, 2021), BRICseq (Huang et al., Cell, 2020), VECTORseq (Retro-seq-based) (Cheung et al., Cell Rep., 2022).

Figure 1 – Supplement 1 shows that very different UMI cutoffs were used to call a cell &quot;positive&quot; for each barcode index.

Then we use the annotated “Excitatory neuron” cluster to further cluster excitatory neuronal subtypes. Based on the 2nd round clustering result, we found several clusters expressed a lower number of counts per cell, a lower number of genes per cell, a higher percentage of mitochondria genes, and ribosome protein genes as differentially expressed genes, which indicates cell clusters with low cell quality (Ilicic et al., Genome Biology, 2016). We also found several other clusters with a small number of cells expressing typical markers of non-neuron cells, such as microglia (C1qa, C1qb) oligodendrocytes (Olig1, Olig2) and endothelial cells (Flt1, Cldn5), which indicates “contamination” of other cell types mixed in “Excitatory neuron” in the initial clustering results.

In the discussion, authors might comment on the added value of capturing the &quot;full&quot; transcriptome at the cost of spatial resolution.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that our current methodology has the advantages below. First, we use a commercialized scRNA-seq technology (10X Genomics), which does not require a specialized technique or equipment setup and is cost-inexpensive. Second, there are many elaborate published spatially-resolved mouse brain atlases generated by Allen Brain Institute, Xiaowei Zhuang’s lab, and many others (Zhang et al., Biorxiv, 2023; Yao et al., Biorxiv, 2023; Allen et al., Cell, 2023). Using differentially expressed genes detected by scRNA-seq 10X Genomics, one can easily annotate the cell population spatially. For example, we performed a comparison analysis of our scRNA-seq data with recently published MERFISH data of PFC (Bhattacherjee et al., Nature Neuroscience, 2023), which confidently provides us with the spatial information of neuronal subtypes (revised Figure 2D). Third, current spatially-resolved single-cell transcriptomics technologies are either imaging-based (MERSCOPE) or next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based (Deng et al., Nature Reviews Bioengineering, 2023). Imaging-based spatial transcriptomics enables single-cell or subcellular resolution, however, is currently cost-expensive, limited by the number of genes detected, and biased to a preselected gene panel. On the other hand, NGS-based spatial transcriptomics enables unbiased gene detection, however, many NGS-based spatial technologies do not support the authentic single-cell resolution (e.g., 50um 10x Genomics Visium or 10-50um for DBiT-seq-based methods) (Deng et al., 2023, Nature Reviews Bioengineering). With all these technological considerations, we believe our method stands out as a robust solution and offers an advantageous balance between resolution and scope.</p><p>We have included this part of the discussion in the Discussion part of the revised manuscript (line 473-482).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

They can then use such efficiency to calibrate their estimation of &quot;dedicated&quot; vs. &quot;collateral&quot; projections. (Note that retrograde labeling efficiency may differ for different sites.) Without such calibration, the authors should caution the readers about the (likely large) underestimation of true collateralization whenever such data are presented and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer for the constructive suggestion concerning the efficiency of retrograde barcoding in our study. We understand the critical importance of accurately determining the efficiency of retrograde barcoding and acknowledge the challenges presented by varying labeling efficiencies across different sites. Our analysis has focused on cells identified through a stringent barcoding threshold, ensuring reliable data, yet we acknowledge that this approach may not represent the full diversity of neuronal projection patterns.</p><p>In response, we have amended the manuscript to more clearly highlight the potential underestimation of collateral projections due to incomplete labeling (line 500-501). This cautionary note emphasizes that our quantitative conclusions might not fully capture the true breadth of neuronal projections. We aim to ensure that readers are thoroughly informed about this limitation and the potential implications for interpreting our data. These revisions have been incorporated into both the Results and Discussion sections to avert any misinterpretation of our study's outcomes. We also propose to combine single-molecule imaging techniques (e.g., MERFISH) with MERGE-seq in the future to generate spatially-resolved and quantitively-enhanced projection patterns (line 517-518). Finally, we provided additional joint analysis with fMOST-based single-neuron projectome data (Gao et al., 2022, Nature Neuroscience) to further validate the projection patterns (&gt; = 3 targets) that cannot be easily validated with dual-color retro-AAV tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another issue with &quot;dedicated&quot; projections: the authors only examined 5 targets.

Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we clustered all cells detected by scRNA-seq to generate major cell type classification, i.e., excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and microglia. Then we use the annotated “Excitatory neuron” cluster to further cluster excitatory neuronal subtypes. Based on the 2nd round clustering result, we found several clusters expressed a lower number of counts per cell, a lower number of genes per cell, a higher percentage of mitochondria genes and ribosome protein genes as differentially expressed genes, which indicates cell clusters with low cell quality (Ilicic et al., Genome Biology, 2016). We also found several other clusters with a small number of cells expressing typical markers of non-neuron cells, such as microglia (C1qa, C1qb) oligodendrocytes (Olig1, Olig2) and endothelial cells (Flt1, Cldn5), which indicates “contamination” of other cell types mixed in “Excitatory neuron” in the initial clustering results. Based on these analyses, we filtered out those cells from the “Excitatory neuron” cluster and redid clustering to generate excitatory neuronal subtypes. We provided a supplementable tale (revised supplementary file 1) containing the marker genes of 2nd round clustering before filtering out 637 cells in the revised manuscript. We improved the main text for clarity by changing “stressed neurons” to “low-quality cells and contaminated non-neuron cells” and included this detailed analysis description in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please mention which 10x Genomics chemistry version (e.g., v2, v3, v3.1) you use in the main text and criteria for QC (lowest acceptable UMI or gene detection level, as well as median gene detection for different cell classes: excitatory, inhibitory and non-neuronal).</p></disp-quote><p>We used Chromium Single Cell 3' Reagent Kit (v3) in this study (Cat#PN1000075).

We consider that it is equally important to demonstrate correspondence across both major classes and excitatory neuronal subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Cell type identity definition: I suggest performing data integration (for example using Seurat) with Bhattacherjee et al., 2019, Liu et al. 2021 and with Yao et al. 2021 (see above) to give more updated names to cell types. The paper should start with cell type definition and present consistent nomenclature from the beginning.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we first performed a comparison analysis of our scRNA-seq data with recently published MERFISH data of PFC (Bhattacherjee et al., 2023, Nature Neuroscience), which confidently provides us with the spatial information of neuronal subtypes (revised Figure 2D). Then we also compare our dataset with the exciatory neuronal subtypes datasets of Bhattacherjee et al., 2019, Lui et al., 2021 and Yao at al., 2021. One thing that is worth mentioning is Lui et al., 2021 sequenced Rbp4cre+ neurons, which are most Layer 5 excitatory projection neurons. Based on the correspondence matrix generated based on MERFISH data and our scRNA-seq data, we have mentioned this spatial nomenclature in the corresponding main text. However, we kept our original annotation to keep the authenticity of the data since we do not have the spatial transcriptomic data. We have included these changes in the revised Figure 2D and revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Caution should be exercised when interpreting under-represented cell types in MERGE-seq. Figure 2 shows that only 8 neurons of the L5-Htr2c subtype were validly barcoded. However, in addition to the possibility that this subtype does not project to the five targets included in this study, the small number of barcoded L5-Htr2c subtype could also be caused by the tropism of AAV2-Retro viruses, or the selective loss of L5-Htr2c neurons in tissue processing due to cell death. Comparison with the in situ hybridization patterns of marker genes in Supplementary Figure 2 and the proportions of neuronal subtypes in Figure 2b suggests bias in sampling of cell subtypes by scRNA-seq. Therefore, independent approaches should be utilized to further investigate the projection targets of L5-Htr2c neurons before reaching a conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that a small number of barcoded L5-Htr2c neurons could be due to cell loss during single-cell dissociation or tropism selection of AAV2-retro. We have explicitly mentioned this in the revised manuscript (line 202-204) and discussed this in the Discussion part (line 488-495). As suggested by comment 17, we refined our threshold selection criteria and set the Hamming distance threshold to 2. Under the new threshold, we found 9 L5-Htr2c neurons were determined as barcoded.</p><p>line 202-204: “Only 9 neurons of the L5-Htr2c subtype were recovered with valid barcodes, which may be attributable to technical factors including cell loss during dissociation or AAV2-retro tropism.

Alternatively, this subtype may intrinsically lack projections to the selected target regions examined in this study. Furthermore, single-cell dissociation for scRNA-seq can result in cell loss, thereby reducing the recovery rate of barcoded neurons. All these factors could influence the extent to which the complete range of neuronal projections is captured. Consequently, the quantitative conclusions drawn here might not fully represent the true extent of neuronal projections.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) We suggest replacing &quot;unbarcoded&quot; with &quot;non-barcoded&quot;. &quot;Un-barcoded&quot; sounds like the cells were barcoded and then the barcode was removed.

In the Figure 6E and 6F (now as revised Figure 6D and 6F), 1,853 barcoded neurons (top 10 frequent projection patterns) were represented. We want to suggest that at mRNA level, projection target is correlated with certain genes. Thus we did not show the cell type assignments. However, the audience can find corresponding cell type assignments and labels in revised Figure 2E, where we already indicated the distribution of neuronal subtypes for barcoded neurons associated with each projection target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Line 490/491 Please include these references when referring to Retro-seq: Tasic et al. 2016 (https://doi.org/10.1038/nn.4216), Tasic et al. 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-018-0654-5), Yao et al. 2021, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2021.04.021, Zhang et al. 2021 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03223-w )</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited these papers in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Completeness and sensitivity of barcode recovery of the approach: The authors recovered 1791 EGFP-positive cells undergoing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from three mice and 19,470 single cells without sorting from the other three mice. Using thresholds calculated based on barcode counts in non-neurons, they found that the percentage of barcoded cells in FACS sorted or unsorted groups are 54% and 12%, respectively. Given that almost all cells sorted by FACS should have been infected with the barcoded GFP AAV viruses, the recovery rate for barcodes is low. Therefore, labeling neurons as barcoded and unbarcoded based on the detection of barcodes will create false negatives, that is, classifying many retrograded labeled neurons as &quot;unbarcoded&quot; (we suggest changing this to &quot;non-barcoded&quot;). It seems that the projectomes of neurons cannot be simply derived from barcode detection through sequencing. Many &quot;unbarcoded&quot; projection neurons were in fact retrogradely labeled by AAV viruses injected into a specific target but were negative for barcodes due to technical limitations.</p><p>One immediate issue caused by the false negative rate of barcode detection is whether the machine learning-based modeling is provided with the right training data (Figure 6). For this model to predict projectomes based on transcriptomes, it first requires a good correlation between barcoding and projectome.</p><p>More discussion should be given to the recovery rate of barcodes, and its potential impact on data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment of the reviewer. To achieve a stringent categorization of barcoded cells, we set several thresholds to filter cells in order. First, we calculated the 95th percentile of the total number of unique molecular identifiers (nUMI) that are mapped with five barcodes, and removed the unusually high numbers of UMIs, which might indicate doublets or PCR-biased amplification. Next, we used two set of cells as negative control, that is, cells supposed not to contain projection barcodes. First set of negative control cells we used is non-neuronal cells classified by coarse clustering based on single-cell transcriptome. Second set of negative control cells we used is “EGFP-negative” cells in FAC-sorted dataset. Basically, we calculated the total five projection barcodes counts determined by cellranger of FAC-sorted dataset, then we assigned the cells with zero projection barcodes counts as “EGFP-negative” cells. For two set of negative control cells, we searched for the value in the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) that is closest to the 99.9th percentile agains each projection barcode, respectively. We selected the higher UMI threshold from the two given sets of threshold values. Next, a cell is determined to be validly barcoded if the number of the barcode UMIs within the cell is larger than the threshold. For example, the calculated threshold of UMIs for barcode 0 (AI) is 28, which means if a cell contains more than 28 UMIs of barcode 0, then this cell is validly barcoded by AI. UMIs threshold for DMS, 101; for MD, 114; for BLA, 35; for LH, 103. It is worth mentioning that the UMI threshold differs for different targets due to different magnitude of barcode expression of each projection target (Figure 1—figure supplement 1I).</p><p>To validate barcode/non-barcode label integrity for machine learning, we performed 100 iterations randomly sampling 1000 cells and swapping labels between barcoded/non-barcoded groups. Prediction accuracy, AUC, and F1 scores of original models using the top 50 HVGs with true labels were compared to models with swapped labels. In each of the 100 trials, 1000 of the 8210 total cells were sampled and barcoded/non-barcoded labels swapped as extensively as group size allowed. We found model performance decreased after label swapping compared to original training labels (revised Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). This analysis suggests that while our stringent UMI threshold might result in some false positives, the barcoded versus non-barcoded labeling approach we adopted still offers a reliable foundation for machine learning training data. Additionally, we have clarified that we limited our analysis and conclusions to data derived from barcoded samples. Line 167-170: <italic>“ The lower fraction of barcoded versus EGFP+ cells suggests our conservative threshold increases false negatives, classifying some low UMI cells as non-barcoded. Therefore, we focused analyses on reliably barcoded cells, though conclusions may not capture the full heterogeneous projection repertoire.”</italic></p><p>We have included the detailed description of threshold determination in the revised manuscript. We also thoroughly discussed the current limitations, computational challenges, potential impact on data analysis, and potential solutions in the revised Discussion (line 484-517).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Additional analysis and control experiments related to barcode detection:</p><p>The low barcode recovery rate could be due to the low number of copies for AAV-encoded transcripts in the transcriptome of single cells, or it is specific for the detection of short barcode sequences. With the current scRNAseq data, one additional analysis is to measure the percentage of neurons positive for GFP transcripts from both FAC-sorted and non-sorted samples and compare the GFP+ neuron frequency to barcode+ neuron frequency.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion. We set the threshold for scRNA-seq data: if GFP UMI counts (sum of all five barcodes UMI counts) in a certain cell are larger than 0, we will determine this cell as a GFP+ cell, otherwise, it is a GFP- cell. We calculated the GFP+ ratio in FAC-sorted and non-sorted groups (Non-sorted group 1-3, group1: 27%, group2: 25%, group3: 27%; FAC-sorted group 4: 81%). In parallel, we also calculated the barcoded ratio in FAC-sorted and non-sorted groups (Non-sorted group 1-3, group1: 17%, group2: 20%, group3: 19%; FAC-sorted group 4: 49%). We can see that barcoded cells ratio is relatively lower than EGFP+ cells. The lower fraction of barcoded versus EGFP+ cells suggests our threshold increases false negatives, classifying some low UMI cells as non-barcoded. Therefore, we focused analyses on reliably barcoded cells, though conclusions may not capture the full heterogeneous projection repertoire.</p><p>We added the GFP+ ratio and barcoded ratio across FAC-sorted and non-sorted groups into the revised Figure S1G and S1H, we also discussed this potential limitation in the Discussion section (line 496-517).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) To enrich cDNA fragments composed of the barcode index, unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), and the barcode, the authors prepared expressed virus barcode libraries with special primers. The authors also tried to detect barcodes directly in single-cell transcriptional libraries. What was the barcode detection frequency without this additional amplification, that is, in regular single-cell transcriptional libraries? It would be good to comment on how much this approach (we assume) improves barcode detection compared to the regular 10x single-cell libraries without additional barcode amplification.</p></disp-quote><p>The projectome and scRNA-seq libraries have different structures due to their distinct amplification templates. The projectome library uses full-length post-amplified cDNA, while the scRNA-seq library uses fragmented cDNA. A key advantage of PCR-enriching the EGFP-barcode region from full-length cDNA is that it generates an organized projectome library structure. Based on our primer design, the expected format is: cell barcode in Read 1 (bases 1-16), UMI in Read 1 (bases 17-28), and projection barcode in Read 2 (bases 31-45). In contrast, in the scRNA-seq libraries, the randomly fragmented cDNA produces variable read lengths covering the 15 bp projection barcode, decreasing detection sensitivity and accuracy. Therefore, a direct comparison of projectome and scRNA-seq libraries for barcode detection may not be feasible.</p><p>We have calculated the reads that are mapped to the five barcodes, either based on scRNA-seq libraries fastq file using cellranger or based on projectome libraries using our methods adapted from MULTI-seq (McGinnis et al., 2019, Nature Methods). We found that scRNA-seq libraries contain lots of zero counts for projection barcode (Note that we used UMI+1 for plot) (revised FigureS1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) The authors hypothesized that the non-neuronal cells would not be transduced by rAAV2-retro. The barcode counts in these non-neuronal cells were used to generate the thresholds for projection neurons. However, such cells, especially microglia, could be positive for AAV transcripts perhaps by phagocytosing dying infected neurons. A better control cell population could be cells negative for GFP after FACS. If sequencing data are available for such GFP-negative cells, it would be useful to examine the detection of barcodes in these cells and use them as the negative control for thresholding.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the rigorous suggestions of the reviewer. We agree with the reviewer that some of the non-neuronal cells could be “barcoded”. In the revised Figure 1F, we have shown that, non-neurons such as endothelial cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and oligodendrocytes contain several cells that have been determined as barcoded. In the revised projection barcode threshold analysis, we also used “EGFP-negative” cells as determined by scRNA-seq data (see revised Methods part, or response to comment 13 for detail). Unfortunately, we did not collect and sequence the GFP-negative cells after FACS. We also agreed that EGFP-negative cells by FACS are an alternative good negative control cells. We have included this point in the Discussion part of the revised manuscript (line 496-517).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) In the section on Projection barcode FASTQ alignment, the authors stated that deMULTIplex R package (v1.0.2) (https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/MULTI-seq) was used to count UMIs associated with barcodes. This method was designed to detect the Sample index and needs to be further adjusted for barcode reading. The current method did not reveal the fact that a single UMI could be associated with multiple barcodes, which could raise the need for thresholding at this stage.</p><p>MULTIseq.preProcess was used to identify the barcode sequence based on its position relative to the P7 primer. The result is a readTable with each row showing the Cell ID, UMI, and barcode sequence. The same UMI appeared in multiple rows and could have different barcodes.</p><p>MULTIseq.align function was used to match the barcode sequence in each row of readTable to the 5 barcodes, and to find the numbers of UMI associated with each barcode in each sample. This function utilizes a minimal Hamming distance of 1 to call a match between barcodes detected in the sequencing samples and the list of designed barcodes. We would suggest a minimal hamming distance of 2. Many of the sequences with a minimal Hamming distance of 2 have a frameshift of 1 nucleotide as compared to the designed barcodes. If the parameter of MULTIseq.preProcess is adjusted to change the position of the expected barcode, we would expect to find the full-length barcode. A specific example is:</p><p>&quot;<named-content content-type="sequence">AAGGCACAGACTTTG</named-content>&quot; has a Hamming distance of 2 as compared to barcode 2 &quot;<named-content content-type="sequence">GAAGGCACAGACTTT</named-content>&quot;, and should also be considered as a match.</p><p>More importantly, MULTIseq.align does not consider the complication that multiple barcodes could be detected for the same UMI, and simply uses the barcode of the first duplicated UMI. Taking the FAC-sorted pfc_4 dataset as an example, the readTable generated using this dataset contains 30272582 rows. The third column represents sequences detected at the specified barcode position.</p><p>After aligning to the 5 barcodes with a max hamming distance of two, 26443131 of the sequences detected at the specified barcode position can be matched, leading to 474012 unique combinations of Cell/UMI, each combination with a set of detected barcodes.</p><p>Many of the UMIs are associated with multiple barcodes. In the pfc_4 dataset, 68955 of the 474012 unique combinations of Cell/UMI are associated with multiple barcodes (14.5%).</p><p>When we used the data above to compare the density distributions of barcode counts per UMI per cell for the pfc_4 dataset and that of non-neuronal cells, we find that low barcode counts may not be specific. The best negative control here would be to use GFP-negative cells after FACS.</p><p>Depending on the threshold values to eliminate these false barcode counts, we reached an even smaller number of barcoded neurons at the end of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the careful examination, insightful comments and suggestions regarding the alignment of projection barcode FASTQ in our methods section. We have carefully reviewed and subsequently modified our methodology to address the concerns raised.</p><p>First, we have revised the MULTIseq.align function to address the issue of multiple barcodes being detected for the same UMI. We now include a more robust analysis of duplicated UMIs to ensure that all potential barcode matches are considered, rather than defaulting to the first duplicate. Second, we have also adopted a minimal Hamming distance of 2 for the MULTIseq.align function to improve the matching accuracy between detected and designed barcodes. We agree with reviewer that GFP-negative cells after FACS could be an alternatively good control (see response to comment 16). We have now updated our analysis using our improved projection barcode alignment (see Code availability in the revised manuscript) and stringent UMI threshold (see revised Methods part or response to comment 13) to determine barcoded/non-barcoded neurons.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers have outlined a couple of additional changes that are needed to fully respond to the prior critiques.

The approach involves multiplexed retrograde tracing by injecting distinctly barcoded rAAV-retro viruses into different target areas, followed by scRNAseq of neurons in the source area on the 10xGenomics platform. The projection targets of barcoded neurons in the source area can be inferred by matching the detected barcodes to the barcode sequences to of rAAV-retro viruses injected into the target areas.</p><p>Validation of this approach was conducted by injecting rAAVs carrying five distinct 15-nt barcodes to five known ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) targets. This revised version has performed integration analysis with previously existing vmPFC scRNA-seq and MERFISH dataset, and compared vmPFC scRNA clusters and the 7 excitatory neuron subtypes analyzed in this study with those in prior datasets. MERGEseq facilitated the identification of vmPFC cell types projecting to distinct areas, revealing that each of the seven identified excitatory neuron subtypes projects to multiple targets, and the five targets receive projections from multiple transcriptomic types. MERGE-seq derived projection patterns were validated through dual-color retro-AAV tracing and were correlated successfully with fMOST-based single-neuron tracing data. Additionally, marker genes for projection-specific cell subclasses were validated in retrogradely labeled vmPFC using RNA FISH for marker detection.</p><p>This revised version has effectively tackled the previously raised concerns. Significant efforts have been dedicated to performing an integrated analysis with existing datasets, enhancing the data analysis methodology, and imposing more stringent criteria for barcode determination. The revised manuscript places greater emphasis on acknowledging and incorporating several prior approaches that influenced the development of the MERGE-seq concept. While the efficiency of retrograde barcoding wasn't experimentally addressed by injecting rAAV-retro viruses with different barcodes into the same region, the limitations and potential concerns of MERGE-seq are now explicitly discussed. Additionally, the revised manuscript provides clarity on essential technical aspects, including QC criteria and parameters for evaluating scRNA data quality. In sum, this manuscript is rigorous and thorough, offering a valuable approach for the multiplexed investigation of neuronal transcriptomics and projection targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your positive assessment of MERGE-seq and recognition of our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, I suggest that QC criteria should be explicitly listed in the main text.

Following initial quality control, which ensured the number of detected RNA in each cell ranged between 500 and 8000, RNA UMI counts in each cell were within 1000 to 60000, and the percentage of mitochondrial genes remained below 20%, we recovered 1791 cells undergoing fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from three mice and 19,470 single cells without sorting from the other three mice, a total of 21,261 cells.”</p><p>For the QC of low-quality cells and contaminated non-neuron cells in the excitatory neurons, in the Line 187-195:</p><p>We added “We first re-clustered excitatory projection neurons expressing Slc17a7 (also known as vesicular glutamate transporter, Vglut1). Clusters with low gene/UMI counts and high mitochondrial gene expression were filtered out as low-quality (Ilicic et al., 2016). Some clusters exhibited non-neuronal cell markers like microglial genes (C1qa, C1qb), oligodendrocyte genes (Olig1, Olig2), and endothelial cell genes (Flt1, Cldn5) despite small cluster size, indicating contamination from other cell types incorrectly grouped within excitatory neurons after initial clustering. In total, we filtered out 637 cells that were identified as either low-quality or contaminated with non-neuronal cell types and recovered 9368 excitatory neurons (see Methods, Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, Supplementary file 1).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
