Despite presence of the catalytic PNG subunit and the PLU and GNU activating subunits in the mature oocyte, GNU is phosphorylated at Cyclin B/CDK1sites and unable to bind PNG and PLU. In vitro phosphorylation of GNU by CyclinB/CDK1 blocks activation of PNG. Meiotic completion promotes GNU dephosphorylation and PNG kinase activation to regulate translation. The critical regulatory effect of phosphorylation is shown by replacement in the oocyte with a phosphorylation-resistant form of GNU, which promotes PNG-GNU complex formation, elevation of Cyclin B, and meiotic defects consistent with premature PNG activation. After PNG activation GNU is destabilized, thus inactivating PNG. This short-lived burst in kinase activity links development with maternal mRNA translation and ensures irreversibility of the oocyte-to-embryo transition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22219.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22219.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22219.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>New egg cells form via a specialized kind of cell division called called meiosis, and will pause at key stages in this process before continuing their development. One of these pauses occurs before the egg cell is fertilized. At fertilization, the egg cell becomes “activated”, development resumes, and it starts forming into an embryo. Molecules deposited in the egg cell when it originally formed are used to control these earliest stages of embryonic development. These molecules include messenger RNA molecules (mRNAs for short), which can be “translated” to build proteins.</p><p>In fruit flies, an enzyme called PNG kinase regulates the translation of hundreds of mRNA molecules during the period after the pause, when the maturing egg cell is activated and the embryo begins to develop. It is not well understood what activates and inactivates the kinase to limit its activity to this period of time. However, it was known that a protein called GNU was needed to bind to the PNG kinase to make it active.</p><p>CyclinB/CDK1 is another kinase, and in contrast to PNG it is highly active when the egg cell is paused. When the egg cell is activated for embryonic development, the levels of this second kinase drop sharply and meiosis is completed. Like all kinases, CyclinB/CDK1 attaches phosphate groups onto other molecules, and Hara et al. now show that CyclinB/CDK1 can modify the GNU protein in this way. The added phosphate groups prevent GNU from binding to the PNG kinase, meaning that the high levels of CyclinB/CDK1 during the pause stop GNU from activating the PNG kinase. However, when the egg cell is activated, the level of CyclinB/CDK1 declines so that there are not enough of these molecules to add phosphates onto GNU. This leaves GNU free to activate the PNG kinase, allowing this kinase to control the translation of mRNA molecules. Furthermore, the activity of PNG kinase leads to the destruction of GNU, and this feedback loop limits this kinase’s activity to the narrow window of time in which it is needed.</p><p>The fruit fly is the second example of an animal in which the activity of a kinase essential for embryonic development has been linked to the completion of meiosis (the other being the roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans).</italic> The use of this strategy in two such different animals suggests that it may also be common to many other animals, including humans. Further investigation is now needed to determine if this is indeed the case.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22219.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22219.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>egg activation</kwd><kwd>maternal mRNA</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>Drosophila</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Masatoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hara</surname><given-names>Masatoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM39341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orr-Weaver</surname><given-names>Terry L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The kinase that controls maternal mRNA translation is regulated by phosphorylation of its activating subunit to restrict kinase activity to the developmental window between meiosis completion and early embryogenesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The onset of embryogenesis at the oocyte-to-embryo transition occurs in the absence of transcription and thus requires remodeling of mRNA translation that alters the proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tadros and Lipshitz, 2009</xref>). This dramatic alteration in maternal mRNA translation is timed to be coordinated with egg activation and the completion of meiosis, but the mechanisms linking these developmental events are unknown. The production of a mature oocyte and its transition to an embryo involve arrest and release of meiosis at two points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Von Stetina and Orr-Weaver, 2011</xref>). The immature oocyte is arrested at prophase of meiosis I (prophase I) in nearly all animals to permit oocyte differentiation, and this arrest is released as oocyte maturation initiates. Maturation leads to the oocyte entering the meiotic divisions and arresting at a second point, metaphase of meiosis II (metaphase II) in vertebrates and metaphase of meiosis I (metaphase I) in insects.</p><p>We use the term egg activation to denote the onset of events that mark the transition of oocyte to embryo, such as release of the secondary meiotic arrest, completion of meiosis, and changes in translation of maternal mRNAs. In many organisms egg activation is linked to fertilization, although it can be independent in organisms such as Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horner and Wolfner, 2008b</xref>). The profound developmental change as the oocyte transitions to an embryo involves extensive reorganization of the proteome. In contrast to somatic cells, in which transcription is a major source of gene expression changes, in most animal species oocytes and early embryos are dependent on posttranscriptional control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Walker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Potireddy et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krauchunas and Wolfner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson and Lin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2014b</xref>). The absence of transcription in this developmental phase necessitates translational control of maternal mRNAs deposited in the oocyte. Changes in protein stability also influence the proteome during this transition.</p><p>A key question in developmental biology is how these changes in translation and protein stability are controlled. The role of translation in the onset of oocyte maturation has been studied in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mendez and Richter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2013</xref>), but translational control during the oocyte-to-embryo transition is poorly understood. In addition, the events accompanying egg activation must be coupled to the completion of meiosis, but the mechanistic basis of this linkage is unknown. To define how changes in translation are coordinated with meiotic cell cycle progression following egg activation, we use the fruit fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>In Drosophila, an oocyte develops through fourteen morphologically distinct stages in an egg chamber consisting of fifteen nurse cells and surrounding follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Spradling, 1993</xref>). Oocytes in early stages (from stage 5 to 12) are arrested at prophase I. Oocytes in stage 13 undergo nuclear envelope breakdown, and mature stage 14 oocytes are arrested at metaphase I. Egg activation is triggered by rehydration and mechanical stimulation during ovulation, just prior to and independently of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Horner and Wolfner, 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krauchunas et al., 2013</xref>). In many species, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is involved in egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stricker, 1999</xref>); this is true also in Drosophila despite the lack of a role for sperm entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaneuchi et al., 2015</xref>). When activated oocytes are laid without fertilization (unfertilized activated eggs), they are arrested after the completion of meiosis. Although maternal mRNAs are translated, mitosis does not begin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Doane, 1960</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahowald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>). Fertilized embryos enter into rapid embryonic mitotic cycles, which consist of alternating S- and M-phases.</p><p>Our recent genome-wide study has shown that hundreds of maternal mRNAs are translationally up- or down-regulated during the oocyte-to-embryo transition and that the majority of these translational changes require PNG kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>png</italic> was identified originally as a gene necessary for initiation of mitosis in the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shamanski and Orr-Weaver, 1991</xref>).

Our biochemical analysis using purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that PNG forms a complex with PLU and GNU and that GNU dimerizes the PNG-PLU subcomplex to elevate its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>). However, how PNG kinase activity is developmentally regulated during the oocyte-to-embryo transition remains unknown. Unraveling this mechanism is important for understanding coupling of the events induced by egg activation. Here we show that CDK1 phosphorylation of GNU negatively regulates PNG kinase activity. PNG kinase becomes activated after meiosis completion promoted by CDK1 inactivation and then self inactivates, limiting its activity to the transition between oocyte and embryo and providing the mechanism to coordinate completion of meiosis with regulation of maternal mRNA translation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dynamics of PNG kinase complex components during oocyte maturation</title><p>To decipher the developmental control of PNG kinase, we first examined the dynamics of protein levels of the PNG complex subunits during the developmental window that includes oocyte maturation (egg chamber stages 10–14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). PNG and PLU were observed in extracts from stage 10 oocytes, which are arrested in prophase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, GNU was undetectable in stage 10, but was present as maturation occurred in stage 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The protein levels of all three subunits were high in mature oocytes (stage 14), which are arrested at metaphase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>), a conclusion supported by quantitative mass spectrometry experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>). These results show protein expression of all the PNG complex components during oocyte maturation, but GNU protein is expressed in a narrower time window during very late oogenesis.

Egg activation is triggered by ovulation, and activated oocytes rapidly resume and complete meiosis in the oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Heifetz et al., 2001</xref>), preventing recovery of oocytes in intermediate meiotic stages after egg activation. A powerful in vitro egg activation system, however, provides a means to follow the events after egg activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mahowald et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horner and Wolfner, 2008a</xref>). In this system, isolated stage 14 oocytes are activated by hypotonic buffer treatment, and the in vitro activated oocytes reproduce the events normally occurring rapidly in the oviduct, including meiotic cycle progression and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Horner and Wolfner, 2008a</xref>). In the in vitro activated oocytes, the protein levels of PNG complex components did not show major changes except for a slight decrease in GNU levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>Notably, a change in GNU mobility occurred during egg activation. A slower mobility form of GNU present following oocyte maturation was replaced by a faster mobility form between 20 and 30 min after hypotonic buffer treatment. These changes are consistent with a loss of phosphorylation, and indeed the slower mobility forms of GNU were previously noted in oocytes and shown to be due to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renault et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The faster mobility form of GNU likely is hypophosphorylated rather than completely dephosphorylated, as phosphoproteome studies showed that GNU is phosphorylated at several sites in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhai et al., 2008</xref>). The upper bands of GNU disappeared when okadaic acid (OA), a PP2A phosphatase inhibitor, was omitted from the native lysis buffer, implying that the slower mobility is due to phosphorylation and sensitive to phosphatase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We observed that GNU protein in oocytes is easily dephosphorylated during preparation of oocyte lysates depending on how rapidly the lysates were prepared and whether they were diluted quickly. Thus in some of our early experiments lysates were prepared less rapidly, causing both the phosphorylated and hypophosphorylated forms to be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the dephosphorylation of GNU that accompanies egg activation, we wanted to test when this occurred relative to the completion of meiosis. Lysates were prepared from eggs at time points after activation and monitored for CDK activity by histone H1 phosphorylation or levels of the mitotic Cyclins A and B (CycA and B) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vardy et al., 2009</xref>), CycA levels increased and then declined during oocyte maturation. CycB was accumulated and its levels decreased 20 min after egg activation, beginning to increase again at 40 min. The levels of CycB correlate with oscillation of H1 kinase activity. Activated eggs from each time point were fixed, stained with DAPI, and examined for meiotic stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The 20 min post activation time point marks the point when the majority of eggs were completing meiosis, and by 30 min nearly 60% had completed meiosis. In addition to these population studies in which there could be some variability, individual activated eggs were examined for meiotic stage, and then lysates prepared from each egg and examined for the GNU form on western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The transition from the fully phosphorylated to the hypophosphorylated form was observed to occur between early and late anaphase of meiosis II (anaphase II). Thus we conclude GNU becomes dephosphorylated when CycB levels decline, H1 kinase activity decreases, and meiosis is completed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>PNG kinase is activated during meiosis II completion, concurrent with GNU dephosphorylation</title><p>The presence of all three PNG kinase subunits in mature oocytes, despite the effects of the kinase on translation not being manifest until after egg activation, posed the question of when and how the kinase is activated. The change in GNU form raised the possibility that dephosphorylation of GNU might be linked to PNG activation. To define the timing of PNG activation, we used SMG protein accumulation as an indicator of PNG activity after attempts to immunoprecipitate PNG kinase from activated eggs to measure kinase activity directly failed to obtain sufficient amounts of PNG complex for the assay. Because <italic>smg</italic> maternal mRNA translational activation is a downstream target dependent on PNG, appearance of SMG protein after egg activation requires PNG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>). As detailed above, SMG protein levels were examined by western blots of extracts from staged activated eggs. Strikingly, we found that SMG started to accumulate 20 to 30 min after hypotonic buffer treatment, when GNU is dephosphorylated and meiosis completed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Thus we hypothesized that phosphorylated GNU is unable to activate PNG kinase, and that dephosphorylation at the completion of meiosis leads to PNG activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>In mature oocytes GNU is phosphorylated at CycB/CDK1 sites</title><p>To determine which residues in GNU were phosphorylated in mature oocytes, we generated strains expressing a functional <italic>gnu-gfp</italic> transgene (see Figure 3) under the normal regulatory elements for <italic>gnu</italic>.

In addition to the CycB/CDK1 sites, four other phosphosites were recovered with low numbers of phosphopeptides, although the Ascore values were significant. Eight of the nine CycB/CDK1 sites are in a region in the GNU protein predicted to be disordered by four different algorithms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The decline in H1 kinase and CycB protein levels coincident with dephosphorylation of GNU also were consistent with its phosphorylation being dependent on CycB/CDK1. We tested potential roles for two other kinases. GNU is phosphorylated by PNG in vitro and shows a mobility shift on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).

This also is consistent with the results that PNG kinase becomes activated after egg activation. We noted that MAPK, which is active during oocyte maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivanovska et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sackton et al., 2007</xref>) and phosphorylates S/T-P, seems to be dispensable for the slowest mobility GNU phosphorylated form.

Taken together, these results confirm that interaction between the PNG-PLU sub-complex and GNU is prevented by phosphorylation of CDK1 target sites on GNU. The phosphorylation-resistant form of GNU is able to associate with PNG and results in premature elevation of Cyc B protein levels, consistent with PNG kinase being prematurely active.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22219.019</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The GNU-9A mutant forms a complex with PNG prematurely in mature oocytes despite active CycB/CDK1.</title><p>The GNU-9A mutant, but not wild-type GNU, associates with PNG in meta-I arrested mature oocytes.

We used in vitro activation to examine whether the timing or accuracy of meiotic divisions was altered by the increased levels of CycB resulting from inhibition of GNU phosphorylation by CycB/CDK1. At egg activation the chromosomes at metaphase I condense and become individually distinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page and Orr-Weaver, 1997</xref>). In the GNU-GFP 9A oocytes the condensed phase of metaphase I persisted longer than in wild type, and the metaphase I/anaphase I transition was delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). These results were consistent with increased levels of CycB taking longer to be targeted for degradation mediated by the APC/C E3 ubiquitin ligase to trigger the metaphase I/anaphase I transition. After this transition, however, the levels of Cyclin B declined somewhat more rapidly in the GNU-GFP 9A compared to wild type. This may reflect the reduced activity of GNU-9A compared to wild type and the lower levels of GNU-GFP 9A protein in the 2–8 transgenic line; thus despite premature PNG activation and elevated <italic>cycB</italic> mRNA translation in mature oocytes, after the completion of meiosis there are reduced levels of active PNG kinase to promote full <italic>cycB</italic> translation relative to wild type. This would account for the limited number of activated eggs with GNU-9A that form polar bodies, the condensed meiotic products whose formation is dependent on reactivation of CycB/CDK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to delays in progression through meiosis, the GNU-GFP 9A form resulted in defects in meiotic chromosome segregation. The morphology of chromosomes after egg activation at metaphase I was aberrant in 19–23% of the oocytes. The chromosomes either were delayed in congressing to the metaphase I plate or had incorrect alignment on the plate. Later, as meiosis was completed, the size and DAPI-staining intensity was uneven in up to 23% of oocytes, reflecting unequal segregation of chromosomes during the meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Because there are only four chromosomes in Drosophila and the two large autosomes are the same size, visualization of aberrant chromosome alignment and segregation underestimates the rate of meiotic errors. Thus we conclude that proper levels of CycB protein and possibly other PNG targets are necessary for the accuracy of meiotic divisions in the oocyte. The simplest interpretation of the effects of GNU-GFP 9A in oocytes is that the dephosphorylated form of GNU leads to premature PNG activation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Inactivation of PNG following egg activation</title><p>We previously observed that GNU protein levels were decreased in in vivo activated eggs and early embryos (0–2 hr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kronja et al., 2014b</xref>).

Here we find that in Drosophila the solution to this developmental challenge is the regulation of PNG kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results show that GNU is phosphorylated at CycB/CDK1 sites in mature oocytes, and in vitro CycB/CDK1 can directly phosphorylate GNU and thereby inhibit its ability to activate PNG kinase via inhibition of formation of the complex. In mature oocytes that are arrested at metaphase I, GNU is phosphorylated at CDK1 consensus sites and prevented from interaction with the PNG-PLU sub-complex. Following egg activation, as CycB protein and H1 kinase activity decline, GNU is dephosphorylated. This corresponds to the completion of meiosis and activation of the PNG kinase complex. Consistent with dephosphorylation of GNU being the crucial event for activation of PNG, substitution of a phosphorylation-resistant form of GNU into the oocyte results in premature elevation of CycB protein, implying PNG activation. Thus we propose that control of PNG kinase activity via GNU phosphorylation by CycB/CDK1 links meiotic completion and translational control of maternal mRNA to coordinate their timing precisely during egg activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Active PNG leads to decreased GNU protein levels. This makes a negative feedback to shut down PNG kinase activity, thereby ensuring PNG kinase activity is constrained to the short developmental window of the oocyte-to-embryo transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22219.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A model for developmental regulation of PNG kinase activity during the oocyte-to-embryo transition.</title><p>Although mature stage 14 oocytes, which are arrested at metaphase of meiosis I, have the PNG kinase complex components, CycB/ CDK1 phosphorylates and inhibits GNU, preventing binding to PNG-PLU and active PNG kinase. Egg activation triggers resumption and completion of meiosis, which result in CDK1 inactivation. Subsequently, GNU becomes dephosphorylated, binds to PNG-PLU and activates PNG kinase, leading to translational control of maternal mRNAs, essential for initiation and progression of the mitotic cycle in embryos. Thus, phosphorylation of GNU by CDK1 couples cell cycle progression and maternal mRNA translation during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. PNG kinase activity also reduces GNU protein levels after egg activation. Together with the PNG activation mechanism, the negative feedback causing GNU protein reduction limits PNG kinase activation to this short time window, important for the precise oocyte-to-embryo transition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22219.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22219.021</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-22219-fig7-v1"/></fig></p><p>Our findings highlight the linchpin role the GNU subunit plays in the developmental control of PNG kinase activity. This regulation is exerted both at the levels of GNU protein and via its phosphorylation state. Although the presence of all three PNG kinase complex proteins is limited to late oogenesis through the early embryo, GNU is present over a narrower time window. GNU protein is undetectable in stage 10 oocytes and is rapidly accumulated during oocyte maturation. Our previous genome-wide study showed that GNU protein accumulation during oocytes maturation relies on translational activation of its mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>). Although the regulatory mechanisms for <italic>gnu</italic> translational activation remain to be defined, it is clearly dependent on CDK1, but not MOS, activity. Thus CDK1 promotes the appearance of GNU, permitting all PNG subunits to be present in the mature oocyte and poised for activation, while it simultaneously prevents activation by phosphorylation of GNU.</p><p>Several previous experimental observations now have clear significance in support of the role of CDK1 phosphorylation of GNU in inhibiting PNG complex formation and kinase activation. Ectopic GNU protein expression in early stage oocytes, which are in prophase I, causes <italic>png</italic>-dependent premature CycB protein expression and actin disorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renault et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vardy and Orr-Weaver, 2007</xref>). Importantly, these defects result from expression of GNU at a developmental stage (stage 11) when although PNG and PLU are present at low levels, CycB/CDK1 is not active, and thus would not be able to block formation of the PNG complex. Analysis of the phosphorylation state of GNU in mutants for the calcipressin Sarah (<italic>sra</italic>) or the meiosis-specific APC/C activator Cortex (<italic>cort</italic>) showed that GNU remains hyperphosphorylated in eggs laid from both types of mutant mothers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krauchunas et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, both of these mutants fail to complete meiosis, with <italic>sra</italic> mutant eggs arrested in anaphase I, and <italic>cort</italic> mutants arrested in metaphase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Page and Orr-Weaver, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Horner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takeo et al., 2006</xref>). The failure of GNU to be dephosphorylated in both of these mutants agrees with our demonstration that GNU becomes hypophosphorylated after the completion of meiosis.</p><p>Although PNG and PLU levels in embryos are gradually decreased 2–4 hr after laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elfring et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fenger et al., 2000</xref>) GNU seems to disappear after the completion of meiosis but before the initiation of embryogenesis. This is evidenced by GNU protein levels being decreased in unfertilized in vivo activated eggs, which complete meiosis II but do not enter into the embryonic cycles. This rapid GNU disappearance requires PNG kinase activity, revealing the existence of a negative feedback to shut off PNG activity shortly after its activation. It remains to be determined how GNU protein levels decline. PNG phosphorylates GNU on sites other than the CDK1 sites (Hara and Orr-Weaver, unpublished), and this phosphorylation may target GNU for degradation mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase of the SCF or the APC/C families. We noted that GNU levels fail to decline in <italic>cort</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kronja et al., 2014a</xref>), which lack one form of the APC/C. This may be an indirect effect of failure of dephosphorylation of the CDK1 sites in GNU and thus absence of PNG activation, but it is also possible that GNU is targeted directly to the APC/C<sup>cort</sup> after completion of meiosis.</p><p>A key question raised by the demonstration of the regulatory role of GNU phosphorylation is whether developmental control of phosphatase activity is required. One possibility is that the phosphatase responsible for dephosphorylation of the CDK1 sites in GNU is constitutively active. CycB/CDK1 activity is high in the metaphase I-arrested mature oocyte, but egg activation triggers meiotic resumption and CDK1 inactivation. Reduction of CycB/CDK1 activity in the presence of active phosphatase may be sufficient for hypophosphorylated GNU. Alternatively, egg activation could lead to activation of a phosphatase. The identity of the GNU phosphatase for the CDK1 sites awaits elucidation. Although it has been shown that PP1 is capable of dephosphorylating GNU in mature oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renault et al., 2003</xref>), PP2A also is a possible GNU phosphatase during the process, particularly given it is the major phosphatase that removes phosphates on CDK1 substrates in mitotic exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mochida et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The partial activity of the GNU 9A protein form provides insights into the mechanism by which GNU activates the PNG kinase. This mutant protein binds to the PNG-PLU sub-complex even in high CDK activity, however, it does not activate PNG kinase to the full extent that wild-type GNU does. This implies that there is an additional step to PNG kinase activation after GNU and the PNG-PLU sub-complex interaction. It is likely that the kinase activation following complex formation involves the N-terminus of GNU. A point mutation in the GNU N-terminal region (changing Pro 17 to Leu) retains ability to bind the PNG-PLU sub-complex but not does not activate PNG kinase activity in vitro (Hara and Orr-Weaver, unpublished and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The PNG kinase is significant for the understanding of how a kinase can rapidly control translation of hundreds of mRNAs. In addition to these insights into mRNA translation, identifying and defining the role of regulators involved in triggering the profound changes accompanying the oocyte-to-embryo transition is crucial for our understanding of the onset of development, with implications for human fertility. Here we have shown two forms of regulation of PNG kinase activity: one being regulation of protein expression of PNG kinase complex components and another being regulation of its activity. Strikingly, a cell cycle regulator, CDK1, controls both. This implies that CDK1 precisely regulates PNG kinase activity, a translational regulator, thus coordinating cell cycle progression and the translational landscape change during the oocyte-to-embryo transition. There are interesting parallels between our findings and those in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> another kinase, the MBK-2 member of the conserved DYRK family of dual specificity tyrosine kinases, like PNG is crucial for the oocyte-to-embryo transition. MBK-2 activation is linked to the meiotic cell cycle by being downstream of the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parry and Singson, 2011</xref>). MBK-2 controls proteolysis of oocyte proteins through the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Robertson and Lin, 2013</xref>), and it also affects RNA granule dynamics and thus likely impacts translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Although PNG and MBK-2 are distinct kinases, these distantly related invertebrates utilize parallel approaches of coupling to cell cycle regulators to limit kinase activity to the oocyte-to-embryo transition. In both organisms, this links meiotic progression to gene expression changes after egg activation. This conservation suggests that this strategy may be employed for the onset of mammalian development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>We use the term ‘biological replicate’ to mean a repeat of all of the steps of an experiment, for example isolation of the flies, recovery of oocytes, preparation and hybridization of an immunoblot.

These were washed once more with 47.5/47.5/5% methanol/water/acetic acid for 2 hr, dehydrated with acetonitrile and dried in a speed-vac. Reduction and alkylation of disulfide bonds was then carried out by the addition of 30 µL 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min. The resulting free cysteine residues were subjected to an alkylation reaction by removal of the DTT solution and the addition of 100 mM iodoacetamide in 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate for 30 min to form carbamidomethyl cysteine. These were then sequentially washed with aliquots of acetonitrile, 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile and dried in a speed-vac.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Jon Pines (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. We realise that the work required will take longer than the usual 2 months that we prefer for revising a manuscript but if you think it will take more than 6 months please let us know. Please also inform us if you prefer not to carry out the work and submit to another journal.</p><p>In this study the authors have investigated the control of maternal mRNA translation at the oocyte to egg transition in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They show that all the components of the PNG-PLU kinase are present but inactive while Cyclin B kinase levels are high. They show that this is because cyclin B-Cdk1 phosphorylates the GNU protein and that this prevents PNG binding to PLU. Once Cyclin B-Cdk1 activity declines, GNU is dephosphorylated and PNG kinase activated, which leads to a change in mRNA translation and a reduction in GNU levels. A non-phosphorylatable form of GNU is only partially active in vitro and in vivo, but sufficient to show that preventing its regulation by cyclin B-Cdk1 leads to premature PNG activation and disruption of meiosis. Overall the results described in this paper are clear and convincing and make an important contribution to our knowledge of the oocyte to egg transition that is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The experiments are well designed and appropriate controls included.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>What is missing is a proper analysis of the phosphorylation of GNU. The authors rely on mobility shifts and mutate all the potential Cdk1 consensus sites.

These data are now included in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>. We found that GNU is phosphorylated in vivo on the nine predicted Cdk1 sites. Four other phosphorylated residues were detected less frequently. Given that in vivo GNU is phosphorylated on all nine Cdk1 sites, analysis of the properties of the GNU-9A phospho-resistant form of the protein in vitro and expression of this form of the protein in mature oocytes was the appropriate experimental approach.</p><p><italic>In addition to these data the authors should also address the following issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Title: the authors have not investigated the control of translation and should remove this from the title.</italic></p><p>We changed the title as suggested.</p><p><italic>2) Two independent transformant lines are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>.

Consequently, expression levels can differ between transgenic lines. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, the two wild-type lines and the 2-7 line have comparable levels of GNU protein, but levels are slightly lower in the 2-8 line.

Both the 2-7 and 2-8 transgene lines have significantly higher levels of Cyclin B protein by a T test (P=0.03 for line 2-7 and P=0.01 for line 2-8).
