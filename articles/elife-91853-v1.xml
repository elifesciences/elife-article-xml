second most common cause of neonatal meningitis in full-term infants (herein NMEC) and the most common cause of meningitis in preterm neonates. Here, we investigated the genomic relatedness of a collection of 58 NMEC isolates spanning 1974–2020 and isolated from seven different geographic regions. We show NMEC are comprised of diverse sequence types (STs), with ST95 (34.5%) and ST1193 (15.5%) the most common. No single virulence gene profile was conserved in all isolates; however, genes encoding fimbrial adhesins, iron acquisition systems, the K1 capsule, and O antigen types O18, O75, and O2 were most prevalent. Antibiotic resistance genes occurred infrequently in our collection. We also monitored the infection dynamics in three patients that suffered recrudescent invasive infection caused by the original infecting isolate despite appropriate antibiotic treatment based on antibiogram profile and resistance genotype. These patients exhibited severe gut dysbiosis. In one patient, the causative NMEC isolate was also detected in the fecal flora at the time of the second infection episode and after treatment. Thus, although antibiotics are the standard of care for NMEC treatment, our data suggest that failure to eliminate the causative NMEC that resides intestinally can lead to the existence of a refractory reservoir that may seed recrudescent infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>recurrent infection</kwd><kwd>gut dysbiosis</kwd><kwd>uropathogenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic></kwd><kwd>neonatal meningitis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP1181958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nhu</surname><given-names>Nguyen Thi Khanh</given-names></name><name><surname>Phan</surname><given-names>Minh-Duy</given-names></name><name><surname>Schembri</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1197743</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Irwin</surname><given-names>Adam D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Queensland Children's Hospital Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>50270</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Patrick NA</given-names></name><name><surname>Beatson</surname><given-names>Scott A</given-names></name><name><surname>Schlebusch</surname><given-names>Sanmarie</given-names></name><name><surname>Irwin</surname><given-names>Adam D</given-names></name><name><surname>Schembri</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Australian Infectious Diseases Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nhu</surname><given-names>Nguyen Thi Khanh</given-names></name><name><surname>Irwin</surname><given-names>Adam D</given-names></name><name><surname>Schembri</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/220211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turner</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>APP2001431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nhu</surname><given-names>Nguyen Thi Khanh</given-names></name><name><surname>Phan</surname><given-names>Minh-Duy</given-names></name><name><surname>Schembri</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The incidence of disease is highest in low-income countries and occurs at a rate of 0.1–6.1/1000 live births (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harvey et al., 1999</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is the second most common cause of NM in full-term infants (herein NMEC), after group B <italic>Streptococcus</italic> (GBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ouchenir et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaschignard et al., 2011</xref>), and the most common cause of meningitis in preterm neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaschignard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basmaci et al., 2015</xref>). Together, these two pathogens cause ~60% of all cases, with on average one case of NMEC for every two cases of GBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">May et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Holt et al., 2001</xref>). In several countries, NM incidence caused by GBS has declined due to maternal intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis; however, NM incidence caused by <italic>E. coli</italic> remains the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">May et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">van der Flier, 2021</xref>). Moreover, NMEC is a significant cause of relapsed infections in neonates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Gilbert, 1990</xref>).</p><p>NMEC are categorised genetically based on multi-locus sequence type (ST) or by serotyping based on cell-surface O antigen (O), capsule (K), and flagella (H) antigens. Analysis of NMEC diversity in France revealed ~25% of isolates belong to the ST95 clonal complex (STc95) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geslain et al., 2019</xref>), however, a global picture of NMEC epidemiology is lacking. NMEC possess a limited diversity of serotypes, dominated by O18:K1:H7, O1:K1, O7:K1, O16:K1, O83:K1, and O45:K1:H7, which together account for &gt;70% of NMEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarff et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Plainvert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bidet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2002</xref>). Notably, ~80% of NMEC express the K1 capsule, a polysaccharide comprising linear homopolymers of α2–8-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetyl neuraminic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sarff et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Robbins et al., 1974</xref>). Apart from the K1 capsule, specific NMEC virulence factors are less-well defined, though studies have demonstrated a role for S fimbriae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Prasadarao et al., 1993</xref>), the outer membrane protein OmpA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Prasadarao et al., 1996</xref>), the endothelial invasin IbeA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huang et al., 2001</xref>), and the cytotoxin necrotising factor CNF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang and Kim, 2013</xref>) in translocation of NMEC across the blood–brain barrier and pathogenesis. A large plasmid encoding colicin V (ColV), colicin Ia bacteriocins, and several virulence genes including iron-chelating siderophore systems has also been strongly associated with NMEC virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peigne et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Despite being the second major NM aetiology, genomic studies on NMEC are lacking, with most reporting single NMEC complete genomes. Here, we present the genomic analyses of a collection of 58 NMEC isolates obtained from seven different geographic regions over 46 years to understand virulence gene content, antibiotic resistance, and genomic diversity. In addition, we provide a complete genome for 18 NMEC isolates representing different STs, serotypes, and virulence gene profiles, thus more than tripling the number of available NMEC genomes that can be used as references in future studies. Three infants in our study suffered recrudescent invasive NMEC infection, and we show this was caused by the same isolate. We further revealed that patients that suffered recrudescent invasive infection had severe gut dysbiosis, and detected the infecting isolate in the intestinal microflora, suggesting NMEC colonisation of the gut provides a reservoir that can seed repeat infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of an NMEC collection from geographically diverse locations</title><p>A collection of 52 NMEC isolates cultured from the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of neonates with meningitis was established with the addition of six completely sequenced NMEC genomes available on the NCBI database.

These isolates were predominantly from two major STs, ST95, and ST1193. ST95 represents a major clonal lineage responsible for urinary tract and bloodstream infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manges et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kallonen et al., 2017</xref>), and were identified throughout the period of investigation. This lineage was also previously shown to cause ~25% of NM cases in France in the period 2004–2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Geslain et al., 2019</xref>), demonstrating its enhanced capacity to cause disseminated infection in newborns. ST1193, on the other hand, was first identified in 2012 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Platell et al., 2012</xref>), and is the second most common fluoroquinolone-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> lineage after ST131 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tchesnokova et al., 2019</xref>). ST1193 causing NM was first reported in the USA in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nielsen et al., 2018</xref>). Here, ST1193 accounted for 15.5% of NMEC isolates, all of which were obtained from 2013, and was the dominant lineage since this time. This is consistent with a report in China that showed ST1193 was the most common NMEC (21.4%), followed by ST95 (17.9%), between 2009 and 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2021</xref>). Concerningly, the ST1193 isolates examined here carry genes encoding several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, generating a resistance profile that may lead to the clinical failure of empiric regimens such as ampicillin and gentamicin, a therapeutic combination used in many settings to treat NM and early-onset sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleiss et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuchs et al., 2018</xref>).

In these reports, infants received appropriate antibiotic treatment based on antibiogram profiling and no clear clinical risk factors to explain recrudescence were identified, highlighting our limited understanding of NM aetiology. Here, we tracked NMEC recurrence using whole-genome sequencing in three patients that suffered NM and recrudescent invasive infection, and demonstrated that the isolate causing recrudescence was the same as the original causative isolate and susceptible to the initial antibiotic therapy. In one patient (patient 2), we identified the causative isolate in the stool at days 77, 149, and 174 after initial detection in the bloodstream, providing direct evidence of persistence in the gut, and implicating this site as a reservoir to seed repeat infection. This isolate belonged to ST537 (serotype O75:H5) and is from the same clonal complex as ST1193 (i.e. STc14).</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, our NMEC collection was restricted to seven geographic regions, a reflection of the difficulty in acquiring isolates causing this disease. Second, we did not have access to a complete set of stool samples spanning pre- and post-treatment in the patients that suffered NM and recrudescent invasive infection. This impacted our capacity to monitor <italic>E. coli</italic> persistence and evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment on changes in the microbiome over time. Third, we did not have access to urine or stool samples from the mother of the infants that suffered recrudescence, and thus cannot rule out mother-to-child transmission as a mechanism of reinfection. Finally, we did not have clinical data on the weeks of gestation for all patients, and thus could not compare virulence factors from NMEC isolated from preterm versus term infants. Regardless, our study describes the genomic diversity of NMEC, highlighting ST95 and ST1193 as the most important clonal lineages associated with this devastating disease. Although antibiotics are the standard of care for NMEC treatment, we show that even when appropriate antibiotics are used, in some cases they do not eliminate the causative NMEC that resides intestinally. Together with associated antibiotic-driven dysbiosis, this reveals a need to consider diagnostic and therapeutic interventions to mitigate the risk of recrudescent infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bacterial isolates</title><p>A collection of 52 NMEC isolates obtained from 1974 to 2020 was achieved from Sweden, Finland, Cambodia, and Australia.

As the sample DNA was already fragmented with a tight peak (mode size 9.4 kb), no shearing was performed; the sample was concentrated using Ampure PB beads (PacBio, PCB-100-265-900) and used directly as input into library preparation.

The DNA was treated to remove single-stranded overhangs, followed by a DNA damage repair reaction and an end-repair/A-tailing reaction. Overhang barcoded adapters were ligated to the A-tailed library fragments, followed by a nuclease treatment to remove damaged library fragments, and then purification with AMPure PB beads. The library was size-selected to remove fragments &lt;3 kb using AMPure PB beads. The final purified, size-selected library was quantified on the Qubit fluorometer using the Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Invitrogen, Q32854) to assess concentration, and run on the Agilent Femto Pulse using the 55 kb BAC Analysis Kit (Agilent, FP-1003-0275) to assess fragment size distribution.</p><p>Sequencing was performed using the PacBio Sequel II (software/chemistry v10.1).

The authors provide genomic information on virulence and antibiotic resistance genomic markers, as well as serotype and capsule information.

This is acknowledged by the group in the discussion, however, it would make the study much more compelling if there was global representation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In the Discussion we state this is likely a reflection of the difficulty in acquiring isolates causing neonatal meningitis, in particular from countries with limited microbiology and pathology resources.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Schembri et al performed a molecular analysis by WGS of 52 <italic>E. coli</italic> strains identified as &quot;causing neonatal meningitis&quot; from several countries and isolated from 1974 to 2020. Sequence types, virulence genes content as well as antibiotic-resistant genes are depicted. In the second part, they also described three cases of relapse and analysed their respective strains as well as the microbiome of three neonates during their relapse. For one patient the same <italic>E. coli</italic> strain was found in blood and stool (this patient had no meningitis). For two patients microbiome analysis revealed a severe dysbiosis.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Although the authors announce in their title that they study <italic>E. coli</italic> that cause neonatal meningitis and in methods stipulate that they had a collection of 52 NMEC, we found in Supplementary Table 1, 29 strains (therefore most of the strains) isolated from blood and not CSF. This is a major limitation since only strains isolated from CSF can be designated with certainty as NMEC even if a pleiocytose is observed in the CSF. A very troubling data is the description of patient two with a relapse infection. As stated in the text line 225, CSF microscopy was normal and culture was negative for this patient! Therefore it is clear that patient without meningitis has been included in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the clinical data for our 52 NMEC isolates, noting that for some of the older Finish isolates we relied on previous publications. This data is shown in Table S1. To address the Reviewer’s comment, we have added the following text to the methods section (new text underlined).</p><p>‘The collection comprised 42 isolates from confirmed meningitis cases (29 cultured from CSF and 13 cultured from blood) and 10 isolates from clinically diagnosed meningitis cases (all cultured from blood).’</p><p>Patient 2 was initially diagnosed with meningitis based on a positive blood culture in the presence of CSF pleocytosis (&gt;300 WBCs, &gt;95% polymorphs). We understand there may be some confusion with reference to a relapsed infection, which we now more accurately describe as recrudescent invasive infection in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another major limitation (not stated in the discussion) is the absence of clinical information on neonates especially the weeks of gestation. It is well known that the risk of infection is dramatically increased in preterm neonates due to their immature immunity. Therefore <italic>E. coli</italic> causing infection in preterm neonates are not comparable to those causing infection in term neonates notably in their virulence gene content. Indeed, it is mentioned that at least eight strains did not possess a capsule, we can speculate that neonates were preterm, but this information is lacking. The ages of neonates are also lacking. The possible source of infection is not mentioned, notably urinary tract infection. This may have also an impact on the content of VF.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. In the Discussion we now note the following (new text underlined):</p><p>‘… we did not have clinical data on the weeks of gestation for all patients, and thus could not compare virulence factors from NMEC isolated from preterm versus term infants.’</p><p>Submission to Medrxiv, a requirement for review of our manuscript at eLife, necessitated the removal of some patient identifying information, including precise age and detailed medical history.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Sequence analysis reveals the predominance of ST95 and ST1193 in this collection. The high incidence of ST95 is not surprising and well previously described, therefore, the concluding sentence line 132 indicating that ST95 <italic>E. coli</italic> should exhibit specific virulence features associated with their capacity to cause NM does not add anything. On the contrary, the high incidence of ST1193 is of interest and should have been discussed more in detail. Which specific virulence factors do they harbor? Any hypothesis explaining their emergence in neonates?</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the virulence factors of ST95 and ST1193 and summarized this information in Figure 4. We also discussed how the K1 polysialic acid capsule in ST95 and ST1193 could contribute to the emergence of these STs in NM. Specifically, we stated the following: ‘We speculate this is due to the prevailing K1 polysialic acid capsule serotype found in ST95 and the newly emerged ST1193 clone [22, 37] in combination with other virulence factors [15, 28, 29] (Figure 4) and the immature immune system of preterm infants.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the paragraph depicted the VF it is only stated that ST95 contained significantly more VF than the ST1193 strains. And so what? By the way &quot;significantly&quot; is not documented: n=?, p=?</p></disp-quote><p>We compared the prevalence of known virulence factors between ST95 and ST1193, and showed that ST95 strains in our collection contained significantly more virulence factors than the ST1193 strains. The P-value and the statistical test used were included in Supplementary Figure 3. To address the reviewers concern, we have now also added this to the main manuscript text as follows (new text underlined):</p><p>‘Direct comparison of virulence factors between ST95 and ST1193, the two most dominant NMEC STs, revealed that the ST95 isolates (n = 20) contained significantly more virulence factors than the ST1193 isolates (n=9), p-value &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney two-tailed unpaired test (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 3).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The complete sequence of 18 strains is not clear. Results of Supplementary Table 2 are presented in the text and are not discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>NMEC isolates that were completely sequenced in this study are indicated in bold and marked with an asterisk in Figure 1. This information is indicated in the figure legend and was provided in the original submission. All information regarding genomic island composition and location, virulence genes and plasmid and prophage diversity is included in Supplementary Table 2. This information is highly descriptive and thus we elected not to include it as text in the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>46 years is a very long time for such a small number of strains, making it difficult to put forward epidemiological or evolutionary theories. In the analysis of antibiotic resistance, there are no ESBLs. However, Ding's article (reference 34) and other authors showed that ESBLs are emerging in <italic>E. coli</italic> neonatal infection. These strains are a major threat that should be studied, unfortunately, the authors haven't had the opportunity to characterize such strains in their manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree 46 years is a long time-span. The study by Ding et al examined 56 isolates comprised of 25 different STs isolated in China from 2009-2015, with ST1193 (n=12) and ST95 (n=10) the most common. Our study examined 58 isolates comprised of 22 different STs isolated in seven different geographic regions from 1974-2020, with ST1193 (n=9) and ST95 (n=20) the most common. Thus, despite differences in the geographic regions from which isolates in the two studies were sourced, there are similarities in the most common STs identified. The fact that we observed less antibiotic resistance, including a lack of ESBL genes, in ST1193 is likely due to the different regions from which the isolates were sourced. We acknowledged and discussed the potential of ST1193 harbouring multidrug resistance including ESBLs in our manuscript as follows:</p><p>‘Concerningly, the ST1193 strains examined here carry genes encoding several aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, generating a resistance profile that may lead to the clinical failure of empiric regimens such as ampicillin and gentamicin, a therapeutic combination used in many settings to treat NM and early-onset sepsis [35, 36]. This, in combination with reports of co-resistance to third-generation cephalosporins for some ST1193 strains [22, 34], would limit the choice of antibiotic treatment.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second part of the manuscript:</p><p>The three patients who relapsed had a late neonatal infection (&gt; 3 days) with respective ages of 6 days, 7 weeks, and 3 weeks. We do not know whether they are former preterm newborns (no term specified) or whether they have received antibiotics in the meantime.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, patient ages were not disclosed to comply with submission to Medrxiv, a requirement for review of our manuscript at eLife.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Patient 1: Although this patient had a pleiocytose in CSF, the culture was negative which is surprising and no explanation is provided. Therefore, the diagnosis of meningitis is not certain. Pleiocytose without meningitis has been previously described in neonates with severe sepsis. Line 215: no immunological abnormalities were identified (no details are given).</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer. The diagnosis of meningitis is made unequivocally by the presence of a clearly abnormal CSF microscopy (2430 WBCs) and an invasive <italic>E. coli</italic> from blood culture. This does not seem controversial to the authors. We had believed it unnecessary to include this corroborative evidence, but have added the following to support our assertion:</p><p>‘The child was diagnosed with meningitis based on a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis (&gt;2000 white blood cells; WBCs, low glucose, elevated protein), positive CSF <italic>E. coli</italic> PCR and a positive blood culture for <italic>E. coli</italic> (MS21522).’</p><p>On the contrary, the authors are surprised by the statement that CSF pleocytosis occurs in neonatal sepsis ‘without meningitis’ and do not know of any definitions of neonatal meningitis that are not tied to the presence of a CSF pleocytosis. Furthermore, the later isolation of <italic>E. coli</italic> from the CSF during the relapsed infection re-enforces the initial diagnosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Patient 2: This patient had a recurrence of bacteremia without meningitis (line 225: CSF microscopy was normal and culture negative!). This case should be deleted.</p></disp-quote><p>In a similar vein to the previous comment, we respectfully assert that this patient has clear evidence of meningitis (330 WBCs in the CSF, taken 24h after initiation of antibiotic treatment). In this case, molecular testing was not performed as, under the principle of diagnostic stewardship, it was not considered necessary by the clinical microbiologists and treating clinicians following the culture of <italic>E. coli</italic> in the bloodstream. We agree that this is not a case of recurrent meningitis, but our intention was to highlight the recrudescence of an invasive infection (urinary sepsis requiring admission to hospital and intravenous antibiotics) which we hypothesise has arisen from the intestinal reservoir. We did not state that all patients suffered from relapsed meningitis.</p><p>Despite this, to address this reviewers concern, we have changed all reference to ‘relapsed infection’ to now read ‘recrudescent invasive infection’ in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Patient 3: This patient had two relapses which is exceptional and may suggest the existence of a congenital malformation or a neurological complication such as abscess or empyema therefore, &quot;imaging studies&quot; should be detailed.</p></disp-quote><p>This patient underwent extensive imaging investigation to rule out a hidden source. This included repeated MRI imaging of head and spine, CT imaging of head and chest, USS imaging of abdomen and pelvis and nuclear medicine imaging to detect a subtle meningeal defect and CSF leak. All tests were normal, and no abscess or empyema found.</p><p>We have modified the text to include this information:</p><p>Text in original submission: ‘Imaging studies and immunological work-up were normal.’</p><p>New text in revised manuscript (underlined): ‘Extensive imaging studies including repeated MRI imaging of the head and spine, CT imaging of the head and chest, ultrasound imaging of abdomen and pelvis, and nuclear medicine imaging did not show a congenital malformation or abscess. Immunological work-up did not show a known primary immunodeficiency. At two years of age, speech delay is reported but no other developmental abnormality.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest a link between intestinal dysbiosis and relapse in three patients. However, the fecal microbiomes of patients without relapse were not analysed, so no comparison is possible.Moreover, dysbiosis after several weeks of antibiotic treatment in a patient hospitalized for a long time is not unexpected. Therefore, it's impossible to make any assumption or draw any conclusion. This part of the manuscript is purely descriptive. Finally, the authors should be more prudent when they state in line 289 &quot;we also provide direct evidence to implicate the gut as a reservoir [...] antibiotic treatment&quot;. Indeed the gut colonization of the mothers with the same strain may be also a reservoir (as stated in the discussion line 336). Finally, the authors do not discuss the potential role of ceftriaxone vs cefotaxime in the dysbiosis observed. Ceftriaxone may have a major impact on the microbiota due to its digestive elimination.</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed the limitations of our study in the Discussion, including that we did not have access to urine or stool samples from the mother of the infants that suffered recrudescence, and thus cannot rule out mother-to-child transmission as a mechanism of reinfection. We have now added that we did not have clinical data on the weeks of gestation for all patients, and thus could not compare virulence factors from NMEC isolated from preterm versus term infants. The limitations of our study are summarised as follows in the Discussion (new text underlined):</p><p>‘This study had several limitations. First, our NMEC strain collection was restricted to seven geographic regions, a reflection of the difficulty in acquiring strains causing this disease. Second, we did not have access to a complete set of stool samples spanning pre- and post-treatment in the patients that suffered NM and recrudescent invasive infection. This impacted our capacity to monitor <italic>E. coli</italic> persistence and evaluate the effect of antibiotic treatment on changes in the microbiome over time. Third, we did not have access to urine or stool samples from the mother of the infants that suffered recrudescence, and thus cannot rule out mother-to-child transmission as a mechanism of reinfection. Finally, we did not have clinical data on the weeks of gestation for all patients, and thus could not compare virulence factors from NMEC isolated from preterm versus term infants.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>It would be useful to mention the sample size (number of genomes analysed, n=58) in the abstract to give readers a sense of the scale of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the number of genomes in the abstract as suggested (new text underlined).</p><p>‘Here we investigated the genomic relatedness of a collection of 58 NMEC strains spanning 1974-2020 and isolated from seven different geographic regions.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The term 'strain' is used throughout, it would be clearer to use 'isolates' to describe the biological material and 'genomes' when the unit being referred to is genome sequences.
