Multiple genes and environmental factors have been implicated in depression, and one of the strongest risk factors for developing the disorder is exposure to stress.</p><p>Stress and depression affect many of the same brain regions, most notably the prefrontal cortex—an area that is involved in decision making, problem solving and regulating emotions. Shrestha et al. therefore reasoned that a good way of obtaining insights into the relationship between stress and depression would be to study prefrontal cortex cells that express genes that have been linked to depression.</p><p>One such gene is <italic>Wfs1</italic>. Mutations in this gene cause a rare disorder called Wolfram syndrome, in which affected individuals experience a wide range of symptoms that often include severe depression. Shrestha et al. identified a specific population of cells in the prefrontal cortex that express <italic>Wfs1</italic>. When subjected to a stressful event, such as being restrained, mice that had been genetically modified to lack this gene in their prefrontal cortex were more likely to exhibit depression-like behaviors than non-modified mice. The genetically modified mice also released more stress hormones when restrained and produced different amounts of a number of proteins that regulate the growth and signaling of neurons.</p><p>Shrestha et al. propose that these proteins act on neural circuits that control how the mice respond to stress. Furthermore, changes in the levels or the distribution of these proteins may increase the likelihood that a stressful event will trigger behaviors associated with depression. Further experiments are required to investigate the possibility that using drugs to manipulate cells that express <italic>Wfs1</italic> could protect against the harmful effects of stress, or even treat existing episodes of depression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08752.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08752.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>medial prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>wolfram syndrome</kwd><kwd>layer 2/3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NIMH 5P50 MH090063 P2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heintz</surname><given-names>Nathaniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The well-established link between stress and depression could be due to the activity of a population of cells in prefrontal cortex that express a gene mutated in the rare disorder Wolfram syndrome.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and potentially life-threatening disorder that affects approximately 16% of the global population at some point in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flint and Kendler, 2014</xref>). Core symptoms of MDD include lack of motivation, reduced ability to derive pleasure from natural rewards (anhedonia) and abnormalities of sleep and appetite. MDD is thought to occur as a result of combined genetic, environmental, and biological factors. Although the nature of these factors and their relative contributions to the disorder remain largely unknown, human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mayberg, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hasler and Northoff, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morishita et al., 2014</xref>) and circuit-based molecular genetic analysis in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nestler and Hyman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52a">Tye and Deisseroth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Svenningson et al., 2006</xref>) have shown that MDD is characterized by alterations in the activity of a distributed circuit controlling emotive behaviors and that treatments that act within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) can have a strong therapeutic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leuchter et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>). While these studies have demonstrated the complexity of the neural circuits controlling depressive behaviors and the actions of antidepressants, the impact of environmental factors on these circuits and their role in behavior has not been addressed adequately.</p><p>It is widely recognized that environmental stress, including early childhood trauma and recent stressful experiences, can contribute to MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Russo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McEwen and Morrison, 2013</xref>). Depressive behaviors can be elicited in experimental animals using a variety of stressors, which typically induce alterations in neuronal morphology and synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shansky and Morrison, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Moench and Wellman, 2014</xref>) in the mPFC that are consonant with the thinning of the mPFC that occurs in MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kroes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grieve et al., 2013</xref>). Inactivation of the ventral mPFC results in loss of cortical control of stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Diorio et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Figueiredo et al., 2003</xref>) and alters the activation of brainstem neurons that regulate behavioral responses to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Maier, 2015</xref>). Optogenetic activation of mPFC neurons projecting to the dorsal raphe nucleus can reversibly alter mobility in the forced swim test (FST), implicating this specific class of pyramidal cells in the behavioral responses to stressful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warden et al., 2012</xref>). While these studies clearly establish the mPFC as a structure that is important in the generation and execution of depressive behaviors and stress responses, and in the therapeutic actions of deep brain stimulation and antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they also highlight the anatomical and functional complexities of mPFC circuitry.</p><p>To investigate cortical cell types that may play additional roles in MDD, it would be informative to identify cell types in the prefrontal cortex that express specifically genes known to cause major depression and to assess their potential roles in the regulation of depressive behaviors. Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that common depression is likely to result from alterations in a very large number of genes of small effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flint and Kendler, 2014</xref>), studies of Wolfram syndrome have identified <italic>Wfs1</italic> as a clear example of a gene that can cause MDD in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swift et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crawford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swift and Swift, 2005</xref>). Here, we have employed bacTRAP translational profiling and virus mediated trans-synaptic tracing studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wall et al., 2010</xref>) to demonstrate that the Wolfram syndrome gene (<italic>Wfs1</italic>) is expressed in a specific population of neurotrophin 3 (<italic>Ntf3</italic>) and proenkephalin (<italic>Penk1</italic>) expressing pyramidal cells in superficial layer 2/3 of the mPFC. These cells receive projections from other cortical structures, from the posterior thalamic nuclear group, and from the lateral amygdala. Deletion of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in forebrain neurons of conditional knockout mice (Wfs1/CKO) alters stress-induced depression-related behaviors, induces the expression of the immediate early gene <italic>Fos</italic> in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and results in enhanced accumulation of serum corticosterone. Increased stress-induced depressive behavior is also evident in animals from which <italic>Wfs1</italic> was deleted specifically in the mPFC. <italic>Wfs1</italic> is present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of superficial cortical pyramidal cells, and its loss in these neurons results in altered growth factor and neurotrophin processing in response to inescapable restraint stress. Taken together, our data demonstrate that superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC can play a critical role in stress-induced depressive behaviors and indicate that dysfunction of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in forebrain neurons leads to activation of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and elevated blood corticosterone levels. They highlight a role for superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the mPFC in the modulation of depressive behaviors and suggest that the major depression evident in patients with Wolfram syndrome and carriers may occur in part due to hyperactivation of the HPA axis in response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Wolfram syndrome is a complex, multisystem disorder that results in early onset diabetes, optic atrophy, and increased risk for MDD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rigoli et al., 2011</xref>).

The Ntf3 bacTRAP founder line PS1046 was chosen for profiling studies because its expression in the mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–E</xref>) and dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) reproduced expression of the endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). EGFP/L10a expression was primarily restricted to superficial layer 2/3 in the mPFC, including the prelimbic, infralimbic and medial orbitofrontal regions. Expression of EGFP/L10a was observed only in the NeuN + neurons (data not shown). Furthermore, at high magnification, it was evident that the soma of EGFP/L10a-expressing cells was pyramidal, with a clear apical dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). EGFP/L10a expression was localized to the soma, proximal dendrites, and nucleolus, as described for other bacTRAP mouse lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doyle et al., 2008</xref>).

As a first step toward investigation of this possibility, we determined the subcellular distribution of Wolframin (WFS1), the protein encoded by the <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene, in the PFC. Thus, a specific antiserum to WFS1 was prepared and used to characterize its distribution in the PFC. As expected, WFS1 is expressed specifically in several structures in the adult mouse brain that are relevant to stress and depression, including superficial layers of the cerebral cortex, the central extended area of the amygdala (data not shown), and pyramidal cells in the CA1 field of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>).

Accordingly, Wfs1/CKO mice were put through a battery of behavioral tests to measure spontaneous activity, cognitive function, and depressive behaviors under normal baseline conditions, and in animals that had first been exposed to acute restraint stress (ARS). Acute psychological stressors such as swim stress and ARS strongly alter rodent behavior in the FST and in the sucrose preference test (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7a">Duncan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4a">Cullinan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20a">Jankord and Herman, 2008</xref>).

Since the activation of the PVN is known to stimulate the pituitary gland to produce adrenocorticotropic hormone, which in turn induces corticosterone release from adrenal glands, we examined endocrine responses to stress in Wfs1/CKO mice using radioimmunoassay (RIA). We measured serum levels of corticosterone in Wfs1/CKO and control mice under basal conditions and after 30 min of ARS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These experiments revealed that baseline corticosterone levels were not different in wt and Wfs1/CKO mice (WT: 46.17 ± 5.00; CKO: 55.26 ± 10.18) and that in both wt and Wfs1/CKO serum corticosterone levels increased in response to stress. However, the magnitude of the increase of serum corticosterone observed in Wfs1/CKO in response to stress (CKO + ARS: 505.12 ± 7.63) was significantly greater than that seen in their wt littermates (WT + ARS: 401.50 ± 6.00) (Two-way ANOVA—Bonferroni post hoc test: WT + ARS vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.001***, N = 5 per group).

Injection ofAAV2.EF1a.DIO.eYFP.WPRE.hGH into the mPFC of Wfs1::CreER<sup>T2</sup> mice fed a tamoxifen diet results in recombination of the viral genome only in Wfs1 pyramidal cells, thus allowing identification of target sites receiving projections from these neurons.

To determine whether their processing and/or abundance changed as a consequence of loss of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in the PFC, Western blots for each of these proteins were processed using brain extracts collected from wt and Wfs1/CKO mice under baseline conditions and following ARS. As a comparison, we assessed the abundance of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is present in the PFC but not specifically enriched in the <italic>Ntf3/Wfs1</italic>-expressing cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, no differences were evident in any of these proteins from wt or Wfs1/CKO animals under baseline conditions. However, in response to ARS, the abundance of WNT7A and NTF3 were both altered. WNT7A is a secreted signaling factor that is involved in axonal remodeling and synaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ciani et al., 2011</xref>). In Wfs1/CKO animals, it is specifically decreased in the PFC (Two-way ANOVA—Bonferroni post hoc test: CKO Basal vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.001**, N = 3 per group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Mature NTF3 (∼14 kDa) is processed from a ∼32-kDa precursor that is referred to as proNTF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yano et al., 2009</xref>). Although we could not reliably detect mature NTF3 on Western blots from PFC, increased levels of proNTF3 were consistently observed in Wfs1 knockout animals in response to ARS (Two-way ANOVA—Bonferroni post hoc test: CKO Basal vs CKO + ARS, p &lt; 0.0001***, N = 3 per group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Although the cell types and circuit elements that underlie different aspects of depressive behaviors and the actions of antidepressant therapies are beginning to be identified, the impact of environmental stress on depression circuitry has not been investigated thoroughly. Here, we report that <italic>Wfs1</italic>, a gene that can cause depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Flint and Kendler, 2014</xref>), is co-expressed with <italic>Ntf3</italic>, <italic>Penk</italic>, and <italic>Wnt7a</italic> in supragranular 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. We demonstrate that conditional deletion of Wfs1 from the forebrain in general, or from the mPFC specifically, results in the induction of depressive behaviors in response to acute stress. This is accompanied by hyperactivation of the HPA axis and elevation of serum corticosterone. We show that Wolframin (the protein encoded by <italic>Wfs1</italic>) is localized to the ER in these neurons and that its loss results in altered growth and trophic factor processing/secretion. Finally, we employ viral tracing methodology to determine that <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing cells in the mPFC project within the cortex and to the caudate putamen and that they receive afferent information from other cortical areas, from the amygdala and from the posterior nuclear thalamic group. We conclude that layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC are a crucial node in the circuitry regulating depressive behaviors in response to stress and that identification of mechanisms that regulate the activity of these neurons, and their downstream targets can provide important insights into the relationship between stress and depression.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Wfs1</italic> and the brain</title><p>Patients with Wolfram syndrome suffer from a broad spectrum of psychiatric and neurological problems, including suicidal tendencies. Heterozygous carriers of mutant <italic>Wfs1</italic> alleles are also affected, exhibiting clinical features of pure MDD. It has been estimated that as many as 7% of the patients hospitalized for MDD may be predisposed due to <italic>Wfs1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Swift et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Crawford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Swift and Swift, 2005</xref>). Studies of <italic>Wfs1</italic> knockout mice have shown that they replicate central and peripheral features of Wolfram syndrome and that they display impaired behavioral adaptation to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sequeira et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luuk et al., 2009</xref>). Interpretation of these data with regard to brain circuitry is confounded by the complexity of the phenotypes present in <italic>Wfs1</italic> knockout animals and by the expression of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in specific subsets of neurons in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens (NAc), the thalamus, the amygdala, and the brainstem. Our demonstration that <italic>Wfs1</italic> is required for normal ER function in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the mPFC and that these cells moderate depressive behaviors in response to stress, raises two issues regarding <italic>Wfs1</italic>. First, given previous studies documenting an essential function for Wfs1 in pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fonseca et al., 2005</xref>) and the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bonnet Wersinger et al., 2014</xref>), and detailed biochemical studies demonstrating that WFS1 negatively regulates ER stress signaling through ATF6α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonseca et al., 2010</xref>), it seems probable that cell types expressing <italic>Wfs1</italic> in the brain also require its function to regulate ER stress. In the case of pancreatic β cells, it is thought that WFS1 tightly controls ER stress to regulate insulin production in response to frequent fluctuations of blood glucose. Given these examples, the expression of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in selected cell types may reflect a requirement for WFS1 in regulating ER function, perhaps even secretory function, in response to extracellular signals that modulate the activity of these cell types. In this context, the observations that WNT7A and proNTF3 protein levels are altered in the cortex of Wfs1/CKO animals in response to stress may be important. Clear positive roles for WNT7A in synapse formation and maintenance have been documented in several systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hall et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gogolla et al., 2009</xref>). In contrast to NTF3, which has an important trophic role in synapse formation, proNTF3 can induce apoptosis in cultured cells, suggesting a negative role for proNTF3 in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yano et al., 2009</xref>). While it is notable that both decreased WNT7A and increased proNTF3 could result in loss of synaptic trophic support in response to stress, this is only one of many possible pathways that could be negatively impacted in layer 2/3 neurons as a consequence of Wfs1 deletion.</p><p>If neurons expressing <italic>Wfs1</italic> in the brain require its function to respond to and moderate behavior in response to specific signals, one might ask which signals carry this information to Wfs1-positive neurons in the context of stress. We find that receptors for three circulating factors that are important for stress responsivity are expressed in <italic>Wfs1</italic>-positive cells in the cortex: <italic>Nr3c1</italic>, the glucocorticoid receptor; <italic>Esr1</italic>, the estrogen receptor; and several adrenergic receptors, <italic>Adra2c</italic>, <italic>Adr2a</italic> and <italic>Adrb1</italic>. It will be of interest, therefore, to determine in future studies whether loss of <italic>Wfs1</italic> regulates the expression or function of these receptors in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. This avenue of investigation could lead to an improved understanding of signals that are particularly relevant to the regulation of depressive behaviors by the mPFC.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>mPFC circuitry and the regulation of stress responses</title><p>We demonstrate here that conditional deletion of <italic>Wfs1</italic> from the forebrain in general, or from the mPFC specifically, results in enhanced sensitivity to ARS. The data demonstrate that the PVN is hyperactivated in response to stress in these animals, and that this leads to elevated peripheral corticosterone, is interesting with regard to the connectivity of <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing neurons in the mPFC. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing cells in the mPFC receive input from several adjacent cortical regions, from the BLA and from the thalamus. Taken together with the expression of the glucocorticoid, estrogen, and adrenergic receptors discussed above, these pathways provide ample opportunity for modulation of Wfs1 cells in the context of stress. Thus far, our data have demonstrated projections from <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing cells primarily to neighboring and contralateral cortical structures, and to the caudate putamen. Given the central role that striatal circuits play in both stress and depression, the simplest interpretation of our results is that loss of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in mPFC impairs signaling to the striatum, and that failure to stimulate GABAergic output from the NAc to the PVN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Russo et al., 2012</xref>) is responsible for hyperactivation of the HPA axis in this model of stress-induced depression. Alternatively, projections from the mPFC to other subcortical sites (e.g., the amygdala) might be altered in response to Wfs1 loss in layer 2/3 neurons. It will be of interest, for example, to determine whether the activity of S100a10 corticostriatal neurons that express p11 is altered in these animals in altered in response to local circuit disruptions as a result of loss of Wfs1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Svenningsen et al. 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2012</xref>).

One interpretation of these data that is consistent with known findings is that normal function of these cells is required to moderate stress and suppress depressive behaviors.

Given the important contributions that family studies have made to our understanding of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pohodich and Zoghbi, 2015</xref>), we believe that further investigation of layer 2/3 cells in other models of depression, and in response to a variety of stressors, can shed important new light on pathways that operate in these cells to moderate depressive behaviors in response to stressful environments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All animal protocols were carried out in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Rockefeller University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

RNA quantity was measured using Nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE) and quality determined with Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA from 50 μl of homogenate prior to immunoprecipitation was also purified as Cortex input samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Specificity index analysis of translational profiles</title><p>15 ng of total RNA was amplified with GeneChip Expression 3′ Amplification 2-cycle cDNA Synthesis kit (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and hybridized to GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 microarrays (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturer's instructions. CEL files for all RNA samples were imported into GeneSpring GX 12.6 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) and preprocessed with the GCRMA algorithm. For each experiment, three biological replicates of IP were averaged and compared with the Cortex Input using an X–Y scatter plot for all 40,101 probe sets. Thresholds were set at 40th percentile for expression and for Top 150 probe sets that had the highest fold change difference in the target cell type compared with the Whole Cortex input.</p><p>For specificity index analysis of multiple distinct cell types, microarray data were preprocessed using Bioconductor package affy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gautier et al., 2004</xref>) and normalized using Robust Multichip Average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Irizarry et al., 2003</xref>). Differentially expressed genes among the different cell types were identified by using Bioconductor package limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smyth, 2005</xref>). p-values were corrected to control the false discovery rate of multiple testing according to the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) at 0.05 threshold. Significant genes with fold change (|fold change| ≥ 1) were considered top genes. Cell-specific gene expression analysis was performed by using the specificity index statistic (pSI) R-package version 1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dougherty et al., 2010</xref>). The pSI allows identification of groups of genes enriched in certain cell type compared with other cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantitative real-time RT-PCR</title><p>cDNA was synthesized from 15 ng of total RNA from three IP replicates and Whole cortex input using WT-Ovation RNA Amplification kit (NuGEN Technologies, San Carlos, CA) and then purified with the Qiagen Quick PCR cleanup, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).

Three biological replicates were collected for each condition. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were separately homogenized in 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM EDTA, 2500 units of Benzonase nuclease (Sigma–Aldrich) and complete-EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche). The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 2000×<italic>g</italic> and supplemented with triple detergents including 10% sodium deoxycholate, 10% NP-40, and 1% SDS by volume. Samples were centrifuged a second time at maximum speed (20,000×<italic>g</italic>) for 15 min. The protein concentration of samples was determined using the QuBit 2.0 protein quantitation kit (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY).</p><p>30 μg of protein was denatured and loaded in each well of 4–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris reducing gels (Life Technologies). The gels were run at 100 V and subjected to wet transfer. PVDF membranes were first activated with methanol and equilibrated in transfer buffer containing 1× transfer buffer (Life Technologies) and 20% methanol. The bands were transferred overnight from gels to PVDF membranes using chilled transfer buffer at 4°C. Membranes were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE) for 30 min to prevent non-specific background binding. Following primary antibodies were diluted in OBT buffer containing Odyssey blocking buffer and 0.1% Tween-20: rabbit anti-NTF3 (Abcam; 1:100), rabbit anti-BDNF (Santa Cruz; 1:100), rabbit anti-PENK (Abcam; 1:100), and rabbit anti-β ACTIN (Abgent, San Diego, CA; 1:2000).</p><p>Membranes were blotted with primary antibody overnight at 4°C and washed three times with PBST buffer containing 1× PBS and 0.1% Tween-20 for 10 min each wash. IR-dye-conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR; 1:40,000) were diluted in OBT buffer and blotted on to membranes for 1 hr at room temperature followed by washes with the PBST buffer. Membranes were scanned using the Odyssey CLx Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR) and bands were quantified using the Image Studio Lite software (LI-COR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Behavioral analysis</title><p>Locomotor and exploratory behaviors were recorded for each individual mouse for 60 min using eight Digiscan open field (OF) apparatus and Fusion software (Accuscan Instruments, Inc., Columbus, OH). Mice were habituated to the testing room in their homecages for 30 min before the start of the experiment. A large arena (50 cm × 50 cm × 22.5 cm) equipped with infrared photocells at two different levels (20 and 50 mm above the floor) was used to record horizontal locomotor activity (total distance), and thigmotaxis (time spent in the center vs total distance). Two fluorescent lamps positioned on two sides of the room provided light levels of about 450 lux in the OF arenas. Each animal was placed in the center of the OF, and its activity was measured for 60 min.</p><p>SPT was performed with a two-bottle procedure, during which mice had free access to both water and sucrose solution. The fluids were provided in 50-ml falcon tubes containing stoppers fitted with ball–point sipper tubes to prevent leakage. Group-housed animals were first habituated for 3 consecutive days to 1% sucrose solution. After habituation, mice were individually housed and water deprived for 20 hr. On the test day, mice were presented with two-bottle choice conditions with either 2% sucrose (in drinking water) or drinking water alone. Consumption of water or sucrose solution was measured by weighing the bottles before and after the test. Bottles were counterbalanced across the left and the right sides of the cage. Sucrose preference was determined as the ratio of average sucrose solution intake (in ml) to the average total fluid intake (in ml).</p><p>For Porsolt's FST, mice were habituated to the testing room in their homecages for 30 min and then individually placed in a glass cylinder (16 cm diameter, 25 cm height) filled with tap water (23–25°C) to a height of 20 cm. Test sessions lasted 6 min and were videotaped. The episodes of immobility were scored every 5 s for the final 4 min of the test.</p><p>Elevated plus maze consisted of two opposite open arms without sidewalls and two enclosed arms of the same size with 14-cm high sidewalls and an endwall. The arms extended from a common central square (5 cm<sup>2</sup> × 5 cm<sup>2</sup>) perpendicular to each other, making the shape of a plus sign. The entire plus-maze apparatus was elevated to a height of 30 cm. Testing began by placing an animal on the central platform of the maze facing the closed arm. An arm entry was counted only all the four limbs were within a given arm. Standard 10-min test duration was applied and the maze was wiped with 70% ethanol in between trials. Test sessions were video recorded with a camera in the center of the maze while ensuring minimal shadows. EthoVision software was used to record the time spent on open arms and closed arms, total distance moved, and number of open arm and closed arm entries.</p><p>For appetite operant conditioning, mice were food restricted to 85–90% of their baseline body weight. Mice were introduced with dust-free precision pellets (Bio-Serv, Flemington, NJ) in their homecages to eliminate novelty associated with these pellets. Operant conditioning were carried out in 12 identical chambers (Med Associates, St Albans City, VT) equipped with a food magazine, house light, stimulus light, tone generator, and three nose-poke apertures. Mice were given 2 days of magazine training with variable interval 20 for time of pellet dispensal until a total of 50 reinforcers were delivered. For acquisition of instrumental learning, one of the three illuminated nose-poke apertures was designated as active (left, center, or right) in a pseudo-randomized and balanced manner for each genotype. A response in the active aperture (correct response) resulted in delivery of a food pellet, accompanied by a 3-s presentation of stimulus light above the magazine and tone. A response in the other two apertures (incorrect response) had no effect. The food reinforcers were all delivered on a variable ratio-2 schedule (1, 2 or 3 correct responses were required to obtain reinforcement). Mice were tested for 25 min each day over 12 consecutive days of training (Acquisition), and the number of correct and incorrect responses were recorded. On the 13th day, the far right or far left aperture that was previously unreinforced was now designated to be the active aperture. Reversal learning and thus behavioral flexibility was measured over the course of next 4 consecutive days.</p><p>Morris water maze testing took place in a white circular Persplex pool, 97 cm in diameter, surrounded by proximal and distal extramaze cues. The pool was filled with opaque water maintained at 23.5°C. Mice were shaped in the tank 1 day prior to testing using a four trial procedure in which a smaller ring (55 cm) was placed inside of the larger (97 cm) ring to decrease the total swimming area. Mice were first placed on a visible 10 × 10 cm platform for 10 s and then removed. They were then placed at three distances progressively further from the platform and allowed to swim to the platform. No data were collected during shaping. From the second day onwards, a transparent lucite platform was submerged just underneath the surface of water and placed in the same location for all trials. 6 trials were conducted per day for 4 consecutive days. Each mouse was placed in one of the four start positions, which varied for each trial, and given 120 s to find the platform in each trial. If the mouse did not find the platform within this time, then it was led to the platform where it was allowed to stay for 10 s. Each mouse was returned to its homecage during the inter-trial interval of approximately 20 min. On the seventh day, task retention was assessed by removing the platform from the pool. Throughout the trials, swim time, that is, latency to reach platform (in s), swim distance (in cm), and swim speed (in cm/s) were recorded. All data for Morris water maze were collected using EthoVision XT (Noldus, Leesburg, VA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Corticosterone RIA</title><p>Submandibular blood of five wt and five Wfs1/CKO mice were collected in EDTA-coated tubes (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), centrifuged at 12,000×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, and plasma was extracted.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This study from the Heintz lab presents a technically sophisticated analysis of <italic>Wfs1</italic> gene function in the superficial cortical layer 2/3 of the medial prefrontal cortex, and demonstrates a role for <italic>Wfs1</italic> in regulating stress responses and depression-related behaviors. Previous studies linked <italic>Wfs1</italic> with an increased risk for mood disorders including depression, but the cellular and molecular bases through which this gene may drive depression-related behaviors were not clear. To address these questions, the authors first profiled gene expression in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells of the mPFC using a novel bacTRAP mouse line and establish the selective expression of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in these neurons. Using novel conditional <italic>Wfs1</italic> CKO mice, they demonstrate that loss of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in mPFC cortical pyramidal neurons leads to depression related behaviors (immobility in the forced swim test and anhedonia) after acute restraint stress (ARS). The authors show that the CKO mice have normal baseline motor and learning behaviors and hence are selectively impaired in stress responses. The connectivity of mPFC <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing neurons was analyzed using genetically based tracing methods. They provide evidence that the CKO mice exhibit an exaggerated physiological response to ARS, consistent with hyperactivation of the HPA axis (e.g. elevated c-fos+ in hypothalamic neurons and increased serum corticosterone levels). Finally, they show that <italic>Wfs1</italic> CKO mice exhibit abnormal levels of two secreted proteins (WNT7A and NTF3) only upon exposure to ARS, suggesting stress-induced ER deficits. Overall, the study provides convincing evidence to demonstrate that <italic>Wfs1</italic> and <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing mPFC pyramidal neurons are regulators of stress responses in mice, and lends important support for a link between <italic>Wfs1</italic> and depression-related behaviors in model organisms and patients.</p><p>This study is among the first to dissect neural circuitry related to depression-related behaviors using genes that are genetically linked to the disease. The reviewers felt that this study is an important addition to the understanding of depression-related neurocircuits, and provides important insights into where <italic>Wfs1</italic> deficiency could elicit depression-related behaviors. The newly developed <italic>Wfs1</italic> conditional KO mice will also provide an invaluable tool for future studies of other <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing neurons in regulating depression-related behaviors.</p><p>With that said, there are several places where the authors overstate what is actually shown. They do not rule out that <italic>Wfs1</italic> deficiency in structures other than layer 2/3 also play a role in these behaviors; the amygdala being one particular target. Also, the layer 2/3 <italic>Wfs1</italic>-expressing cells surely also project within the columns of the mPFC; thus, their effect on stress responsiveness might result from disruption of processing within the mPFC, and hence other outputs from mPFC, including from non-Wfs1 cells. The authors should revise their discussion of their results to make these other possibly more indirect effects of their mutation clear. Similarly, although WFS patients showed increased risk for depression, there is no evidence from GWAS studies to show <italic>Wfs1</italic> variants have a significant association with MDD.

We have explicitly stated (in the subsection “Selective deletion of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in cortical excitatory neurons”), for example, that recombination in <italic>Emx1</italic>Cre mice is restricted to the forebrain, and that <italic>Wfs1</italic> expression in subcortical structures such as the amygdala are unaffected (we have added arrows to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and modified the legend to highlight this point). We have also highlighted the reference that demonstrated that <italic>Wfs1</italic> is expressed in layer 2/3 throughout the cortex, and further discussed the point that it is the injections of AAVs expressing Cre recombinase in mPFC and subsequent behavioral studies that allow us to conclude that the mPFC is critical for these behaviors (in the subsection “Deletion of <italic>Wfs1</italic> in the medial prefrontal cortex is sufficient to cause stress-induced depression related behavior”).</p><p><italic>Also, the layer 2/3</italic> Wfs1<italic>-expressing cells surely also project within the columns of the mPFC; thus, their effect on stress responsiveness might result from disruption of processing within the mPFC, and hence other outputs from mPFC, including from non-</italic>Wfs1 <italic>cells. The authors should revise their discussion of their results to make these other possibly more indirect effects of their mutation clear</italic>.</p><p>We have provided further discussion of our results to indicate that. While we have identified one cell type in the mPFC that is important for moderation of depressive behaviors in response to stress, there are certainly other cell types within the brain that may be able to generate similar behavioral phenotypes. These would include non-Wfs1-expressing cells in the mPFC and elsewhere whose function is impacted by Wfs1-expressing cells (see the subsection “Stress-induced depression”), or cells that participate in parallel circuits that impact these behaviors. Nevertheless, we believe identification of this first cell type as an example of a circuit element that is relevant to both stress and depression is an important advance.</p><p><italic>Similarly, although WFS patients showed increased risk for depression, there is no evidence from GWAS studies to show</italic> Wfs1 <italic>variants have a significant association with MDD. The authors should modify their Abstract and Discussion to avoid stating that their findings have implications for MDD (e.g. in the Abstract: “ Our data identify superficial layer 2/3 pyramidal cells as critical for moderation of stress in the context of MDD…”)</italic>.</p><p>We have provided further discussion of the genetics of MDD, and the role that studies of familial disorders have played in the elucidation of mechanisms and circuits that are relevant to more general, sporadic diseases (see Discussion). In the case of MDD, GWAS studies have been disappointing thus far, so we think that it is appropriate to mention the precedents for this type of approach and the value it has brought to the field. We have ‘softened’ the tone of the Abstract as requested in spite of the strong arguments that a significant fraction of <italic>Wfs1</italic> carriers exhibit a pure form of major depression.</p></body></sub-article></article>
