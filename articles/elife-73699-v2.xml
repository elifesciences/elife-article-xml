immunosuppressive mechanism contributing to immune evasion in solid tumors. Adenosine is not only known to contribute to tumor progression, but it has specific roles in driving dysfunction of immune cells, including natural killer (NK) cells. Here, we engineered human NK cells to directly target the CD73-adenosine axis by blocking the enzymatic activity of CD73. In doing so, the engineered NK cells not only impaired adenosinergic metabolism driven by the hypoxic uptake of ATP by cancer cells in a model of non-small-cell lung cancer, but also mediated killing of tumor cells due to the specific recognition of overexpressed CD73. This resulted in a âsingle agentâ immunotherapy that combines antibody specificity, blockade of purinergic signaling, and killing of targets mediated by NK cells. We also showed that CD73-targeted NK cells are potent in vivo and result in tumor arrest, while promoting NK cell infiltration into CD73<sup>+</sup> tumors and enhancing intratumoral activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>CD73</kwd><kwd>adenosine</kwd><kwd>CAR-NK</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001368</institution-id><institution>V Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>#D2019-039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matosevic</surname><given-names>Sandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Lilly Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Andrea M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001377</institution-id><institution>Walther Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0186.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matosevic</surname><given-names>Sandro</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Migliaccio/Pfizer Graduate Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019-2020</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chambers</surname><given-names>Andrea M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA023168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Utturkar</surname><given-names>Sagar</given-names></name><name><surname>Lanman</surname><given-names>Nadia</given-names></name><name><surname>Toregrosa-Allen</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><name><surname>Elzey</surname><given-names>Bennett D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA082709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jalal</surname><given-names>Shadia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically engineered, CD73-redirected human NK cells show potent antitumor activity in vivo by impairing adenosinergic activity of CD73 in cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide and in the United States. The overall 5-year survival rate is also very low for both men and women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sidney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howlader et al., 2014</xref>. Approximately 85% of all lung cancers diagnosed are non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), and almost 40% of those cases are lung adenocarcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zappa and Mousa, 2016</xref>. Standard of care therapy has evolved to include immunotherapy as a first-line treatment for early and more advanced stages of lung cancer, and typically these treatments are checkpoint inhibitors, focusing on PD-1/PD-L1 blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Socinski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 2017</xref> alone or in combination with chemotherapy. For lung cancer patients without a driver mutation, immunotherapy has resulted in remarkable responses in a subset of NSCLC patients. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandhi et al., 2018</xref> However, even with a combination of chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, only 34% of patients are alive and progression-free after 1 year.</p><p>Another limitation of currently approved immunotherapies in NSCLC is that patients with targetable mutations do not seem to respond to these agents. Patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK) abnormalities, for instance, do not qualify for PD-1/PD-L1 treatments due to low response rates. Even though these patients still have a number of targeted therapy options besides immunotherapy, the cancer can eventually progress, even with commonly used tyrosine kinase inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yoneshima et al., 2018</xref>. Additionally, patients with non-targetable genotypes (for instance, some non-targetable KRAS mutant/STK11 mutant tumors) do not respond well to standard treatment either <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sidney et al., 2019</xref>. Poor efficacy to PD-1/PD-L1 in these patients may be due to a number of factors including a decrease in certain tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and an increase in infiltration of regulatory T cells and immunosuppression in EGFR mutated tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Xia et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sugiyama et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Velez and Burns, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Streicher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lin et al., 2019</xref>.</p><p>In the tumor microenvironment (TME), altered metabolism in the tumor cells due to hypoxia, nutrient deficiency, and increased glucose metabolism can lead to modified immune function and tumorigenesis due to the reorganization of the immune cellsâ metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Annibaldi and Widmann, 2010</xref>. In this hypoxic environment, high levels of ATP are released from the cancer cells that are then consecutively degraded through ecotoenzymes CD39 and CD73 to become adenosine (ADO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang and Matosevic, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poth et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Leone and Emens, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonioli et al., 2016</xref>.

CD73 was shown to be a negative prognostic factor for patient survival in non-small cell lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>. In EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma, CD73 becomes highly over-expressed and has been shown to have less infiltrating CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells compared to non-mutated NSCLC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Velez and Burns, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Streicher et al., 2017</xref>. This overexpression of CD73 in mutated EGFR, for instance, may provide one explanation to the poor responses seen with current immunotherapy options. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop better strategies to overcome checkpoint inhibitor resistance in both mutated and wildtype lung adenocarcinoma.</p><p>Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown to be a promising approach preventing tumor progression; however, CAR T-cells have only been successful in treating blood hematologic malignancies. Also, autologous CAR T-cells have been shown to cause cytokine storm and induce graft-versus host disease (GvHD). CAR NK-cells, on the other hand, may induce minimal side effects and allow the ability to use allogeneic cells, paving the way for an âoff the shelfâ immunotherapeutic treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yilmaz et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siegler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lupo and Matosevic, 2019</xref>. In addition, most CARs are derived from T-cell receptor intracellular signaling domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Siegler et al., 2018</xref>; therefore, the use of an NK stimulatory domain may help to increase NK cell cytotoxicity in the tumor microenvironment.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate the use of an engineered peripheral blood NK cell-based therapy for overcoming the immunosuppression induced by cancer-producing adenosine. We have engineered the NK cells to directly target the CD73 on the tumor cells by imparting a CD73-specific CAR along with NK-specific signaling derived from FCÎ³RIIIa (CD16). We report that these anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells have substantial anti-tumor activity and enhanced degranulation and cytokine production in vitro as well as halted tumor growth in vivo against CD73<sup>+</sup> lung adenocarcinoma. This study demonstrates the potential of CD73 as an immunotherapeutic target for solid tumors, by enabling tumor-specific recognition and targeting of metabolic reprogramming by directly impairing the CD73-adenosine axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of CD73-targeted NK cells</title><p>CD73 is abundantly expressed in NSCLC, specifically lung adenocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), where it is a recognized prognostic marker associated with poorer overall survival (OS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Inoue et al., 2017</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We developed a genetic construct to enable targeting of CD73 and neutralization of its enzymatic activity with NK cells. To do so, we fused a functional, neutralizing CD73 scFv with intracellular and transmembrane regions of FC(gamma)RIIIa (CD16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As a first step toward functional evaluation, we were interested in evaluating the efficiency of mRNA transfection and viral transduction in expressing the CD73-directed construct on NK cells. Plasmids encoding for human CD73 scFv and FCÎ³RIIIa (CD16) regions were developed using the pcDNA3.1(+) for mRNA transfection and the lentiviral pLV plasmid for lentiviral transduction. Although mRNA is transient and generally results in lower transduction efficiencies with primary human NK cells, electroporation was used to validate the function of the gene with mRNA before transduction with the lentivirus.</p><p>To determine the optimal electroporation conditions for inserting the CD73 scFv CAR into peripheral blood NK cells, a variety of conditions were tested, ranging 250 V-500V with various pulse durations, pulse lengths, and pulse intervals (Figure S6: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref>).

The expression of the anti-CD73 scFv showed that an average of 25% of NK cells were found to express the CD73-CAR construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since the loss of NK cell viability is commonly associated with electroporation, we evaluated the viability of NK cells in culture after transfection.

With transduced NK cells, moreover, there was no donor-specific drop in viability and no detrimental effect of cell growth of the donor NK cells due to the transduction procedure, unlike what we had observed with electroporation. In fact, the transduced NK cells had slightly higher cell growth compared to non-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The transduced NK cell population also was not altered in its proportion of CD56<sup>+</sup> NK cells compared to non-transduced NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), and they could expand in media to reach clinical doses. Although there can be some variability in gene expression on NK cells due to donor variability, overall high levels of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) of the CD73 CAR with no changes in NK cell phenotypic populations were obtained. In summary, we showed that lentiviral transduction yields superior expression of the CD73.CAR on NK cells with conditions that can eliminate large losses in viability and that can generate a pure population of CAR-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>NK cells engineered with a CD73.CAR target CD73<sup>+</sup> lung adenocarcinoma in both normoxic and chemically induced hypoxic conditions, while not impacting normal cells</title><p>Compared to control primary NK cells, the CD73.CAR NK cells engineered via either the pcDNA3.1(+) (CD73.mRNACAR) or pLV (CD73.CAR) plasmids exhibited significantly higher killing of A549 cells after 4 hr at various effector:target (E:T, PNK:A549) ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3AâB</xref>). Killing abilities of primary NK cells were generally highly dependent on donor NK cells, precluding direct comparison of killing efficacies. Optimal E:T killing ratios were also different between different donors, both for mRNA-electroporated as well as lentivirally transduced NK cells. PNK cells transduced with lentivirus, compared with mRNA electroporated PNK cells, had a greater relative increase in killing ability between engineered and non-engineered cells, which may be due to higher gene expression and non-transient expression obtained using lentiviral transduction. Conversely, lower killing of CD73 knockout A549 (KO.A549, <italic>Figure S8</italic>) cells was observed by CD73.CAR-NK cells compared to control, non-transduced primary NK cells, showing that mere expression of the CAR construct does increase the killing ability of human NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that the extent of the in vitro killing ability of target cells by CD73.mRNACAR-NK cells is reliant on the enzymatic activity of CD73 on the target cells, which we observe may have limited adenosine production under in vitro conditions. Furthermore, co-culture with A549 cells stimulated the CAR-NK cells to induce increased degranulation displayed by cell surface CD107a expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>) and cytokine secretion shown by IFN-Î³ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Here, the anti-CD73 antibody performed similarly in vitro in terms of killing ability compared to the engineered CAR-NK cells, except at the higher ratio, where the CAR-NK cells outperformed the CD73 antibody.

The resistance to killing has been attributed to a number of mechanisms, including the protective role of ATP to NK cells, and HLA-E expression<sup>73</sup>.

These effects are, however, limited in vitro because enzymatic activity of CD73, which drives the extent of adenosine accumulation, is typically substantially lower in vitro than in vivo. Moreover, CD73.CAR NK cells were healthy as they proliferated rapidly after transduction and stayed viable after mRNA electroporation. When comparing CD73-antibody to CD73.CAR-NK cells, cytotoxicity was lower for the CD73-antibody treatment, especially at the higher effector to target ratio in vitro, which may also correlate to antibody potency. Antibodies do not home into the sites of disease as efficiently as CAR-engineered cells and therefore, do not have as strong of responses in patients with large tumor burdens.

We also show decreased NK killing under hypoxic conditions; however, the CD73.CAR NK cells were able to rescue the detrimental effects of hypoxia to increase NK cell killing ability through the blocking of adenosine. NK cells also express HIF-1Î± under hypoxic conditions that cause this downregulation of killing ability. HIF-1Î± has been under investigation as an anti-tumor strategy but targeting HIF-1Î± directly in the NK cell could potentially be disadvantageous by impairing tumor killing and NK infiltration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krzywinska et al., 2017</xref>. Therefore, by targeting adenosine accumulation directly, the effects of hypoxia on the cancer cells will be diminished, while not affecting the killing ability of the NK cells.</p><p>One concern with the direct targeting of CD73 is the expression of this enzyme on healthy tissues which could increase the risk of on-target, off-site side effects. CD73 expression on non-tumor locations normally supports a variety of physiological processes to prevent an overactive immune system, and these locations include some epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and cardiac myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">KordaÃ et al., 2018</xref>. Although no broad adverse safety effects have been reported in clinical studies targeting CD73 with systemically administered antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harvey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Siu et al., 2018</xref>, a strategy to reduce the risk of targeting non-tumor tissue has been to engineer the antibodies without Fc receptor engagement. One such antibody, MEDI9447, is currently in clinical trials. Recent data from the MEDI9447 trial reported that systemic anti-CD73 therapy was well-tolerated with a manageable safety profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Geoghegan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Overman et al., 2018</xref>. However, eliminating the Fc engagement also eliminates the induction of ADCC, thus restricting NK cell activation and efficacy of treatment. Here we showed that inherently the NK cells did not have any observable off-target effects, as exhibited through killing experiments on endothelial cells. Moreover, the engineered NK cells did not have an increase in killing, indicating that even with high CD73, NK cells do not target normal healthy tissues, thus able to avoid off-target activation against non-malignant cells. While the use of HUVEC cells may have some limitations compared to normal endothelial cells, concerns over the targeting of CD73-directed NK cells to non-tumor tissues can be alleviated by administering these cells locally, such as intratumorally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dubinett et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2017</xref>.</p><p>Here, we also show that the engineered NK cells with the anti-CD73 construct stunted tumor growth and promoted increased NK cell filtration into lung tumors in vivo. These data point to CD73, as a tumor-associated antigen, being a viable target and mediating potent CAR-NK cell based anti-tumor effects against CD73<sup>+</sup> lung adenocarcinoma xenografts in mice, both in terms of tumor metabolism and mouse survival. Clinical data has shown that adoptive transfer of cytokine-induced killer cells is well tolerated and provides improved outcomes over chemotherapy in treating NSCLC patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>. To have the most effective treatment, we used multiple injections, with treatments once a week and IL-15 three times per week. NK cells can have a short lifespan, but the addition of multiple injections and IL-15 helps to drive NK expansion and persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sahm et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoyos et al., 2010</xref>. In our study, we employed three doses of the engineered NK cells and showed suppressed tumor growth after these three infusions. We did not have any evidence of toxicity of our treatment or with IL-15 as mice weights were consistent between treatment groups throughout the study. As evidenced by the smaller tumor size and stunted tumor growth over time after treatment ended, the NK cells were able to persist and maintain their cytotoxic potential. At the end of treatment, NK cells were still found in the circulation, and the engineered CD73.CAR-NK cells were found to have infiltrated into the tumors more than the non-engineered NK cells.</p><p>There were no differences between activation and inhibitory receptors in circulating NK cells for engineered and non-engineered groups; however, the granzyme B expression in the TME was much higher for the engineered NK cells. Since the treatment was injected via the tail vein, not all the cells in the circulation may have made it to the tumor site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang and Matosevic, 2020</xref>. Moreover, the increase in granzyme B in the TME for the engineered cells showed that the NK cells maintained their cytotoxic potential over the course of the study.</p><p>Although engagement of CD73.CAR with CD73 on the tumor cells promoted NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we have not directly tested the activation signaling function of our CD73.CAR construct. Therefore, we cannot rule out whether this effect is dependent upon activation signaling through the CD16 domains or resulting from improved target cell conjugation to enhance natural cytotoxicity.</p><p>Therapeutically, NK cells have an advantage over the FDA approved T-cell therapies, as NK cells exert an innate killing ability that is non-CAR specific, as shown by the killing of tumor targets by non-engineered NK cells. Directing NK cells against CD73 in the TME can also potentially eliminate CD73 expressing suppressor cells, such as CD73<sup>+</sup> Tregs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chambers and Matosevic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schuler et al., 2014</xref>. Expression of CD73 on tumor-infiltrating NK cells is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2022</xref>), as we and others have shown, but CD73<sup>+</sup> NK cells were associated with a hyper-functional phenotype, including the ability to produce IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neo et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, targeting CD73 expressing cells in the TME will not only eliminate tumor-positive cells, but may remove these additional cell populations that help support the tumor niche. In conclusion, by using NK-specific signaling components to arm the NK cells against the immunosuppression in the TME, we have demonstrated a promising new immunotherapeutic modality to improve the survival of NSCLC patients and other patients with CD73<sup>+</sup> solid tumors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files, or are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.931zcrjnp">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.931zcrjnp</ext-link>.

significant interest for cancer immunotherapy, considering recent success of CAR-NK cells in treating B cell malignancies with fewer deleterious side effects, as compared to CAR-T cell therapies. In this paper, the authors engineered NK cells expressing a CAR targeting CD73, which is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinomas and generates immunosuppressive adenosine. Their CD73.CAR-NK cells not only exhibited improved infiltration of and enhanced cytotoxicity toward CD73-expressing tumor cells, but also significantly reduced adenosine production by a lung adenocarcinoma line, which has potential to further improve anti-tumor immune responses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73699.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Kerry</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Kerry</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0567t7073</institution-id><institution>Fox Chase Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.10.05.463201">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.10.05.463201v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kerry Campbell as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Numbers of mice analyzed should be increased for experiments in Figure 5 as requested by reviewer #1.</p><p>2) The authors should provide some evidence whether or not the CAR is providing a direct activation signal into the NK cells upon engagement with CD73.</p><p>3) The authors should test whether CD73 is upregulated when the NK cells are activated. This may be difficult if the CAR blocks CD73 protein detection, but perhaps at least testing for up regulation of mRNA by RT-PCR could be performed.</p><p>4) Data from assay of untransfected NK cells should be added to Figure 4C.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. With the minimal enhanced killing of A549 target cells in vitro, it is unclear if the CAR is actually associating with zeta and Î³ adaptors and thereby functional to signal into NK cells or just inhibiting CD73 catalytic activity on the target cells. Differences in adenosine production could be influencing natural cytotoxicity responsiveness in figures 1C&amp;D, so the authors should treat CAR-bearing NK cells with biotinylated recombinant CD73 and streptavidin and test for degranulation and/or calcium mobilization. Ideally, they could also demonstrate whether the CAR physically associates with zeta and or Î³ adaptors in co-immunoprecipitation experiments.</p><p>2. Analysis of only 4 mice per group in the survival study of Figure 5B is grossly inadequate, and this should be increased to 15-20/group to achieve valid statistical rigor.</p><p>3. NK cell infiltration appears to be greater for the mice treated with CD73.CAR.NK in the single example shown in Figures 5G&amp;H, which is particularly interesting, but confirmation of this potentially key point by quantification with mean and SD from at least 5 mice should be shown to significantly strengthen this conclusion and the manuscript overall. Was the decrease in Lag-3 in Figure 5I statistically significant? If not, more mice should be assayed before claiming Lag-3 expression was decreased. The number of mice assessed is not indicated. Also, Figures 5B and 5C are reversed, as are 5D and 5E. Also, descriptions of 5G,H, and I are mixed up in text and figure legend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors should double check (and correct/modify as needed) some instances in the introduction. For example, where it is mentioned about non-targetable genotypes â here, the authors give KRAS mutant tumors as an example, but some KRAS mutants can be targeted, so this should be addressed. The authors make the broad statement that CAR T cells can induce GvHD, but they make no distinction between autologous and allogeneic CAR T cells. This should be more precisely written.</p><p>The methods the authors used appear to be suitable to address their main questions. There are some minor typos that should be corrected (e.g. ScFv is usually written as scFv, generally spaces should be given between numbers and units, &quot;increase alter the killing&quot; â should be either increase or alter, so one of the words should be deleted).</p><p>On page 17 of the Results section, the authors write that &quot;overall high yields of expression of the CD73 CAR with no changes in NK cell phenotypic populations were obtained&quot;, but do not provide any link as to where these data are displayed. These are important points and should be shown.</p><p>The font size of the text in figure 1 should be increased and the size of the figure panels in general should be increased so that the reader can more easily view the data.</p><p>In figure 2, the authors should provide information regarding the number of replicates for each panel instead of only at the end of the figure. The data shown in figure 2C is not the transduction efficiency as the authors describe it â the transduction efficiency would need to be calculated in the transduced culture prior to sorting. What is shown here is rather the enrichment of modified cells after sorting. The authors should define the right and left plots in figure 2E.</p><p>In figure 3, how do the authors explain their observations of increased CD107a and IFN-Î³ expression at lower effector-to-target (E:T) ratios versus higher E:T?</p><p>How many times were the experiments shown in figure 4 accomplished?</p><p>The data panels shown in figure 5 do not match how they are described in the text (page 20). Figure 5C shows bioluminescence data, not survival, 5D shows the body weight, 5E the tumor volume, 5G NKp46 expression, 5H granzyme B levels, and H is shown twice. The authors should change these to match the data shown.</p><p>Do the authors have any data comparing the &quot;NK-specific&quot; with &quot;T cell&quot; CAR constructs in this context?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Although the experiments were well performed, the manuscript could be improved by addressing the points below.</p><p>1. CD73 could be induced on NK cells upon engagement with tumor cells, thereby impairing the antitumor effect of these engineered anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells in the TME. Thus, the authors should examine this possibility in their work.</p><p>2. The authors need to discuss why anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells had a minimal killing activity on CD73+ HUVEC cells compared to CD73+ human tumor cells.</p><p>3. In Figure 4C, the control group &quot;untransfected NK cells only&quot; is missing.</p><p>4. The tumor weight data (Figure 5E) about the antitumor effect of anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells vs untransduced NK cells seem inconsistent with the survival data (Figure 5B) as well as the bioluminescence data (Figure 5C). Are there any significant differences of tumor weights among different groups?</p><p>5. The name of the tumor should be &quot;A549&quot; rather than &quot;GBM43&quot; in Figure 5F.</p><p>6. Overall, please indicate the reproducibility of your animal and other important studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73699.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

To demonstrate that signaling along the CAR domains occurs upon CD73 engagement, we have carried out a cytotoxicity study using CRISPR/Cas9 CD73 KO A549 cells, which do not express CD73 and produce no adenosine <italic>(Figure 3B)</italic>. CAR-expressing NK cells did not show enhanced cytotoxicity against CD73 KO A549 cells, but did show enhanced cytotoxicity to A549 WT cells, indicating that CAR-bearing NK cells require CD73 engagement for functional activation.</p><p>Further, we have added new data which indicate that the killing ability of the CD73.CAR-</p><p>NK cells is higher against target cells than WT human NK cells in combination with antiCD73 antibody, suggesting the enhanced cytotoxicity of CAR-bearing NK cells is through CAR engagement rather than merely enzymatic blockade of CD73.</p><p>Though adenosine does affect NK cell activity, in a published manuscript, we showed that among these activity-supporting mechanisms, activation of NK cells in the presence of cytokines is able to temper adenosine-mediated suppression of NK cell effector responses, resulting in promotion of NK cell killing. In addition, the metabolic breakdown of adenosine into inosine contributes to its limited accumulation in vitro. See Figure 3B, 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

We, and others, observe that CD107a and IFN-Î³ decrease with increases in effector:target ratio (Aarsund, et al., 2022; Gomez-Lomeli, et al. 2014). At lower E:T ratios there are more NK:cancer interactions per cell, and each individual NK cell responds to this heightened stimulus expressing more CD107a and IFNÎ³ at lower E:T ratios, as measured by flow cytometry.

CD73 could be induced on NK cells upon engagement with tumor cells, thereby impairing the antitumor effect of these engineered anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells in the TME. Thus, the authors should examine this possibility in their work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important question, which we find very interesting. We have in fact examined the possibility of CD73 being induced on NK cells in response to cancer cells. We have analyzed patient data and have carried out a series of assays with both WT and CD73KO CD73<sup>+</sup> cancer cells in the presence of NK cells both under normoxic and chemically-induced hypoxic conditions. Our data show that CD73 upregulation on NK cells is generally limited, and requires high expression of CD73 on cancer cells, as well as hypoxic conditions. In addition, NK cells isolated from tumors of patients show no significant upregulation of CD73 on their surface. This analysis highlights that while this phenomenon is possible, it results in limited upregulation of CD73 on the NK cell surface, thus limiting the loss of NK cells due to potential fratricide. These data have recently been accepted for publication in a separate manuscript (Chambers et al., <italic>Cancer Immunology, Immunotherapy</italic>, 2022, 10.1007/s00262-022-03219z).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors need to discuss why anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells had a minimal killing activity on CD73+ HUVEC cells compared to CD73+ human tumor cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this important and throughtful question. Firstly, it has been shown that HUVECs have no effect on the proliferation or killing ability of NK cells (Pradier Cell Transplantation 2011). Additionally, others have reported low killing of HUVECs by NK cells at E:T ratios below 20:1 (Gorini et al., <italic>Blood</italic> 2010), and suggest that secretion of high levels of ATP may be protective of HUVECs from NK cell killing. They also express HLA-E, suggesting there could be MHC-dependent inhibition of NK cells, contributing to low killing. We are including the references showing this below. We have also edited the manuscript to address this.</p><p>â Gorini S. et al.; ATP secreted by endothelial cells blocks CX<sub>3</sub>CL1-elicited natural killer cell chemotaxis and cytotoxicity via P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptor activation. <italic>Blood</italic> 2010; 116 (22): 4492â4500.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In Figure 4C, the control group &quot;untransfected NK cells only&quot; is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have repeated this assay to include untransfected NK cells only and have replaced the figure in the manuscript with an updated assay which also includes the untransfected NK cell group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The tumor weight data (Figure 5E) about the antitumor effect of anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells vs untransduced NK cells seem inconsistent with the survival data (Figure 5B) as well as the bioluminescence data (Figure 5C). Are there any significant differences of tumor weights among different groups?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment, as well as the opportunity to clarify this observation. Because mice were euthanized at a predetermined endpoint based on tumor size, at different timepoints, no significant differences in tumor weights were observed. In other words, no difference in tumor weight would be expected since tumors are sacrificed when the reach the same size. Bioluminescence data were collected at the same timepoints for all groups, and are a more valid metric for assessing the anti-tumor effect of anti-CD73 CAR-NK cells and untransduced NK cells. To address this and remove confusion, we have removed tumor weight measurements from the manuscript and have rather provided updated in vivo efficacy data with a significantly larger number of mice (16 per group). See figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The name of the tumor should be &quot;A549&quot; rather than &quot;GBM43&quot; in Figure 5F.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Overall, please indicate the reproducibility of your animal and other important studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this question. Most in vitro and in vivo studies have been repeated at least three times and results are consistent between independent experiments. The number of replicates for specific experiments is provided in the manuscript. A new set of in vivo studies were repeated for this revision, with a total of 16 mice/group to strengthen the statistical significance of the data. NK cell transduction is typically dependent on donor, with average expression reported in Figure 2, and upon sorting, we consistently obtained a pure &gt;99% population of CAR-expressing NK cells. Overall, we have been thorough in optimizing methodology to obtain and report consistent data and findings.</p></body></sub-article></article>
