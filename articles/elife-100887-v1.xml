Although it can be treated through surgery, results vary widely, and the cancer often returns. Determining which RPLS tumours are likely to respond well to treatment, and which are more aggressive, can be challenging. This is partly because many of the tumors appear similar under a microscope, making it difficult to identify those that might require more intense treatment.</p><p>For some types of cancer, researchers have started to overcome this problem by identifying molecular markers – specific genes, proteins and other molecules – that are unique to tumor cells. This allows for a better understanding of tumor behavior and helps pinpoint which treatments are most likely to be successful. However, the relevant molecular markers for RPLS remain unknown, preventing this precision medicine approach from being applied to this type of cancer.</p><p>To help close this gap, Xiao et al. studied the genetic activity of tumors from 88 RPLS patients to look for activity associated with more aggressive tumors. Analysis revealed two distinct groups of tumors. One group showed high activity of a gene known as <italic>LEP,</italic> which is involved in metabolism<italic>.</italic> Tumors with high <italic>LEP</italic> activity were less aggressive, with patients surviving longer and requiring fewer surgeries. The other tumor group showed high activity of a gene known as <italic>PTTG1</italic>, which plays a role in cell division and DNA repair. When overactive, these processes can make tumors grow and spread more quickly. In this group, tumors were more likely to return after surgery. Based on these findings, Xiao et al. developed a simple test using the two genes to classify tumors. When tested in a larger group of 241 patients, this method successfully sorted tumors into the two groups with more than 99% accuracy.</p><p>The findings of Xiao et al. suggest that the activity of <italic>LEP</italic> and <italic>PTTG1</italic> could potentially be used as a molecular marker for identifying RPLS patients that might benefit from more intensive treatments. However, further research is required to confirm how reliable these markers are before they can be used to diagnose patients in the clinic.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retroperitoneal liposarcoma</kwd><kwd>molecular classification</kwd><kwd>LEP</kwd><kwd>PTTG1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009592</institution-id><institution>Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, Adminitrative Commission of Zhongguancun Science Park</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z191100006619081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82073390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Min</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023QNRC001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiao</surname><given-names>Mengmeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of two molecularly distinct retroperitoneal liposarcoma subtypes, stratifiable via LEP and PTTG1 biomarkers, enables prognosis prediction and informs precision surgical strategies to improve clinical outcomes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS) is a soft tissue sarcoma originating in the retroperitoneum with an insidious onset. Traditional surgical resection has been regarded as a primary and curable treatment strategy of RPLS for the past 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ecker et al., 2016</xref>). However, the anatomical complexity and biological properties of sarcoma brought great difficulty in achieving microscopically margin-negative resection, leading to a high postoperative recurrence rate in RPLS patients. During the past decade, scientists tried to improve the postoperative survival of RPLS patients by personalized surgical resection and neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapies, but the effect was not satisfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Littau et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gronchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gronchi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gronchi and Pollock, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pisters, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Recently, precision medicine greatly enriched the therapeutic approaches and reformed the clinical decision-making chain of tumor diagnosis and treatment, prolonging the median survival of main tumor types 2–10 times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zeng and Jin, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alifrangis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frese et al., 2021</xref>). Biomarker-based patient stratification and targeted therapy together make up the kernel of precision medicine, which is intrinsically based on the molecular profiling of cancers. However, our knowledge of the molecular features of RPLS is limited, and few clinically applicable molecular biomarkers and targeted drugs are available for RPLS treatment. Only sporadic molecules such as CDK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pilotti et al., 2000</xref>), MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Binh et al., 2005</xref>), AURK4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yen et al., 2019</xref>), and CCNDBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Yang et al., 2021</xref>) have been reported as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers, but these biomarkers were poorly represented and verified. Therefore, it is crucial to reveal the molecular landscape of RPLS and explore a feasible classification for its diagnosis and treatment.</p><p>Here, we conducted a comprehensive investigation into the molecular characteristics of RPLS through the delineation of the largest gene expression landscape ever assembled for this rare disease entity. By identifying both RPLS-specific genes and prognostic biomarkers, we unveiled their intricate relationships with clinical parameters. Our findings revealed the existence of two distinct molecular subtypes within all RPLS patients, characterized by diverse pathological compositions, enriched signaling pathways, and varying clinical outcomes. This highlights the limitations of relying solely on traditional pathological classification for surgical decision-making in certain cases where patients exhibit favorable histological features but poor prognoses, emphasizing the pivotal role of molecular subtyping in guiding individualized treatment strategies and enhancing patient management. To facilitate practical application in clinical settings, we developed a simplified RPLS classification system based on key biomarkers (LEP and PTTG1) representative of each subtype. Notably, this classification scheme was validated in a larger cohort of RPLS patients through immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), laying the groundwork for precise surgical interventions guided by molecular insights in the realm of RPLS treatment.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow diagram of exploring retroperitoneal liposarcoma (RPLS) dichotomous classification.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100887-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Patients and tissue specimens</title><p>Patients who were diagnosed with RPLS amenable to surgical resection were eligible for the study. The RPLS histology was confirmed according to the WHO criteria done on biopsy or surgical specimen by a dedicated sarcoma pathologist. Exclusion criteria comprised age &lt;18 years, severe psychiatric disorders impairing informed consent or study compliance, and inability to ensure adequate follow-up. Tumor specimens from 88 RPLS patients (training cohort 1, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; training cohort 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) and another cohort of 241 RPLS patients (validation cohort, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) were obtained from our local hospital. These cohorts are sourced from REtroperitoneal SArcoma Registry (RESAR, NCT03838718). All the patients underwent curative resection from January 2015 to May 2019. RPLS tissue specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen within 1 hr and then stored in a –80°C refrigerator before use. Clinical information was collected from the medical records, and no patient had undergone previous chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between the latest surgery and death from tumors or between the latest surgery and the last observation taken for surviving patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) was defined as the interval between the latest surgery and diagnosis of relapse or death. Informed consent for surgical procedures and specimen collection was obtained from each patient.

These models were specifically tailored to analyze biomarker data in order to predict clinical outcomes in surgical patients.</p><p>LR is a statistical method that establishes a relationship between a set of independent variables and a binary outcome. It calculates the probability of an event occurring based on the six to seven input features derived from biomarkers relevant to the surgical patient. SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that categorizes data points by identifying the optimal hyperplane that separates distinct classes within a high-dimensional space. This approach effectively maps biomarker data into a multidimensional space to facilitate accurate classification of patient outcomes. RF is an ensemble learning technique that generates multiple decision trees during training and aggregates the results to make predictions. By leveraging this method, we can enhance predictive accuracy by mitigating overfitting and increasing model robustness when analyzing biomarker-driven patient data.</p><p>The performance of these machine learning models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) metric. A higher AUC value indicates superior discriminatory power of the model in distinguishing different clinical outcomes. An AUC value closer to 1.0 signifies strong predictive capability, while 0.5 indicates no discriminatory ability at all. By evaluating the AUC values generated by LR, SVM, and RF models, clinicians can identify which algorithm yields the most reliable predictions based on biomarker profiles for surgical patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>The protocol was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2022</xref>). In brief, the LEP and PTTG1 antibodies for IHC were purchased from Proteintech (Cat No: bs-0409R and bs-1881R).

G1 displayed elevated ssGSEA scores associated with metabolism, whereas G2 exhibited heightened ssGSEA scores linked to cell cycle and DNA damage and repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These features suggested that effective monitoring of the prognosis of RPLS patients can be achieved based on the activation status of specific pathways. We also evaluated the clinical features and immune infiltration levels of those samples.

Also, a linear negative correlation between LEP and PTTG1 expression was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Considering the enhanced interpretability and generalization of linear models, we adopted the results of LR for subsequent analysis (risk values = 2.182 × PTTG1−2.204×LEP). The patients marked as high-risk (Cluster_H) exhibited worse OS and DFS than those marked as low-risk (Cluster_L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>).

Similarly, the Cluster_H showed higher Ki67 levels and smaller tumor sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Moreover, a Sankey diagram was drawn to show the correlation among G1/G2, C1/C2, and Cluster_L/H. Cluster_L/H was well matched to C1/C2 and G1/G2, suggesting LEP and PTTG1 were promising biomarkers for a dichotomous RPLS classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). To ensure the broader applicability of LEP and PTTG1 as classification biomarkers, we performed an independent validation using an external liposarcoma cohort (GSE30929). This dataset was selected due to its relevance to RPLS (N=63, 45%) and the availability of distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) outcomes, aligning with the clinical focus of our study. Applying our established LR, we found that the high-risk (V) group exhibited significantly worse DRFS compared to the low-risk (V) group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and the high-risk group (V) demonstrated a higher proportion of high-grade histology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), consistent with our previous findings. These results validate the robustness and generalizability of our risk stratification model across distinct liposarcoma cohorts.

G1 was annotated as metabolism-active, which exhibited high ssGSEA scores on metabolism-associated pathways, while G2 showed high ssGSEA scores on cell cycle and DNA damage and repair with a high Ki67 and MDM2 level.</p><p>G2 had more aggressive molecular features and worse clinical outcomes compared to G1, in accordance with previously reported tumor classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lindskrog et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In fact, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. Electronic address: elizabeth.demicco@sinaihealthsystem.ca and Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017</xref>, has integrated SCNA and DNA methylation to divide dedifferentiated liposarcoma into two subtypes (S1 and S2), the unfavorable cluster was characterized as JUN amplified (an oncogene that promotes proliferation and metastasis) and lower inferred fraction of immature dendritic cells. However, the patients in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network. Electronic address: elizabeth.demicco@sinaihealthsystem.ca and Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017</xref>, were of complex origin (mixed limbs, trunk, and retroperitoneum), providing limited guidance for RPLS molecular classification. Here, we reported the first clinically applicable RPLS molecular classification based on RNA sequencing and IHC validation cohorts.</p><p>To facilitate the clinical application, we constructed a simplified RPLS molecular classification derived from the original cell cycle/metabolism subgroups. By the NMF algorithm, we identified LEP and PTTG1 as representative biomarkers for each subtype. A model based on IHC staining of LEP and PTTG1 successfully approximated the original dichotomous RPLS classification in biological features and survival outcomes. LEP is an important regulator of basal metabolism and food intake, which is considered a linkage between metabolism and the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiménez-Cortegana et al., 2021</xref>). Although LEP-based targeting therapies have not yet been fully applied, LEP has already been identified as a potent metabolic reprogramming agent to support antitumor responses in aggressive melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de la Cruz-Merino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rivadeneira et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, LEP improves the immunotherapeutic effects by regulating innate and adaptive immune responses via increasing the cytotoxicity of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Francisco et al., 2018</xref>), stimulating the proliferation of T/B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Francisco et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernotiene et al., 2006</xref>), and activating DC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). Those reported roles of LEP provided a good mechanism explanation on the features of metabolism pathway-enriched, better prognosis, and higher TME level of metabolism subgroup (LEP+). In contrast, PTTG1 acts as a regulator of sister chromatid separation during cell division under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zou et al., 1999</xref>), which is closely linked to genetic instability, aneuploidy, tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heaney et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ramaswamy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kim et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Teveroni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Romero et al., 2001</xref>). PTTG1 also regulates the cell cycle and the transactivation of growth factors as an initiator and promoter of tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zou et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mora-Santos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McCabe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ishikawa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hamid et al., 2005</xref>). Overexpressing PTTG1 was correlated with worse prognosis in tumors, such as ovarian cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Parte et al., 2019</xref>), cervical cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2019b</xref>), renal cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tian et al., 2022</xref>), and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heaney et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, the biological functions of PTTG1 provided a good mechanism explanation of the pathway-enriched cell cycle/DNA damage and repair-associated, worse prognosis, and more aggressive pathological composition ratio in the cell cycle subgroup (PTTG1+).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our study presented a comprehensive gene expression landscape of RPLS, revealing distinct molecular features. Through categorizing RPLS into metabolism and cell cycle subtypes and identifying key biomarkers LEP and PTTG1, we established a dichotomous classification system verified by IHC assays. This innovative approach enables precise guidance for surgeons in adjusting treatment strategies for patients with histologically favorable but prognostically challenging RPLS cases, thereby advancing the implementation of precision medicine in guiding surgical interventions for RPLS.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data anonymization</title><p>All participant identifiers were replaced with unique IDs during data collection and analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical trial registration Unique identifying number or registration ID: NCT03838718.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Specimens of RPLS were obtained from Peking University International Hospital.

The authors should provide a detailed explanation of the selection process.</p></disp-quote><p>The selection criteria for identifying LEP and PTTG1 as biomarkers involved selecting prognostic genes that were highly expressed in C1 and C2, respectively, and achieved the highest AUC value in distinguishing the two RPLS groups (Page17 lines 288-290).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) To ensure the broader applicability of LEP and PTTG1 as classification markers, the authors should validate their findings in one or two external datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate your insightful suggestion regarding the external validation of LEP and PTTG1 as classification biomarkers. To address this concern, we performed an independent validation using an external liposarcoma cohort (GSE30929; Page 6, Lines 104-105), which comprises 140 primary liposarcoma samples with annotated clinicopathological and survival data. This dataset was selected due to its relevance to RPLS (N=63, 45%) and the availability of distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) outcomes, aligning with the clinical focus of our study.</p><p>Applying our previously established prognostic model (Risk value = 2.182 × PTTG1 - 2.204 × LEP) to this cohort, we stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups using the median risk score as the cutoff. Consistent with our original findings, the high-risk group exhibited significantly worse DRFS compared to the low-risk group. The ROC curves based on the 1-, 3-, 5-year survival status of patients demonstrated that this model can effectively predict patient DRFS (log-rank P &lt; 0.001, Figure S3A-B). Furthermore, the high-risk group demonstrated a higher proportion of high-grade histology (P &lt; 0.001, Fisher’s exact test, Figure S3C-D).</p><p>These results validate the robustness and generalizability of our risk stratification model across distinct liposarcoma cohorts. The external dataset’s alignment with our findings underscores the potential of LEP and PTTG1 as reproducible biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic stratification in liposarcoma.

We would like to address these points in detail below:</p><p>(1) Purpose of the PTTG1- and LEP-based RPLS Classification Model</p><p>The primary objective of our study was to develop a molecular subtyping model based on PTTG1 and LEP to guide personalized treatment strategies for patients with RPLS, particularly those classified as low-grade by traditional histopathological criteria but exhibiting poor prognosis. This subgroup of patients may benefit from more aggressive surgical resection, which is a potentially curative approach for RPLS. Our model aims to identify these high-risk patients to ensure complete tumor resection, thereby improving their clinical outcomes.</p><p>(2) Therapeutic Response Evaluation in Distinct Groups</p><p>In both our validation cohort and external validation cohort, surgical resection was the primary treatment modality for RPLS. After stratifying patients using our model, we observed significant differences in surgical outcomes between the two groups: the high-risk group exhibited poor prognosis, while the low-risk group showed favorable outcomes (Figure 5D-E and Figure S3A-B). Importantly, our model successfully identified low-grade histopathological cases with poor prognosis, who might otherwise be undertreated (Figure 5G-I and Figure S3C-D). By advocating for more thorough surgical resection in these high-risk patients, we aim to improve their prognosis. This achievement aligns with the primary goal of our study, which is to provide a molecular tool for personalized treatment guidance.</p><p>(3) Future Validation and Functional Exploration of PTTG1 and LEP</p><p>Our study has identified PTTG1 and LEP as key biomarkers for RPLS classification, and we recognize the urgent need to elucidate their molecular functions in RPLS pathogenesis. Here, we are pleased to report that we have already initiated cellular and animal experiments to investigate the roles of PTTG1 and LEP in RPLS. These experiments aim to validate our predictions and explore the underlying mechanisms by which these biomarkers contribute to tumor behavior and treatment response. We anticipate that the results of these studies will provide further mechanistic insights and will be submitted for publication in a suitable journal in the near future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Surgical resection remains the most effective treatment for retroperitoneal liposarcoma. However, postoperative recurrence is very common and is considered the main cause of disease-related death. Considering the importance and effectiveness of precision medicine, the identification of molecular characteristics is particularly important for the prognosis assessment and individualized treatment of RPLS. In this work, the authors described the gene expression map of RPLS and illustrated an innovative strategy of molecular classification. Through the pathway enrichment of differentially expressed genes, characteristic abnormal biological processes were identified, and RPLS patients were simply categorized based on the two major abnormal biological processes. Subsequently, the classification strategy was further simplified through nonnegative matrix factorization. The authors finally narrowed the classification indicators to two characteristic molecules LEP and PTTG1, and constructed novel molecular prognosis models that presented obviously a great area under the curve. A relatively interpretable logistic regression model was selected to obtain the risk scoring formula, and its clinical relevance and prognostic evaluation efficiency were verified by immunohistochemistry. Recently, prognostic model construction has been a hot topic in the field of oncology. The interesting point of this study is that it effectively screened characteristic molecules and practically simplified the typing strategy on the basis of ensuring high matching clinical relevance. Overall, the study is well-designed and will serve as a valuable resource for RPLS research.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your insightful feedback on our manuscript.
