synaptic circuits linking primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas is fundamental for sensorimotor integration in cortex. Circuits along the ascending somatosensory pathway through mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1 were recently described in detail (Yamawaki et al., 2021). Here, we characterize the peripherally evoked spiking dynamics in these two cortical areas. Brief (5 ms) optogenetic photostimulation of the hand generated short (~25 ms) barrages of activity first in S1 (onset latency 15 ms) then M1 (10 ms later). The estimated propagation speed was 20-fold faster from hand to S1 than from S1 to M1. Amplitudes in M1 were strongly attenuated. Responses were typically triphasic, with suppression and rebound following the initial peak. Evoked activity in S1 was biased to middle layers, consistent with thalamocortical connectivity, while that in M1 was biased to upper layers, consistent with corticocortical connectivity. Parvalbumin (PV) inhibitory interneurons were involved in each phase, accounting for three quarters of the initial spikes generated in S1, and their selective photostimulation sufficed to evoke suppression and rebound in both S1 and M1. Partial silencing of S1 by PV activation during hand stimulation reduced the M1 sensory responses. Overall, these results characterize how evoked spiking activity propagates along the hand/forelimb transcortical loop, and illuminate how in vivo cortical dynamics relate to the underlying synaptic circuit organization in this system.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sensorimotor integration</kwd><kwd>somatosensory</kwd><kwd>corticospinal</kwd><kwd>motor system</kwd><kwd>optogenetic</kwd><kwd>parvalbumin interneuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS125594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon MG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS061963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon MG</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>'Phototactile' hand stimulation rapidly activates first the somatosensory then the motor cortex, broadly consistent with constraints suggested by the previously described circuit architecture of this transcortical loop.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Somatosensory signals reach primary motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldring et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Strick and Preston, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Swadlow, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Naito et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hatsopoulos and Suminski, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murray and Keller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Reddy et al., 2024</xref>). To do so, signals from mechanoreceptor afferents ascend primarily via lemniscal pathways and somatosensory thalamus to arrive in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which sends corticocortical projections to primary motor cortex (M1). The thalamus→S1→M1 circuits are well studied in model systems such as the rodent vibrissal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ferezou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sreenivasan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petersen, 2019</xref>). We recently confirmed and extended these findings for the corresponding circuits of mouse hand/forelimb S1 and M1, using slice-based optogenetic and electrophysiological methods to delineate synaptic circuit connections along the transcortical sensorimotor loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A salient feature of the hand/forelimb circuits is the transition, on reaching S1 cortex, from a ‘streamlined’ organization of the ascending subcortical circuits via thalamus to a ‘densely polysynaptic’ organization of the local and interareal cortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we sought to characterize the timing, amplitude, and related properties of the cortical dynamics in the same S1 and M1 circuits, evoked by stimulating hand mechanoreceptors. We developed an optogenetic–electrophysiological approach guided by the desiderata of delivering brief stimuli to awake animals during simultaneous recordings of spiking activity in both areas, leveraging a mouse line enabling cortical as well as peripheral optogenetic manipulations. This approach enabled quantitative characterization of fundamental properties of the spiking dynamics of hand/forelimb S1 and M1 in response to brief peripheral stimulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Brief stimulation of the hand evokes barrages of spiking activity in S1 and M1</title><p>To study cortical responses to hand stimulation, we aimed to develop a paradigm for delivering short-duration stimuli while electrophysiologically sampling spiking activity in hand/forelimb S1 and M1 cortical areas of awake mice. The rationale for using brief stimuli was to obtain the equivalent of an impulse response function of the system. For example, with millisecond-scale stimulation, essentially all activity, including any longer-lasting responses extending in time well after the initial pulse of input, can be ascribed to the initial input alone. We adopted an optogenetic approach for delivering ‘phototactile’ somatosensory stimuli to the mouse’s hand with millisecond precision, combining this with cortical electrophysiological recordings of evoked spiking activity (<bold>Methods</bold>). Motivations for this approach included the ease of precisely controlling stimulus timing and intensity, and compatibility with awake animals.</p><p>Crossing a proprioceptor-specific driver line of mice (PV-Cre) with a channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) reporter line (Ai32) yielded expression of ChR2 in peripheral mechanoreceptor afferents, particularly around the palm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <bold>Methods</bold>). We chose this line because it fortuitously also labels parvalbumin-type GABAergic neurons in the cortex, enabling cortical optogenetic manipulations as well. To sample stimulus-evoked cortical responses, we recorded from multi-channel linear arrays inserted in S1 and M1 of awake, head-fixed mice as they rested their hands on holding bars harboring an optical fiber through which light stimuli were delivered to the palm. As shown in an example recording, photostimulation of the hand with 5-ms pulses of blue light elicited barrages of cortical spiking activity in both areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although hand stimulation evoked activity in forelimb M1, it did not evoke movements of the forelimb (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Following experiments, brains were sectioned and inspected to stereotaxically localize the fluorescent tracks of the dye-coated linear arrays to confirm the recording locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This approach thus provides a way to record and analyze S1 and M1 cortical activity evoked by brief photostimulation of the hand in awake mice.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Brief stimulation of the hand evokes barrages of spiking activity in S1 and M1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental approach.

In trials where the mouse’s hand was not resting on the light-delivery bar, no responses were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, G</xref>). This also served as a control for potential visual responses to the flashing light. As seen in the individual experiments as well as in the grand averages, peripheral stimulation evoked a triphasic response in both areas, with an initial short-latency large-amplitude peak followed by an interval of suppressed activity and a subsequent late lower-amplitude rebound.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, both in S1 and M1, peak amplitude strongly correlated with onset latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) and peak latency (S1: <italic>ρ</italic> = –0.69, p = 0.01; M1: <italic>ρ</italic> = –0.71, p = 0.01); the faster the onset, the larger the amplitude. Few other significant correlations were found, however. Response durations were not significantly correlated with peak amplitudes in S1, where responses were generally strongest, and only relatively weakly correlated in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, larger responses terminated just as quickly as smaller ones. Although response amplitudes were consistently bigger in S1 than in M1 they were not significantly correlated with each other. This may reflect variability in probe placements, the numbers and types of units recorded, and other factors contributing to animal-to-animal variability.</p><p>Having measured the latencies of the evoked spiking activity reaching S1 and M1, we also estimated the corresponding effective propagation speeds. To do so, we estimated the hand-to-S1 and S1-to-M1 pathway distances and divided these by the latencies (<bold>Methods</bold>). The hand-to-S1 distance was estimated as 44.3 ± 1.1 mm, and the hand-to-S1 propagation speed was accordingly 3.0 ± 0.1 m/s based on onset latencies (2.1 ± 0.1 m/s based on peak latencies). The S1-to-M1 distance, measured as the Euclidean distance between the probes, was 0.92 ± 0.12 mm (mean ± s.d.), and the estimated S1-to-M1 propagation speed was accordingly 0.14 ± 0.11 m/s based on the difference (M1 minus S1) in onset latencies (0.14 ± 0.10 m/s based on peak latencies). Thus, the propagation speed for the entire subcortical leg of the ascending pathway was approximately 20-fold faster than for the short corticocortical leg, from S1 to M1.</p><p>These results quantify basic properties of the initial component of the evoked cortical spiking activity in S1 and M1. In S1, responses begin ~15 ms after stimulus onset and reach peak amplitude ~6 ms later. In M1, responses have a similar temporal profile but with a ~10 ms lag and approximately one-third of the S1 amplitude. Thus, M1 receives a slightly delayed and substantially attenuated short-latency somatosensory response from brief hand stimulation. In both areas, responses self-terminate, extinguishing within ~25 ms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Post-peak activity is suppressed in S1 and rebounds in both S1 and M1</title><p>Focusing next on the later phases of the evoked responses, we noted that the initial burst of evoked activity was self-terminating, and particularly in S1 often then fell below the pre-stimulus baseline level as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

To explore this, we tested the sensitivity of the cortex to a second photostimulus, timed to coincide with the intervals of either the suppressed or rebound activity, or later (i.e., a paired-pulse paradigm, with variable lag) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–N</xref>).

This implies that somatosensory input generates in S1, and to a lesser extent in M1, a sequence of excitation, inhibition, and disinhibition, with the two later stages scaling in proportion to the initial response amplitude. The self-terminating property of the initial large-amplitude response together with the ensuing suppression of activity suggests strong initial recruitment of inhibitory interneurons. Therefore, we next investigated the response properties of cortical interneurons, using cell-type-specific methods to identify them in the recordings and manipulate their activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Laminar profiles of evoked activity in S1 and M1</title><p>To assess the laminar distribution of the evoked activity, we used the same methods as in the probe-averaged analyses described above but with spiking responses of active units binned according to cortical depth (11 recordings).

To test this, we performed focal stimulation of S1 PV neurons as above, in this case pairing it with simultaneous hand stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). As before, hand stimulation alone evoked strong responses in S1 and weaker and delayed responses in M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

When hand stimulation was paired with S1 silencing, the activity in S1 followed a hybrid pattern (reflecting the combined effect of activating the PV units and partially suppressing the sensory-evoked response), and the activity in M1 was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D</xref>).

The findings identify basic properties and mechanisms of population spiking dynamics in this model system for investigating neural mechanisms of sensorimotor integration in transcortical loops.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Methodological considerations</title><p>The optogenetic method for peripheral stimulation used here, though artificial, closely mimics basic features of natural somatosensory stimulation, as shown in numerous prior studies involving related approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O’Connor et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Millard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Prsa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emanuel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehnert et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schorscher-Petcu et al., 2021</xref>). Like electrical stimulation, which is also used in somatosensory experiments, a key advantage is the ability to deliver temporally precise (i.e., brief) stimuli to the hand. However, electrical stimulation non-specifically activates somatosensory afferents, including pain fibers, and while tolerated by human subjects usually requires general anesthesia for studies in non-human mammalian model species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zaforas et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Another advantage of the optogenetic approach is the ability to restrict labeling to particular somatosensory afferents of interest. A potential disadvantage of the particular approach used here, based on using a Cre line to drive expression, is that ChR2 may be expressed in the cortex as well, potentially constraining options for cortical optogenetic manipulations. However, in this case, we specifically chose the PV-Cre line because ChR2 is also expressed in cortical PV neurons, enabling cortical opto-tagging and silencing in the same experiments. A related point is that the particular Cre line used here (PV-Cre) is one that labels proprioceptor afferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hippenmeyer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>); other lines are available for labeling diverse somatosensory subtypes of DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Neubarth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sharma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our approach relied on repeated stimulation of the hand as it rested on the bar during each ~30 s block of trials, which was unproblematic in these experiments where the goal was to broadly stimulate a large but not necessarily identical population of mechanoreceptors distributed across the palm. However, for other experimental goals such as receptive field mapping, this configuration would need to be modified.</p><p>We primarily analyzed activity based on pooling of multi- and single units, as our main aim was to analyze the response modulation in S1 and M1 to the hand stimulation. This enabled more extensive exploration of the data, as the fraction of single units recorded was low. Additionally, basal firing rates were low, reflecting the quiescent behavioral state, as mice were required to remain still with their hand resting on the light-delivery bar during recordings. An acknowledged caveat, therefore, is that this approach is problematic for characterizing absolute firing rates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>M1 responses reflect S1→M1 corticocortical activity</title><p>To what extent do the evoked responses reflect propagation of activity along S1→M1 corticocortical circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>)? In principle, other pathways to M1 could be involved. For example, somatosensory thalamus projects not only to S1 but also S2, which projects to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Suter and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). However, thalamocortical projections to S2 arise mainly from caudal whisker-related thalamic nuclei, while the forelimb-related pathways, including those for proprioception, are concentrated in rostral nuclei projecting to S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Francis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rubio-Teves et al., 2024</xref>). As another possibility, activity in S1 might drive M1 via thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mo and Sherman, 2019</xref>). However, in the mouse hand/forelimb system, cortico-thalamo-cortical (CTC) pathways are primarily organized as recurrent loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2020</xref>), which may recurrently drive corticocortical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shepherd and Yamawaki, 2021</xref>). The reduction in M1 responses when S1 activity was partially silenced directly implicates S1 in driving M1 responses, and the non-PV silenced neurons in S1 likely included corticocortical neurons. Technical limitations, relating to the proximity of M1 and S1 and the spatial resolution of focal silencing, precluded even stronger silencing of S1 activity. Although residual M1 activity was most likely driven by remaining upstream activity within forelimb S1, other, albeit more circuitous, pathways may secondarily contribute. Overall, however, our findings indicate that M1 responses arise primarily from feedforward propagation of activity along S1→M1 circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Response latencies reflect fast subcortical and slow corticocortical circuits</title><p>In S1, the evoked activity developed quickly following hand stimulation, with onset latencies of 15 ms on average, consistent with those found previously using related approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emanuel et al., 2021</xref>). For comparison, in the rat, whisker deflection generates cortical responses with an even shorter latency of ~10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahissar et al., 2000</xref>), consistent with the shorter pathway distance for the whisker-barrel system. We estimated the effective propagation speed along the ascending pathway, from the periphery to S1, to be 3 m/s. Interestingly, in humans the hand-to-S1 latency is similarly short, ~20 ms, with correspondingly much higher conduction velocities for the ascending pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desmedt and Cheron, 1980</xref>).</p><p>In M1, the evoked activity also developed quickly, lagging S1 by 10 ms. However, although the latencies were brief, the effective corticocortical propagation speed was slow, estimated at 0.14 m/s. This speed is comparable to the conduction velocity of thin unmyelinated cortical axons, estimated to be ~0.2 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raastad and Shepherd, 2003</xref>), and to interareal propagation speeds in other corticocortical circuits in mouse cortex, estimated to be approximately 0.3 m/s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Both the hand-to-S1 and S1-to-M1 pathways are polysynaptic, and the estimated propagation speeds thus reflect multiple biophysical properties (axonal conduction velocities, synaptic transmission delays, and more).</p><p>This 20-fold difference in subcortical versus corticocortical propagation speeds is consistent with previous characterizations of the synaptic circuit organization of the same pathways as ‘streamlined’ for the subcortical ascending pathways to S1 and ‘densely polysynaptic’ for the corticocortical pathway from S1 to M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, sensorimotor transformations in this system appear designed for signal propagation that is fast from periphery to the cortex, then slows drastically from S1 to M1 (and other areas). The slowness of corticocortical dynamics in this system accords with the idea that speed-limited sensorimotor transformations may be a general property of neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zheng and Meister, 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Response amplitudes and durations reflect intrinsic mechanisms of termination and attenuation</title><p>In M1, the initial peak response amplitudes were substantially attenuated relative to S1, where amplitudes were high, far above the low baseline firing rates. In both areas, responses were self-terminating, with brief durations. Response profiles resemble the ‘packet’-like activity patterns previously described in diverse circuits, which have been proposed as fundamental units of information processing in neural systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luczak et al., 2015</xref>). They also closely resemble those of optogenetically evoked activity patterns observed in higher-order corticocortical pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Responses were not only self-terminating but also self-extending, in the sense that their durations (tens of milliseconds) were much longer than the peripheral stimulus that evoked them (5 ms). At the cortical level, this temporal dispersion of the responses did not accumulate going from S1 to M1, reflecting tight control and termination of excitation along the corticocortical pathway.</p><p>Response termination likely involves multiple mechanisms, given the importance of preventing runaway excitation. For example, cellular-level mechanisms such as spike frequency adaptation rapidly attenuate firing of mouse S1 and M1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hattox and Nelson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Suter et al., 2013</xref>). Circuit-level mechanisms include the strong activation of cortical inhibitory interneurons by somatosensory input (considered later).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Laminar activity reflects S1→M1 circuit organization</title><p>In S1, the laminar profile of evoked responses was broad, with a focus on middle laminar zones corresponding to layers 4 and 5A. This pattern is generally consistent with thalamocortical connectivity in forelimb S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>), and with prior studies of homologous thalamocortical connections and dynamics in the whisker-barrel system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Kock et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Constantinople and Bruno, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sermet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). In M1, previous results from slice-based analysis of S1→M1 connectivity show strongest excitatory synaptic input to layer 2/3 neurons, with little or no input to corticospinal and other deeper layer neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this, we found strongest activation in laminar zones corresponding to layers 2/3 and 5A. A small dip between these zones, likely corresponding to layer 4, accords with other previous results showing a relatively paucity of corticocortical input to M1 layer 4 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamawaki et al., 2014</xref>). Activity was low across deeper zones corresponding to layers 5B and 6. Thus the laminar profile of evoked activity largely matches that of the synaptic connectivity in the underlying corticocortical S1→M1 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary.</title><p>Comparison of evoked cortical dynamics and synaptic circuit organization along the hand/forelimb-related transcortical loop through S1 and M1.

Prior studies in S1 have shown that somatosensory stimulation potently activates cortical inhibitory interneurons, particularly PV-type neurons, with stronger and faster (shorter latency) recruitment compared to excitatory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Simons, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu and Connors, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bruno and Simons, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Swadlow, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabernet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cruikshank et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yu et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, here we found that PV neurons in S1 are massively recruited by hand stimulation, both in terms of the number (approximately equal to that of non-PV units) and the firing rate (approximately double that of non-PV units). Indeed, most (~76%) of the evoked spikes in S1 cortex during the initial peak response were from PV neurons. PV units were moreover recruited slightly earlier (i.e., with shorter response latencies) than non-PV units. We did not study PV units in M1 in response to hand stimulation, but prior studies indicate similarly strong, short-latency recruitment of fast-spiking neurons in hand/forelimb M1 as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murray and Keller, 2011</xref>).</p><p>PV units remained involved in the ensuing suppression and rebound phases as well. During suppression, PV spiking fell, rather than increased; thus, the overall suppression could not be ascribed to ongoing firing of these inhibitory interneurons, but likely reflects other mechanisms, such as slow kinematics of GABAergic responses. During rebound, the contribution of PV spiking to the overall activity was again high compared to non-PV units, which in this case reflected their relatively greater recruitment rather than higher firing rates. These findings are consistent with prior characterizations of peak-suppression-rebound responses in S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chapin et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhu and Connors, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sreenivasan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Selective activation of PV units alone in either S1 or M1 evoked a sequence of suppression and rebound activity similar to that evoked by hand stimulation alone, indicating a prominent role of PV activity in shaping the triphasic cortical responses. Focal activation of PV neurons, used here for the purpose of mechanistically probing cortical somatosensory responses, is also commonly used for the purpose of transient focal silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the rebound activity studied here as part of the triphasic somatosensory response is closely related to the rebound excitation that can occur as an unwanted confounding side effect of focal activation of interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wiegert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings emphasize that this is an inherent property of the cortex, elicitable not only by peripheral sensory input but also intracortically by PV activation or electrical stimulation, and likely involving intrinsic electrophysiological mechanisms as well as local cortical and CTC circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grenier et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Claar et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kumaravelu and Grill, 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Russo et al., 2024</xref>).

These findings suggest a role for PV neurons in S1 in regulating the extent to which S1 activity influences M1 activity. More generally, the findings obtained by opto-tagging PV neurons in S1 indicate a prominent role for these neurons in shaping both the local S1 and downstream M1 responses to somatosensory stimulation of the hand.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Perspectives</title><p>The S1-to-M1 transcortical loop – the longest of several sensorimotor loops embedded along the neuraxis to enable somatosensory feedback control over a range of time scales – may be particularly important for mediating rapid adjustments to ongoing somatosensory information in the context of current and planned cortical motor commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Reschechtko and Pruszynski, 2020</xref>). Our findings in the mouse provide a basis for comparisons to homologous systems, particularly the rodent vibrissal and primate hand/forelimb circuits; as alluded to above, these can exhibit notable similarities as well as differences in latencies and other dynamic properties. Our characterizations of basic response parameters in mouse hand/forelimb circuits also provide a framework for relating dynamic spiking activity to the underlying cells and their synaptic connections in this system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>; as a first step, we explored the use of optogenetic manipulations of PV neurons.

Multi-units on the same channel with similar waveform shapes were merged.

For photostimulation of hand mechanoreceptors, the bar for the hand rest was fashioned out of a thick-walled plastic tube (diameter: 3.2 mm outside, 1.5 mm inside) by drilling a through-hole and inserting the exposed end of an optical fiber (910 μm core diameter, 0.22 NA, 1.5 m length, FG910UEC Patch cable, Thorlabs, Inc). The fiber was coupled to a blue LED (455 nm wavelength, M455F3 source, LEDD1B driver; Thorlabs, Inc). The bar was positioned so that the fiber tip faced the palm when mice placed their hand on the resting bar. With this configuration, light stimuli broadly illuminated the volar aspect of the hand. We visually monitored (and video recorded in a subset of experiments) the hand placement during each block of trials, and blocks in which the mouse repositioned the hand were discarded.</p><p>Photostimulation parameters were controlled by Wavesurfer software (v0.945, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wavesurfer.janelia.org/">https://wavesurfer.janelia.org/</ext-link>). Light intensity at the fiber tip was calibrated with a power meter (PM100D, Thorlabs, Inc). Stimulus duration was 5 ms and intensity was 5 mW at the fiber tip. This intensity was chosen based on pilot experiments in which we varied the LED power, which showed that this intensity was reliably above the threshold for evoking robust responses in both S1 and M1 without evoking any visually detectable movements (as subsequently confirmed by videography). Photostimuli were applied to the hand contralateral to the cortical recordings. For each experiment, light pulses were delivered in blocks of 25 trials (except where noted otherwise) with an inter-trial period of 1 s. In addition, we also recorded responses when the mouse’s hand was resting off the bar, either as a control or in combination with cortical photostimulation (described next).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetic photostimulation of cortical PV neurons</title><p>In most cases, optogenetic activation of PV neurons in S1 or M1 was performed while mice had their hands off the light-delivery bar, using a sequence of 25 pulses of blue light delivered at the tip of the opto-probe. The probe was inserted as described above and coupled via patch cord (M63L01, Thorlabs, Inc) to the blue laser source (473 nm wavelength, MBL-III-473-100 mW, Opto Engine LLC), with an illumination intensity of 1 mW at the fiber tip, core diameter 105 μm. For a subset of silencing experiments, the optogenetic activation of PV neurons was interleaved with trials of hand stimulation or both hand and focal S1 stimulation while the mouse kept their hand resting on the light-delivery bar. The illumination intensity was reduced to 0.25 mW at the fiber tip. There was a total of 27 trials per condition in this case. In all cases, the stimulus duration for PV activation was 20 ms.</p><p>We checked the specificity of cortical labeling in the PV-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), as prior results have shown PV expression in a subset of excitatory neurons in layer 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Palicz et al., 2024</xref>). Anatomically, in cortical slices of PV-Cre x Ai14 (tdTomato) mice in which layer 5B corticospinal neurons were also labeled, we observed no double-labeled cells. Electrophysiologically, in cortical slices of PV-Cre × Ai32 mice in which corticospinal and corticocortical excitatory neurons were also labeled, recordings from these neurons showed no detectable photocurrents. In some neurons, we did detect evoked excitatory synaptic currents and/or potentials. However, these were weak, and tiny compared to the GABAergic inputs. Thus, in the experiments reported here, the dominant effect of cortical photostimulation in PV-Cre × Ai32 mice appears consistent with massive GABA-mediated inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Analysis of stimulus-aligned data</title><p>For each active unit, spiking activity was binned in 5 ms bins, aligned to stimulus onset. PSTHs spanning 0.5 s before to 0.5 s after stimulation were constructed by averaging the stimulus-aligned binned firing rates over trials (generally 25). To detect stimulus-responsive units, the PSTHs were <italic>z</italic>-scored, and stimulus-responsive units were identified as those for which the maximum <italic>z</italic>-scored firing rate exceeded 2.5 s.d. above the baseline mean value (250 ms preceding the stimulus onset).</p><p>Analyses focused on stimulus-responsive units, except where otherwise indicated. Dynamic properties of each responsive unit’s PSTH were extracted as follows. To analyze properties associated with the early main response, for each trial, we first baseline-subtracted the raw PSTHs using their baseline mean value. Peak amplitude was calculated as the maximum firing rate in the average baseline-subtracted PSTH, over a time window of 100 ms post-stimulus. The time bin of the maximum post-stimulus firing rate was taken as the peak latency. The time bin when the firing rate first exceeded 2.5 s.d. was considered as the onset latency. Response duration was computed as the time window from when the firing rate first exceeded 2.5 s.d. above baseline to when it first fell below 1 s.d above baseline.</p><p>To analyze properties associated with the post-peak suppression phase of the responses, we identified units with significant suppression: for each unit, we calculated the mean firing rate during this interval, between 110 and 170 ms (based on visual inspection of average PSTHs), and statistically compared this to the mean of the pre-stimulus baseline (Wilcoxon’s signed rank test). As the response tended to rebound after this period, we identified units with significant rebound: for each unit, we calculated the rebound amplitude by finding the maximum of the PSTH during the rebound window, between 190 and 400 ms, and averaging from 20 ms before to 20 ms after this value, and statistically compared this with the mean of the pre-stimulus baseline.</p><p>For laminar analysis, we computed the PSTH for all units as above but sorted the units into bins of 5% of the normalized cortical depth, 20 bins total from 0 (pia) to 1 (boundary of cortex with the underlying white matter). The bin-averaged PSTHs were then calculated using the same approach as described above for the probe-averaged PSTHs.</p><p>For each experiment, once the parameters and PSTHs were computed for all responsive units, values were pooled and averaged. These averages were then pooled to obtain grand averages across experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Video motion analysis</title><p>To analyze potential stimulus-evoked movements, video recordings were taken from a cohort of three mice during photostimulation of the hand. Videos were captured under red light illumination with a high-speed CMOS-based monochrome video camera at 1000 frames per second (fps), 999.6 μs exposure time, and 1024 × 512 pixel field of view, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barrett et al., 2024</xref>). Motion analysis was performed by taking the difference in pixel values for each frame from the average values of the same pixels in a 100-ms baseline preceding each stimulus, for at least 25 trials. The average difference in pixel values in a rectangular ROI surrounding the hand was then calculated over a post-stimulus period from 6 to 100 ms after each stimulus (the duration the LED was on was excluded from analysis due to the artifact caused by the illumination). If a mouse moved in any consistent manner during the post-stimulus interval, this would be reflected in a narrow range of average change in pixel values on each trial, but for all three mice the average change in pixel values was not significantly different from zero (Wilcoxon signed rank test, all p &gt; 0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Probe track localization</title><p>As previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2022</xref>), recording sites were confirmed by coating the probes with a fluorescent dye (DiI, Vybrant Multicolor Cell Labeling Kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) prior to recordings, harvesting and histologically processing the brains after experiments, and localizing the probe tracks in 100 μm brain sections under epifluorescence microscopy. In two cases, because probe tracks could not be recovered histologically, areal assignment was based on the targeted coordinates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pathway morphometry</title><p>S1-to-M1 distance was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the S1 and M1 recording sites, localized based on probe tracks as described above. To estimate the hand-to-S1 distance we separately estimated the hand-to-cord and cord-to-cortex distances and summed these. The distance from the palm of the hand to the sixth cervical (C-6) spinal cord segment was estimated from morphometric measurements of cadaveric specimens (<italic>n</italic> = 5 mice). The distance from C-6 cord to S1 cortex was estimated from published MRI images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Slice-based optogenetics and electrophysiology</title><p>In a subset of experiments we used standard slice-based methods to assess responses of electrophysiologically recorded pyramidal neurons to photostimulation of ChR2-expressing presynaptic axons in brain slices of forelimb S1 and M1, as previously described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamawaki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the technical approach was essentially identical to that used previously to characterize excitatory connectivity in the same circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yamawaki et al., 2021</xref>), adapted to examine excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs from ChR2-expressing PV neurons (in PV-Cre × Ai32 mice, as described above) to layer 2/3 and 5B pyramidal neurons. To facilitate positive identification of pyramidal neurons, retrograde AAV-tdTomato (AAVretro-CAG-tdTomato, 59462-AAVrg; Addgene, Watertown, MA) was injected into the spinal cord (to label corticospinal neurons, as described above) and in the contralateral cortex (to label intratelencephalic-type projection neurons).

For group comparisons, we primarily used nonparametric tests. Except where indicated otherwise, for paired samples Wilcoxon’s signed rank was calculated with a minimum sample size of <italic>n</italic> = 6.

The conclusions are generally well supported and match expectations from previous studies of hand/forelimb circuits by this same group (Yamawaki et al., 2021), from the well-studied whisker tactile pathway to whisker S1 and M1, and from the corresponding pathway in primates. The study uses the novel approach of optogenetic stimulation of PV afferents in the periphery, which provides an impulse-like volley of peripheral spikes, which is useful for studying feedforward circuit dynamics. These are primarily proprioceptors, so results could differ for specific mechanoreceptor populations, but this is a reasonable tool to probe basic circuit activation. Mice are awake but not engaged in a somatosensory task, which is sufficient for the study goals.</p><p>The main results are: (1) brief peripheral activation drives brief sensory-evoked responses at ~ 15 ms latency in S1 and ~25 ms latency in M1, which is consistent with classical fast propagation on the subcortical pathway to S1, followed by slow propagation on the polysynaptic, non-myelinated pathway from S1 to M1; (2) each peripheral impulse evokes a triphasic activation-suppression-rebound response in both S1 and M1; (3) PV interneurons carry the major component of spike modulation for each of these phases; (4) activation of PV neurons in each area (M1 or S1) drives suppression and rebound both in the local area and in the other downstream area; (5) peripheral-evoked neural activity in M1 is at least partially dependent on transmission through S1.</p><p>All conclusions are well-supported and reasonably interpreted. There are no major new findings that were not expected from standard models of somatosensory pathways or from prior work in the whisker system.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-conducted and analyzed study in which the findings are clearly presented. The optogenetic sensory afferent stimulation method is novel and is well-suited for studying feedforward circuit dynamics. This study provides important baseline knowledge from which studies of more complex sensorimotor processing can build.</p><p>There are no further recommendations for the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.105112.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Piña Novo</surname><given-names>Daniela</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>Mang</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fisher</surname><given-names>Rita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Richevaux</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Jianing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Peking University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Beijing</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barrett</surname><given-names>John Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon MG</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Northwestern University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Building on previous in vitro synaptic circuit work (Yamawaki et al., eLife 10, 2021), Piña Novo et al. utilize an in vivo optogenetic-electrophysiological approach to characterize sensory-evoked spiking activity in the mouse's forelimb primary somatosensory (S1) and motor (M1) areas.

Overall, the study will be useful to those interested in forelimb S1-M1 interactions.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the results are clear and convincing, one weakness is that many results are consistent with previous studies in other sensorimotor systems, and thus not all that surprising. For example, the findings that sensory stimulation results in delayed and attenuated responses in M1 relative to S1 and that PV inhibitory cells in S1 are strongly recruited by sensory stimulation are not novel (e.g., Bruno et al., J Neurosci 22, 10966-10975, 2002; Swadlow, Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 357, 1717-1727, 2002; Gabernet et al., Neuron 48, 315-327, 2005; Cruikshank et al., Nat Neurosci 10, 462-468, 2007; Ferezou et al., Neuron 56, 907-923, 2007; Sreenivasan et al., Neuron 92, 1368-1382, 2016; Yu et al., Neuron 104, 412-427 e414, 2019). Furthermore, the observation that sensory processing in M1 depends upon activity in S1 is also not novel (e.g., Ferezou et al., Neuron 56, 907-923, 2007; Sreenivasan et al., Neuron 92, 1368-1382, 2016). The authors do a good job highlighting how their results are consistent with these previous studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the close reading of the manuscript and the many constructive comments and critiques. As the reviewer notes, there have been many prior studies of related circuits in other sensorimotor systems forming an important context for our study and findings, as we have tried to highlight. We appreciate the suggestions for additional relevant articles to cite.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps a more significant weakness, in my opinion, was the missing analyses given the rich dataset collected. For example, why lump all responsive units and not break them down based on their depth? Given superficial and deep layers respond at different latencies and have different response magnitudes and durations to sensory stimuli (e.g., L2/3 is much more sparse) (e.g., Constantinople et al., Science 340, 1591-1594, 2013; Manita et al., Neuron 86, 1304-1316, 2015; Petersen, Nat Rev Neurosci 20, 533-546, 2019; Yu et al., Neuron 104, 412-427 e414, 2019), their conclusions could be biased toward more active layers (e.g., L4 and L5). These additional analyses could reveal interesting similarities or important differences, increasing the manuscript's impact. Given the authors use high-density linear arrays, they should have this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have analyzed the activity patterns as a function of cortical depth, and now include these results in the manuscript as suggested. The key new finding is that the M1 responses are strongest in upper layers, consistent with expectations based on the excitatory corticocortical synaptic connectivity characterized previously. Changes to the manuscript include new figures (Figure 5; Figure 5 - figure supplement 1), which we explain (Methods: page 14, lines 618-621), describe (new Results section: pages 4-5, lines 183-189), comment on (Discussion: page 9, lines 378-391), and summarize the significance of (Abstract: page 1, lines 22-24). In addition, we incorporated the new laminar analysis into a summary schematic (Figure 9). We thank the reviewer for suggesting this analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, why not isolate and compare PV versus non-PV units in M1? They did the photostimulation experiments and presumably have the data. Recent in vitro work suggests PV neurons in the upper layers (L2/3) of M1 are strongly recruited by S1 (e.g., Okoro et al., J Neurosci 42, 8095-8112, 2022; Martinetti et al., Cerebral cortex 32, 1932-1949, 2022). Does the author's data support these in vitro observations?</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments were relatively complex and M1 optotagging was not routinely included in the stimulus and acquisition protocol. Therefore, we don’t have sufficient data for this analysis. We plan to address this in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would have also been interesting to suppress M1 while stimulating the hand to determine if any part of the S1 triphasic response depends on M1 feedback.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is of interest but consider this to be outside the scope of the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I appreciate the control experiment showing that optical hand stimulation did not evoke forelimb movement. However, this appears to be an N=1. How consistent was this result across animals, and how was this monitored in those animals? Can the authors say anything about digit movement?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed additional experiments to address this point. A constraint with EMG is that it is limited to the muscle(s) one chooses to record from, and it is difficult to implant tiny muscles of the hand. Therefore, for this analysis, we used kilohertz videography as a high-sensitivity method for movement surveillance across the hand. Hand stimulation did not evoke any detectable movements.

The conclusions are generally well supported, and match expectations from previous studies of hand/forelimb circuits by this same group (Yamawaki et al., 2021), from the well-studied whisker tactile pathway to whisker S1 and M1, and from the corresponding pathway in primates. The study uses the novel approach of optogenetic stimulation of PV afferents in the periphery, which provides an impulselike volley of peripheral spikes, which is useful for studying feedforward circuit dynamics. These are primarily proprioceptors, so results could differ for specific mechanoreceptor populations, but this is a reasonable tool to probe basic circuit activation. Mice are awake but not engaged in a somatosensory task, which is sufficient for the study goals.</p><p>The main results are:</p><p>(1) brief peripheral activation drives brief sensory-evoked responses at ~ 15 ms latency in S1 and ~25 ms latency in M1, which is consistent with classical fast propagation on the subcortical pathway to S1, followed by slow propagation on the polysynaptic, non-myelinated pathway from S1 to M1;</p><p>(2) each peripheral impulse evokes a triphasic activation-suppression-rebound response in both S1 and M1;</p><p>(3) PV interneurons carry the major component of spike modulation for each of these phases; (4) activation of PV neurons in each area (M1 or S1) drives suppression and rebound both in the local area and in the other downstream area;</p><p>(5) peripheral-evoked neural activity in M1 is at least partially dependent on transmission through S1.</p><p>All conclusions are well-supported and reasonably interpreted. There are no major new findings that were not expected from standard models of somatosensory pathways or from prior work in the whisker system.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a well-conducted and analyzed study in which the findings are clearly presented. This will provide important baseline knowledge from which studies of more complex sensorimotor processing can build.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A few minor issues should be addressed to improve clarity of presentation and interpretation:</p><p>(1) It is critical for interpretation that the stimulus does not evoke a motor response, which could induce reafference-based activity that could drive, or mask, some of the triphasic response. Figure S1 shows that no motor response is evoked for one example session, but this would be stronger if results were analyzed over several mice.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we have performed additional experiments to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The recordings combine single and multi-units, which is fine for measures of response modulation, but not for absolute evoked firing rate, which is only interpretable for single units. For example, evoked firing rate in S1 could be higher than M1, if spike sorting were more difficult in S1, resulting in a higher fraction of multi-units relative to M1. Because of this, if reporting of absolute firing rates is an essential component of the paper, Figs 3D and 4E should be recalculated just for single units.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for noting this. Although the absolute firing rates are not essential for the main findings or conclusions (which as noted focus on response modulations and relative differences) we agree that analyzing the single-unit response amplitudes is useful. Therefore, changes in the manuscript now include: revised Figure 3, and associated text edits in the Methods (page 12, lines 543-545), Results (page 3, lines 115-119), and Discussion (page 7, lines 305-311) sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In Figure 5B, the average light-evoked firing rate of PV neurons seems to come up before time 0, unlike the single-trial rasters above it. Presumably, this reflects binning for firing rate calculation. This should be corrected to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this reflects the binning. We agree that this is potentially confusing and have removed these average plots below the raster plots, as the rasters alone suffice to demonstrate the result (i.e., that PV units are strongly activated and thus tagged by optogenetic stimulation). Changes are now reflected in revised Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 6A bottom, please clarify what legends &quot;W. suppression&quot; and &quot;W. rebound&quot; mean.</p></disp-quote><p>In the figure plot legends, the “W.” has been removed.
