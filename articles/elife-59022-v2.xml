Mice are highly resistant to <italic>Shigella</italic> and the lack of a tractable physiological model of shigellosis has impeded our understanding of this important human disease. Here, we propose that the differential susceptibility of mice and humans to <italic>Shigella</italic> is due to mouse-specific activation of the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome. We find that NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice are highly susceptible to oral <italic>Shigella</italic> infection and recapitulate the clinical features of human shigellosis. Although inflammasomes are generally thought to promote <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis, we instead demonstrate that intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific NAIP–NLRC4 activity is sufficient to protect mice from shigellosis. In addition to describing a new mouse model of shigellosis, our results suggest that the lack of an inflammasome response in IECs may help explain the susceptibility of humans to shigellosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Shigella</kwd><kwd>shigellosis</kwd><kwd>inflammasome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI075039</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vance</surname><given-names>Russell E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI064285</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lesser</surname><given-names>Cammie F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitchell</surname><given-names>Patrick S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Irving H.

Oral streptomycin administration and other treatments facilitate <italic>Shigella</italic> colonization of the mouse intestinal lumen by ablating the natural colonization resistance provided by the microbiome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freter, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Q S Medeiros et al., 2019</xref>). However, antibiotic-treated mice do not present with key hallmarks of human disease, likely due to the failure of <italic>Shigella</italic> to invade and/or establish a replicative niche within the mouse intestinal epithelium.</p><p>Inflammasomes are cytosolic multi-protein complexes that initiate innate immune responses upon pathogen detection or cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rathinam and Fitzgerald, 2016</xref>). The NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome is activated when bacterial proteins, such as flagellin or the rod and needle proteins of the T3SS apparatus, are bound by NAIP family members. Importantly, the <italic>Shigella</italic> T3SS inner rod (MxiI) and needle (MxiH) proteins are both potent agonists of human and mouse NAIPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reyes Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). Activated NAIPs then co-assemble with NLRC4 to recruit and activate the Caspase-1 (CASP1) protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vance, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao and Shao, 2015</xref>). CASP1 then cleaves and activates the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18 and the pore-forming protein Gasdermin-D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kayagaki et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shi et al., 2015</xref>), initiating a lytic form of cell death called pyroptosis. We and others recently demonstrated that activation of NAIP–NLRC4 in IECs further mediates the cell-intrinsic expulsion of infected epithelial cells from the intestinal monolayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). In the context of <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, it is generally accepted that inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis of infected macrophages promotes pathogenesis by initiating inflammation, and by releasing bacteria from macrophages, allowing the bacteria to invade the basolateral side of intestinal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnupf and Sansonetti, 2019</xref>). However, it has not been possible to test the role of inflammasomes in the intestine after oral <italic>Shigella</italic> infection due to the lack of a genetically tractable model. Here, we develop the first oral infection mouse model for <italic>Shigella</italic> infection that recapitulates human disease, and demonstrate a specific host-protective function for inflammasomes in intestinal epithelial cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Shigella</italic> appears to suppress the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome</title><p>The <italic>Shigella</italic> T3SS effector OspC3 inhibits cytosolic LPS sensing by the human Caspase-4 (CASP4) inflammasome, but is reported not to bind to the mouse ortholog, Caspase-11 (CASP11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>). We reasoned that inflammasome inhibition may be a general strategy used by <italic>Shigella</italic> to establish infection, and that such inhibition might occur in a host-specific manner. To test this hypothesis, we compared inflammasome-dependent cell death following <italic>Shigella</italic> infection of mouse C57BL/6J (B6) bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and human PMA-differentiated THP1 cells. Infection with the wild-type (WT) <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> strain 2457T but not the avirulent BS103 strain (which lacks the virulence plasmid) resulted in CASP1-dependent cell death in both mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sandstrom et al., 2019</xref>) and human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Treatment of THP1 cells with LFn-MxiH+PA (‘NeedleTox’), but not PA alone, induced a CASP1- and NLRC4-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We also confirmed that <italic>Shigella</italic> MxiH and MxiI (rod) activate human NAIP–NLRC4 in a reconstituted inflammasome assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reyes Ruiz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tenthorey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results confirm that the <italic>Shigella</italic> rod and needle proteins are capable of activating the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome. Moreover, since we observe robust activation of NAIP–NLRC4 in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), our data indicate that the <italic>Shigella</italic> T3SS needle and rod proteins are delivered to the cytosol during infection. However, the presence of other inflammasomes in THP1 cells likely obscures our ability to determine if <italic>Shigella</italic> activates human NLRC4.</p><p>As a strategy to eliminate cell death induced by the AIM2 and PYRIN inflammasomes, we used THP1 <italic>AIM2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells treated with colchicine, an inhibitor of PYRIN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, WT <italic>Shigella</italic> infection did not induce pyroptosis of colchicine-treated <italic>AIM2</italic><sup>–/–</sup> THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, although human THP1 cells express functional NAIP–NLRC4, and <italic>Shigella</italic> rod and needle proteins can activate NAIP–NLRC4, we nevertheless observe no such activation during <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>Shigella</italic> might antagonize the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome. To test this hypothesis, <italic>AIM2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> colchicine-treated THP1 cells were either uninfected or infected with the <italic>Shigella</italic> WT or BS103 strains for 1 hr, and then treated with NeedleTox to induce NAIP–NLRC4-dependent cell death. Interestingly, NeedleTox-induced pyroptosis was significantly reduced in cells previously infected with WT but not avirulent BS103 <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As a control, treatment with nigericin, an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome, induced cell death similarly in cells that were uninfected or infected with either WT or BS103 <italic>Shigella</italic> strains. Thus, WT <italic>Shigella</italic> infection appears to specifically suppress activation of the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome in THP1 cells, leading us to hypothesize that NAIP–NLRC4 activation may be a mouse-specific mechanism of resistance to shigellosis. Future studies will be required to confirm these results with further genetic studies, and to address the mechanism of <italic>Shigella</italic> antagonism of human NAIP–NLRC4, as well as the mechanism of <italic>Shigella</italic> activation of AIM2 and/or PYRIN.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>B6.<italic>Naip</italic>-deficient mice are susceptible to shigellosis</title><p>The mouse NAIP–NLRC4 and CASP11 inflammasomes protect the intestinal epithelium from <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crowley et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the above experiments led us to hypothesize that the failure of <italic>Shigella</italic> to antagonize mouse inflammasomes might explain the inborne resistance of mice versus humans to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. A prediction from this hypothesis is that mice lacking inflammasomes might be susceptible to oral <italic>Shigella</italic> challenge. Previous studies have demonstrated that the intestinal microbiota of mice provides intrinsic colonization resistance to diverse enteric pathogens, including <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ducarmon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freter, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martino et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Q S Medeiros et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, to overcome this barrier, we pretreated B6 WT mice orally with streptomycin antibiotic. Consistent with prior studies, we found that antibiotic pre-treatment followed by oral infection allows for robust <italic>Shigella</italic> colonization of the intestinal lumen and feces compared to water-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these high lumenal bacterial loads (&gt;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/g feces) did not cause overt disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). To determine if inflammasomes contribute to the resistance of mice to <italic>Shigella</italic>, we orally challenged WT and <italic>Casp1/11<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice with 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of <italic>Shigella</italic>. CASP1 has been previously reported to drive acute inflammation and <italic>Shigella</italic> clearance during mouse lung infection via the processing and release of IL-1β and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sansonetti et al., 2000</xref>). Mice that lack CASP1 and/or CASP11 are also more susceptible to oral infection with <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crowley et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, B6 WT and <italic>Casp1/11<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice were similarly resistant to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection, showing no signs of intestinal inflammation or disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Thus, neither of the primary caspases associated with the canonical or non-canonical inflammasome are essential for resistance to <italic>Shigella</italic> in the mouse intestine. The NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome can recruit Caspase-8 (CASP8) in the absence of CASP1, an event which leads to non-lytic cell death and delayed IEC expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that this compensatory capacity of CASP8 may account for the resistance of <italic>Casp1/11<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Thus, to test directly if the mouse NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome mediates resistance to shigellosis, we orally infected streptomycin-pretreated B6 WT and ∆<italic>Naip</italic> mice with 5 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU of <italic>Shigella</italic>. ∆<italic>Naip</italic> mice (also called <italic>Naip1-6</italic><sup>∆/∆</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rauch et al., 2016</xref>) harbor a large chromosomal deletion that eliminates expression of all mouse <italic>Naip</italic> genes.

While ocular, pulmonary, and intraperitoneal <italic>Shigella</italic> infections have been used to assess bacterial virulence in mice, these models do not feature bacterial colonization of intestinal epithelial cells, a key event required for pathogenesis in humans. Thus, inflammasome-deficient mice provide the first physiologically relevant mouse model of bacillary dysentery. The genetic and immunological tractability of this system relative to other small animal oral infection models (rabbit, guinea pigs) should pave the way for detailed genetic and mechanistic <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of the host factors underlying <italic>Shigella</italic> pathogenesis that have long been elusive.</p><p>There remain key differences between orogastric <italic>Shigella</italic> infection of NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice and human infection. First, even genetically susceptible mice require oral antibiotic treatment to alter the mouse microbiome and allow <italic>Shigella</italic> to establish a replicative niche in the gut. However, this limitation is not unique to our <italic>Shigella</italic> model, as antibiotic pretreatment is a common practice in many mouse models of enteric bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barthel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becattini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou Ghanem et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S. sonnei</italic> encodes a type VI secretion system that mediates competition with other bacterial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>). This finding suggests that interbacterial interactions may also be an important selective pressure acting on <italic>Shigella</italic> in the human gut. An important next step will be to identify interactions between <italic>Shigella</italic> and the human versus mouse microbiome that define the species-specific differences in colonization resistance.</p><p>In our model, we were able to achieve shigellosis in mice inoculated with as few as 2 × 10<sup>4</sup> CFU. Although much is made of the low infectious dose of <italic>Shigella</italic> required to cause disease in humans, we note that experimental human infection studies only variably achieved disease with 100 CFU (39%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DuPont et al., 1969</xref>) and even higher inocula failed to cause disease in some individuals 10<sup>5</sup>–10<sup>8</sup> CFU (64%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DuPont et al., 1989</xref>). We also note that <italic>Shigella</italic> rapidly expands in the antibiotic-treated mouse gut regardless of starting inoculum, suggesting that there is a threshold dose required to establish infection, beyond which a larger inoculum may have little significance to the disease outcome. Ultimately, infectious dose during natural infections likely varies depending on a multitude of environmental and host factors. While many questions remain, our model now provides a means by which to dissect these key questions, which will allow future refinement and greater utility of the model to understand human infection and disease.</p><p>A long-held belief is that <italic>Shigella</italic> exploits inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis. Pyroptotic cell death is presumed to allow bacteria to escape macrophages and invade the basolateral surface of polarized enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnupf and Sansonetti, 2019</xref>). Although we do not directly address this possibility, our experiments suggest that <italic>Shigella</italic> has instead evolved to inhibit or evade the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome to limit intestinal epithelial cell death. Indeed, we find that the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome plays a critical role in host defense by restricting <italic>Shigella</italic> replication and spread in IECs. Further supporting this notion, only <italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> but not WT IEC organoid monolayers are permissive to <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Our data are consistent with the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome providing defense by coordinating the expulsion of <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected cells. Similarly, <italic>Salmonella</italic> infected IECs are expelled from the intestinal epithelial barrier in an NLRC4-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rauch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sellin et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, epithelial inflammasomes coordinate the expulsion of infected IECs as a general defense strategy against enteric bacterial pathogens. A non-mutually exclusive possibility is that NAIP–NLRC4 (or other inflammasomes) are required for <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion and or pathogenesis in non-IECs, including macrophages. Interestingly, in <italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice, IL-1β and KC levels in target tissues are elevated, indicating that <italic>Shigella</italic> may encounter multiple inflammasomes at distinct stages of infection with opposing consequences for bacterial replication and host pathogenesis.</p><p>We only observe bloody diarrhea in <italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice generated on the 129 genetic background. 129 mice naturally harbor a null <italic>Casp11</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kayagaki et al., 2011</xref>). Although other genetic differences may contribute to the variation in susceptibility to <italic>Shigella</italic> between B6 and 129 NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice, we speculate that both the NAIP–NLRC4 and the CASP11 inflammasomes mediate protection in IECs against <italic>Shigella</italic> invasion. However, the susceptibility of B6 NAIP–NLRC4-deficient (but CASP11<sup>+</sup>) mice, as well as the resistance of <italic>Casp1/11</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, suggest that these inflammasomes are not strictly redundant and that NAIP–NLRC4 alone is sufficient to confer resistance to shigellosis in mice. The <italic>Shigella</italic> effector OspC3 antagonizes the human LPS sensor CASP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>), and IEC-expressed CASP4 provides protection against other human bacterial pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holly et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Knodler et al., 2014</xref>), underscoring the importance of the LPS-sensing pathway during human infection. Similarly, our finding that <italic>Shigella</italic> appears to suppress the human NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome implies that evasion and/or antagonism of inflammasomes is a general virulence strategy during human infections.</p><p>There is currently no licensed <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccine, and very limited knowledge of what vaccine-induced immune responses would be desirable to elicit to mediate protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barry et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mani et al., 2016</xref>). Our new shigellosis model will finally allow the field to leverage the outstanding genetic and immunological tools and reagents in the mouse to address fundamental questions about the immune response to <italic>Shigella</italic>.

Ceca and colons from mice were isolated, cut longitudinally, removed of lumenal contents, swiss-rolled, and fixed in methacarn followed by transfer to 70% ethanol. Samples were processed by routine histologic methods on an automated tissue processor (TissueTek, Sakura), embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 4 µm thickness on a rotary microtome, and mounted on glass slides. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin on an automated histostainer and coverslipped. Histopathological evaluation was performed by light microscopy (Olympus BX45, Olympus Corporation) at magnifications ranging from x20 to x600 by a board-certified veterinary pathologist (I.L.B.) who was blinded to the experimental groups at the time of evaluation. Representative images were generated as Tiff files from digitized histology slides scanned on a digital slide scanner (Leica Aperio AT2, Leica Biosystems). Images were taken using freely downloadable software (Image Scope, Leica Aperio, Leica Biosystems) and processed in Adobe Photoshop. Photo processing was confined to global adjustments of image size, white balance, contrast, brightness, sharpness, or correction of lens distortion and did not alter the interpretation of the image. Sample preparation, imaging, and histology scoring was conducted by the Unit for Laboratory Animal Medicine at the University of Michigan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Intestinal CFU determination</title><p>To enumerate whole tissue intestinal CFU, ceca and colons from mice were isolated, cut longitudinally and removed of lumenal contents, placed in culture tubes containing 400 µg/mL gentamicin antibiotic in PBS, vortexed, and incubated in this solution for 1–2 hr. Organs were washed five times in PBS to dilute the gentamicin, homogenized in 1 mL of PBS, serially diluted, and plated on TSB agar plates containing 0.01% CR and 100 µg/mL streptomycin.

Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger.

These are important findings and provide an opportunity to further advance the field in ways not previously possible. However, there are areas where the in vitro and in vivo data presented contradict each other, and there are inconsistencies with previously published work by the authors. In addition, with the development of the new mouse model being a major highlight of this manuscript, significantly more detail and discussion must be added to explain this mouse model. Therefore, the reviewers are requesting a major revision to the text of the manuscript to address these concerns, as detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Since the authors are presenting the paper largely as the first published mouse model for shigellosis, it is important to discuss the model's caveats for the benefit of others who may wish to utilize this model, as well as emphasize how much more there is to learn. A more in depth discussion about the differences between human <italic>Shigella</italic> infection and the new model would be helpful. It is important to emphasize that the mouse model requires a much greater inoculum of the pathogen to induce disease and requires microbiota-deficiency to be effective. What are the implications of this finding on our understanding of human disease? The authors present the inhibition of human NAIP–NLRC4 as the main factor that effects the difference in infection between humans and mice but a high innolcum (5 x 10(7) cfu/mouse compared to approx. 100 cfu for humans) is still required in addition to streptomycin treatment. It is not discussed whether any refinement of these procedures was attempted or why such a high inoculum and streptomycin treatment is still required. Presumably microbiota differences in addition to <italic>Naip</italic>-/<italic>Nlrc4</italic> is an important species specific determinant of infection, hence the streptomycin treatment.</p><p>2) In the second paragraph of the Discussion the authors present an either/or scenario in which either macrophage pyroptosis is required for IEC infection or inhibition of NAIP–NRLC4 pyroptosis in IECs is required for IEC infection. However, these scenarios are not mutually exclusive. For example, it is plausible that the extremely low burdens of <italic>Shigella</italic> required to infect humans (&lt;100 CFUs) is due to the pathogen initially crossing the epithelial barrier (e.g. through M-cells) to infect macrophage, and then re-infection of IECs after macrophage pyroptosis. In this scenario, the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome could prevent further expansion of bacterial in IECs by eliminating the cell-to-cell spread that have been described by others. Importantly, the macrophage lifecycle stage may not be necessary in mice in which the microbiota has been removed and <italic>Shigella</italic> is delivered at a very high inoculum. While, additional ideas could be, and should be, put forth since the mouse model provides new insights or challenges an existing dogma in the field.</p><p>3) Many questions remain concerning why NLRC4-deficient THP1 cells still undergo pyroptosis. The authors provide evidence that <italic>Shigella</italic> activates PYRIN and/or AIM2 inflammasomes in humans, and that somehow mouse macrophages would fail to have this same detection. At face value, the data would suggest that humans are able to detect <italic>Shigella</italic> by PYRIN and AIM2, but for some reason these two inflammasomes are insufficient, and instead NLRC4 is required for in vivo defense. Then in mice, it would imply that everything is flipped – for some reason detection by PYRIN and AIM2 is not important, but now the bacteria can be detected by NLRC4 and this is important. The NLRC4 focused conclusions are consistent with the in vivo data, that NLRC4 in humans fails to detect, but NLRC4 in mice succeeds in detecting <italic>Shigella</italic>. However, the data that PYRIN and AIM2 in human cells successfully detect <italic>Shigella</italic> are inconsistent with the overall conclusions of the paper. I suspect that this is an artifact of THP1 cells, and that the in vivo situation in humans is that these two inflammasomes will fail to detect <italic>Shigella</italic>. There is published precedent from other infections where in vitro detection belies in vivo lack of detection (e.g. <italic>Listeria</italic> is detected by AIM2 in vitro, but probably not <italic>in vivo</italic>). It may be difficult to make direct comparisons between how inflammasomes act in THP1 cells as compared to BMMs, due to artifacts arising from the different origins and passage levels of the two cell types. It may be that the inflammasomes response is most important in IECs, as proposed by the authors, and that IECs may not express PYRIN or AIM2. There is evidence from publicly available IEC transcriptional profiles that IECs do not express PYRIN (<italic>Mefv</italic>) (Reikvam, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017996), although this profile does show AIM2 expression in IEC. As it stands, the in vitro data appear to contradict one of the main conclusions of the paper, because it would seem that human PYRIN and AIM2 inflammasomes can detect <italic>Shigella</italic>, and so these should compensate for NLRC4. The explanation as to why PYRIN and AIM2 are insufficient to compensate for NLRC4 evasion in human infection should be addressed at least in discussions of the data to explain the apparent discrepancy.</p><p>4) The overall message of this manuscript directly contradicts the authors prior paper in Science just last year. They found that the <italic>Shigella</italic> effector IpaH7.8 directly and specifically ubiquitinates the mouse NLRP1B inflammasome, leading to activation of that inflammasome.

A more in depth discussion about the differences between human Shigella infection and the new model would be helpful. It is important to emphasize that the mouse model requires a much greater inoculum of the pathogen to induce disease and requires microbiota-deficiency to be effective. What are the implications of this finding on our understanding of human disease? The authors present the inhibition of human NAIP–NLRC4 as the main factor that effects the difference in infection between humans and mice but a high innolcum (5 x 10(7) cfu/mouse compared to approx. 100 cfu for humans) is still required in addition to streptomycin treatment. It is not discussed whether any refinement of these procedures was attempted or why such a high inoculum and streptomycin treatment is still required. Presumably microbiota differences in addition to naip-/nlrc4 is an important species specific determinant of infection, hence the streptomycin treatment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the infectious dose in humans vs. mice merits more discussion in a revised manuscript. We used a dose of 5x10<sup>7</sup> CFU in our manuscript to ensure reproducible infection of all mice. Although it is often (correctly) stated that as few as 10-100 bacteria <italic>can</italic> infect humans with <italic>Shigella</italic>, there is actually considerable heterogeneity in the infectious dose. DuPont et al., 1989, summarizes several human challenge studies in their Table 1, which shows that while 25-39% of humans exhibit symptoms after low dose infection (&lt;200 CFU), 36-44% of humans are resistant to high doses (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>8</sup> CFU). Thus we do not consider the infectious dose in our mouse model to be out of the range of what is ‘normal’ in humans. Indeed, our new model may help us understand some of the factors that confer resistance to certain humans.</p><p>That being said, we have now conducted experiments to address the necessary infectious dose in our model, using inoculums of 2x10<sup>4</sup>, 2x10<sup>5</sup>, and 2x10<sup>6</sup> in NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice compared to 2x10<sup>6</sup> in WT mice. We observed fully penetrant disease in NAIP–NLRC4-deficient mice inoculated with as few as 2x10<sup>4</sup> CFU. These data are included in a new Figure 8. We also observed that <italic>Shigella</italic> markedly expands in the antibiotic-cleared gut lumen, regardless of the starting inoculum, as early as 1d post-infection (Figure 8A), suggesting that there is a threshold dose above which the outcomes are largely similar.</p><p>Antibiotic pre-treatment is a common feature of many mouse models for enteric pathogens, including a very widely used model of <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection, but we agree this is important to highlight and have now added discussion to the manuscript to call attention to this point. We hope that this satisfies the concern of the reviewers regarding inoculum.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the second paragraph of the Discussion the authors present an either/or scenario in which either macrophage pyroptosis is required for IEC infection or inhibition of NAIP–NRLC4 pyroptosis in IECs is required for IEC infection. However, these scenarios are not mutually exclusive. For example, it is plausible that the extremely low burdens of Shigella required to infect humans (&lt;100 CFUs) is due to the pathogen initially crossing the epithelial barrier (e.g. through M-cells) to infect macrophage, and then re-infection of IECs after macrophage pyroptosis. In this scenario, the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome could prevent further expansion of bacterial in IECs by eliminating the cell-to-cell spread that have been described by others. Importantly, the macrophage lifecycle stage may not be necessary in mice in which the microbiota has been removed and Shigella is delivered at a very high inoculum. While, additional ideas could be, and should be, put forth since the mouse model provides new insights or challenges an existing dogma in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We do clearly state in our manuscript (Discussion, fourth paragraph) that our results do not directly address the question of whether <italic>Shigella</italic> might benefit from inflammasome activation in macrophages. In the revised version of the manuscript we have further expanded on the discussion of the role of inflammasomes in macrophages and IECs to acknowledge multiple, non-mutually exclusive scenarios. We have also now measured cytokines from tissue and find that IL-1β is elevated in <italic>Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (Figure 3F). We now also discuss the possibility that, in the absence of NAIP–NLRC4, the elevated IL-1β reflects inflammasome activation in <italic>Shigella</italic>-infected macrophages on the basolateral side of the gut epithelium.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Many questions remain concerning why NLRC4-deficient THP1 cells still undergo pyroptosis. The authors provide evidence that Shigella activates PYRIN and/or AIM2 inflammasomes in humans, and that somehow mouse macrophages would fail to have this same detection. At face value, the data would suggest that humans are able to detect Shigella by PYRIN and AIM2, but for some reason these two inflammasomes are insufficient, and instead NLRC4 is required for in vivo defense. Then in mice, it would imply that everything is flipped – for some reason detection by PYRIN and AIM2 is not important, but now the bacteria can be detected by NLRC4 and this is important. The NLRC4 focused conclusions are consistent with the in vivo data, that NLRC4 in humans fails to detect, but NLRC4 in mice succeeds in detecting Shigella. However, the data that PYRIN and AIM2 in human cells successfully detect Shigella are inconsistent with the overall conclusions of the paper. I suspect that this is an artifact of THP1 cells, and that the in vivo situation in humans is that these two inflammasomes will fail to detect Shigella. There is published precedent from other infections where in vitro detection belies in vivo lack of detection (e.g. Listeria is detected by AIM2 in vitro, but probably not in vivo). It may be difficult to make direct comparisons between how inflammasomes act in THP1 cells as compared to BMMs, due to artifacts arising from the different origins and passage levels of the two cell types. It may be that the inflammasomes response is most important in IECs, as proposed by the authors, and that IECs may not express PYRIN or AIM2. There is evidence from publicly available IEC transcriptional profiles that IECs do not express PYRIN (Mefv) (Reikvam, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0017996), although this profile does show AIM2 expression in IEC. As it stands, the in vitro data appear to contradict one of the main conclusions of the paper, because it would seem that human PYRIN and AIM2 inflammasomes can detect Shigella, and so these should compensate for NLRC4. The explanation as to why PYRIN and AIM2 are insufficient to compensate for NLRC4 evasion in human infection should be addressed at least in discussions of the data to explain the apparent discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer states that our data that human PYRIN and AIM2 inflammasomes can detect <italic>Shigella</italic> in THP1 cells are “inconsistent” or “appear to contradict” the overall conclusion of our paper, which is that the NLRC4 inflammasome provides necessary defense of mouse intestinal epithelial cells. For reasons explained below, we do not agree that there is an inconsistency or contradiction and indeed many of the points the reviewer makes in their comments fit with our view, so perhaps there is less disagreement than it might seem. As the reviewer discusses, differences in inflammasome expression in humans vs. mice, and in IECs vs. macrophages vs. THP1 cells, and the kinetics of inflammasome responses, as well as several other factors, can easily account for the results we obtain. It appears that PYRIN is not well expressed in mouse IECs (Price et al., 2016), at least not uniformly at levels in all cells that are sufficient to confer protection. AIM2 is expressed in colonic IECs (Price et al., 2016), but it is not clear that it would be engaged in every infected IEC. For example, AIM2 detects bacterial DNA, which might only be released if the <italic>Shigella</italic> bacteria lysed in the cytosol. As noted by the reviewer, this may be a relatively rare event, as previously documented for AIM2 activation by <italic>Listeria</italic>-infected macrophages (Sauer JD et al., 2010). AIM2 activation may also be kinetically delayed in IECs.</p><p>It appears instead that NLRC4 is the main inflammasome that can respond to <italic>Shigella</italic> in mouse IECs; thus loss of NLRC4 is sufficient to lead to susceptibility of mice. It remains possible that there is some functional AIM2 or PYRIN (or CASP11 or NLRP1B) in mouse IECs; thus, the further removal of these inflammasomes might lead to even greater susceptibility. Alternatively, a low level of activation mediated by these additional inflammasomes (perhaps in macrophages instead of in IECs) might even be necessary to produce the inflammation that causes disease symptoms.</p><p>In humans, consistent with our data in Figure 1, we propose that the NLRC4 inflammasome is antagonized or otherwise evaded by <italic>Shigella</italic>. The reviewer wonders why PYRIN or AIM2 cannot compensate for NLRC4, and is suspicious that the activation of PYRIN/AIM2 we observe in THP1 cells is not representative of what would occur in vivo. Certainly we agree that THP1 cells are non-physiological and we do not attempt to make claims in the manuscript that our observation of AIM2/PYRIN activity in these cells means anything for human shigellosis.</p><p>The reviewer states: “the in vitro data [in THP1 cells] appear to contradict one of the main conclusions of the paper, because it would seem that human Pyrin and AIM2 inflammasomes can detect <italic>Shigella</italic>, and so these should compensate for NLRC4.” For all the reasons discussed above, we do not agree there is a contradiction. There are many reasons why PYRIN and AIM2 might function in THP1 cells (and possibly even human macrophages) but would not compensate for NLRC4 in IECs.</p><p>In sum, we agree that there is more to learn about which inflammasomes, if any, are activated by <italic>Shigella</italic> in human IECs, but given the many uncertainties, we do not feel it is fair to say that our results are internally contradictory. We now discuss some of these points in a revised manuscript.</p><p>We would also like to share new data with the reviewers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We have now made <italic>MEFV/AIM2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> THP-1 cells (<italic>MEFV</italic> is the gene encoding PYRIN). We find that <italic>Shigella</italic>-induced cell death and IL-1β levels in <italic>MEFV/AIM<sup>–/–</sup></italic> is greatly reduced, suggesting that MEFV and AIM2 are responsible for the cell death in <italic>Shigella</italic> infected cells. This also supports the idea that the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome is inactive during <italic>Shigella</italic> infection. Moreover, repeating the suppression assay in <italic>MEFV/AIM<sup>–/–</sup></italic> clearly demonstrates that NeedleTox fails to activate the NAIP–NLRC4 inflammasome following infection with WT but not BS103 <italic>Shigella</italic>. However, because we were only able to generate a single DKO clonal line, we are being cautious in our interpretation and would not like to publish these data at the present time. We also concede that the discussion of Figure 1E, and the use of chemical inhibitors instead of genetic knockouts, limits our ability to make firm conclusions. We thus word our discussion of these data very cautiously and directly state that further follow up work will be required. The main purpose in our view is simply to set up the hypothesis that if there is a species-specific function of NLRC4 in restriction of <italic>Shigella</italic>, then loss of NLRC4 should render mice susceptible to <italic>Shigella</italic> – a hypothesis that the rest of the paper then addresses.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59022-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The overall message of this manuscript directly contradicts the authors prior paper in <italic>Science</italic> just last year. They found that the <italic>Shigella</italic> effector IpaH7.8 directly and specifically ubiquitinates the mouse NLRP1B inflammasome, leading to activation of that inflammasome. How can the loss of NLRC4 be so important when mice still retain NLRP1B which the authors previously published to detect Shigella? Is this due to differences between murine NLRP1 alleles? This should be discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the assertion that our current findings contradict our prior paper in <italic>Science</italic>. IpaH7.8 exclusively activates the 129 variant of mouse NLRP1B. Thus, we would not expect NLRP1B to play a role on the B6 background. We also note that it is currently unknown whether or not <italic>Nlrp1b</italic> is functional in IECs in 129 or B6 mice. Interestingly, CASP11, which is known to be both expressed and functional in IECs, does not compensate for a loss of NLRC4. Thus, the presence of a functional inflammasome (whether it be NLRP1B or CASP11) may not necessarily compensate for the function of NAIP–NLRC4 in IECs. As has been pointed out by the reviewers, it may also be possible that <italic>Shigella</italic> utilizes inflammasome activation in macrophages, a possibility that our current manuscript does not address. Thus, NLRP1B in macrophages may respond to <italic>Shigella</italic> and promote the more pronounced phenotype we observe on the 129 background. These are follow up questions that we are working on but we do not feel they are directly relevant to establish the claims of the current manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the subsection “Shigella causes bloody diarrheal disease in 129.Nlrc4<sup>–/–</sup> mice&quot;, the authors say that no blood was seen in B6 background, but they do not present direct data or discuss whether this statement arises from macroscopic examination (which would be unable to detect low level bleeding).
