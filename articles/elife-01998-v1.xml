Unlike most kinases, GSK-3 is controlled by inhibition rather than by specific activation. In the insulin and several other signaling pathways, phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of GSK-3 generates an auto-inhibitory peptide. In contrast, Wnt/β-catenin signal transduction requires phosphorylation of Ser/Pro rich sequences present in the Wnt co-receptors LRP5/6, and these motifs inhibit GSK-3 activity. We present crystal structures of GSK-3 bound to its phosphorylated N-terminus and to two of the phosphorylated LRP6 motifs. A conserved loop unique to GSK-3 undergoes a dramatic conformational change that clamps the bound pseudo-substrate peptides, and reveals the mechanism of primed substrate recognition. The structures rationalize target sequence preferences and suggest avenues for the design of inhibitors selective for a subset of pathways regulated by GSK-3.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01998.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01998.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to be able to respond to changes in the body, such as changes in hormone levels or the arrival of a pathogen such as a virus. Proteins acting in signaling pathways—where one protein switches ‘on’ or ‘off’ the next protein in the pathway—allow the detection of different changes or signals to be translated in the appropriate response.</p><p>The properties of a protein often depend on its shape, and many proteins change shape when they are switched ‘on’ and ‘off’. Moreover, the ability to change shape allows a protein to interact with many other proteins and to be involved in many different signaling pathways.</p><p>The enzyme GSK-3 is a protein that is involved in several pathways, and it controls other proteins by adding chemical tags, called phosphate groups, to them. Unlike many other enzymes, GSK-3’s default state is to be permanently switched on, and it can be switched off in a number of different ways. When a cell detects the hormone insulin, for example, another enzymes adds a phosphate group to a site near one end of GSK-3 to switch it off. Alternatively, when a cell recognises a different signaling molecule, called Wnt, a phosphate group is added to yet another protein, which then binds to and switches off GSK-3.</p><p>To explore the workings of GSK-3 in greater detail, Stamos et al. solved the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme that had been switched off in these two ways. In the insulin pathway, the region near to one end of GSK-3 that contains the added phosphate group was shown to bind to and block the site on the enzyme that usually binds to its target (i.e., to the next protein in the signaling pathway). In the Wnt pathway, remarkably, the same site on GSK-3 was blocked in a very similar way by the piece of the other protein with the phosphate group added.</p><p>GSK-3 is a potential drug target for the treatment of several diseases, such as diabetes and neurological disorders. However, as this enzyme is involved in multiple pathways, it has been hard to find drugs to treat any one condition without side effects. Uncovering subtle differences in how GSK-3 can be controlled in different pathways could, in the future, help with efforts to develop more specific drugs to target GSK-3 to treat these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01998.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01998.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>GSK-3</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>protein kinase</kwd><kwd>LRP6</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM56169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>William I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG39420</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weis</surname><given-names>William I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007276</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Enos</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chu</surname><given-names>Matthew Ling-Hon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Niket</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phosphorylation of the Wnt receptor LRP6 directly inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 by acting as a pseudosubstrate that stabilizes an active conformation of the enzyme, identical to autoinhibition by phosphorylation of its N terminus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a highly conserved kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ali et al., 2001</xref>) that in higher animals functions in insulin signaling, microtubule regulation, inflammatory pathways, and developmental programs including Hedgehog, Notch and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jope and Johnson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). GSK-3 has two isoforms in vertebrates, α and β, that share 97% identity in their catalytic cores but have different N- and C-terminal extensions. GSK-3 prefers pre-phosphorylated substrates, termed ‘primed’ substrates, with a phosphorylated serine or threonine residue at the position 4 residues C-terminal (P+4) to the serine or threonine to be phosphorylated (P+0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiol et al., 1987</xref>). Over 70 P+4 primed substrates for GSK-3 have been identified and confirmed as true biological GSK-3 targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutherland, 2011</xref>). GSK-3 is a potential therapeutic target for diabetes and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amar et al., 2011</xref>), but its diversity of substrates complicates efforts to target a specific function.</p><p>The overall structure of the GSK-3 catalytic domain is similar to other protein kinases, containing an N-terminal lobe composed primarily of β-strands in a β barrel conformation, and a C-terminal lobe composed mostly of α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ter Haar et al., 2001</xref>). At the interface of the N- and C- lobes, the C-helix and activation loop of GSK-3 form the putative substrate-binding site and help to position residues involved in the binding of ATP and substrate catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ter Haar et al., 2001</xref>). Crystal structures of GSK-3 obtained in the absence of nucleotide and/or peptide substrate reveal an ordered activation loop similar in conformation to that found in other kinases when the loop is phosphorylated. GSK-3 also shows no evidence for movements of the C-helix critical for positioning of catalytically important residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jura et al., 2011</xref>). GSK-3 can be phosphorylated at a tyrosine (Tyr216) on its activation loop, which increases enzymatic activity approximately fivefold, a modest increase compared to the activation of other kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>GSK-3 differs from most kinases in that it is constitutively active and controlled by inhibition, rather than by specific activation conferred by phosphorylation of the activation loop. Phosphorylation of a serine present in a conserved sequence near the amino terminus of the protein (Ser9 in GSK-3β) is the major regulatory checkpoint in most pathways, including insulin signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>). For example, in the absence of Ser9 phosphorylation, GSK-3 phosphorylates glycogen synthase and renders it less active, and inactivates eIF2B. Binding of insulin to its cell surface receptor results in the activation of the kinase AKT/PKB, which phosphorylates the conserved N-terminal peptide, resulting in increased glycogen and protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cross et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frame and Cohen, 2001</xref>). The phosphorylated sequence, designated here as the pS9 peptide, is thought to auto-inhibit GSK-3 by acting as a pseudo-substrate that blocks binding of other substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frame et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>GSK-3 also plays a critical role in the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Binding of a Wnt growth factor to its cell surface receptors Frizzled and LRP5/6 results in the stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin and activation of target genes. In the absence of Wnt, β-catenin is found in a ‘destruction complex’ that includes GSK-3, casein kinase 1 (CK1), the Adenomatous Polyposis Coli protein, and Axin. Axin has binding sites for β-catenin, GSK-3 and CK1, and thereby scaffolds efficient phosphorylation of the N-terminus of β-catenin, which marks β-catenin for ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stamos and Weis, 2013</xref>). The association with Axin sequesters a fraction of cytosolic GSK-3 in the destruction complex, which likely prevents interactions with regulatory proteins not involved in Wnt signaling, including kinases that target Ser9. Mutation of GSK-3β Ser9 does not affect Wnt signaling, and this residue does not become phosphorylated during Wnt stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ding et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McManus et al., 2005</xref>). Although isoform-specific roles have been observed in other pathways (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McManus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Patel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaidanovich-Beilin et al., 2009</xref>]), GSK-3α and β function redundantly in Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doble et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Upon Wnt activation, Axin-bound GSK-3 translocates to the plasma membrane, where phosphorylated peptide repeat motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of the activated LRP5/6 receptor interact with the β-catenin destruction complex to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>). The five repeats, designated a-e, have the consensus sequence P-P-P-S/T-P-X-S/T, where each of the S/T residues becomes phosphorylated in response to Wnt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Niehrs and Shen, 2010</xref>). Several kinases, including GSK-3 itself, may be responsible for phosphorylating the first Ser/Thr residue of the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zeng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cervenka et al., 2011</xref>). Phosphorylation of this site forms a primed substrate recognition sequence for CK1, which then phosphorylates the second Ser/Thr residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davidson et al., 2005</xref>). Current models suggest that the phospho-LRP6 motifs can directly inhibit GSK-3 phosphorylation of β-catenin by engaging the kinase as a pseudo-substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2013a</xref>). Although both phosphorylation sites in the consensus motif appear to be required for biological activity, only the first site is necessary for LRP6 to inhibit GSK-3 enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, the five repeats function cooperatively in LRP6, as removing any single motif from LRP6 results in significant decreases in Wnt signaling capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDonald et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge has been to understand how GSK-3 is controlled such that its effects in one pathway are insulated from others. Some specificity is achieved through association with pathway-specific scaffolding proteins that bind GSK-3 and its substrate, such as the β-catenin destruction complex, which sequester GSK-3 from other pathways and lead to highly efficient phosphorylation. However, the inhibition by the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic domain demonstrates that other modes of inhibition can operate. We set out to assess the mechanistic similarities and differences between inhibition by N-terminal phosphorylation and inhibition mediated by the phosphorylated LRP5/6 motifs.</p><p>There are only a handful of crystal structures of kinases bound to peptide substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Madhusudan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hubbard, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lowe et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lippa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lopez-Ramos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soundararajan et al., 2013</xref>), and only one, a tyrosine kinase, with a primed substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davis et al., 2009</xref>). Here we show that the auto-inhibitory pS9 peptide sequence and the inhibitory LRP6 c- and e-motifs all bind to GSK-3 as pseudo-substrates. Unique to GSK-3, binding is associated with a drastic conformational rearrangement of a highly conserved loop that engages the inhibitory peptides in a clamp-like structure. Peptide binding promotes a conformation of a glycine-rich loop that is associated with catalytic activity in other protein kinases. The LRP6 peptide complexes support a model in which phosphorylated receptor acts to inhibit GSK-3 directly and thereby promote β-catenin stabilization. The interactions between GSK-3 and the different inhibitory peptides help to explain substrate sequence preferences. The remodeling of the enzyme around peptide substrates suggests novel avenues for the development of GSK-3 inhibitors specific to particular pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phosphorylated LRP6 repeat motif inhibits GSK-3 more strongly than the phosphorylated GSK-3 N-terminus</title><p>Inhibition constants of approximately 700 µM and 13 µM have been reported for the pS9 auto-inhibitory peptide and LRP6 a-motif peptide (NPPPpSPApTERSH), respectively, but these were measured with different substrates and with different assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>). To compare the inhibitory activity of these two peptides directly in the same experimental system, we used a primed peptide substrate from eIF2B (peIF2B) that contains a single phosphorylation site, to avoid complications arising from processive phosphorylation of multiple sites present in many GSK-3 substrates, including glycogen synthase and β-catenin.

In the LRP6 inhibitory peptide complexes, residues <sup>1569</sup>PPPpTPR of the c-motif or <sup>1604</sup>PPPpSPC of the e-motif are visible; the second phosphorylation site in these peptides is disordered and we were not able to ascertain whether it is phosphorylated in the crystallized protein.</p><p>The pSer/pThr in the primed P+4 position of all three inhibitors binds to the site predicted from peptide-free structures that contain phosphate or sulfonate groups in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ter Haar et al., 2001</xref>). Arg96, Arg180 and Lys205 form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–E</xref>). In the inhibitor-free structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), these basic residues form hydrogen bonds with a molecule of glycerol present in the phosphate-binding site, and a previous structure of GSK-3 bound to a non-hydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP shows that water molecules occupy this site (PDB 1PYX; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertrand et al., 2003</xref>). These observations suggest that the primed P+4 phosphate-binding site is essentially pre-formed in the enzyme.</p><p>As in other kinases, the activation loop region (residues 200–226) forms part of the binding site for substrate peptides. In addition to the basic side chains noted above, the backbone amide of Val214 also forms a hydrogen bond with the phosphate in the priming site. To accommodate the backbone of the inhibitory peptides, the side chain of Val214 adopts a rotamer that avoids steric clash with the phosphate. Residues in the P+1, P+2, and P+3 positions (Arg-Thr-Thr in the pS9 peptide, or Pro-Pro-Pro in the LRP6 c- and e-motif peptides) form an arch over the conserved Ile217, and the P+1 residue packs against Tyr216 (discussed in more detail below). In addition to these interactions, the LRP6 peptide complexes also reveal a water-mediated connection between the backbone carbonyl oxygens of the P+2 proline and Tyr216.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The C-loop undergoes a large conformational change upon inhibitory peptide binding</title><p>Comparison of the inhibited and peptide substrate-free GSK-3 structures shows that the loop immediately preceding the C-helix, designated here as the C-loop, undergoes a large movement toward the C-terminal lobe of the kinase and clamps down on top of the bound pS9 or LRP6 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The α-carbon of residue Phe93, which lies at the tip of the loop, moves 8.5 Å relative to substrate-free structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In peptide substrate-free GSK-3 crystal structures, many of the side chains in the C-loop are disordered, and the loop has relatively high temperature factors, indicating conformational flexibility. It should be noted that crystals of GSK-3 grown in the absence of Axin have lattice contacts that would not allow the C-loop to adopt the conformation observed here (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dajani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">ter Haar et al., 2001</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes in GSK-3 upon inhibitor peptide binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Superposition of α-carbon traces of GSK-3 structures.

Directly adjacent to the C-loop, Leu88 is pulled toward the inhibitory peptide, and Tyr127 moves downward and sits on top of Leu88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These movements are transmitted along the corresponding β strands to which these residues attach, which also shift slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This shift of the β-sheet includes the glycine-rich loop that sits above the nucleotide.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The inhibitor peptides promote a catalytically competent conformation of the glycine-rich loop</title><p>In crystal structures of GSK-3 lacking an inhibitory peptide, the glycine-rich loop of the N-terminal lobe, comprising residues 62–70, adopts a position similar to that observed in the crystal structure of PKA bound to AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Narayana et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) In contrast, in both the pS9 peptide and LRP6 e-motif complexes we observe an additional, partially occupied conformation of the glycine-rich loop in which the loop has moved toward the ADP molecule and away from the rest of the N-terminal lobe, with the backbone amide of Ser66 moving by 4 Å compared to the peptide-free structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). This lower conformation could not be modeled in the LRP6 c-motif complex, although the refined Fo-Fc electron density suggests that it may be present at very low occupancy.

Phe67 packs against the threonine at the P+2 residue of the pS9 peptide, and although Ser66 and Phe67 are poorly ordered in the LRP6 c- and e-motif complexes, modeling them in the same position as that observed in the pS9 complex shows that Phe67 can pack against the P+2 proline of the LRP6 peptides. Mutation of GSK-3β Phe67 to alanine severely impairs catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ilouz et al., 2006</xref> and MDE, data not shown), suggesting that the packing of this residue against the substrate peptide is important for stabilizing a catalytically active conformation.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Conformational change of the glycine-rich loop upon inhibitor peptide binding.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Left panel</italic>: superposition of α-carbon traces of five selected GSK-3 structures.

The trigonal planar AlF<sub>3</sub> molecule is coordinated by an ADP β-phosphate oxygen, as predicted for AlF<sub>3</sub> mimicking the transition state of an in-line attack on the Ser/Thr residue of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madhusudan et al., 2002</xref>), and the lower conformation of the glycine-rich loop is well defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Despite the slightly lower resolution of this structure (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), the glycine-rich loop adopts the same conformation as that in the pS9 and LRP6 e-motif complexes, indicating that the presence of ADP and peptide inhibitor stabilize this conformation.</p><p>The structural and mutational data strongly suggest that the inhibitory peptides bind as true pseudo-substrates and stabilize a catalytically competent conformation. The partial occupancy of the lower glycine-rich loop conformation, along with the disorder of residues 65–67 in the LRP6 complexes, is consistent with NMR studies of PKA, which show that the glycine-rich loop is relatively ordered in the upper conformation in the absence of peptide substrate, whereas it becomes more dynamic when the peptide is bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masterson et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2011</xref>).</p><p>In the structures of GSK-3 bound to both ADP and pseudo-substrate peptides, the formation of the lower glycine-rich loop conformation occurs in the absence of a γ-phosphate on ATP or a transition-state mimic, but appears to be further stabilized by AlF<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). The interaction between Phe67 and the P+2 residue of a substrate, and the movement of the β strand adjacent to the glycine-rich loop that occurs when the C-loop engages the substrate peptide, may favor the lower conformation of the glycine-rich loop seen here. For example, Phe67 is found in several positions in peptide inhibitor-free GSK-3 structures, and some of them (e.g., PDB 1PYX) would clash with the C-loop in the peptide-bound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We conclude that binding of the pseudo-substrate itself favors the lower glycine-rich loop conformation in GSK-3, which strongly suggests that true substrates also favor this loop conformation and thereby promote catalysis (summarized in <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Unlike PKA, however, substrate binding requires a significant conformational rearrangement of the C-loop in the N-terminal lobe.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-01998-media1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.009</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Conformational changes in GSK-3 associated with peptide substrate binding.</title><p>The video shows the ADP and Axin-bound enzyme changing between the inhibitor-free and pS9-bound states.

The P+1 residue in these complexes, as well as that of the PKA inhibitor PKI, aligns very well with those of the GSK-3 inhibitory peptides, and is oriented similarly such that the P+0 residue would be correctly positioned to accept a phosphate from ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

In addition to the main-chain interactions observed between GSK-3 and the inhibitory peptides, GSK-3β Phe93 packs against residues at the P+2 and P+5 positions of the inhibitor peptides. Given that the inhibitor peptides appear to bind as pseudo-substrates and stabilize an active conformation of GSK-3, we tested the importance of Phe93 for GSK-3 activity by determining steady-state kinetic parameters for wild-type GSK-3β and the F93A and F93G mutants using peIF2b as the substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The mutants show 7–9-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency (k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub>), with significant increases in K<sub>M</sub> that suggest a loss of affinity for the peptide substrate. These data indicate that the interaction with Phe93 contributes strongly to substrate binding, and the reductions in k<sub>cat</sub> are consistent with the notion that peptide binding is required for formation of a catalytically competent enzyme.</p><p>Unlike most loops in the N-terminal lobe of GSK-3, the C-loop has been highly conserved throughout evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The position equivalent to Phe93 of mouse GSK-3β is strongly conserved; the only other residue found at this position is tyrosine, which would be able to form the same interactions with the P+2 and P+5 residues of the substrate peptide. A bulkier residue such as tryptophan at this position would clash with the substrate peptide backbone, and the decreased activity of the F93A mutant suggests that smaller residues would not extend far enough to interact with the substrate. In the absence of pseudo-substrate inhibitors, Phe93 does not interact with other parts of the kinase and is present on a solvent exposed, flexible loop. Thus, the conservation of Phe or Tyr residue at this position must be attributed to its role in substrate binding and concomitant formation of an active kinase conformation.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GSK-3 sequence alignments near the C-loop.</title><p>White letters on black background indicates identical residues, and bold letters denote similar residues.

The presence of the pS9 or LRP6 peptides, however, precludes this positioning for Tyr216. Instead, it points outward, away from the peptide, and adopts an identical conformation to that seen when it is phosphorylated, where it interacts with several basic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bax et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). In the inhibitory peptide complexes, the ring of Tyr216 packs against the P+1 residue. These observations are consistent with the modest increase in GSK-3 activity when Tyr216 is phosphorylated: in order to accommodate binding of the substrate peptide, Tyr216 must move away from its unphosphorylated position and break its interaction with Val214. Having phosphorylated Tyr216 pre-positioned for substrate binding would not require the extra energy needed for this rearrangement.</p><p>Alignment of known GSK-3 primed substrates demonstrates some preference for small, uncharged residues, especially proline, at the P+1 position (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the non-polar interactions observed with the ring of Tyr216. However, arginine is found in this position in 19% of the substrates, including the inhibitory pS9 peptide, where its β carbon packs against Tyr216. When GSK-3 is phosphorylated at Tyr216, the charged phosphate group on pTyr216 would be located near the distal end of the P+1 residue. Modeling shows that the phosphate group could interact with the positively charged moiety of arginine at P+1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These observations suggest that GSK-3 substrate specificity may be controlled in part through Tyr216 phosphorylation status, with substrates containing smaller or hydrophobic residues at P+1 preferred when Tyr216 is not phosphorylated and basic residues preferred when phosphorylated. If so, potential tyrosine kinases mediating Tyr216 phosphorylation or factors that promote autophosphorylation of Tyr216 may favor phosphorylation of particular substrates and thereby provide an additional level of regulation of GSK-3 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lochhead et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaidanovich-Beilin and Woodgett, 2011</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The data presented here reveal the mode of binding of GSK-3 pseudo-substrate inhibitors, which imply that the catalytically active conformation can form only in the presence of a peptide substrate. Although the C-loop is often poorly ordered in non-peptide-bound structures, it interacts directly with the inhibitory peptides, and the loss of activity resulting from mutation of Phe93 demonstrates the critical nature of this interaction. The C-loop interactions, coupled with changes in the position of the glycine-rich loop, create an arrangement of catalytic residues comparable to those observed in PKA bound to the transition state mimic ADP-AlF<sub>3</sub> and a peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Madhusudan et al., 2002</xref>). These observations, as well as comparison to structures of other kinases bound to substrates, indicate that the inhibitory peptides act as true pseudo-substrates that mimic binding to substrate, rather than stabilizing a distinct catalytically inactive conformation of GSK-3.</p><p>Phosphorylation of the conserved LRP5/6 cytoplasmic repeat motifs is essential for Wnt signal transduction and is in particular associated with inhibition of GSK-3 activity and subsequent stabilization of the transcriptional co-activator β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>). Several studies have shown that phosphorylated LRP5/6 can directly inhibit GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). This suggests a model in which recruitment of the destruction complex to the Wnt-bound receptors occurs when activated Dishevelled binds to Axin through their respective DIX domains. GSK-3 bound to Axin would phosphorylate LRP5/6 and generate its own inhibitor, thereby selectively inhibiting the pool of GSK-3 that phosphorylates β-catenin without affecting other GSK-3 activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>). The kinetic and structural data presented here demonstrate that the phosphorylated LRP6 repeat motifs act as direct inhibitors of GSK-3 catalytic activity. The 40-fold stronger inhibitory activity relative to that of phosphorylated GSK-3 N-terminus is consistent with the LRP5/6 motifs working in <italic>trans</italic>, as opposed to the presumed kinetic advantage of having the GSK-3 N-terminal inhibitory substrate part of the same polypeptide chain, although formation of membrane associated ‘signalosome’ complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilic et al., 2007</xref>) likely enhances the probability of encounter between Axin-bound GSK-3 and LRP5/6.</p><p>The prolines of the LRP5/6 cytoplasmic tail repeat motifs have been shown to be critical for Wnt signaling in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacDonald et al., 2008</xref>).

Interestingly, a glutamate residue (Glu12) is present at a similar position on the pS9 auto-inhibitory peptide, which we also do not observe. It is possible that the negative charge present at this position contributes to a relatively non-specific electrostatic interaction in a flexible region. However, previous experiments indicated that there was no increase in inhibitory activity toward GSK-3 of the doubly phosphorylated LRP6 peptide vs a peptide bearing only the first phosphorylated S/T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Piao et al., 2008</xref>). The second phosphorylation site may instead provide an additional site of interaction for another protein, as this region of LRP6 is accessible to solvent. One example could be an additional domain of Axin itself, as Axin has been shown to interact directly with the phosphorylated PPSP motif in the absence of GSK-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">MacDonald and He, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013b</xref>).</p><p>GSK-3 represents an important drug target for a variety of diseases, including diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, and some cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Medina and Castro, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Takahashi-Yanaga and Sasaguri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wada, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amar et al., 2011</xref>). Inhibiting GSK-3 in these pathways while not promoting oncogenesis through aberrant β-catenin signaling is a challenge. Many kinase inhibitors in use today are based on interactions with the nucleotide-binding region, with elaborations that target unique features of the particular enzyme. Such inhibitors would be non-selective towards the various substrates of GSK-3. Some recently developed compounds target portions of the kinase not directly involved in nucleotide binding, especially activating or inhibiting conformations of the C-helix, for example clinically approved drugs toward the Abl and EGFR tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jura et al., 2011</xref>). The peptide substrate-bound GSK-3 conformation observed in the crystal structures presented here suggests that it may be possible to target the three-dimensional structure formed by the rearranged C-loop in order to select for specific substrate-bound forms of GSK-3. The projection of the P+3 substrate residue inward toward a pocket formed by the rearranged C-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) may provide a binding surface for small molecules that interact with a particular substrate sequence at this position. Such a compound would stabilize the bound conformation and prevent turnover of a specific substrate, enabling selective targeting of one pathway controlled by GSK-3.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>GST-Axin-GBD (GSK-3 Binding Domain) fusion protein was constructed by inserting the region encoding residues 383–402 of human Axin into a modified pGEX-KG vector containing a TEV cleavage site between the GST protein and the insert.

Cell pellets were harvested via centrifugation and stored at −80°C until purification.</p><p>Cell pellet from 4 l of culture was lysed in 40 ml of cold Lysis Buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 5 mg/l DNaseI (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA), and 0.2 mM PMSF with an Emulsiflex homogenizer (Avestin, Toronto, Canada). Lysate was centrifuged at 39000×<italic>g</italic> for 1 hr at 4°C to remove insoluble material. The clarified lysate was then added to a 10 ml bed volume of Glutathione-Agarose beads (Sigma) pre-equilibrated in Lysis Buffer and run under gravity flow. The beads were then washed with 200 ml of Wash Buffer containing 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The GSK-3/GST-Axin complex was then eluted from the beads by adding 6 × 5 ml aliquots of Wash Buffer plus 20 mM reduced L-glutathione (pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH). Elution fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. TEV protease was added to the fractions containing the GSK-3/GST-Axin complex and allowed to incubate overnight at 4°C. Removal of the GST tag was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and samples were run over PD-10 columns pre-equilibrated with Wash Buffer according to manufacturer’s protocol (GE Healthcare, Fairfield, CT) to remove glutathione at room temperature. Samples were then passed over 10 ml of glutathione-agarose beads again and the flow-through collected in order to remove cleaved GST and any uncleaved GST-Axin complex. The resulting GSK-3/Axin complex was &gt;95% pure as analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and its concentration was approximately 0.3–0.5 mg/ml.</p><p>GSK-3β 1-383 used for the kinetics assays was produced by incubating 10 ml of the uncleaved protein with 16,000 units of lambda phosphatase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) and 2 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> overnight at 4°C, then for 2 hr at room temperature. Removal of the lambda phosphatase, TEV cleavage, and the rest of the purification were carried out as for the AKT-phosphorylated GSK-3β 1-383. Analysis of the purified protein by western blotting showed little phosphorylation on pS9 compared to the protein before phosphatase treatment (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Phosphorylation and crystallization</title><p>Crystallization of the various GSK-3/Axin complexes was accomplished by dialysis. Purified GSK-3/Axin complex (12 ml) was combined with 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 400 μM ATP (inhibitor-free structure), 30 μg of active AKT (Millipore), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 200 μM ATP (pS9 inhibitory peptide), or 50–100 μg of purified CK1, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 200 μM ATP (LRP6 c- and e-motif structures) at room temperature and injected into a 3–12 ml size Slide-a-Lyzer cassette (7000 MWCO; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). The cassette was placed into a 250 ml reservoir solution of 10% PEG 35,000, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 µM ATP, and 5 mM DTT at room temperature to facilitate phosphorylation, then incubated at 4°C. Crystals formed inside the cassette after approximately 72 hr. To form the pS9–AlF<sub>3</sub> complex, the cassette was transferred to the same solution, with 200 μM ADP, 200 μM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 μM Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and 1.2 mM NaF replacing the ATP, and incubated for 1 week at 4°C. Crystals ranging from 20 to 750 µm in diameter were harvested by excising one side of the dialysis membrane on the cassette with a razor blade and adding a cryoprotectant solution composed of 10% PEG 35,000, 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 20–22% glycerol, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 200 µM ATP (for the pS9–AlF<sub>3</sub> complex, 200 μM ADP, 200 μM Al(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, and 1.2 mM NaF were used instead of ATP) and 5 mM DTT directly to the inside of the cassette. Crystals were mounted on cryoloops (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA) and frozen directly into liquid nitrogen.</p><p>GSK-3β 1-383 phosphorylated at Ser9 (GSK-3β 1-383<sup>pS9</sup>) used in kinase assays was produced by incubating GST-Axin/GSK-3β 1-383 with 15 µg AKT (Millipore) for approximately 48 hr in a dialysis cassette as described for crystallization, but prior to TEV cleavage. The protein solution was removed from the cassette when its volume reached ∼1 ml and diluted back to 12 ml with wash buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 200 µM ATP. The AKT was removed by applying the solution to glutathione-agarose beads. TEV cleavage and subsequent purification then proceeded as described above. Analysis of the purified protein by mass spectrometry showed that Ser9 was 24% phosphorylated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data collection, analysis, and structure determination</title><p>Diffraction data were measured from crystals at 100 K at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL) beamlines 12-2 or 11-1, or beamline 23ID-B of the Advanced Photon Source. Integration of images was performed with XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kabsch, 2010</xref>), and scaling with Aimless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Murshudov, 2013</xref>).

The structures were solved and refined in the Phenix package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The LRP6 c- and e-motif complexes were solved by molecular replacement using PDB ID 1O9U as the starting model. The inhibitor-free, pS9 and pS9-AlF<sub>3</sub> structures were solved by rigid body refinement using the LRP6 c- and e-motif complexes. Bulk solvent parameters, TLS groups and individual temperature factors were applied throughout the refinement. Model building was carried out in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>).

A typical reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 112.5 μM γ<sup>32</sup>P-ATP at 0.02 μCi/μL (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and 224 nM GSK-3β. All measurements were performed at 30°C. The substrate peptide concentration was 20 μM or 80 µM for the inhibition assays and was varied for the determination of K<sub>M</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> values. Inhibitor peptide was added at concentrations ranging from 50–1000 μM for the pS9 peptide and 5–20 μM for the LRP6 a-motif. For each measurement, a 20 μl sample was removed from the reaction and mixed immediately with 20 μl of 150 mM phosphoric acid. 35 μl of the resulting solution was then blotted onto a 96-well plate containing P81 cellulose phosphate paper and washed 5 or 10 times with 0.5% phosphoric acid. Scintillation fluid was then added, and the plate was counted in a Wallac MicroBetta 1450 liquid scintillation counter. Control reactions performed in the absence of substrate peptide showed that signal from GSK-3 autophosphorylation was not significant.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Weis and colleagues reports several new high resolution (ca 2.1 - 2.5 A) X-ray crystal structures of the important signaling kinase GSK3. These structures are noteworthy as they contain phosphorylated inhibitory motifs from the N-terminus of GSK3 itself or derived from the Wnt signaling pathway protein LRP6. These structures reveal that the inhibitory motifs bind as predicted for primed pseudosubstrates to the enzyme in its active conformation. A special feature of the complex is the presence of an extensive interaction between the C-loop and the substrate/inhibitory motif which undergoes a significant conformational change compared to the inhibitor-free structure. These structures may also help us understand how GSK3 substrate recognition occurs and in fact how Tyr216 phosphorylation may modulate substrate specificity. This study gives insight into how Tyr216 phosphorylation can modestly activate the kinase. The conserved nature of GSK3 Phe93, from the C-loop, is now explained and tested here by mutagenesis, showing its importance. A role of a conserved Arg in GSK3 interacting with the phospho-site of the primed substrate is suggested. Some technically impressive aspects of the study include the use of chimeric LRP6-GSK3 to capture the inhibited conformation and the use of kinases to obtain cleanly phosphorylated GSK3 for crystallization, and the use of ALF3- to visualize the “transition state”. Overall, this is a well-done and significant manuscript that should be of broad interest to <italic>eLife</italic> readers.</p><p>Principal concerns to be addressed:</p><p>1) There were several concerns raised about the kinetic measurements which should be addressed. The k<sub>cat</sub> values, in the range of 0.04 s<sup>-1</sup> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) are on the low side compared to many other active kinases (e.g., PKA is about 20 s<sup>-1</sup>). It would be helpful if the authors could compare their rate constants with any other GSK3 rate constants recorded in the literature to see if this has been found in other labs. The background phosphate values (time zero) are quite high at low inhibitor peptide as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and get lower with increasing inhibitor peptide additions. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on why this might be the case and also indicate how they dealt with this in calculating rates. For example, were the rates based on slopes (probably best) or were they product/time without background subtraction? Why such large error bars for the K<sub>M</sub> determinations? It doesn't look like the authors used a standard model for substrate competitive inhibition to fit their data for inhibition by the pS9 and LRP6 peptides. Was non-linear regression used? What software? What inhibition model?</p><p>2) It does not appear that the catalytic activity of the phospho-GSK3 enzymes were measured (or at least they are not reported). These would presumably show reduced activity compared to the non-N-terminally phosphorylated enzyme but it would be nice to demonstrate this and report the quantitative data. If the activity of these forms is below the level of detection, that could be stated (and the detection threshold mentioned).</p><p>Additional comments for consideration:</p><p>- While it certainly seems reasonable that the present work provides insight regarding recognition of substrate peptides (and perhaps also of primed substrate peptides), it may be excessive to claim that the structures presented here reveal the basis of primed substrate recognition. These peptides are inhibitors, not substrates, and indeed it seems that none of the structures reveal an ordered residue in the position expected for a phosphoacceptor. Further, intermingled discussion of the peptides as inhibitors and substrates is potentially confusing to the reader. Our advice would be to discuss implications for substrate recognition in a separate section, with clear acknowledgement of the limitations of the interpretation.</p><p>- The authors refer to the phosphorylated residue as P+4. This is understandable, given the P+4 priming phenomenon. However, is this a structurally sound interpretation? In the superposition with PKA bound to PKI, does the “P+1” in the peptides studied here superimpose with the P+1 in PKI? Are there backbone hydrogen bonds between peptide and activation loop in common between the structures described here and other kinase/peptide substrate complexes that allow the authors to define the register and conclude that the phosphorylated Ser/Thr is indeed in a P+4 position.</p><p>- Were the C-loop mutants studied in the context of inhibition by LRP6 or pSer9?</p><p>- The authors state that this is the first kinase complexed to a primed substrate. While this may be true for Ser/Thr kinases, the authors should cite the following, “Structural recognition of an optimized substrate for the ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases” (Davis et al, FEBS J. 2009 Aug;276(16):4395-404), as a structure that shows a pTyr primed substrate complexed to an ephrin receptor kinase.</p><p>- The authors state that, “Most kinase inhibitors in use today stabilize the inactive conformations...” While lapatinib, sorafenib, and imatinib are examples of this, erlotinib, gefitinib, dasatinib, stutent, and vemurafinib bind to active conformations of kinases. Thus, we would suggest modifying this point.</p><p>- Is it clear from the structures that an N-tail from one enzyme is not extending into the active site of a neighbor in the crystal lattice (ie intermolecular interaction)? The authors could comment on this. If there is any doubt in solution, they could measure the rate of GSK3 kinase activity at different phospho-GSK3 concentrations.</p><p>- The authors state in their Abstract and ultimate sentence that their results will aid design of GSK-3β inhibitors that are selective for specific pathways, but it is not obvious how. The authors may wish to better flesh out this claim or consider omitting it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01998.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Principal concerns to be addressed</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) There were several concerns raised about the kinetic measurements which should be addressed.

It would be helpful if the authors could compare their rate constants with any other GSK3 rate constants recorded in the literature to see if this has been found in other labs</italic>.</p><p>Note: Some small errors in data analysis were corrected in the revised manuscript. The final values of kinetic constants have changed slightly, but the conclusions are unaffected. In particular, the LRP6 a-motif peptide inhibits GSK-3 approximately 40x more strongly than the S9 peptide, rather than 16x reported in the previous version. The other notable error was in conversion of rates from pmol/sec to 1/sec, which resulted in k<sub>cat</sub> values (and thus k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>M</sub> values) smaller by a factor of two.</p><p>The activity is indeed considerably lower than PKA and some other kinases. There have been very few measurements of rate constants reported for GSK-3, as the vast majority of studies use simple qualitative endpoint assays, for example western blotting to check for formation of phosphorylated substrates, to measure activity. Also, as we note in the text, direct comparison with other GSK-3 studies is not straightforward because different groups have used different substrate sequences, most of which are processive (i.e., multiple phosphorylations at successive <italic>n-4</italic> sites). Nonetheless, we can compare values from the handful of studies that report kinetic constants in the table below.</p><p>Fiol et al (1987 and 1990) [1, 2] Wang et al (1994) [3] and Dajani et al (2003) [4] all give K<sub>M</sub> values for other GSK-3β substrate peptides that agree with our results to within an order of magnitude (and are often larger than ours). Fiol et al (1987) also gives a k<sub>cat</sub> for what the authors later determined is rabbit GSK-3α (Fiol et al, 1990) that is more than an order of magnitude lower than ours (approximately 0.0014 s<sup>-1</sup> as calculated from their data). Dajani et al. also reported a k<sub>cat</sub> of 0.7, but no units were provided. The assay referenced in that paper uses rate units of pmol min<sup>-1</sup>, so if we assume that the k<sub>cat</sub> is reported in units of min<sup>-1</sup> then the value is 0.012 s<sup>-1</sup>, somewhat smaller than our value of 0.079 s<sup>-1</sup>.<table-wrap id="tbl4" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reference</th><th>Substrate</th><th>k<sub>cat</sub></th><th>K<sub>M</sub> (µM)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Fiol et al, 1987</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase</td><td>0.0014 sec<sup>−1</sup></td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Fiol et al, 1987</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase</td><td>n.d.</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Fiol et al, 1987</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase with second GSK-3 target serine mutated to alanine</td><td>n.d.</td><td>6</td></tr><tr><td>Fiol et al, 1987</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase with third<break/>GSK-3 target serine mutated to alanine</td><td>n.d.</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Fiol et al, 1987</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase with fourth GSK-3 target serine mutated to alanine</td><td>n.d.</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al, 1994</td><td>Phospho-CREB peptide</td><td>n.d.</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al, 1994</td><td>Myelin basic protein</td><td>n.d.</td><td>59</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al, 1994</td><td>κ-Casein</td><td>n.d.</td><td>114</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al, 1994</td><td>Phosvitin</td><td>n.d.</td><td>200</td></tr><tr><td>Wang et al, 1994</td><td>Phosphatase inhibitor-2</td><td>?</td><td>16</td></tr><tr><td>Dajani et al, 2001</td><td>Primed peptide based on glycogen synthase</td><td>??</td><td>70</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>References:</p><p>1.

Unfortunately the solid black symbols for the inhibitor free data in the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> were hard to read: although linear regression for the inhibitor-free data gives a non-zero y intercept at t = 0, the actual data points for t = 0 (now shown as clear circles for the inhibitor free data) are in fact comparable to the other data. This likely corresponds to the transition between a burst phase and steady-state kinetic regime. In these experiments, ATP and inhibitor peptides (or control with no inhibitor) were preincubated with enzyme prior to addition of the substrate peptide. The rapid burst in the absence of inhibitor peptide can be attributed to rapid binding of substrate peptide, which reduces the time needed to form the ES complex. In the presence of preincubated inhibitor peptide, however, formation of the ES complex requires dissociation of the inhibitor peptide from the enzyme, so an initial fast turnover does not occur. Although this difference may ultimately give some interesting insights into the actual mechanism of the enzyme, the point of this figure is to compare the relative inhibitory potencies of the S9 and LRP6 a-motif peptides.</p><p>There are two principal reasons for the large error bars in the K<sub>M</sub> measurements. First, filter binding is itself a somewhat noisy assay, and individual rates were not always perfectly consistent across different days. Second, the inherent noise in the assay was compounded for the mutants by the low signal.</p><p>As described in the Materials and methods section, the inhibition constants were obtained using the method in the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhou et al (1997)</xref> reference.</p><p><italic>2) It does not appear that the catalytic activity of the phospho-GSK3 enzymes were measured (or at least they are not reported).

The reviewers reasonably assumed that this would be straightforward given the crystal structures, but in fact is very difficult to obtain 100% phosphorylated material. We attempted in vitro phosphorylation using AKT for native GSK-3, or CK1 for the LRP6 chimeras, but we obtained only a few percent phosphate incorporation (measured by mass spectrometry). As GSK-3 is not efficiently phosphorylated, the extreme concentration of GSK-3 along with AKT (or CK1 for the LRP6 chimeras) produced by dialysis against high molecular weight PEG enabled sufficient production of the phosphorylated enzyme for crystallization. Note that although the peptide is phosphorylated in the structure, we did not know what fraction of the total enzyme input to crystallization was phosphorylated.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ request, we used the crystallization protocol to produce phosphorylated full-length GSK-3β, but halted the dialysis prior to crystallization. Mass spectrometry showed that this material is 24 % phosphorylated. The partially phosphorylated material shows poor activity relative to the non-phosphorylated enzyme (produced by phosphatase treatment of the full-length enzyme, or the truncated version lacking the autoinhibitory N-terminus). Although we cannot produce fully phosphorylated material, the experiment clearly shows that the in vitro phosphorylated material is inhibited. This is now described in the text and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Given the clear data reported here and earlier on inhibition by synthetic phosphorylated peptides in trans, we do not feel that it would be worth the considerable costs in time and money needed to repeat this experiment with the LRP6 chimeras.</p><p><italic>Additional comments for consideration</italic>:</p><p><italic>- While it certainly seems reasonable that the present work provides insight regarding recognition of substrate peptides (and perhaps also of primed substrate peptides), it may be excessive to claim that the structures presented here reveal the basis of primed substrate recognition. These peptides are inhibitors, not substrates, and indeed it seems that none of the structures reveal an ordered residue in the position expected for a phosphoacceptor. Further, intermingled discussion of the peptides as inhibitors and substrates is potentially confusing to the reader. Our advice would be to discuss implications for substrate recognition in a separate section, with clear acknowledgement of the limitations of the interpretation</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the distinction of inhibitor and true substrate peptides was muddled in the original manuscript. The point was that comparison with a known active kinase like Thr197-phosphorylated PKA shows that the enzyme itself is in an active conformation, indicating that the inhibitors work as pseudo-substrates. We have carefully maintained this distinction in the revised paper. Given these structural data, as well as the comparison with known true substrate sequences (see next point), it is very likely that the binding mode visualized in these structures represents the mode of binding of true primed substrates. Moreover, the effect of F93 mutation clearly shows that the interaction with the C-loop is relevant to the action of the kinase on a true substrate.</p><p><italic>- The authors refer to the phosphorylated residue as P+4. This is understandable, given the P+4 priming phenomenon. However, is this a structurally sound interpretation? In the superposition with PKA bound to PKI, does the “P+1” in the peptides studied here superimpose with the P+1 in PKI? Are there backbone hydrogen bonds between peptide and activation loop in common between the structures described here and other kinase/peptide substrate complexes that allow the authors to define the register and conclude that the phosphorylated Ser/Thr is indeed in a P+4 position</italic>.</p><p>We are not entirely sure about the reviewers’ question as to whether this is a “structurally sound interpretation”. The P+4 assignment is based on the known properties of GSK-3 substrates. The electron density of the peptide is well defined at this resolution, so there is no ambiguity regarding the direction of the polypeptide nor the visible side chain assignments. We have now added a comparison to PKA:PKI and other kinases bound to substrates, showing that the orientation and structures of these other kinases in the P+1 site is similar (text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This further supports the notion that the binding mode of the inhibitory peptides corresponds closely to that of true primed substrates.</p><p><italic>- Were the C-loop mutants studied in the context of inhibition by LRP6 or pSer9</italic>?</p><p>No. The F93 mutation was made to show that this residue interacts with real substrates as part of catalysis, supporting the claim that the structures visualize an active conformation and that the inhibitors are pseudo substrates. Given the poor activity of 5 the F93 mutants, it is doubtful that we would be able to detect further inhibition by the peptides.</p><p><italic>- The authors state that this is the first kinase complexed to a primed substrate. While this may be true for Ser/Thr kinases, the authors should cite the following, “Structural recognition of an optimized substrate for the ephrin family of receptor tyrosine kinases” (Davis et al, FEBS J. 2009 Aug;276(16):4395-404), as a structure that shows a pTyr primed substrate complexed to an ephrin receptor kinase</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for this suggestion; we have now cited this paper in the Introduction.</p><p><italic>- The authors state that, “Most kinase inhibitors in use today stabilize the inactive conformations...” While lapatinib, sorafenib, and imatinib are examples of this, erlotinib, gefitinib, dasatinib, stutent, and vemurafinib bind to active conformations of kinases. Thus, we would suggest modifying this point</italic>.</p><p>Thank you, we have clarified this point in the last paragraph.</p><p><italic>- Is it clear from the structures that an N-tail from one enzyme is not extending into the active site of a neighbour in the crystal lattice (i.e., intermolecular interaction)? The authors could comment on this. If there is any doubt in solution, they could measure the rate of GSK3 kinase activity at different phospho-GSK3 concentrations</italic>.</p><p>Addressing whether the S9 interaction is truly autoinhibitory versus trans-inhibitory is an interesting question, but this was not our focus as we are interested in comparing the interaction of the N-terminal peptide (presumed to be cis) with the LRP6 peptides, which are of course part of a different molecule in vivo. To answer the reviewer’s question, we cannot rule out that the N-tail of one molecule is binding in the active site of another in the crystals, as the connection is disordered and the arrangement of molecules in the lattice might allow this to happen. We are also somewhat restricted in the range of concentrations to test GSK-3 activity due to the signal-to-noise of the assay at low concentrations and the need to keep GSK-3 soluble and to maintain steady-state conditions at high concentrations. We have noted in the Discussion that there is a “presumed” kinetic advantage of having the inhibitory peptide in cis in GSK-3.</p><p><italic>- The authors state in their Abstract and ultimate sentence that their results will aid design of GSK-3β inhibitors that are selective for specific pathways, but it is not obvious how. The authors may wish to better flesh out this claim or consider omitting it</italic>.</p><p>We have clarified this proposal in the last paragraph.</p></body></sub-article></article>
