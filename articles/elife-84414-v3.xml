We demonstrated that the herbal drug combination holds great promise as an effective remedy for PCM, acting through the regulation of immunoinflammatory pathways and improvement of systematic immune level. In particular, the herbal drug combination could significantly reduce the recurrence rate of PCM, a major obstacle to PCM treatment. Our data suggests that the herbal drug combination is expected to feature prominently in future PCM treatment.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>C.

The main histopathological characteristics of PCM are the infiltration of plasma cells and lymphocytes in breast tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). Interestingly, PCM shares similarity with breast cancer from the perspective of macroscopical or microscopical characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, mounting evidence suggests that the dysregulation of immune system is closely associated with the pathogenesis of PCM. Recently, the incidence rate of PCM is quickly rising, yet the treatment methods for PCM are still rather limited. In clinical practice, surgical resection and hormone therapy remain two major treatments for PCM. Unfortunately, neither surgical resection nor hormone therapy could prevent recurrence of PCM. Moreover, the serious side effects of hormone therapy are still problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Fleming et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, the discovery of effective PCM treatment or therapeutics with minimal side effects is clearly warranted.</p><p>Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has a rather long history for the prevention and treatment of complex diseases in eastern Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Tu, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Tu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Yin et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, for decades, TCM has been often used as alternative or complementary medicine in the West. Indeed, Chinese herbal compounds have been successfully applied in the treatment of PCM in conjunction with Western medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zhang et al., 2020a</xref>). In clinical practice, TCM refers to herbal entity prescription or formulae (also called ‘Fangji’), which may exhibit coordinating or synergistic effects through the combination of multiple herb drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Li et al., 2010</xref>). However, the design of formulae in TCM is solely based on the principle of ‘syndrome differentiation’ according to the medicinal properties of herbal entities. Moreover, the molecular mechanisms for the ‘formulae’ in TCM remain rather elusive.</p><p>Knowledge graph has emerged as an advanced technology in the field of artificial intelligence that is able to connect entities in a graph based on their existing intricate relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ye et al., 2021</xref>). In particular, knowledge graph can enable the rational design and identification of combination therapies for a specific disease or phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). Recently, we developed and constructed a knowledge graph for the discovery of herbal drug combination toward immunotherapy and systematic immunity. Subsequently, we identified a synergistic combination of herbal drugs for PCM via a scoring system based on target-hitting rates and phenotype relativeness. To verify our concept of design, we conducted a clinical trial experiment for the drug combination of herbal compounds mentioned above (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registration: NCT05530226). Strikingly, our clinical results demonstrated that the herbal drug combination identified by knowledge graph can markedly suppress various inflammatory cytokines in serum, restore clinical symptoms, and reduce the recurrence rates of PCM patients with improved global health status.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of knowledge graph toward immunotherapy</title><p>We employed data mining techniques to collect and compile 240 targets of immunotherapy and systematic immunity from the PubMed database. Next, we collected and compiled 345 herbal drug entities officially released by the National Health Commission of China and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The intricate relations between the herbal drug entities and the immunotherapy targets were extracted from the PubMed database. These intricate relations were subjected to further manual curation. We used 13 ontology terms to describe the intricate relations (edges) in the knowledge graph. Moreover, 64 attributes of the medicinal properties for the herbal drug entities were collected and compiled from the Pharmacopoeia of China. Finally, we built the knowledge graph using Neo4j and Py2Neo tools that consists of 895 nodes and 2197 edges.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Scoring system of the knowledge graph</title><p>To this end, we developed a scoring system to asses and predict synergistic drug combination of herbal drug entities (number of drugs, n) as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>x</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtable rowspacing="4pt" columnspacing="1em"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo symmetric="true">‖</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Herein, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the penalty function. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> value will be set to 0 if the medicinal properties of the drug combination fall into the contraindication rules in the Pharmacopoeia of China.

The patients were divided 1:1 into experimental group (EG) and control group (CG). It is noteworthy that, in order to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of TCM drug combination, we selected the patients who were treated with Western medicine in the real world during the same period. Therefore, the two groups of patients were divided into TCM treatment group (EG) and Western medicine treatment group (CG). There was no significant difference in baseline data such as age, body mass index, clinical classification, marriage, and child-bearing history between the two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The patients in the CG were orally treated with methylprednisolone tablets, 20 mg/day once a day. The patients in the EG were orally treated with 20 g/bag of herbal drug combination twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening for 2 mo. The herbal drug combination was prepared as granules in the following formulae: Taraxacum 15 g, Fructus forsythiae 15 g, Honeysuckle 10 g, Uniflower swisscentaury root 8 g, Herba violae 20 g, Danshen 10 g, Astragalus 20 g, and Liquorice 8 g. The formula was determined by TCM experts on the basis of ‘syndrome differentiation’ as described in the Pharmacopoeia of China. Furthermore, the herbal drug combination in the form of granules was provided and prepared by the Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University according to the standard requirement of clinical study by the National Medical Products Administration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Clinical trial protocol</title><p>The clinical trial for the herbal drug combination was registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> and entitled ‘A single arm study of Traditional Chinese Medicine for plasma cell mastitis” with registration code NCT05530226 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Recently, we collected 345 entities of herbal drugs documented in TCM books and herbal drugs announced by the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine through advanced text-mining techniques. The existing intricate relationships between the herbal drugs and immunotherapy targets were also extracted and compiled via advanced text-mining techniques and manual curation for the construction of knowledge graph. We defined an ontology list consisting of 13 ontology terms describing the relations (edges) between herbal drug entities and the immunotherapy targets based on manual curation of literature data. Moreover, we collected the attributes of the medicinal properties of each herbal compound from the Pharmacopoeia of China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Hao and Jiang, 2015</xref>). We totally compiled and integrated 64 attributes of the medicinal properties of herbal drug entities into the knowledge graph. These medicinal properties are useful throughout the design of herbal drug combination. Finally, we built the knowledge graph using Neo4j and Py2Neo tools that consists of 895 nodes and 2197 edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which can be visited online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ikgg.org/">http://www.ikgg.org/</ext-link>). Subsequently, we employed a scoring system (or so-called recommendation system) to asses and predict synergistic herbal drug combination from the knowledge graph. Note that the scoring function is able to identify those herbal drug combinations that are most related to specific phenotypes as well as herbal drug combinations that are able to hit most discrete cellular targets, yet still following the principle of ‘syndrome differentiation’ as described in the Pharmacopoeia of China (‘Methods’). Here, syndrome differentiation refers to the very basic principle of identifying and treating diseases in TCM. Syndrome (Zheng) is the presentation of the pathological changes during a specific disease course, including the location, cause, and nature of a disease. Moreover, ‘Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi’ refers to the rules guided by syndrome differentiation to select multiple herbal drug entities to treat a specific disease in TCM. To this end, we used this scoring function to select herbal drug combinations consisting of eight herbal entities. We chose to identify drug combinations with eight entities because ‘formulae’ consisting of eight drugs are regarded as ‘essence combination’ in the TCM community. In short, we employed a combination generator that is able to randomly generate drug combinations with eight herbal drug entities for 10 rounds, each of which consists of 1000 random drug combinations. All the generated drug combinations from the 10 rounds were further ranked and evaluated. It is noteworthy that the scoring results of the 10 rounds are presented as normal distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The top 20 combinations from each round ranked by the scoring function were further curated and inspected by experts in TCM. Remarkably, we identified a specific drug combination that was ranked among the top 20 choices in all 10 rounds of calculation. The drug combination was chosen for further clinical study for two reasons. First, this drug combination was among the top 20 combinations in each round of our calculations. Second, we asked experts in TCM to inspect the top 20 combinations on the basis of ‘syndrome differentiation’ as described in the Pharmacopoeia of China, and finally the combination consisting of eight herbal drug entities, including ‘Fructus forsythiae,’ ‘Herba violae,’ ‘Uniflower swisscentaury root,’ ‘Danshen,’ ‘Astragalus,’ ‘Taraxacum,’ ‘Liquorice,’ and ‘Honeysuckle,’ was selected for further clinical study.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of the knowledge graph for the drug discovery of plasma cell mastitis in the present work.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-84414-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Snapshot of the medical knowledge graph toward immunotherapy.</title><p>The knowledge graph was constructed using Neo4j and Python tools (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ikgg.org/kghti">http://www.ikgg.org/kghti</ext-link>).

In total, the eight herbal drug entities in the combination regulate 46 cellular targets related to immunotherapy and systematic immunity such as HIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Nan et al., 2022</xref>), iNOS, IL-17, IL-6, IL-1β, mTOR, NLPR3, PD-L1, STAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), TGF-β, TLR2, and TLR4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). It is noteworthy that the medicinal properties of the eight drug entities could be classified into three major categories of ‘heat-clearing and detoxicating,’ ‘Qi-tonifying,’ and ‘blood-activating menstruation regulating.’ Moreover, we conducted pathway analysis for the herbal drug combination for plasma cell mastitis. Interestingly, we revealed that the herbal drug combination may modulate a few pathways related to systematic immunity, including ‘Toll-like receptors cascades,’ ‘MAP kinase activation,’ ‘adaptive immune system,’ ‘growth hormone receptor signaling,’ ‘cytokine signaling in immune system,’ and ‘innate immune system’ via Reactome Knowledgebase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jassal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We believe that all these may account for the therapeutic profiles of the herbal drug combination toward PCM. For instance, ‘Toll-like receptors cascades,’ ‘adaptive immune system,’ ‘cytokine signaling in immune system,’ and ‘innate immune system’ are critical cellular pathways for systematic immunity that are directly associated with the pathogenesis of PCM. Moreover, the ‘MAP kinase activation’ pathway is associated with cellular defense and innate immunity, which are also crucial for the development and inflammatory conditions of PCM.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Network diagram of the herbal drug combination consisting of eight entities, including ‘Honeysuckle,’ ‘Taraxacum,’ ‘Astragalus,’ ‘Danshen,’ ‘Forsythia,’ ‘Herba violae,’ ‘Liquorice,’ and ‘Uniflower swisscentaury root,’ displayed in red circles.</title><p>In total, 46 cellular targets related to systemic immunity were hit by the drug combination such as NLPR3, IL-17, TLR4, STAT3, IL-6, iNOS, and TLR2, which are displayed in the green box model.

The baseline characteristics are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>. Strikingly, our results demonstrated that a few inflammatory cytokines in the serum, including IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IFN-γ, IL-1β, and TNF-α, were significantly downregulated in PCM patients after treatment of herbal drug combination compared to the CG treated with methylprednisolone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We chose to measure these cytokines in the experiments because they are often regarded as serum cytokine markers during the pathogenic development of PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we found that the serum levels of IgA and IgG were markedly suppressed in the treatment group of herbal drug combination compared to the CG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Note that both IgA and IgG have been found to be crucial diagnostic serum markers for PCM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Xing et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, IgA is regarded as a major component of mucosal immunity that is closely related to the pathogenesis of PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Betts et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bharathan and Mullarky, 2011</xref>). Therefore, our data suggests that the herbal drug combination may enable the regulation of mucosal immunity and consequently downregulate IgA and IgG serum level. Furthermore, we conducted the standard Quality of Life questionnaire studies for PCM patients in the clinical experiment. Our results implicated that symptom score, pain score, and global health status of PCM patients are significantly improved after treatment of the herbal drug combination compared to the CG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It is noteworthy that our results demonstrated that the recurrence rate of PCM patients in the treatment group was reduced to 3.75% compared to the recurrence rate of 12.5% in the CG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, the incidence rate of adverse events of PCM patients in the treatment group was reduced to 6.25% compared to the recurrence rate of 11.25% in the CG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, we observed that the clinical symptoms of PCM patients in the EG such as swelling, abscess, and fistula were reversed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> after treatment of herbal drug combinations. The clinical symptom score in the EG is ~4.68 compared to the clinical symptom score of ~5.98 in the CG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

In recent years, knowledge graph, a technique that can provide structured relations among entities and unstructured semantic relations associated with entities, has been introduced into the domain of drug discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zeng et al., 2022</xref>). The advantage of employing knowledge graph for drug discovery lies in the capabilities of revealing structured associations between drug entities, cellular targets, biological pathways, and phenotypes for human disorders. This is useful for scientists to identify new indications or phenotypes for existing drugs or so-called drug repurposing. With the aid of scoring function or recommendation system, knowledge graph can also be used to design and identify drug combinations for a specific disease. Herein, for the first time, we introduced and employed the concept of knowledge graph to identify herbal drug combinations for the severe PCM with unmet medical needs.</p><p>Although the pathogenesis of PCM remains largely unclear, there have been numerous reports implicating that the overactivation of immunoinflammatory pathways plays an important role in the development of PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). The major advantage of using TCM is that herbal drug combination can hit multiple discrete targets related to immunoinflammatory pathways with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity. Herein, for the first time, we showcase an example that identifies an herbal drug combination via knowledge graph toward PCM. In contrast to using the conventional principle of ‘syndrome differentiation,’ our knowledge graph consisting of intricate relations between herbal drug entities and immunotherapy targets coupled with scoring functions is able to automatically identify novel herbal drug combinations that can hit most discrete targets, making this strategy unique in the TCM community. This is because PCM is a rather complex disease that pathogenesis may involve multiple targets and immunoinflammatory pathways. Hence, we made the hypothesis that drug combinations that can act on most discrete targets or pathways related to PCM might be more effective to alleviate the symptoms. Although we acknowledge that the inclusion of chemical ingredients from the herbal drugs may impact the outcome of our analysis and design, unfortunately, the inclusion of chemical ingredients in the knowledge graph is rather technically difficult due to the limited and incomplete datasets for the herbal drugs in the field of TCM. Nevertheless, our strategy captures the prominent feature of design for drug combinations toward a complex disease such as PCM. In the future, we plan to include multiple types of omics data such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomic, or metabolomics data into the knowledge graph to reveal novel targets and enable novel drug discovery.</p><p>We want to remind the reader that a third arm (a placebo group) added to the clinical study might be useful to fully reveal the therapeutic effects of the herbal drug combination. Unfortunately, we were unable to add a third arm due to some ethical concerns. This is because PCM is a rather acute, severe, and intense clinical manifestation of breast. Without any treatment, the serious inflammatory condition of PCM may quickly advance into breast cancer. Therefore, this is a limitation of our clinical study, and we hope to design more delicate clinical trials in the future to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of herbal drug combination. Nevertheless, the detailed analysis of three indicators, including symptom score, pain score, and score of life quality, between the EG treated with herbal drug combination and the CG treated with methylprednisolone in the clinical study suggests that the herbal drug combination might be more effective in reversing the clinical conditions of PCM compared to the methylprednisolone treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>In this study, our results revealed that the herbal drug combination identified by knowledge graph could suppress a few key immunoinflammatory cytokines, enhance the systematic immune levels, and significantly reduce the recurrence rates of PCM patients. Note that recurrence has become one major obstacle after surgical resection for PCM treatment in clinical practice. On the other hand, hormone therapy may increase the risk of side effects for PCM patients. Therefore, our approach of herbal drug combination may provide a new avenue for PCM treatment with less recurrence rate and reduced incidence rate of adverse events.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we report the identification and clinical assessment of an herbal drug combination toward PCM. We demonstrated that the herbal drug combination holds great promise as an effective remedy for PCM, acting through the regulation of multiple cellular targets and immunoinflammatory pathways, which leads to the improvement in systematic immune level. In particular, the herbal drug combination could significantly reduce the recurrence rate of PCM, a major obstacle to PCM treatment. Our data suggests that the herbal drug combination is expected to feature prominently in the future PCM treatment. Moreover, these promising results underscore the potential of knowledge graph to identify drug combinations or other novel therapeutics across various types of human disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Ethical statement</title><p>The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the China Medical University (approval number: 2021PS024T).

The herbal drug combination used in the clinical study didn't obtain the highest score during the scoring process (Figure 2). The authors need to explain and elaborate this in a paragraph.</p><p>2. In Figure 3, the network diagram analysis from the knowledge graph revealed that NLPR3, IL-17, TLR4, STAT3, IL-6, iNOS and TLR2 are possible cellular targets for the herbal drug combination. The authors need to elaborate or provide some references that NLPR3, IL-17, TLR4, STAT3, IL-6, iNOS and TLR2 are relevant to PCM pathogenesis.</p><p>3. The authors need to explain and elaborate 'penalty function', in page 14.</p><p>4. Line 326, the authors mean 'validated via cellular model'?</p><p>5. Line 329, the author refers to 'systematic immunity'?</p><p>6. Page 17, line 347, 'The herbal drug combination was prepared as granules in the following formulae', The authors need to explain how this formula was determined.</p><p>7. In Figure 8, the authors need to provide more details for the clinical pictures in a paragraph. For example, age, treatment period and brief descriptions of the symptoms etc.</p><p>8. The authors need to explain why the drug combination consisting of eight herbal drugs is selected in their study. Page 7, line 137, the authors made a statement that 'eight drugs are regarded as essence combination'. The authors need to explain and elaborate this point in the manuscript.</p><p>9. Is it feasible that the authors could include chemical ingredients of the herbal drugs into their knowledge graph for the identification of herbal drug combination? The authors should elaborate more for this point in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84414.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Figure 2 looks like it could be moved to supplementary data.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been fixed.

We fully agree with the referee that a third arm (placebo group) added in the clinical trial may be useful to further reveal the therapeutic effects of herbal drug combinations. Indeed, we met some difficulties to add the placebo group in the clinical trial and unfortunately, we were unable to obtain the ethnical approval from the Research Ethnical Committee of our university should we want to add the placebo group in the trial. This is because plasma cell mastitis (PCM) is a rather acute, severe and intense clinical manifestation of breast. Without any treatment, the serious inflammatory condition of PCM may quickly advance into breast cancer. In addition, the patients may feel tremendous pain without treatment due to the quick development of PCM. Therefore, the Research Ethnical Committee raised concerns about the placebo group and we were unable to add the placebo group in the trial. Nevertheless, we fully agree with the referee that a third arm could be useful and we elaborate this limitation of our clinical study in a paragraph in the Discussion section of our manuscript. Moreover, we conducted additional analysis of the clinical data. The detailed analysis of three indicators including symptom score, pain score and score of life quality between the experiment group treated with herbal drug combination and the control group treated with methylprednisolone in the clinical study suggest that the herbal drug combination might be more effective to reverse the clinical conditions of PCM as compared to the methylprednisolone treatment (see Figure 6 —figure supplement 1-2-3). Please see below or draft-track-change, line 234-246 for more details.</p><p>“We want to remind the reader that a third arm (a placebo group) added in the clinical study might be useful to fully reveal the therapeutic effects of the herbal drug combination.

Moreover, ‘Jun-Chen-Zuo-Shi’ refers to the rules guided by syndrome differentiation to select multiple herbal drug entities to treat a specific disease in TCM.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The drug combination was chosen for the further clinical study for two reasons. First, this drug combination was among top twenty combinations in each round of calculations. Second, we asked experts in TCM to inspect the top twenty combinations on the basis of ‘syndrome differentiation’ as described in Pharmacopoeia of China and finally the combination consisting of eight herbal drug entities including ‘Fructus forsythiae’, ‘Herba violae’, ‘Uniflower swisscentaury root’, ‘Danshen’, ‘Astragalus’, ‘Taraxacum’, ‘Liquorice’ and ‘Honeysuckle’ was selected for further clinical study.

Is it feasible that the authors could include chemical ingredients of the herbal drugs into their knowledge graph for the identification of herbal drug combination? The authors should elaborate more for this point in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for this insightful and helpful comment. We fully agree with the referee that the inclusion of chemical ingredients from the herbal drugs may impact the outcome of our analysis and design. Unfortunately, the inclusion of chemical ingredients in the knowledge graph is rather technically difficult due to the limited and incomplete datasets for the herbal drugs in the field of TCM. Nevertheless, our strategy captures the prominent feature of design for drug combinations towards a complex disease such as PCM. In the future, we plan to include multiple types of omics data such as genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metagenomic or metabolomics data into the knowledge graph to reveal novel targets and enable novel drug discovery. Please see page 12, line 252-260 in draft-track-change for more details. We hope this could clarify the concerns.</p></body></sub-article></article>
