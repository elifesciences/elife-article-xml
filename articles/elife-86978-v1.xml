Since a functional BBB forms by mouse embryonic day E15.5, we reasoned that gene cohorts expressed in CNS endothelial cells (EC) at E13.5 contribute to BBB formation. In contrast, adult gene signatures reflect BBB maintenance mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, transcriptomic analysis revealed distinct cohorts of EC genes involved in BBB formation and maintenance. Here, we demonstrate that epigenetic regulator’s histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control EC gene expression for BBB development and prevent Wnt/β-catenin (Wnt) target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs. Low Wnt activity during development modifies BBB genes epigenetically for the formation of functional BBB. As a Class-I HDAC inhibitor induces adult CNS ECs to regain Wnt activity and BBB genetic signatures that support BBB formation, our results inform strategies to promote BBB repair.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>blood-brain barrier</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>wnt signalling</kwd><kwd>HDAC2</kwd><kwd>PRC2</kwd><kwd>beta-catenin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS121339</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar T</surname><given-names>Peeyush</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21NS135176</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar T</surname><given-names>Peeyush</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18CDA34110036</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kumar T</surname><given-names>Peeyush</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) control endothelial gene expression for BBB development and prevented Wnt/β-catenin target genes from being expressed in adult CNS ECs.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Central nervous system vessels possess a BBB that prevents toxins and pathogens from entering the brain. A leaky BBB can lead to deleterious consequences for CNS disorders, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, and brain tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Profaci et al., 2020</xref>). No treatment options are available to sustain and/or regenerate BBB integrity. Identifying and targeting the mechanism that forms and maintains the BBB is an attractive strategy to regain BBB integrity.</p><p>By comparing the EC transcriptome of peripheral and brain vessels, the genomic profile that contributes to BBB was described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daneman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sabbagh et al., 2018</xref>).

HDAC inhibitors are critical experimental tools for elucidating HDAC functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li and Seto, 2016</xref>), and four HDAC inhibitors are FDA-approved drugs for cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yoon and Eom, 2016</xref>). More than thirty HDAC inhibitors are being investigated in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">He et al., 2022</xref>). Similarly, PRC2, a complex of polycomb-group proteins (such as EZH2, EED, and SUZ12), represses transcription via its methyltransferase activity that catalyzes tri-methylation of H3K27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>).

Evidence linking Wnt to regulating BBB genes includes an EC-specific knockout (KO) of β-catenin that affects BBB gene expression and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gastfriend et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hupe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tran et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In CNS ECs, Wnt signaling requires binding Wnt ligands Wnt7a/7b to Frizzled receptors. This interaction stabilizes the intracellular signaling molecule β-catenin by suppressing a cytoplasmic destruction complex, which would otherwise degrade β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin translocates to the nucleus and regulates Wnt target gene transcription by interacting with DNA binding transcription factors TCF/LEF (T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancing factor). The mechanisms underlying the reduced Wnt signaling and how Wnt regulates the BBB gene transcription are not established.</p><p>We describe the discovery of epigenetic mechanisms responsible for regulating BBB gene expression during development, how Wnt signaling is reduced, and the significance of these mechanisms for BBB development.

This result is consistent with the established dual transcriptional role of these epigenetic regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ferrari et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jahan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaneko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Somanath et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zupkovitz et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, we present evidence that HDAC2 is required to form a functional BBB and induce anti-angiogenic signals. Even though the loss of vascular integrity and lethality at E-13.5 was reported in non-inducible conditional <italic>Ezh2</italic> KO using <italic>Tie2</italic> Cre-mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Delgado-Olguín et al., 2014</xref>), loss of <italic>Ezh2</italic> from E-13.5 did not significantly affect BBB permeability. These results indicate that, during the differentiation phase, HDAC2 initiates the transcriptional control, and PRC2 functions in a supporting mechanism. However, the KD of these regulators from adult CNS ECs induces a similar gene expression pattern, indicating the possibility that PRC2 facilitates the epigenetic modification during later BBB development and maintenance.</p><p>Since we did not detect H3K9me3, the repression of genes involved in BBB formation is mainly mediated through H3K27me3. On varying abundance, repressive histone mark H3K27me3 and active histone mark H3K4me3 were detected in our selected BBB genes, suggesting that repressive and activating histone methylation marks modify the promoter. Bivalent histone states can correlate with genes transcribed at low levels, suggesting these genes are poised for activation. In addition, we detected H3K9ac at the active and repressed BBB genes. Bivalent promoters can harbor H3K9ac. Thus, among the five BBB genes analyzed, each gene exhibits a different epigenetic signature, defined by histone acetylation and methylation. These results systematically demonstrate the complexity of epigenetic regulation in BBB genes and the evidence of unique epigenetic signatures. The data presented here does not entirely represent all the histone modifications on BBB genes, as other essential histone modifications, such as H3K27ac and H3K14ac, have not been examined.</p><p>The mechanism that confers low Wnt signaling in adult CNS ECs is unknown. Our results demonstrate that Wnt pathway components are still active in adult CNS ECs, yet the Wnt target genes are epigenetically inactive. Thus, in the adult CNS ECs, Wnt pathway activation permits stabilized β-catenin to enter the nucleus. Whether this nuclear β-catenin binds to Wnt target genes is unknown. Nevertheless, we demonstrated that HDAC2 and PRC2 repress Wnt target genes. Other studies have revealed that the basal or minimal Wnt pathway maintains adult BBB integrity, but its activation also prevents stroke-induced BBB damage. This also suggests the possibility of switching Wnt-regulated genes during development. Our transcriptomic analysis revealed the Wnt-regulated adult CNS EC genes associated with BBB.</p><p>It is unknown how Wnt regulates BBB genes. We demonstrated that inhibiting the active Wnt pathway at E13.5 can induce the BBB gene expression pattern associated with BBB maintenance. We demonstrate that the low Wnt pathway in E13.5 causes epigenetic modifications on BBB genes mediated by HDAC2. However, the link between Wnt and epigenetic mechanisms is unclear. Since inhibiting β-catenin induces the aforementioned results, it is likely that these effects are mediated through β-catenin. In support of this model, β-catenin GOF during BBB development prevents the maturation of BBB and inhibits the differentiation of angiogenic vessels, resulting in increased brain vascularization. Similar morphological characteristics between <italic>Hdac2</italic> ECKO and β-catenin GOF indicate its close association.</p><p>Wnt signaling in CNS ECs is believed to require Wnt7a and Wnt7b produced by neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eubelen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuhnert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vallon et al., 2018</xref>). Our transcriptomic data revealed significant expression of Wnt7a in E13.5 ECs with null expression in adults. Interestingly, adult CNS ECs showed considerable activation of Wnt7a mRNA with MS-275 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, β-catenin KD and GOF affect the expression of Wnt7a, and β -catenin staining after MS-275 treatment showed localization of β-catenin to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). These data indicate a possible innate mechanism of ECs to regulate the Wnt pathway.</p><p>A natural consequence of targeting epigenetic regulators or the Wnt pathway is that these mechanisms regulate numerous genes. Our mRNA sequencing results on embryonic and adult ECs revealed that HDAC2 inhibition or deletion could regulate EC genes associated with critical functions, including angiogenesis, barrier genesis, and Wnt signaling. Our <italic>Hdac2</italic> ECKO phenotypic and transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A–C</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>) reveal that the absence of HDAC2 impairs vascular and BBB maturation through the antirepression of BBB, angiogenesis, and Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The resulting increase in angiogenesis and BBB permeability in <italic>Hdac2</italic> ECKO embryos supports our hypothesis that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression is essential for proper BBB and vascular development. However, our embryonic data showed no difference in <italic>Cldn1</italic> and <italic>Cldn5</italic> with <italic>Hdac2</italic> deletion, which differs from the adult ECs data. This discrepancy can be attributed to developmental stage, culture-induced changes in adult ECs, pan class-I HDAC inhibitor use, heterogeneous EC population, and sequencing depth.</p><p>Epidrugs are attractive therapeutics since epigenetic changes are reversible, with the potential to reestablish function after treatment. Our results support this, as the expression of <italic>Cldn1</italic> and <italic>Cldn5</italic> returns to normal after 7 d of treatment. Furthermore, our results illustrate the potential of MS-275 to reinstate the developmental characteristics in mice and partially in human adult CNS ECs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Wild-type C57BL/6 J was used for embryonic and adult EC expression profiles.

Endothelial cells are the site of the barrier. These cells exhibit unique features relative to peripheral endothelium and a unique pattern of gene expression. There remains much to be learned about how the transcriptome of brain endothelial cells is established in development and maintained throughout life.</p><p>The manuscript by Sadanandan, Thomas et al. investigates this question by examining transcriptional and epigenetic changes in brain endothelial cells in embryonic and adult mice. Changes in transcript levels and histone marks for various BBB-relevant transcripts, including Cldn5, Mfsd2a and Zic3 were observed between E13.5 and adult mice. To perform these experiments, endothelial cells were isolated from E13.5 and adult mice, then cultured in vitro, then sequenced. This approach is problematic. It is well-established that brain endothelial cells rapidly lose their organotypic features in culture (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276">https://elifesciences.org/articles/51276</ext-link>). Indeed, one of the primary genes investigated in this study, Cldn1, exhibits very low expression at the transcript level in vivo, but is strongly upregulated in cultured ECs.</p><p>(<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187">https://elifesciences.org/articles/36187</ext-link> ; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/">https://markfsabbagh.shinyapps.io/vectrdb/</ext-link>)</p><p>This undermines the conclusions of the study. While this manuscript is framed as investigating how epigenetic processes shape BBB formation and maintenance, they may be looking at how brain endothelial cells lose their identity in culture.</p><p>An additional concern is that for many experiments, siRNA knockdowns are performed without validation of the efficacy of knockdown.</p><p>Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.86978.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Sadanandan et al describe their studies in mice of HDAC and Polycomb function in the context of vascular endothelial cell (EC) gene expression relevant to the blood-brain barrier, (BBB).

concern on endothelial cells (ECs) transcription changes on culture.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this concern by FACS-sorting ECs (Fig. 7A revised) and comparing our data with previous studies (S. Fig. 1C). Our major claim was the epigenetic repression of EC genes, including those involved in BBB formation and angiogenesis, during later development. To further strengthen our claim, we knocked out HDAC2 during the later stages of development to prevent this epigenetic repression. As shown in the first version of the manuscript, this knockout results in enhanced angiogenesis and a leaky BBB.</p><p>In the revised version, we have FACS-sorted CD31+ ECs from E-17.5 WT and HDAC2 ECKO mice, followed by ultra-low mRNA sequencing. Confirming the epigenetic repression via HDAC2, the HDAC2-deleted ECs showed high expression of BBB genes such as ZO-1, OCLN, MFSD2A, and GLUT1, and activation of the Wnt signaling pathway as indicated by the upregulation of Wnt target genes such as Axin2 and APCDD1. Additionally, to validate the increased angiogenesis phenotype observed, angiogenesis-related genes such as VEGFA, FLT1, and ENG were upregulated.</p><p>Since the transcriptomics of brain ECs during developmental stages has already been published in Hupe et al., 2017, we did not attempt to replicate this. However, we compared our differentially regulated genes from E-13.5 versus adult stages with the transcriptome changes during development reported by Hupe et al., 2017. We found a significant overlap in important genes such as CLDN5, LEF1, ZIC3, and MFSD2A (S. Fig. 1C).</p><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, culture-induced changes cannot be ruled out from our data. We have included a statement in the manuscript: &quot;Even though we used similar culture conditions for both embryonic and adult cortical ECs, culture-induced changes have been reported previously and should be considered as a varying factor when interpreting our results.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer-1 Comment 2- An additional concern is that for many experiments, siRNA knockdowns are performed without validation of the efficacy of the knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now provided the protein expression data for HDAC2 and EZH2 in the revised manuscript Supplementary Figure- 2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer-1 Comment 3- Some experiments in the paper are promising, however. For example, the knockout of HDAC2 in endothelial cells resulting in BBB leakage was striking. Investigating the mechanisms underlying this phenotype in vivo could yield important insights.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your positive comment. The in vivo HDAC2 knockout experiment serves as a validation of our in vitro findings, demonstrating that the epigenetic regulator HDAC2 can control the expression of endothelial cell (EC) genes involved in angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier (BBB) formation, and maturation. To investigate the mechanism behind the underlying phenotype of HDAC2 ECKO, we performed mRNA sequencing on HDAC2 ECKO E-17.5 ECs and discovered that vascular and BBB maturation is hindered by preventing the epigenetic repression of BBB, angiogenesis, and Wnt target genes (Fig. 7A). As a result, the HDAC2 ECKO phenotype showed increased angiogenesis and BBB leakage. This strengthens our hypothesis that HDAC2-mediated epigenetic repression is critical for BBB and vascular maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 Comment-2 The use of qPCR assays for quantifying ChIP and transcript levels is inferior to ChIPseq and RNAseq. Whole genome methods, such as ChIPseq, permit a level of quality assessment that is not possible with qPCR methods. The authors should use whole genome NextGen sequencing approaches, show the alignment of reads to the genome from replicate experiments, and quantitatively analyze the technical quality of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's comment. While whole-genome methods like ChIP-seq offer comprehensive and high-throughput data, ChIP-qPCR assays remain valuable tools due to their sensitivity, specificity, and suitability for validation and targeted analysis. Our ChIP analysis identify the crucial roles of HDAC2 and PRC2, two epigenetic enzymes, in CNS endothelial cells (ECs). In vivo data presented in Figure 4 further support this finding through observed phenotypic differences. We concur that a comprehensive analysis of HDAC2 and PRC2 target genes in ECs is essential. A comprehensive analysis of HDAC2 and PRC2 target genes in ECs is currently underway and will be the subject of a separate publication due to the extensive nature of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 Comment-3 Third, the observation that pharmacologic inhibitor experiments and conditional KO experiments targeting HDAC2 and the Polycomb complex perturb EC gene expression or BBB integrity, respectively, is not particularly surprising as these proteins have broad roles in epigenetic regulation in a wide variety of cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments from the reviewers. Our results provide valuable insights into the specific epigenetic mechanisms that regulate BBB genes It is important to recognize that different cell types possess stage-specific distinct epigenetic landscapes and regulatory mechanisms. Rather than having broad roles across diverse cell types, it is more likely that HDAC2 (eventhough there are several other class and subtypes of HDACs) and the Polycomb complex exhibit specific functions within the context of EC gene expression or BBB integrity.</p><p>Moreover, the significance of our findings is enhanced by the fact that epigenetic modifications are often reversible with the assistance of epigenetic regulators. This makes them promising targets for BBB modulation. Targeting epigenetic regulators can have a widespread impact, as these mechanisms regulate numerous genes that collectively have the potential to promote the vascular repair.</p><p>A practical advantage is that FDA-approved HDAC2 inhibitors, as well as PRC2 inhibitors such as those mentioned in clinical trials NCT03211988 and NCT02601950, are already available. This facilitates the repurposing of drugs and expedites their potential for clinical translation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
