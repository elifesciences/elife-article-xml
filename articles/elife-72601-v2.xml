In developing organs, positional information can be idealized as a local coordinate system that arises from morphogen gradients controlled by organizers at key locations. This offers a plausible mechanism for the integration of the molecular networks operating in individual cells into the spatially coordinated multicellular responses necessary for the organization of emergent forms. Understanding how positional cues guide morphogenesis requires the quantification of gene expression and growth dynamics in the context of their underlying coordinate systems. Here, we present recent advances in the MorphoGraphX software (Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015⁠) that implement a generalized framework to annotate developing organs with local coordinate systems. These coordinate systems introduce an organ-centric spatial context to microscopy data, allowing gene expression and growth to be quantified and compared in the context of the positional information thought to control them.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>segmentation</kwd><kwd>quantification</kwd><kwd>positional information</kwd><kwd>convolutional neural

controlled by positional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wolpert, 1969</xref>)⁠, where cells can sense their position in a developing organ and respond accordingly. This phenomenon may be even more pervasive in plants as cells cannot relocate within organs and must decide their fate based on their location. For example, root morphogenesis appears to be controlled by an organizing center at the root tip that provides founder cells and positional information to the growing structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheres et al., 2002</xref>)⁠. Ablation of cortical cell initials in the root meristem causes the neighboring pericycle cells to divide and fill the available space, subsequently adopting the fate associated to their new location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van den Berg et al., 1995</xref>)⁠. A similar effect has been demonstrated for a variety of cell types in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marhava et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. In leaves, development is thought to be coordinated by polarity fields oriented from leaf base to tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>)⁠. Over time organs can initiate new growth axes, such as when serrations or leaflets develop in more complex leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barkoulas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, or lateral roots emerge from the primary root (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheres et al., 2002</xref>)⁠. In these cases, information from several organizers must be integrated to direct cell response.</p><p>To understand how positional information controls morphogenesis, it is necessary to quantify cell shape, gene expression, and morphogen concentration changes over time, preferably at the cellular level. This information then needs to be related to its position relative to the organizers controlling development within the organ. As computational power and imaging methods improve, new software packages for cell segmentation and lineage tracking are being developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sommer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stegmaier et al., 2016</xref>⁠), including many specialized for plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eschweiler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolny et al., 2020</xref>)⁠. This progress has enabled the segmentation of time-lapse data at increasingly higher resolution and throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sapala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Willis et al., 2016</xref>)⁠. Although this increase in data volume offers tremendous potential to understand how genes control form, the analysis of geometric data from thousands of cells is nontrivial. Information about a cell’s shape, gene expression, and growth directions is of limited value when the cell’s spatial context within the developing organ is unknown.</p><p>MorphoGraphX is a computer software platform that is specialized for image processing on surface layers of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>)⁠.

Key to the approach taken in the software is the representation of cell layers as curved, triangulated surface meshes that capture the overall 3D shape of organs, which retains much of the simplicity of 2D segmentation and lineage tracking. These ‘2.5D’ images contain the geometry of the sample at two scales. The global shape of the organ is captured by the mesh’s geometry, while a cellular-scale representation is obtained from the confocal signal projected onto the mesh, which is segmented to extract the shape of individual cells on the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>).

Although a selection of these and other image denoising and preprocessing tools are available directly within MorphoGraphX, it is also possible to preprocess and/or segment 3D images in other software and import them into MorphoGraphX for further analysis. After the initial segmentation, cellular features can be quantified, such as cell area, shape, and gene expression for single time points, or cell proliferation and growth for time-lapse data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). These data can then be annotated with positional information to aid the understanding of the development of the organism under study. Even with deep learning techniques, image quality needs to be very high for full 3D segmentation, and this is often not possible with live imaged data.

On the full 7-day sepal time-lapse shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hervieux et al., 2016</xref>)⁠, initially growth is predominantly located at the distal parts of the organ, followed by the progressive displacement of the high growth zone towards the base of the sepal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). By time point 6, the growth has slowed and become more uniform as the organ differentiates. Proliferation is initially more uniform, but otherwise follows a pattern similar to growth, progressing basally as the organ matures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The data can be indexed by position from the base of the sepal and plotted, showing how growth and proliferation vary along the PD developmental axis as a percentage of the total sepal length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). It can be seen in the graphs that although the sepal appears to undergo a similar growth arrest starting at the tip as the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf, there are subtle differences. The growth in the early stages is more distal in the sepal, along with the proliferation, and the zone of higher growth moves towards the base as the sepal develops. This is in contrast to the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf where the growth and proliferation zones remain relatively fixed with respect to the total leaf length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.

A common problem with the interpretation of such directional information is the tendency for directions to be locally heterogeneous when growth is nearly isotropic. This happens because the maximal and minimal growth amounts are almost the same, and the displayed directions become arbitrary and heavily influenced by noise. This can make the comparison of growth directions between neighboring cells difficult. A more informative approach is to look at growth with respect to the directions of the developmental axes. This can be done by first setting up an axis defining the positional information for the leaf, for example, by using the previously introduced distance field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The growth directions are then projected onto this developmental axis and separated into components that are parallel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and perpendicular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) to the axis. Using this method on the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> leaf primordium different developmental zones with varying growth rates along the PD and medial-lateral (ML) axis can be revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>): while the area extension differs greatly in midrib/petiole (low) and leaf blade cells (high), it can be seen that those differences mainly follow from the ML growth rate, whereas the PD growth map is more similar in these domains. Moreover, an increase in ML growth around the forming serration can be seen, separating it from the surrounding leaf blade cells that show less growth along this direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

At the proximal end (at 0 μm), the cell shape is relatively isotropic with similar values in cell length, width, and depth. Moving along the PD axis, cell anisotropy slowly increased, first mostly due the decreasing depth and width (until around 100 μm), later mainly due to the increased cell length (from about 150 μm). The increased cell length suggests a highly anisotropic growth along the longitudinal axis in this area. A potential proliferative region could be suspected in the region between 100 and 150 μm, where cell volume and length are the smallest. The quantification using the organ coordinates in this study allows spatial information to be linked to 3D cellular properties such as cell volumes and the associated shape anisotropies along different cell axes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Using positional information for automatic cell-type classification</title><p>Plant organs typically emerge as primordia consisting of undifferentiated tissue.

When tracking cell lineages over multiple time points, a secondary label called the ‘parent label’ is provided. Other secondary labelings are also possible, for example, for cell type, cell layer, or zones within an organ. MorphoGraphX has several methods to assign these labels to classify cell types and layers. These labels can be assigned manually by interactively selecting cells or by employing a number of processes that use heat map measure data to assign secondary labels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–H</xref>). Positional information from the distance measures can be combined with measures of cell morphology and gene expression, where a secondary labeling can be used to provide additional context.</p><p>Since cells of a common biological cell type have similarities in one or more geometrical, positional, or gene expression attributes, the values of these attributes will often form a cluster, facilitating their automatic classification. An example can be seen in the 3D Cell Atlas add-on for MorphoGraphX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>)⁠ that clusters cells by relative radial distance and cell size to classify the cell layers of the root, hypocotyl, mature embryo, or other radially symmetric plant organs. To aid in optimizing cell clustering, MorphoGraphX offers a 2D interactive heat map, where information from two independent measures can be visualized, and clusters selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These methods can be used repeatedly on subsets of cells to enable a classification of cells that differ across more than two features.</p><p>Multifeature classifications tasks can be solved automatically by machine learning approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995</xref>)⁠ when provided with sufficient training data. Of particular relevance are support vector machines (SVMs) that have been used to classify cell types based on geometrical features of plant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Reuille and Ragni, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sankar et al., 2014</xref>)⁠. MorphoGraphX provides a simple interface to the libSVM SVM library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>)⁠. Cells can be selected and classified into different cell types for use as training data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Any cell attribute or measure that can be quantified in MorphoGraphX can be used by the classifier. These include all the morphological and gene expression measures, time-lapse measures, positional information created via distance maps or other coordinate systems, and even custom measures created via plug-ins or calculated externally with R or MATLAB. Once trained on a small group of cells with the desired measures, the classifier can be used to classify all the cells in a sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). After manual curation, the classification can then be used as additional training data, improving the power of the classifier. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F and G</xref> show the cell types of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gynoecium, which consists of the lateral valve tissues that are fused to the replum. Within the valve, stomata are homogeneously distributed, consistent with the uniform growth and differentiation of this tissue. In contrast, no stomata cells can be found within the replum, which is made up of smaller, more homogenously sized cells. Cell typing this organ can be useful to identify the region of the valve margin, where the fully matured fruit will dehisce to release the seeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eldridge et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ripoll et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-72601-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Cell-type classification using support vector machines (SVMs).</title><p>A selection of measures is calculated on a segmented mesh from an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gynoecium.

In MorphoGraphX, this can be done following cell segmentation by manually assigning parent labels to the second time point, a process that has been highly streamlined in the user interface for 2.5D surfaces. However for full 3D samples, or large 2.5D samples with multiple time points, this method can be cumbersome. One method to address this problem is to find a nonlinear coordinate transformation or deformation that maps all the points from one time point onto the next. Parent labeling can then be determined by mapping cell centers of the later time point to an earlier one, allowing the cell they came from to be identified. This can be used to directly assign lineage or to seed algorithms that use more involved methods, such as the minimization of the total distances between the mapped cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fernandez et al., 2010</xref>)⁠. In MorphoGraphX, to define a mapping between the meshes of two successive time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), we have implemented a 3D deformation function based on scattered data point interpolation (using cubic radial-basis functions; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duchon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turk and O’Brien, 1999</xref>)⁠. An initial transformation is computed based on a few preassigned landmarks by matching several cells with their parents in the previous time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). A deformation field is then calculated that provides a mapping for all points in 3D. This is then used to assign parent labels in the second time point based on their closest match in the previous time point. Close to the landmark points, this mapping will be very accurate, with accuracy decreasing with distance from the landmarks. The decrease in accuracy away from landmarks is larger if the deformation between the time points is highly nonuniform. After assigning all the cells to their closest parent, the mapping is then verified by checking the correspondence of neighborhoods between each cell and its parent. The labeling for cells that do not match is cleared, and the process is repeated. This causes correctly labeled regions to ‘grow’ out from the initially placed landmarks until the entire sample is correctly labeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). At each step, only correctly labeled cells remain. Sometimes the iterative cell labeling process can get stuck in highly proliferative areas where cells have divided repeatedly between time points. In this case, a few additional landmarks can be manually added at trouble spots. One significant advantage of the method is that incorrect cells remain unlabeled, making manual curation straightforward. Once all of the parents are assigned and have passed the neighborhood correspondence check, one can be assured that both the lineage and the underlying segmentations are correct.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Deformation functions in MorphoGraphX.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Deformation functions allow a direct mapping of arbitrary points (blue) between two meshes.

One example is automated cell lineage tracking, originally implemented for surfaces, which has now been extended to facilitate growth analysis in full 3D. Lineage tracking in 3D is a much harder task than on 2.5D surface images as 3D cellular meshes lack the cellular junctions that serve as material points for surfaces. However, in many cases, entire organs are well defined by their surfaces meshes, allowing landmarks on the surface to be used to construct a 3D deformation function to aid lineage tracking in full 3D. Surface landmarks can also be combined with 3D cell centers and/or face centers as material points to improve the internal resolution of the deformation functions for full 3D samples.

As plant cells cannot move, cell division and growth are the main determinants of morphogenesis. MorphoGraphX has processes to identify dividing cells from time-lapse data and quantify the orientation of the division wall in both 2.5D and 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). In 2.5D, the best-fit line to the division wall is calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and D</xref>), whereas in 3D the best-fit plane is used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C and G</xref>). There are also measures to determine the asymmetry of the daughter cells. The use of positional information to give organ context is especially important for directional information, such as the orientation of cell division. Quantifying the orientation of the division plane is of little use without knowing how it relates to the developmental axes. Orientations can be computed with respect to the axes of a local coordinate system defined for the organ, along with its associated positional information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). It is also possible to quantify how close cell divisions are to common division rules proposed in the literature, such as the shortest wall through the center of the cell including local minima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besson and Dumais, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yoshida et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vaddepalli et al., 2021</xref>) along the PDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hejnowicz, 2014</xref>)⁠, or rules based on network measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Advanced data analysis and visualization tools.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Division analysis of a cell from a surface segmentation of an <italic>A. thaliana</italic> sepal.

Namely, the length of paths between cells is maximized, whereby cells that lie upon more shortest paths have a great propensity to divide, and the orientation of this division tends to leave the two daughter cells on the fewest number of shortest paths. Using this approach, the local geometric properties of cells can be related to the emergent global organization of cellular arrangements. Perturbation of cell shape in the <italic>katanin1</italic> mutant led to alterations in path length in the SAM, which correlated with defects in phyllotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6-4"><title>Cell polarity</title><p>Cellular signals, such as proteins tagged with fluorescent reporters, can also be quantified in MorphoGraphX. After segmenting a surface into cells by using a cell wall stain or marker line, a signal collected in a second channel can be projected onto the surface mesh, and the abundance, orientation, and polarity of signals can be computed. Examples are the PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporter report line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benková et al., 2003</xref>)⁠ or the GFP:MBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Van Bruaene et al., 2004</xref>)⁠ line that tags microtubules (MTs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L–N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the quantification of cell polarity, MorphoGraphX implements a process where the projected signal along the cell border is binned based on its position in relation to the cell center to obtain its predominant direction and its intensity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8L</xref> shows an example of the PIN1 polarity quantification at the cell wall of surface segmented cells in the SAM. A similar quantification can be performed for 3D meshes as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>, where we computed the PIN2 polarity in epidermis and cortex cells of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. Again, this directional information can be combined with the organ coordinates to compute the angle between cell polarity and the organ axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

It supports the independent rotation and translation of different stacks and meshes in the same world space and the ability to render both voxel and geometric data together with blending and transparency. It has adjustable clipping plane pairs and a bendable Bezier cutting surface that can be used to look inside 3D samples, and an interface to support the creation of animations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). However, visualizing and interacting with 3D data on a 2D computer screen still remains a challenge. A particular problem is the validation and correction of 3D segmentations of organs as internal cells are obscured by outer layers. 3D segmentation curation and correction is a bottleneck when developing training sets for deep learning tools, and MorphoGraphX has become a useful tool for this purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolny et al., 2020</xref>)⁠. In addition to clipping planes, exploded views are a commonly used method to visualize the internal structure of multicomponent 3D objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>)⁠, which can be used on mesh data in MorphoGraphX. These are particularly useful for visualizing the internal structure of entire organs with small cell numbers such as embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and can be used in combination with multiple clipping planes for larger samples. To add biological meaning to the exploded visualization, cells can be bundled by their parent or cell-type label to visualize key aspects of biological data sets such as cell divisions or to separate organs into cell layers or by cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Furthermore, cells sharing the same cell-type label can be easily manually selected, moved, or deleted for improved visualization of specific tissues and groups of cells. These processes can also aid user interactions, making cell selection and annotation more straightforward when users are curating 3D cellular segmentations and lineage maps.</p><media id="video5" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-72601-video5.mp4"><label>Video 5.</label><caption><title>Creating an animation.</title><p>Key frames are saved and used to provide steps for an animation that can then be played back.</p></caption></media><p>In addition to mesh editing tools, MorphoGraphX has several tools to edit voxel data.

It also avoids the requirement to set up a full Python environment and comes stand-alone as a package built for the most common nVidia GPU architecture.</p><media id="video6" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-72601-video6.mp4"><label>Video 6.</label><caption><title>Convolutional neural network (CNN) cell wall prediction and segmentation.</title><p>Using an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flower meristem, a CNN is first used to improve the cell wall signal. The meristem is then segmented into cells, and a 3D mesh created.</p></caption></media><p>Once data is segmented, it often requires some manual correction before it is ready for final analysis in a chosen coordinate system. MorphoGraphX has interactive tools that operate on voxel data both to combine and split labels (cells), although typically it is easier to oversegment and combine, rather than undersegment and split (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). This can be used to correct segmentations, which can then be used to help train deep learning networks to further improve automatic segmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vijayan et al., 2021</xref>)⁠. In this context, MorphoGraphX has been used to segment and curate <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ovule data to create ground truth for confocal prediction networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wolny et al., 2020</xref>)⁠.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Software design</title><p>The internal architecture of MorphoGraphX has been designed to make it easily extendable, while retaining the speed of the fully compiled, statically typed language C++. The relatively small visualization and data management core is augmented with processes that are loaded dynamically at startup and provide almost all of the software’s functionality. MorphoGraphX has grown to provide a wealth of custom processes for 2.5D and 3D image processing and coordinate system creation. Additionally, it has become a platform to integrate published tools and methods that have no visual interface to the data of their own, which increases their accessibility and ease of exploration for biologists. Examples include the previously mentioned deep learning tools and the processes that interface to the Insight Toolkit (ITK) C++ image processing libraries. This greatly reduces the learning curve required to use ITK tools, such as the popular Morphological Watershed filter, which can be run from MorphoGraphX with a click of the mouse. For more advanced ITK pipelines, we have recently integrated an open-source tool that provides an XML Pipeline Wrapper for the Insight Toolkit (XPIWIT) that allows the development of ITK image processing pipelines interactively without any C++ programming required (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bartschat et al., 2016</xref>). These pipelines can be packaged into processes and called directly from the MorphoGraphX GUI, allowing the easy exploration of complex ITK image processing pipelines. An example is the ‘Threshold of weighted intensity and seed-normal gradient dot product image’ (TWANG) pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stegmaier et al., 2014</xref>)⁠, a fast parallel algorithm for nuclear segmentation. A selection of pipelines along with the XPIWIT software is bundled as an add-on for MorphoGraphX and requires no additional installation.</p><p>Another example of software integration with popular open-source tools is the processes we have developed to interface with R (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>) that provide plots for basic statistical analysis on attributes created in MorphoGraphX, including positional information provided by organ-centric coordinate systems. This simplifies the creation of the most commonly used plots without the need for export files and the mastery of ggplot. In addition to directly linking to C++ libraries, MorphoGraphX can be scripted with Python, allowing repetitive functions to be performed in batch, and the possibility to integrate Python-based tools. Operations interactively performed in MorphoGraphX are written to a Python log file for reproducibility and logging, and to allow easy cut-paste script creation.</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-72601-video7.mp4"><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Calling R from MorphoGraphX.</title><p>A time lapse of an <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> leaf is used to demonstrate how to create heat map data for analysis and plotting in R.</p></caption></media><p>Since its inception, a major focus of MorphoGraphX has been in the creation, manipulation, and visualization of geometry in the form of surface meshes for 2.5D and full 3D cellular meshes. This is in addition to the 3D voxel source data from microscopy images. There is currently very little software available that can handle both and enable the interaction between the two. Most image processing software work only with voxels, whereas most computer graphics, animation, and engineering software deal only with meshes. If the goal is simply to segment 2D or 3D cells, there are many options available, for example, Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>)⁠ or ilastik (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berg et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. If the processing of surface projections is required, advanced geometrical quantification like cell division analysis, or annotation with custom designed coordinate systems, then MorphoGraphX should be considered.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Similar to sequencing data, geometric data on the shape and sizes of hundreds or thousands of cells is of limited value without annotation. For many developmental questions, the spatial context for information on cell shape, division, and gene expression is paramount. However, it is not enough to know the 3D position of cells, but rather their position in a coordinate system relative to the developing tissue or organism. These coordinates typically reflect the developmental axes of the organism or tissue, allowing the direct comparison of cell and organ shape changes with the gene expression controlling their morphology. In addition to putting data in a mechanistic context, organ-centric relative coordinates can be used to compare samples with different morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thompson, 1942</xref>)⁠, such as different mutants, or even in different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. This also applies to changes in morphology over time, where organ coordinate systems can be used to determine the correspondence between cells at different stages of development. Several tools have been published that successfully harness organ-centric coordinates for specific problems, for example, in roots and hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schmidt et al., 2014</xref>)⁠, the shoot apex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2019</xref>)⁠, and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ovule and similar shaped organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vijayan et al., 2022</xref>)⁠. MorphoGraphX provides a generalized framework to create such tools by enabling the development of coordinate systems customized to the particular organ or organism of interest. Possibilities vary from simple distance-based systems to analyze leaf growth on surfaces from time-lapse images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kierzkowski et al., 2019</xref>)⁠ to more involved methods for more complex organs in full 3D from fixed samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vijayan et al., 2021</xref>)⁠.</p><p>MorphoGraphX is unique in that it is the only software that we are aware of that allows image processing on surface meshes, which we informally refer to as 2.5D image processing. These meshes are most often created from 3D confocal images of a cell boundary signal. Images obtained from the microscope in proprietary formats are typically loaded into Fiji or ImageJ with BioFormats/LOCI-Tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Linkert et al., 2010</xref>)⁠, and then converted to TIFF for import into MorphoGraphX. Denoising of images and other preprocessing can be performed before import; however, most common preprocessing steps are now available directly in MorphoGraphX. Although originally targeted at 2.5D image processing, the necessity to handle full 3D image processing has meant that it has become convenient to implement a wide array of processing filters for full 3D in MorphoGraphX, many of which are GPU accelerated. The number of processes available in MorphoGraphX has swelled to over 540 in the current version compared to just over 160 in the previously published version (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barbier de Reuille et al., 2015</xref>)⁠. This includes a comprehensive toolkit for cell shape analysis, growth tracking, cell division analysis, and the quantification of polarity markers, both on 2.5D image meshes, and for full 3D. All of these measures can be calculated and stored within the mesh, or exported to files for further processing with other software. Custom measures can also be calculated and imported for visualization within MorphoGraphX. Cell shape measures in combination with positional information provide a powerful framework for cell-type classification, both with machine learning methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>) and clustering techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. Although organ-centric positional information provides important features for cell classification, it is unavailable in most machine learning cell classification software that typically can only deal with voxel information and limited annotation.</p><p>A key strength of MorphoGraphX is that it offers both manual and automatic tools for segmentation, lineage tracking, and data analysis. Although fully automated methods are improving, streamlined methods for manual and semi-automatic segmentation and analysis provide a path to completion for many samples where the automatic methods are ‘almost’ good enough. For example, the automatic lineage tracking now available in MorphoGraphX benefits from the streamlined tools we developed previously to do the process manually as these are now used to correct and fill in missing portions when the automatic segmentation is incomplete. This reflects the interactive nature of MorphoGraphX and its focus on low-throughput but high-quality datasets.</p><p>As more and more imaging datasets are becoming available for community use, their annotation with positional information and gene expression data will be critical to help understand how the cell-level action of different genes and genetic networks is translated into the 3D forms of tissues and organs of different species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.plantcellatlas.org">https://www.plantcellatlas.org</ext-link>). In this context, MorphoGraphX provides a tool set to help maximize the attainable information from these datasets in an accessible platform tailored to the experimental biologist.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Software availability</title><p>MorphoGraphX is open-source software and runs on Linux and Windows.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MorphoGraphX 2.0: Providing context for biological image analysis with positional information&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Roeland MH Merks (Reviewer #2); Naomi Nakayama (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers agree that MGX2.0 is a powerful suite of tools that can be of use to many researchers in the plant and developmental biology fields, but all felt it is more appropriate for a &quot;Tools and Resources&quot; manuscript and suggest that the revision be submitted as such.</p><p>2) Even for a tools and resources manuscript, it would be nice to clarify what novel findings MorphGraphX can reveal with the new updates. Did you find something counterintuitive or previously unknown/unexpected because of the precision quantification? Did using these data result in different outcomes with a computational model, for example? Such an example will be a strong incentive for why these updates warrant another major publication.</p><p>3) More detail on how the data must be generated to make it suitable for use in MGX2.0, such as explicit parameters for input image quality, is required. MGX1.0 had fairly strict standards for input. Have these standards changed? Also, in the last 10 years, many post-acquisition programs exist to &quot;clean-up&quot; noisy image data (e.g. ilastik workflows). Are these packages compatible with MGX2.0?</p><p>4) Provide more clearly organized workflow overviews. It is impressive how many analysis tools are available, but so much information is overwhelming. Even as experienced users of MGX1.0, (Rev 1), it was challenging to follow what tools were being applied to what questions and tissues. To reach both beginner and expert MGX users, we suggest including a table that summarizes the approaches and applications described in the paper.</p><p>5) To help get users started with MGX2.0, (1) present the software availability more prominently along the software availability sections; (2) add to each figure a set of instructions/a protocol for reproducing the figure using MGX2.0 as part of the supplements. At least for one of these a highly detailed step-by-step set of instructions would be highly useful; the next figures could build upon these.</p><p>6) The Results section is challenging to read and needs some restructuring. Specifically (1) the figures are described out of order, and most figures are scattered in different main text sections. Consolidate the order of the information according to the messages of each figure or rearrange figure panels; (2) The basic procedure of the software use is introduced in the middle (Line 360-370), but this should be in the introduction or beginning of the results; (3) multiple organ and tissue types are juxtaposed in the examples, of making the text difficult to follow. Some context and background will be needed to flesh out why it's important to quantify specific morphogenetic events in the mutants or markers chosen as examples.</p><p>7) Please clarify the novelty of this report beyond the other publications on MorphGraphX in the past five years (e.g., Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015; Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2019).</p><p>Specific examples of these general points about organization and narrative are found in the three reviews. Please consider these specifics as you address the required changes noted in #1-#7.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Items that must be addressed</p><p>– Image quality required. It is unclear whether there are any changes in regard to the input data (image quality/step size) required for the processes described. Even if there are no changes it is unclear for those new to using MorphographX and could lead to disappointment. A short paragraph on input data would be of great help.</p><p>– Tomato meristem. The paragraph about auxin in tomato meristems (line 299-308) is confusing and could do with some clarification. The conclusion is too strong for the data presented. The authors should either rephrase OR present experiments in which manipulations took place OR cite previous work that adds to the presented data.</p><p>– Workflow overview. The paper provides a great overview of new workflows introduced in MorphographX 2.0. Because there is so much information, it can be overwhelming. We suggest including a table that summarizes the approaches and applications described in the paper. This would allow beginner and expert users to see all that is on offer in an efficient way.</p><p>Items recommended to take into consideration</p><p>– Intended audience. We are assuming the intended audience are plant biologists that either have experience using MorphographX or are interested in using the software in the future. With that assumption it would be useful to clarify some terms as they might be unclear for readers. Such as Bezier splines/surface. In addition other sections provide detail that is confusing rather than clarifying (eg line 775-795 will cause many readers to get lost just before reaching the end of the story).</p><p>– Central story. One of the strengths of the story is the many different tissues used in the story. However, this also sometimes hinders the coherence/flow. We realize this is probably not realistic for this story but for future stories the authors could consider picking one central story to revisit at the start of each section before diving into other tissues/applications.</p><p>– Segmentation. There are many new functions in MorphographX 2.0, how did any previously existing applications change? Most importantly, did the segmentation/merging change at all? Manual correction of segmentation errors is the most time-consuming step for many casual users.</p><p>– Figures/story structure. Figures and story don't use the same story structure which gets confusing in the first half of the story. The story only partially discusses figures at first and then gets back to them with one section moving between figures 2, 5 and 4 and the next section discussing parts of figure 3. For the reader this is confusing as (1) when first encountering the figure they might try to understand the figure as a whole, thus viewing all the panels while only several are discussed and then (2) they are later directed to jump between figures+pages to follow the story which is quite impractical. There is no simple solution, but we encourage the authors to consider either restructuring some earlier figures.</p><p>– Plot axes. Putting the dependent variable on the x-axis of many of the plots is visually pleasing and matches the orientation of many samples. But it can be confusing to many readers who are used to seeing the dependent variable on the y-axis.</p><p>– Advanced geometric analysis. This section if the least coherent and most difficult to follow. Obviously, there are analyses that cannot have a whole section that should be discussed. A short introductory sentence in this section might help make that clear so readers are not looking for logic that is not there. In addition, some of the paragraphs should be shortened or rewritten. They are currently both long and confusing.</p><p>– Exploded views/3D visualization. The paragraph describing 3D visualization (line 683-699) describes difficulties with 3D visualization and possible solutions. From the text it's not entirely clear how this works in MorphographX 2.0. Can certain bundles of cells be unselected/made invisible when navigator/exploring segmentation? What are the limits of these approaches? Exploded views might work great for young embryos but less well for larger tissues.</p><p>– Comparison to comparable software. MorphographX 2.0 is a great tool. It would be great to have its applications/strengths (discussed in line 762 onwards) put into context compared to other similar tools (Ilastik, etc).</p><p>Additional questions we had about the authors visions. These do not need to be addressed for the paper to be meaningful, but they were questions that immediately came to mind when reading this. If the authors want to add to the nascent sections describing future applications, below are some things that may be of interest to a plant development audience.</p><p>– Cells as nodes in networks.

We had assumed that since it was submitted as a “Research Advance” on a previous “Tools and Resources” manuscript, that it would inherit the same classification. In any case, please change it to a &quot;Tools and Resource&quot; manuscript, and if it is possible to indicate is as an advance on the original MGX manuscript that would also be nice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Even for a tools and resources manuscript, it would be nice to clarify what novel findings MorphGraphX can reveal with the new updates. Did you find something counterintuitive or previously unknown/unexpected because of the precision quantification? Did using these data result in different outcomes with a computational model, for example? Such an example will be a strong incentive for why these updates warrant another major publication.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial submission we had mostly focused on the methods themselves, so we have tried to be more explicit about the results that can be had with the new tools that were not possible/difficult before.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More detail on how the data must be generated to make it suitable for use in MGX2.0, such as explicit parameters for input image quality, is required. MGX1.0 had fairly strict standards for input. Have these standards changed? Also, in the last 10 years, many post-acquisition programs exist to &quot;clean-up&quot; noisy image data (e.g. ilastik workflows). Are these packages compatible with MGX2.0?</p></disp-quote><p>The requirements for high quality datasets are largely the same, and the guidelines from MGX1.0 are still in the user guide, with a few small updates. Some datasets can be improved using the CNN methods, so we have added discussion of this. We have also emphasized the point, that although high quality data sets are still required, especially when attempting a full 3D segmentation and analysis, surface (2.5D) processing can be done on much lower quality samples. The coordinate systems in some cases can also lower this threshold a bit more, for example on roots or hypocotyls where one may only be interested in cell length, and then the segmentation does not have to be as accurate. We have added these points to the text in an introductory section at the beginning of the results and added to the user guide.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide more clearly organized workflow overviews. It is impressive how many analysis tools are available, but so much information is overwhelming. Even as experienced users of MGX1.0, (Rev 1), it was challenging to follow what tools were being applied to what questions and tissues. To reach both beginner and expert MGX users, we suggest including a table that summarizes the approaches and applications described in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>It has indeed become a rather large and complicated software, and we have tried to make things as accessible as possible for new users, while still explaining the advanced features for more experienced readers. In addition to the short videos provided in the initial submission, we have added longer tutorial-style videos for some of the more involved analysis, such as the creating of coordinate systems, semi-automatic lineage tracking, cell type classification, deformation functions for morphing and animating growth, and use of the deep learning tools. As they are very large, we have included them in the data repository for the manuscript, and have referenced them in the figures. We have also added a table which gives an overview of the available workflows, also highlighting what is new, and with references to the figures and where the workflows are used, and the chapters in the user guide that contain the step by step guides. Finally, we have extended the methods section to give a more detailed description on what processes and pipelines were used to achieve the results of the different analyses shown in the figures. We hope that we have now provided enough resources for the range of users from beginners to experts, to enable the repetition of all the analysis pipelines shown, either with the data we have provided, and with their own data sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) To help get users started with MGX2.0, (1) present the software availability more prominently along the software availability sections; (2) add to each figure a set of instructions/a protocol for reproducing the figure using MGX2.0 as part of the supplements. At least for one of these a highly detailed step-by-step set of instructions would be highly useful; the next figures could build upon these.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have made the presentation more prominent in the software availability section. There already was a loose connection between a lot of the figures and the user guide, as we have tried to use the same samples, which are also available to download. We agree that this was not very obvious so we have now put references in the figure captions. We have also extended the methods section to provide more detail for each figure and its relevant sections of the user guide. As mentioned in (4), there are now extended video tutorials for some of the more advanced new features that provide click-by-click detail (and sound) on exactly what to do using the sample data sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The Results section is challenging to read and needs some restructuring. Specifically (1) the figures are described out of order, and most figures are scattered in different main text sections. Consolidate the order of the information according to the messages of each figure or rearrange figure panels; (2) The basic procedure of the software use is introduced in the middle (Line 360-370), but this should be in the introduction or beginning of the results; (3) multiple organ and tissue types are juxtaposed in the examples, of making the text difficult to follow. Some context and background will be needed to flesh out why it's important to quantify specific morphogenetic events in the mutants or markers chosen as examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restructured the text as suggested, changing the figure order and text flow to better match the figures. We have moved some of the text from lines 360-370 to the beginning of the results. As mentioned, some figures show multiple organs to demonstrate the application of organ systems (Figure 2) or cell type classification (Figure 4) or of the additional tools (Figure 8), so in these cases we have added more context to the samples chosen to illustrate the utility of the various tools presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please clarify the novelty of this report beyond the other publications on MorphGraphX in the past five years (e.g., Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2015; Montenegro-Johnson et al., 2019; Strauss et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the discussion to explain the relationship of MorphoGraphX to these previous works.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific examples of these general points about organization and narrative are found in the three reviews. Please consider these specifics as you address the required changes noted in #1-#7.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Items that must be addressed</p><p>– Image quality required. It is unclear whether there are any changes in regard to the input data (image quality/step size) required for the processes described. Even if there are no changes it is unclear for those new to using MorphographX and could lead to disappointment. A short paragraph on input data would be of great help.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added this, see also response to the editor summary comment 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Tomato meristem. The paragraph about auxin in tomato meristems (line 299-308) is confusing and could do with some clarification. The conclusion is too strong for the data presented. The authors should either rephrase OR present experiments in which manipulations took place OR cite previous work that adds to the presented data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to clarify the text, toned down the conclusion, and added references for the notion that auxin acts a trigger for primordium initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Workflow overview. The paper provides a great overview of new workflows introduced in MorphographX 2.0. Because there is so much information, it can be overwhelming. We suggest including a table that summarizes the approaches and applications described in the paper. This would allow beginner and expert users to see all that is on offer in an efficient way.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have added a table of workflows with references to the related chapters in the user guide (see also response to the editor summary comment 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Items recommended to take into consideration</p><p>– Intended audience. We are assuming the intended audience are plant biologists that either have experience using MorphographX or are interested in using the software in the future. With that assumption it would be useful to clarify some terms as they might be unclear for readers. Such as Bezier splines/surface. In addition other sections provide detail that is confusing rather than clarifying (eg line 775-795 will cause many readers to get lost just before reaching the end of the story).</p></disp-quote><p>The paper is intended for a dual audience, biologists that use the tools, as well as computational people that might be interested in using similar methods in their work, or even contributing to MGX. We have moved the paragraph indicated by the reviewer to its own section on software design, and have clarified any terms used and provided more background for the aspects covered there. The intent in this section was to give advanced users and computational people a brief overview of the many new features that have been integrated into MorphoGraphX, and hopefully encourage others to join in further development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Central story. One of the strengths of the story is the many different tissues used in the story. However, this also sometimes hinders the coherence/flow. We realize this is probably not realistic for this story but for future stories the authors could consider picking one central story to revisit at the start of each section before diving into other tissues/applications.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we decided to follow the development of coordinate systems as a central story, however this makes it necessary to introduce many biological “mini-stories” as the development of coordinate systems and their application does not map nicely to a single biological story. Nevertheless, we have tried to smooth this out in the revised version (see also editor summary answer 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Segmentation. There are many new functions in MorphographX 2.0, how did any previously existing applications change? Most importantly, did the segmentation/merging change at all? Manual correction of segmentation errors is the most time-consuming step for many casual users.</p></disp-quote><p>The segmentation itself is still using watershed for 2.5D (our custom code) or 3D (ITK libraries). What has made the biggest difference is pre- and post-processing methods, as well as tools for correction. One substantial improvement is the ability to do semi-automatic lineage tracking using the deformation functions that can make a continuous map from one time point to another. By labeling a few cells, the map can be used to fill in the rest and then they are verified based on neighborhood relations. This is probably a whole method in itself. Another substantial improvement comes with pre-processing using CNN (convolutional Neural Networks), that can dramatically improve weak signal, especially for 3D work where the quality needs to be much higher for 3D. MGX can also readily load processed image or segmented data that have been processed on other platforms. We have added an overview of these possibilities to an outline paragraph at the beginning of the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Figures/story structure. Figures and story don't use the same story structure which gets confusing in the first half of the story. The story only partially discusses figures at first and then gets back to them with one section moving between figures 2, 5 and 4 and the next section discussing parts of figure 3. For the reader this is confusing as (1) when first encountering the figure they might try to understand the figure as a whole, thus viewing all the panels while only several are discussed and then (2) they are later directed to jump between figures+pages to follow the story which is quite impractical. There is no simple solution, but we encourage the authors to consider either restructuring some earlier figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to clean this up by rearranging the figures and the text (see also editor summary answer 4 and 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Plot axes. Putting the dependent variable on the x-axis of many of the plots is visually pleasing and matches the orientation of many samples. But it can be confusing to many readers who are used to seeing the dependent variable on the y-axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed to orientation of the samples and the axes (see Figure 2, 2S1, 4, 7, 7S1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Advanced geometric analysis. This section if the least coherent and most difficult to follow. Obviously, there are analyses that cannot have a whole section that should be discussed. A short introductory sentence in this section might help make that clear so readers are not looking for logic that is not there. In addition, some of the paragraphs should be shortened or rewritten. They are currently both long and confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>This section was a catch-all for things we thought too important not to be mentioned, but didn’t fit anywhere else. To minimize confusion, we have organized it into short sub-sections, so that each will be seen as somewhat stand alone. We have also done as the reviewer suggests and added an introductory sentence, and tried to streamline and shorten the text here as much as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Exploded views/3D visualization. The paragraph describing 3D visualization (line 683-699) describes difficulties with 3D visualization and possible solutions. From the text it's not entirely clear how this works in MorphographX 2.0. Can certain bundles of cells be unselected/made invisible when navigator/exploring segmentation? What are the limits of these approaches? Exploded views might work great for young embryos but less well for larger tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells cannot be hidden from view by selecting (other than deleting them), although we are constantly improving the visualization tools, and this would be a nice option to have. Since the exploded view can be used with multiple clipping planes, it does a lot better on larger samples than one would initially expect. We have been more specific in the revised version about what this feature can do.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Comparison to comparable software. MorphographX 2.0 is a great tool. It would be great to have its applications/strengths (discussed in line 762 onwards) put into context compared to other similar tools (Ilastik, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a discussion of how MorphoGraphX relates to other software in the Software design section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional questions we had about the authors visions. These do not need to be addressed for the paper to be meaningful, but they were questions that immediately came to mind when reading this. If the authors want to add to the nascent sections describing future applications, below are some things that may be of interest to a plant development audience.</p><p>– Cells as nodes in networks. This is touched upon and sounds interesting. Do the authors imaging visualizing cell networks in cytoscape? In addition to the one story mentioned, do you imagine other applications?</p></disp-quote><p>There are a few measures that treat the cells as nodes in a graph, with the weights of the cell-cell interfaces determined by area, but of course very limited in comparison to what Cytoscape can do. It is possible to export the network information to.csv files, which can then be loaded into Cytoscape.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Positional + gene expression data. The importance of positional information in addition to other large datasets such as expression data is mentioned several times. How do the authors imagine that this information could be integrated in the future?</p></disp-quote><p>Probably the biggest obstacle here is the lack of cell level gene expression information. Nevertheless some have already started to combine gene expression data and present it visually on template organs, for example the Plant Cell Atlas group. For this type of data, it is straightforward to write plugins to import it and visualize on cellular geometry, now matter what software it was generated in. MGX can already read a wide array of mesh, and voxel data in different formats, including some metadata.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>To help get users started, it would be helpful to (1) present the software availability more prominently along the software availability sections; (2) add to each figure a set of instructions/a protocol for reproducing the figure using MorphoGraphX, e..g as part of the supplements. At least for one of these a highly detailed step-by-step set of instructions would be highly useful; the next figures could build upon these.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above (this comment was highlighted in the editor summary answers 4 and 5), we have made the presentation of the software availability more prominent. We have also added more description in the methods and the user guide and videos to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am a Mac user and have not been able to download and try the software yet, so perhaps instructions are in the source code package.. However,. I tried clicking the &quot;Get Help&quot; link on the MorphoGraphX main page, but the link is broken. In any case it would help if it is more clearly communicated to readers that they can do all of these cool analyses themselves, and give them instructions or directions to step-by-step instructions for performing the analyses themselves.</p></disp-quote><p>Sadly there is no Mac version, although the it does run on Parallels and VMWare (recommend the non-Cuda Linux version). It did run on Mac at one time. The problem is that Mac has been removing OpenGL support over the years, so it is not possible to create an OpenGL context that supports all the features needed in MGX. Soon the Mac will drop OpenGL entirely, so we would need to do a port to Metal. Not impossible, but we are currently lacking resources for that.</p><p>The link should now be fixed, it just points to the Help page of the site.</p><p>We have now added some very detailed step-by-step videos that use the datasets provided with the manuscript, with audio and click-by-click instructions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>It is a manuscript with beautiful visual figures, reporting a widely useful open-source image analysis tool.
