remodelers. Herein, we characterize the 1D scanning properties of SWR1, a conserved yeast chromatin remodeler that performs histone exchange on +1 nucleosomes adjacent to a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) at gene promoters. We demonstrate that SWR1 has a kinetic binding preference for DNA of NDR length as opposed to gene-body linker length DNA. Using single and dual color single-particle tracking on DNA stretched with optical tweezers, we directly observe SWR1 diffusion on DNA. We found that various factors impact SWR1 scanning, including ATP which promotes diffusion through nucleotide binding rather than ATP hydrolysis. A DNA-binding subunit, Swc2, plays an important role in the overall diffusive behavior of the complex, as the subunit in isolation retains similar, although faster, scanning properties as the whole remodeler. ATP-bound SWR1 slides until it encounters a protein roadblock, of which we tested dCas9 and nucleosomes. The median diffusion coefficient, 0.024 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s, in the regime of helical sliding, would mediate rapid encounter of NDR-flanking nucleosomes at length scales found in cellular chromatin.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SWR1</kwd><kwd>chromatin remodeler</kwd><kwd>optical tweezers</kwd><kwd>one-dimensional diffusion</kwd><kwd>target search</kwd><kwd>single molecule</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10 OD025221</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM122569</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ha</surname><given-names>Taekjip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM125831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Carl</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1746891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carcamo</surname><given-names>Claudia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carcamo</surname><given-names>Claudia C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM128299</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poyton</surname><given-names>Matthew F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM133151</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Louder</surname><given-names>Robert K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In vitro single-particle tracking reveals that ATP binding increases the one-dimensional diffusion of yeast chromatin remodeler SWR1 on DNA stretched between optical tweezers and diffusion is confined by protein roadblocks and nucleosomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic genomes are packaged into chromatin, the base unit of which is the nucleosome. Both the position of nucleosomes on the genome and their histone composition are actively regulated by chromatin remodeling enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yen et al., 2012</xref>). These chromatin remodelers maintain and modify chromatin architecture which regulates transcription, replication, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tessarz and Kouzarides, 2014</xref>). A particularly well-defined area of chromatin architecture is found at gene promoters in eukaryotes: a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) of about 140 bp in length is flanked by two well-positioned nucleosomes, one of which, the +1 nucleosome, sits on the transcription start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bernstein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Xu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yuan et al., 2005</xref>) and the nucleosome on the opposite side of the NDR, upstream of the TSS, is known as the â1 nucleosome. The +1 nucleosome is enriched for the noncanonical histone variant H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raisner et al., 2005</xref>) and, in yeast, H2A.Z is deposited into the +1 nucleosome by SWR1 (Swi2/Snf2-related ATPase complex), a chromatin remodeler in the INO80 family of remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Korber and HÃ¶rz, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Krogan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>). The insertion of H2A.Z into the +1 nucleosome is highly conserved and plays an important role in regulating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giaimo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rudnizky et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While the biochemistry of histone exchange has been characterized, the target search mechanism SWR1 uses to preferentially exchange H2A.Z into the +1 nucleosome is not yet understood. The affinity of SWR1 for nucleosomes is enhanced by both long-linker DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yen et al., 2013</xref>) and histone acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), and both factors play a role in the recruitment of SWR1 to promoters. A recent single-molecule study further showed that SWR1 likely exploits preferential interactions with long-linker length DNA by demonstrating that H2A.Z is predominantly deposited on the long-linker distal face of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poyton et al., 2022</xref>), similar to what is observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rhee et al., 2014</xref>). It is possible that SWR1 first binds long-linker DNA and then finds its target, the +1 nucleosome, using facilitated diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as was previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>). In a hypothetical facilitated search process SWR1 would first find the NDR through a three-dimensional target search. Once bound, it is possible the entire SWR1 complex diffuses one dimensionally on the NDR, where it can encounter both the â1 and +1 nucleosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SWR1 binds DNA in short- and long-lived states and prefers longer DNAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proposed facilitated search mechanism for how SWR1 locates the +1 nucleosome.

It is not known if SWR1 or any other chromatin remodeler can linearly diffuse on DNA, and therefore make use of facilitated diffusion to expedite its target search process. Additionally, SWR1âs core ATPase, like other chromatin remodelers, is a superfamily 2 (SF2) double-stranded DNA translocase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nodelman and Bowman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yan and Chen, 2020</xref>). While there is no evidence for SWR1 translocation on nucleosomal DNA, it remains possible that SWR1 may undergo directed, instead of diffusional, movements on a DNA duplex in the absence of a nucleosome substrate.</p><p>In this study, we used a site-specifically labeled SWR1 complex to demonstrate that in vitro SWR1 can scan long stretches of DNA via 1D diffusion, which may facilitate its search for target nucleosomes in vivo. First, we characterized the kinetics of SWR1 binding to DNA and found that the on-rate increases linearly with DNA length while the off-rate is independent of length for DNA longer than 60 bp. Next, we used an optical trap equipped with a scanning confocal microscope to show that SWR1 can diffuse one dimensionally along stretched DNA, with a diffusion coefficient that permits scanning of a typical NDR in 93 ms. Interestingly, we see that ATP binding alone increases the one-dimensional diffusion coefficient of SWR1 along DNA. We found that a major DNA-binding subunit of the SWR1 complex, Swc2, also diffuses on DNA suggesting that it contributes to SWR1âs diffusivity. The diffusion coefficient for both SWR1 and Swc2 increases with ionic strength suggesting that SWR1 utilizes some microscopic dissociation and reassociation events, known as hopping, to diffuse on DNA. However, it is likely that SWR1 only makes infrequent hops, with most of the diffusion on DNA being mediated by helically coupled diffusion, known as sliding, since SWR1 diffusion is blocked by proteins that are bound to DNA, such as dCas9, and the diffusion of the complex is slower than would be expected for majority hopping diffusion. Finally, we observed SWR1 diffusion on DNA containing sparsely deposited nucleosomes and provide evidence that SWR1 diffusion is largely confined between nucleosomes. Our data indicate that a multisubunit chromatin remodeler can diffuse along DNA and suggests that in vivo SWR1 may find NDR-flanking nucleosomes through facilitated diffusion. 1D diffusion at NDRs may be an important aspect of SWR1 target search and potentially a common feature for chromatin remodelers that acts upon nucleosomes adjacent to the NDR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SWR1-binding kinetics depend on DNA length</title><p>To study both the DNA-binding kinetics and diffusive behavior of SWR1, we generated a site-specifically labeled complex referred to as Cy3-SWR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We purified SWR1 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> in the absence of the Swc7 subunit (SWR1ÎSwc7). Recombinant Swc7 was expressed and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a single cysteine in Swc7 was labeled with Cy3, and the labeled Swc7 was then added to the SWR1ÎSwc7 preparation between two steps of a specialized tandem affinity purification protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sun et al., 2020</xref>). Subsequent purification on a glycerol gradient revealed that the Cy3-labeled Swc7 comigrated with the rest of the SWR1 subunits, demonstrating incorporation of Swc7 back into the SWR1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The histone exchange activity of the labeled Cy3-SWR1 was identical to that of wild-type SWR1 as revealed by an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) which shows the histone exchange reaction progress as triple FLAG-tagged H2A.Z is incorporated into a mononucleosome substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>While it is well established that the affinity of SWR1 for DNA is dependent on DNA length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>), the kinetics of binding are unknown. We used TIRF (Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence) microscopy to perform single-molecule colocalization measurements to observe Cy3-SWR1 binding and unbinding on Cy5-labeled DNA of different lengths in real time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâG</xref>). These measurements showed that both the on-rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>bind</sub>) and the lifetime of the SWR1âDNA complex (<italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub>) are dependent on DNA length. The on-rate for SWR1 binding to 20 bp DNA, the approximate size of linker DNA between intragenic nucleosomes in yeast, was 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> M<sup>â1</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>. Increasing the DNA length to 150 bp, the approximate size of the NDR in yeast, significantly increased the binding rate 36-fold to 3.6 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> M<sup>â1</sup> s<sup>â1</sup>. <italic>k</italic><sub>bind</sub> increased linearly with DNA length between these two values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that as the effective concentration of DNA bp is increased, binding is also increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>; <italic>k</italic><sub>bind</sub> normalized by DNA length). This result suggests that longer DNA substrates may harbor more potential SWR1-binding sites. In support of this, we found that longer DNA molecules could accommodate multiple bound SWR1 molecules, with the likelihood of multiple binding events increasing with DNA length (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> for an example trace). Cy3-Swc7 alone exhibited no affinity for 150 bp DNA (data not shown), suggesting that the observed Cy3-signal increase is caused by the full Cy3âSWR1 complex binding to DNA.</p><p>The lifetime of SWR1 bound to DNA (<italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub>) was also sensitive to DNA length, exhibiting two sharp increases as DNA size increased from 20 to 40 and 60 to 100 bp. Whereas <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> for 20 bp DNA was 1.5 Â± 0.3 s, <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> for SWR1 binding to 40 and 60 bp DNA increased to 9 Â± 1.4 and 12 Â± 5.8 s, respectively, which is the same within error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Once the DNA was 80 bp or longer, however, the lifetime increased dramatically to at least 30 s, the photobleaching limit of our measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Measurements at lower laser power showed that SWR1 remained bound to 150 bp DNA with a life time of approximately 3 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> was unchanged in the presence of ATP but was sensitive to ionic strength, decreasing with added salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Curiously, <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> also decreased in the presence of competitor DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E, F</xref>). In our in vitro experimental setup, as DNA length is increased, SWR1 <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> showed an approximately 120-fold increase. Compared to the 36-fold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>bind</sub> as DNA length increased, the much higher fold increase in binding lifetime might suggest that once SWR1 binds NDR DNA in vivo that it will remain bound for several minutes, potentially sequestering the remodeler from performing histone exchange at other +1 nucleosome targets. The in vivo <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub>, however, is likely much shorter due to the higher ionic strength in cells as well as due to effects of molecular crowding, competitor DNA binding, and the activity of endogenous helicases which may oust DNA-bound factors such as SWR1. Indeed, a study utilizing single-particle tracking in vivo showed that the stable chromatin-bound dwell-time for a number of ATP-dependent remodelers is on the order of several seconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). The kinetic measurements presented here show that the affinity of SWR1 for DNA greater than 60 bp is primarily limited by the on-rate, suggesting the increased occupancy of SWR1 at longer NDRs observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>) is a result of the increased probability of SWR1 finding the NDR, as opposed to an increase in the residence time of SWR1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SWR1 scans DNA</title><p>To determine if SWR1 can move along DNA, we tracked single Cy3âSWR1 complexes bound to stretched lambda DNA using an optical trap equipped with a confocal scanning microscope (LUMICKS, C-Trap) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heller et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heller et al., 2014b</xref>).

Since diffusion coefficient distributions are nonnormal, <italic>D</italic><sub>1,obs</sub> is defined as the median diffusion coefficient of all molecules in a condition; individual diffusion coefficients were determined from the slope of the initially linear portion of their respective MSD plot (see Materials and methods for more details).

The MSDs of Cy3-SWR1 in the presence of ATP remained linear, showing that SWR1 does not translocate directionally on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The increased slope of the MSDs in the ATP condition, however, does indicate that ATP increases the diffusion. An overlay of all trajectories from both conditions further demonstrates that SWR1 diffuses a greater distance from the starting position in the presence of ATP and that its motion is not directional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To address whether this increased diffusion was due to ATP hydrolysis, we also measured SWR1 diffusion in the presence of 1 mM ATPÎ³S, a nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP, as well as with ADP. The distribution in diffusion coefficients in the presence of ATP and ATPÎ³S are both shifted to higher values compared to in the absence of ATP or in the presence of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This shift was shown to be statistically significant using the nonparametric MannâWhitney <italic>U</italic>-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). SWR1 diffusion in the presence of 1 mM ATP (<italic>D</italic><sub>1,obs =</sub> 0.024 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s Â± 0.001) was not significantly different than diffusion in the presence of 1 mM ATPÎ³S (<italic>D</italic><sub>1,obs =</sub> 0.026 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s Â± 0.002).

Both increased diffusion and decreased binding lifetimes are features of 1D hopping, as the more time a protein spends in microscopic dissociation and reassociation the faster it can move on DNA, but also falls off DNA more frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonnet et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirny et al., 2009</xref>).

The TIRF assay also shows that competitor DNA can decrease binding lifetime as would be expected for a protein that hops on DNA and may be prone to alternative binding onto competitor DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman et al., 2007</xref>).

This combined with the observation that high salt decreases the binding lifetime of Swc2 further supports that Swc2 and SWR1 engage in hopping during diffusion. An alternative explanation is that both SWR1 and Swc2 DBD may engage in a so-called âmonkey-barsâ mechanism in which binding at a second DNA-binding site promotes dissociation from DNA at the first bound site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rudolph et al., 2018</xref>). The Swc2 DBD is likely intrinsically disordered and may be able to bind multiple DNAs simultaneously, as may other DBDs on SWR1 subunits promoting binding onto competitor DNA.</p><p>The theoretical upper limit of diffusion for a particle that uses linear translocation (1D hopping) is higher than the theoretical upper limit of diffusion with helically coupled sliding because in the latter there are additional rotational components of friction incurred when circumnavigating the DNA axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blainey et al., 2009</xref>). Based on the molecular weight of SWR1 and Swc2, the theoretical upper limits of 1D diffusion using rotation-coupled versus -uncoupled 1D diffusion can be calculated (Materials and methods). In all conditions measured, the median diffusion of SWR1 is below the upper limit with rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), consistent with much of the observed diffusion coming from SWR1 engaging in rotationally coupled diffusion. Nonetheless, some individual traces have diffusion coefficients that surpass this theoretical maximum, indicating that there may be alternative modes for engaging with DNA (e.g., infrequent hopping), which allows it to surpass the upper limit with rotation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorman et al., 2010</xref>). A similar phenomenon was observed for Swc2 DBD, which also exhibited median diffusion coefficients below the theoretical maximum with rotation, with some traces having diffusion coefficients above this limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These trends are consistent with a model in which SWR1 utilizes a majority 1D helically coupled sliding with occasional hopping (or monkey bar-like movements) to diffuse on DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>SWR1 cannot bypass bound dCas9</title><p>While the NDR is a region of open chromatin where accessibility to DNA is higher compared to DNA in gene bodies, SWR1 must compete with transcription factors and other DNA-binding proteins for search on this DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kubik et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rhee and Pugh, 2012</xref>).

To investigate whether ATP-bound SWR1 can bypass protein barriers, we turned to dCas9, an endonuclease inactive mutant of Cas9, to serve as a programmable barrier to diffusion. We used a dual color single-particle tracking scheme to simultaneously observe Cy3-labeled SWR1 diffusion and the positions of Cy5-labeled dCas9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). crRNAs were used to direct dCas9 binding to 5 positions on the lambda DNA using previously validated targeting sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>,<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sternberg et al., 2014</xref>). We assume that dCas9 binding far outlasts the photobleaching lifetime of Cy5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh et al., 2016</xref>), therefore we use the average position of the particle to extend the trace after photobleaching of Cy5 for colocalization analysis. Out of 106 traces with colocalization events, 67% showed SWR1 moving away from dCas9 toward where it came from as if it was reflected from a boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B, C</xref>). Another 30% of traces showed SWR1 immobile and colocalized with dCas9 for the duration of the trace, which we describe as stuck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>). Only 3% of all colocalization events exhibited a crossover event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The ability of dCas9 to block SWR1 diffusion in most encounters further supports a model in which SWR1 mainly engages in helically coupled sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

The mean MSD for SWR1 on naked DNA increases linearly at short time scales (&lt;2 s), whereas the mean MSD for SWR1 on the lambda nucleosome array plateaus over this same time scale, indicative of confined 1D diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). The degree to which diffusion is confined can be described by <italic>Î±</italic> &lt; 1 where MSD = <italic>Dt</italic><sup><italic>Î±</italic></sup>. Whereas SWR1 on naked DNA has an <italic>Î±</italic> = 0.88 over a 2-s time scale, SWR1 on the lambda array has an <italic>Î±</italic> = 0.24 reflecting considerable confinement. By fitting the MSD curve to an exponential function, the mean MSD appears to approach a limit of 0.054 Î¼m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Assuming an even distribution of an average of 40 nucleosomes per array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), the mean distance between nucleosomes is equal to 0.35 Î¼m; whereas the length of DNA to which SWR1 diffusion is confined is approximately 0.23 Î¼m, determined from the square root of the MSD limit described above. Representative traces show signs of confinement, as more immobile segments dominate the trace and the range of SWR1 exploration becomes confined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Moreover, diffusion coefficients for traces on the nucleosome array are overall smaller, despite the presence of 1 mM ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). The percentage of traces exhibiting zero to low diffusion is increased in this condition, which is further seen when overlaying all trajectories of SWR1 diffusion in the absence versus the presence of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). These data, therefore, suggest that SWR1 diffusion is confined to the space between nucleosomes.</p><p>Instantaneous diffusion analysis of SWR1 bound to nucleosome arrays suggests that SWR1 may be transiently engaging the nucleosomes in the context of a 1D diffusion-mediated encounter. For this analysis, diffusion coefficients are calculated for all windows of 0.4 s in length, allowing for an understanding of how diffusivity changes over the length of a trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Aiding in the interpretation of overall trends, diffusion is assigned to one of three categories: fast diffusion (<italic>D</italic><sub>coef</sub> &gt; 0.04 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s), slow/immobile diffusion (<italic>D</italic><sub>coef</sub> &lt; 0.01 Âµm<sup>2</sup>/s), or medium diffusion (between the threshold values for fast and slow diffusion) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Slow and immobile are technically not distinguishable in this study as higher instrumental spatial and temporal resolution would be required. If SWR1 is engaging the nucleosome upon encounter, one may predict that SWR1 diffusion on the sparse nucleosome array would begin in high or medium diffusion and transition into a slow/immobile state.</p><p>In this study, a majority of DNA-binding events by SWR1 occurred before imaging was initiated; when averaging across the length all trajectories from the start of observation, SWR1 diffusion on the sparse nucleosome array does not decrease or exhibit a higher immobile fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). While this imaging setup limited the extent to which instantaneous diffusion analysis could be used to observe the initial nucleosome capture event, we did observe that the overall percentages within individual trajectories spent in the immobile state is drastically increased for nucleosome arrays, indicating a longer duration for the nucleosome-captured state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Furthermore, a dwell-time analysis of the SWR1 immobile state within trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2DâF</xref>) shows that SWR1 spends more time immobile on the nucleosome array as compared to on naked DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2F</xref>).

Without 1D sliding, the search process of SWR1 for its target nucleosome would be dependent solely on 3D collisions with nucleosomes. In the yeast genome, there are approximately 61,568 annotated nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang and Pugh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kubik et al., 2015</xref>), of which 4576 are identified as potential +1 nucleosomes enriched in H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tramantano et al., 2016</xref>). Since only 7% of nucleosomes are targets of SWR1 histone exchange, we believe that +1 nucleosomes use their adjacent NDRs as antennas, promoting SWR1 binding and 1D search to encounter flanking nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirny et al., 2009</xref>). This increased efficiency in target localization through dimensional reduction of the search process may be one that could extend to other chromatin remodelers that act on nucleosomes adjacent to the NDR, such as RSC, SWI/SNF, ISW2, and INO80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>While this study establishes for the first time that the chromatin remodeler SWR1 can diffuse on DNA, and that such diffusion is confined by dCas9 and nucleosomes, many questions remain. First, while SWR1 may be guided to its main target nucleosome, +1, via binding to the NDR, how SWR1 preferentially recognizes the +1 nucleosome over the â1 nucleosome on the other side of the NDR remains unanswered. While there is evidence that acetylation of the +1 nucleosome may help establish the directionality of the interaction when assessing the two NDR-flanking nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), data from our study indicate that even nucleosomes lacking acetylation can reduce the diffusion of the SWR1 complex possibly through nucleosome engagement. Therefore, it will be necessary to measure the fold difference in dwell-time on nucleosomes, in the context of 1D diffusion, that do and do not contain acetylation marks in order to determine the magnitude of the effect that the 1D search process would have on directing binding to the +1 to â1 nucleosome. Of note, there are times where both NDR-flanking nucleosomes will be substrates of SWR1 and are equally enriched for H2A.Z incorporation, as is the case when both nucleosomes are the +1 nucleosomes of divergently transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagchi et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, H2A.Z is preferentially enriched at inactive promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Li et al., 2005</xref>), this phenomenon should be revisited in the light of 1D diffusion as it is possible that regulatory mechanisms that affect transcription of these genes also impact the ease with which SWR1 can perform 1D diffusion.</p><p>Furthermore, the DNA used as a substrate in this study, lambda DNA, is different in mechanical properties, owing to differences in sequence composition, compared to yeast promoters and may therefore not be the most biologically representative substrate for studying 1D diffusion of SWR1. A sequencing study discovering the intrinsic flexibility of different DNA sequences helped establish that promoter NDR regions from yeast are highly rigid and this unique property compared to gene-body DNA helps instruct the chromatin remodeler, INO80, a close relative of SWR1, to position nucleosomes at the boundary of the rigid NDR helping to establish the defined positioning of the +1 nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basu et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that sensing changes in DNA rigidity while performing a 1D search could allow SWR1 to distinguish +1 from â1 nucleosomes. Finally, in our study, a distinction is not made between NDRs and nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) in contemplating the relevance of a 1D search mechanism in targeting SWR1 to the +1 nucleosome. The distinction between these two types of promoter architectures was recently further developed via the implementation of ChIP-exo/seq to comprehensively discover occupancies of fragile nucleosome in addition to bound transcription factors at yeast promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rossi et al., 2021</xref>). The complexity of the integrated transcriptional regulatory networks and 3D chromatin architecture is a caveat to the simplified model presented in this study and may limit the magnitude to which a 1D search process factors into target nucleosome-binding in vivo. Fragile nucleosomes in NDRs effectively shorten the length of nucleosome-free linker DNA proximal to the +1 nucleosome, diminishing the kinetic binding preference for that NDR. Fragile nucleosomes, in addition to transcription factors, may also impede diffusion, increasing the time scale required to encounter flanking nucleosomes via 1D diffusion. In vivo binding of SWR1, as shown via ChIP-seq, has already been shown to be reduced by fragile nucleosome occupancy of NDRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ranjan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Venters and Pugh, 2009</xref>). Therefore, while the observations presented in this study are an exciting launching point into studies of chromatin remodeler 1D diffusion, future work with additional promoter-binding proteins is needed to assess the relevance of these biophysical measurements to in vivo target binding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>ATP binding facilitates SWR1 target search and diffusion on DNA</title><p>We observed that SWR1 diffusion is increased in the presence of ATP, and that substitution with ATPÎ³S also results in similar increased diffusion suggesting that this enhancement is mediated by nucleotide binding rather than hydrolysis. SWR1 requires ATP to perform the histone exchange reaction, and basal levels of ATP hydrolysis when any one of the required substrates for the histone exchange reaction is missing is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luk et al., 2010</xref>). This includes the scenario where SWR1 is bound to DNA in the absence of the nucleosome and H2A.Z/H2B dimer. Therefore, we do not expect SWR1 diffusion in the presence of 1 mM ATP to be modulated by ATP hydrolysis, which is consistent with our findings. Binding of nucleotide cofactor has been shown to produce conformational changes in ATPases that can affect their diffusion on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman et al., 2007</xref>). The core ATPase domain of SWR1, Swr1, like other chromatin remodelers, belongs to the SF2 of translocases which have two lobes that switch between an open and closed conformation with ATP binding and hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nodelman et al., 2020</xref>). It is therefore possible that the ATP bound closed conformation of the core ATPase results in a DNA-binding interface, distributed across accessory domains, that is more conducive to diffusion on DNA, contributing to the enhanced diffusion of SWR1 in the presence of ATP or ATPÎ³S. In the present study, we further investigated a DNA-binding subunit, Swc2, which forms an extended interface with the core ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to the changes in the contacts that the translocase domain makes with DNA in the closed versus open form, it is possible that ATP modulates how Swc2 engages with the DNA through conformational changes propagated from Swr1. Swc2 appears to be an important accessory subunit for 1D diffusion, as we were able to show that in isolation, the DBD of Swc2 diffuses on DNA. We show that, like SWR1, Swc2 likely utilizing a combination of sliding and hopping to diffuse on DNA, while exhibiting a much-increased diffusion coefficient owning to its smaller size. Future studies will aim to address how ATP binding to the catalytic subunit may alter its conformation and/or that of Swc2 (or another DNA-binding component) leading to enhanced diffusion of the SWR1 complex.</p><p>Conformations that result in slower sliding presumably become trapped in free energy minima along the DNA where the DNA sequence or the presence of DNA lesions results in a more stably bound DNAâprotein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman et al., 2007</xref>). While it remains unknown whether SWR1 interacts with different sequences of DNA differently in the context of sliding, we believe this may be a possibility since we observe a distribution in diffusion coefficients within any single condition which would not be expected if the energetic costs of binding substrate were equal everywhere. The NDR is rich in AT-content; therefore, one might imagine that SWR1 may have evolved to be better at scanning DNA with high AT-content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chereji et al., 2018</xref>). Lambda DNA, the DNA substrate used in this study, has asymmetric AT-content, which has been shown to affect nucleosome positioning during random deposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Visnapuu and Greene, 2009</xref>). Future studies of chromatin remodeler 1D diffusion are needed to address this possibility.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SWR1 and Swc2 predominantly slide with diffusion confined between roadblocks</title><p>The way a protein engages with DNA during 1D search can have impacts on both scanning speed and target localization. For instance, a protein that maintains continuous contact with the DNA in part through chargeâcharge interactions with the phosphate backbone will predominantly utilize helically coupled sliding. By contrast, a protein that dissociates just far enough from the DNA for cation condensation on the phosphate backbone to occur before quickly reassociating will utilize linear hopping to perform short 3D searches before reassociating at a nearby site on the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mirny et al., 2009</xref>). Proteins that hop on DNA therefore have increased diffusion with increased monovalent cation concentration, as a higher screening potential results in more frequent hops. SWR1 and the DBD of the Swc2 subunit both become more diffusive as the concentration of potassium chloride is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), which indicates that both utilize some degree of hopping when diffusing on DNA.</p><p>Nonetheless, the observed diffusion for both SWR1 and Swc2, on average, falls within a range expected for a protein that predominantly uses a sliding mechanism to diffuse on DNA. In order for a protein to slide or hop on DNA, the energy barrier (Î<italic>G</italic><sup>â¡</sup>) to break the static interaction and dynamically engage with the DNA following the parameters of either the sliding or hopping model must be less than â2 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmadi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Slutsky and Mirny, 2004</xref>). Based on the molecular weight of SWR1 and Swc2, the upper limit of 1D diffusion was estimated for both the sliding and hopping model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, Materials and methods). The upper limit of diffusion coefficients for rotation-coupled sliding-only diffusion is lower than hopping-only diffusion due to the rotational component increasing friction in the sliding model. We found that most particles for either SWR1 or Swc2 fall below the estimated upper limit for sliding diffusion. This observation indicates that, averaged over the length of the trace, the energetic barrier to exclusively hop along DNA is too large, whereas the energy barrier for sliding diffusion is permissive (&lt;2 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>). Therefore, while both SWR1 and Swc2 DBD can engage in hopping, both on average utilize sliding diffusion as exhibited by their slow diffusion.</p><p>Sliding as a predominant component of the SWR1 interaction with DNA is further evidenced by the observation that SWR1 can neither bypass a dCas9 protein roadblock nor nucleosomes with high efficiency. Other studies have found that proteins that utilize sliding as the predominant form of 1D diffusion cannot bypass proteins or nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gorman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hedglin and OâBrien, 2010</xref>), whereas a protein that predominantly hops may be able to bypass these obstacles. The utilization of hopping diffusion has been described as a trade-off between scanning speed and accuracy, with proven implications in target sequence bypass by the transcription factor LacI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marklund et al., 2020</xref>). Whether the same may be true for chromatin remodelers in search of specific nucleosomes is yet to be reported.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Single-particle tracking in vivo has shown that approximately 47% of SWR1 molecules are bound to chromatin and the remainder is performing 3D diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>). Once bound (e.g., near the center of an average NDR of ~150 bp) our findings suggest that SWR1 would require 46 ms (see Materials and methods) to scan and encounter a flanking nucleosome by 1D diffusion at 0.024 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s. While our study lacks cellular data demonstrating the essentiality of 1D scanning for SWR1 target localization efficiency and SWR1 function in vivo, SWR1 bound to chromatin has been shown to have a bound-state diffusion coefficient that is ~twofold larger than the diffusion of chromatin itself (SWR1 D bound 0.063 Â± 0.0003 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s versus histone H2B D bound 0.028 Â± 0.0002 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ranjan et al., 2020</xref>). A later study found that other yeast chromatin remodelers that act on nucleosomes adjacent to the NDR (RSC, SWI/SNF, ISW2, and INO80) are similarly more diffusive than histone H2B in their chromatin-bound states, and are, similar to SWR1, dependent on the ability of their ATPase domains to bind or hydrolyze ATP in order to exhibit this enhanced bound diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2021</xref>). While several factors could result in this enhanced bound diffusion, such as enhanced diffusion of promoter chromatin or intersegmental transfer of SWR1 (a topic not explored in our study), 1D diffusion may be an important contributor to this enhanced chromatin-bound diffusion. A single-molecule TIRF study on the molecular mechanism of the SWR1 histone exchange reaction recently reported that when complexed with a canonical nucleosome and the H2A.ZâH2B dimer, SWR1 can rapidly perform the ATP hydrolysis-dependent histone exchange reaction on average in 2.4 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poyton et al., 2022</xref>). The SWR1-catalyzed histone H2A.Z exchange on chromatin may therefore be an intrinsically rapid event that occurs on a time scale of seconds. While 1D diffusion should in principle allow SWR1 to encounter either the +1 or â1 nucleosome at the ends of an NDR, we anticipate that future studies of diffusion toward acetylated nucleosomes may provide insights on how the complex is preferentially enriched at the +1 nucleosome that bears a higher level of histone acetylation. Future investigations should consider analysis of 1D diffusion on nucleosome arrays that mimic the natural nucleosome arrangement and histone modifications of NDRs and gene bodies and will provide important biophysical and temporal insights on how SWR1 undergoes target search to capture its nucleosome substrates at gene promoters. They might also include an investigation of mutations to SWR1 subunits that permit histone exchange but abrogate diffusivity on DNA, which would establish the importance of this biophysical property to SWR1 activity in vivo. Extension of this approach to other ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers and histone modification enzymes will facilitate understanding of the cooperating and competing processes on chromatin resulting in permissive or nonpermissive architectures for eukaryotic transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein purification, fluorescence labeling, and functional validation (SWR1 and Swc2)</title><p>The SWR1 complex labeled only on Swc7 was constructed as has been previously documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poyton et al., 2022</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sebastian Deindl (Reviewer #2); Tom Owen-Hughes (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please note that only textual changes are required, but you may consider including additional data as indicated below. In addition, clarifications in the text that point out the limitations of the study and that not all of SWR1 function (i.e. directionality of H2AZ incorporation) is explained are indicated below.</p><p>1) The effect of ATP on the diffusion is very intriguing and strongly suggests the involvement of the Swr1 subunit. The authors could consider analyzing the diffusion of the motor subunit Swr1. This should enable a distinction between the direct change in sliding properties of the Swr1 helicase domains vs the allosteric effect on the Swc2 conformation.</p><p>2) In the presence of nucleosomes, specific binding of SWR1 should occur. More specifically, one could expect SWR1 to first bind randomly and start diffusing before finally encountering a nucleosome and forming a long-lived complex. Were the authors able to observe it? It would be very helpful if the authors added a more detailed description of the SWR1 behavior they observed in the presence of nucleosomes, including a quantification of immobile SWR1 molecules as a function of time after initial binding to DNA â the expectation would be that the fraction of immobile SWR1 molecules would increase due to nucleosome binding. The authors could strengthen the manuscript if they conducted SWR1 diffusion experiments in the presence of labeled nucleosomes, which should help answer these questions and enable more confident conclusions.</p><p>3) Lines 349-351: &quot;Î DNA, the DNA substrate used in this study, has asymmetric AT-content, which has been shown to affect nucleosome positioning during random deposition&quot; â could the authors plot the distribution of SWR1 diffusion coefficients as a function of the position on the substrate? Even when the Î»-DNA orientation is not known, the effect of sequence (e.g. AT-content) on diffusion should be apparent in such a plot.</p><p>4) The authors may consider discussing in more quantitative terms the magnitude of the effect that the 1D search process could have on directing SWR1 towards +1 nucleosomes. It would seem that a comparison with -1 nucleosomes, where 1D diffusion is expected to have the same effect as for +1, could be rather informative.</p><p>5) The alternative explanation for an increased dissociation of SWR1 in the presence of competitor DNA could be a &quot;monkey bar&quot; mechanism, where multiple DNA binding sites can engage in interactions with different DNA molecules, thus facilitating dissociation. The authors could probe this hypothesis by measuring toff for Swc2 with and without competitor DNA. If the &quot;monkey-bar&quot; mechanism were true, Swc2 dissociation should not be significantly affected by competitor DNA, since it's only one of several DNA binding domains of SWR1, whereas if the original effect was caused by hopping, competitor DNA should still significantly enhance Swc2 dissociation.</p><p>6) It's clear that the association of SWR1 complexes with DNA is affected by the length of the fragment. The major limitation of the study is that it does not establish whether these properties are required for correct targeting activity in vivo.</p><p>7) It's much more difficult to test this, and likely beyond the scope of this study. One way might be to identify mutations that affect the diffusive motion of SWR1 complexes but not their activity in histone exchange. In the absence of data of this nature it is important the manuscript acknowledges that further work would be required to establish that the biophysical properties reported here in vitro are rate limiting for SWR1 action in vivo.</p><p>8) Other issues that appear not to be addressed by the model include that there is not a universally accepted view on what factors are bound to f NDR's. Some studies have suggested that fragile nuclease sensitive sub nucleosomes are present within NDR's other that transcription factors are dynamically associated with these regions. The presence of either would affect the effective length in the NDR and reduce its ability to influence SWR1 targeting via the mechanism proposed here.</p><p>9) DNA fragment length is observed to have a larger effect on the off rate of SWR1 complexes (300-fold), than the on rate (30-fold). If SWR1 complexes are stably associated with longer regions of free DNA, this may impede their association with nucleosomes where the complex acts to incorporate H2AZ.</p><p>10) Although the presence of relatively accessible DNA may explain some aspects of the targeting of SWR1 complexes, it does not explain why H2AZ is incorporated into +1 nucleosomes to a greater extent than -1 nucleosomes. As a result the one dimensional diffusion model is unable to explain all aspects of SWR1 targeting.</p><p>11) Limitations of the biophysical measurements reported in the manuscript in the absence of corroborative evidence relating to SWR1 function in cells should be included in the discussion.</p><p>12. While it would require additional methods and perhaps beyond the scope of the current studies addressing the following questions could increase the impact of the paper. Can the authors show that diffusion by SWR1 actually enhances H2AZ exchange into nucleosomes? The directionality of H2AZ insertion (+1 vs -1 nucleosomes) is an outstanding question that the authors only elude to in the discussion. Can the authors show that histone acetylation anchors SWR1 to the +1 nucleosome or show that acetylated nucleosomes are preferentially exchanged with H2AZ? Such experiments would support their suggestion regarding directionality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77352.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please note that only textual changes are required, but you may consider including additional data as indicated below.

The revised manuscript includes a more thorough discussion on the limitations of our in vitro diffusion measurement on fully explaining in vivo SWR1 behavior and function. Moreover, we performed additional TIRF measurements to address how Swc2 binding to dsDNA is affected by competitor DNA. Finally, we made the corrections noted in the minor points section and we have performed the suggested supplemental data analyses. The resulting manuscript is a stronger and more complete work, which we believe is suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The effect of ATP on the diffusion is very intriguing and strongly suggests the involvement of the Swr1 subunit.

Indeed, the Wu lab has noted that the Swr1 subunit aggregates when expressed alone. Thus, more complex schemes are necessary to investigate whether ATP-binding increases diffusion of the complex by direct conformational changes of Swr1 and/or by allosteric effects on the conformation of Swc2. This is an interesting problem for future investigations and is now noted in the first paragraph of the second section of the Discussion.</p><p>âFuture studies will aim to address how ATP-binding to the catalytic subunit may alter its conformation and/or that of Swc2 (or another DNA binding component) leading to enhanced diffusion of the SWR1 complex.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the presence of nucleosomes, specific binding of SWR1 should occur.

We have performed instantaneous diffusion analysis of SWR1 diffusion on naked DNA, on nucleosome arrays, as well as for dCas9, and used this to explore the predictions mentioned by the reviewers. Due to technical considerations for all of our optical tweezer experiments, we are unable to resolve the initial nucleosome binding event as most SWR1 particles were already bound to the array and exhibiting a nucleosome-captured state at the start of imaging. This is best seen in Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2B, which shows that the mean instantaneous diffusion coefficient doesnât decrease over time after the start of the trace observation, nor does the percentage of all traces in an immobile state increase over time. We agree that using labeled nucleosomes would strengthen our claims on SWR1 diffusion in the presence of nucleosomes; however, we are still in the process of optimizing a long-lived fluorescent label on the nucleosome for the optical tweezers set-up.</p><p>The results of this analysis are now included in Figure 6 âfigure supplement 2. Our interpretations are now found as the third paragraph in the Results section entitled âNucleosomes are barriers to SWR1 diffusionâ.</p><p>In addition to the new analysis, we also added two panels to Figure 6 âfigure supplement 1 (D-E) which demonstrate that the diffusive behavior of SWR1 on the nucleosome array is confined, further strengthening the claims initially presented.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Lines 349-351: &quot;Î DNA, the DNA substrate used in this study, has asymmetric AT-content, which has been shown to affect nucleosome positioning during random deposition&quot; â could the authors plot the distribution of SWR1 diffusion coefficients as a function of the position on the substrate? Even when the Î»-DNA orientation is not known, the effect of sequence (e.g. AT-content) on diffusion should be apparent in such a plot.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. Since we did not collect the data in a way that would ensure that we could correlate the position of the particle with the underlying sequence of the DNA, we cannot provide conclusive evidence for a correlation between diffusion coefficient and underlying AT-content. In order to address the reviewerâs request, we plotted the mean instantaneous diffusion coefficient as a function of the position along the substrate (measured in pixels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and found that the diffusion coefficient does not significantly vary as a function of position (the differences between positions fall within the standard deviation of the mean of all other sites on the substrate). Note that the AT content, averaged over two different DNA orientations, does show a slight peak in the center of the DNA. Based on this analysis, the diffusion coefficients do not display a correlated or anticorrelated relationship with AT-content.</p><p>We believe that future work should address the possibility that there is a difference in mobility of the SWR1 remodeler on DNA based on AT-content. This could be accomplished by using fiducial markers on the DNA to better align the DNA sequence with the position of the bound diffusing chromatin remodeler. Another possibility is to create a sequence with well-defined repeats of biologically relevant sites of high vs low AT content. Yeast promoters are known to be higher in AT-content and a model promoter/ NDR might serve as a better substrate for studying differences in diffusion based on underlying sequence composition. It is possible that the rigidity of such sequences may modulate the free energy barrier required for 1D scanning of these regions of open chromatin resulting in difference in mobility of the remodeler.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Changes in instantaneous diffusion coefficient as a function of position along the DNA substrate.</title><p>(A) The AT-content along the Î phage genome is plotted in both orientations, revealing an asymmetric distribution of AT-content directionally across the genome.

It would seem that a comparison with -1 nucleosomes, where 1D diffusion is expected to have the same effect as for +1, could be rather informative.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that deserved more attention in the manuscript. We have added the following paragraphs to the first part of the Discussion section âReducing the dimensionality of nucleosome target searchâ, which we believe addresses the concerns raised by the reviewer:</p><p>âWhile this study establishes for the first time that the chromatin remodeler SWR1 can diffuse on DNA, and that such diffusion is confined by dCas9 and nucleosomes, many questions remain. First, while SWR1 may be guided to its main target nucleosome, +1, via binding to the NDR, how SWR1 preferentially recognizes the +1 nucleosome over the -1 nucleosome on the other side of the NDR remains unanswered. While there is evidence that acetylation of the +1 nucleosome may help establish the directionality of the interaction when assessing the two NDR flanking nucleosomes (Ranjan et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2005), data from our study indicates that even nucleosomes lacking acetylation can reduce the diffusion of the SWR1 complex possibly through nucleosome engagement. Therefore, it will be necessary to measure the fold difference in dwell time on nucleosomes, in the context of 1D diffusion, that do and do not contain acetylation marks in order to determine the magnitude of the effect that the 1D search process would have on directing binding to the +1 vs -1 nucleosome. Of note, there are times where both NDR flanking nucleosomes will be substrates of SWR1 and are equally enriched for H2A.Z incorporation, as is the case when both nucleosomes are the +1 nucleosomes of divergently transcribed genes (Bagchi et al., 2020). Additionally, H2A.Z is preferentially enriched at inactive promoters (Li et al., 2005); this phenomenon should be revisited in the light of 1D diffusion as it is possible that regulatory mechanisms that affect transcription of these genes also impact the ease with which SWR1 can perform 1D diffusion.</p><p>Furthermore, the DNA used as a substrate in this study, Î» DNA, is different in mechanical properties, owing to differences in sequence composition, compared to yeast promoters and may therefore not be the most biologically representative substrate for studying 1D diffusion of SWR1. A sequencing study discovering the intrinsic flexibility of different DNA sequences helped establish that promoter NDR regions from yeast are highly rigid and this unique property compared to gene body DNA helps instruct the chromatin remodeler, INO80, a close relative of SWR1, to position nucleosomes at the boundary of the rigid NDR helping to establish the defined positioning of the +1 nucleosome (Basu et al., 2021). It is possible that sensing changes in DNA rigidity while performing a 1D search could allow SWR1 to distinguish +1 from -1 nucleosomes. Finally, in our study, a distinction is not made between nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) and nucleosome free regions (NFRs) in contemplating the relevance of a 1D search mechanism in targeting SWR1 to the +1 nucleosome. The distinction between these two types of promoter architectures was recently further developed via the implementation of ChIPâexo/seq to comprehensively discover occupancies of fragile nucleosome in addition to bound transcription factors at yeast promoters (Rossi et al., 2021). The complexity of the integrated transcriptional regulatory networks and 3D chromatin architecture is a caveat to the simplified model presented in this study and may limit the magnitude to which a 1D search process factors into target nucleosome binding in vivo. Fragile nucleosomes in NDRs effectively shorten the length of nucleosome free linker DNA proximal to the +1 nucleosome, diminishing the kinetic binding preference for that NDR. Fragile nucleosomes, in addition to transcription factors, may also impede diffusion, increasing the timescale required to encounter flanking nucleosomes via 1D diffusion. in vivo binding of SWR1, as shown via ChIP-seq, has already been shown to be reduced by fragile nucleosome occupancy of NDRs (Ranjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Venters and Pugh, 2009). Therefore, while the observations presented in this study are an exciting launching point into studies of chromatin remodeler 1D diffusion, future work with additional promoter-binding proteins is needed to assess the relevance of these biophysical measurements to in vivo target binding.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The alternative explanation for an increased dissociation of SWR1 in the presence of competitor DNA could be a &quot;monkey bar&quot; mechanism, where multiple DNA binding sites can engage in interactions with different DNA molecules, thus facilitating dissociation. The authors could probe this hypothesis by measuring toff for Swc2 with and without competitor DNA. If the &quot;monkey-bar&quot; mechanism were true, Swc2 dissociation should not be significantly affected by competitor DNA, since it's only one of several DNA binding domains of SWR1, whereas if the original effect was caused by hopping, competitor DNA should still significantly enhance Swc2 dissociation.</p></disp-quote><p>This was a very interesting suggestion. We decided to probe this hypothesis by measuring t<sub>bound</sub> for Swc2 with and without competitor DNA (as well as in the presence of high salt) as the reviewer suggested and observed that Swc2 DBD alone experiences shortened binding lifetime in the presence of DNA. We did not rule out the possibility of SWR1 and Swc2 utilizing a monkey-bars mechanism since the DNA binding domain of Swc2 is likely disordered and may be able to make interactions with multiple pieces of DNA simultaneously inducing a monkey-bar exchange. In addition to appending the additional data to Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1G-H, we added the following to the Results in the section discussing SWR1 and Swc2 hopping versus sliding:</p><p>âWe also observed the effects of competitor DNA on Swc2 DNA binding domain dwell-time under the same conditions (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1G-H). Like SWR1, Swc2 DBD experienced shortened dwell-times in the presence of competitor DNA (Figure 1 âfigure supplement 1H). This combined with the observation that high salt decreases the binding lifetime of Swc2 in the context of TIRF imaging further supports that Swc2 and SWR1 engage in hopping during diffusion. An alternative explanation for why competitor DNA shortens binding lifetime is that both SWR1 and Swc2 DBD may engage in a so-called âmonkey-barsâ mechanism in which binding at a second DNA binding site promotes dissociation from DNA at the first bound site (Rudolph et al., 2018). This mechanism cannot be ruled out by our observations since Swc2 DBD is likely intrinsically disordered and may be able to bind multiple DNA simultaneously similar to how distant DNA binding domains on the SWR1 complex may promote exchange onto competitor DNA.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It's clear that the association of SWR1 complexes with DNA is affected by the length of the fragment. The major limitation of the study is that it does not establish whether these properties are required for correct targeting activity in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the reviewer is correct, there is prior literature reporting that SWR1, in vivo<italic>,</italic> accumulates at promoters with longer nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs), as seen by SWR1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), (Ranjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013; Venters and Pugh, 2009). The referenced study used partial and full MNase digestions showing that the fragile nucleosome occupancy of some NDRs affects the SWR1 occupancy trend; fragile nucleosomes in the middle of long NDRs effectively shortens the region of long nucleosome free DNA resulting in decreased SWR1 targeting to these promoters. In our initial submission, we left this unaddressed in the text, and have further clarified these points in the third paragraph of the first section of the discussion titled âReducing the dimensionality of nucleosome target searchâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It's much more difficult to test this, and likely beyond the scope of this study. One way might be to identify mutations that affect the diffusive motion of SWR1 complexes but not their activity in histone exchange. In the absence of data of this nature it is important the manuscript acknowledges that further work would be required to establish that the biophysical properties reported here in vitro are rate limiting for SWR1 action in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and have added the potential usefulness of discovering such mutants to our conclusions section:</p><p>âThey [<italic>in reference to future studies</italic>] might also include an investigation of mutations to SWR1 subunits that permit histone exchange but abrogate diffusivity on DNA, which would establish the importance of this biophysical property to SWR1 activity in vivo.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Other issues that appear not to be addressed by the model include that there is not a universally accepted view on what factors are bound to f NDR's. Some studies have suggested that fragile nuclease sensitive sub nucleosomes are present within NDR's other that transcription factors are dynamically associated with these regions. The presence of either would affect the effective length in the NDR and reduce its ability to influence SWR1 targeting via the mechanism proposed here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We have cited the referenced paper that better characterized the occupancy of fragile nucleosomes and TFs at yeast NDRs, and have mentioned the caveats that such in vivo complexity of integrated transcription regulatory networks would pose to the simplified model we present in this study based on in vitro observations. The following was added to the third paragraph of the Discussion section titled âReducing the dimensionality of nucleosome target searchâ:</p><p>âFinally, in our study, a distinction is not made between nucleosome depleted regions (NDRs) and nucleosome free regions (NFRs) in contemplating the relevance of a 1D search mechanism in targeting SWR1 to the +1 nucleosome.

If SWR1 complexes are stably associated with longer regions of free DNA, this may impede their association with nucleosomes where the complex acts to incorporate H2AZ.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have changed the text to clarify our understanding that the increase in on-rate as a function of DNA length may in fact be best translated to understanding SWR1 targeting to +1 nucleosomes in vivo, and that the decrease in off-rate with DNA length, seen in vitro, is more likely to be affected by the cellular environment in vivo. Ultimately, the photobleaching-limited lifetime of SWR1 binding to DNA in our set-up allowed us to make an extended observation time of single diffusing SWR1 particles, enabling the characterization of the biophysical properties of SWR1 1D diffusion using the cTrap. We have added the following to the end of the first Results section alongside the presentation of the TIRF data:</p><p>âMeasurements at lower laser power showed that SWR1 remained bound to 150Â bp DNA with a half-life of approximately 3 minutes (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C). <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> was unchanged in the presence of ATP but was sensitive to ionic strength, decreasing with added salt (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E-F). Curiously, <italic>t</italic><sub>bound</sub> also decreased in the presence of competitor DNA (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E-F). In our in vitro experimental set-up, as DNA length is increased, SWR1 t-bound showed an approximately 120-fold increase. Compared to the 36-fold increase in k-bind as DNA length increased, the much higher fold increase in binding lifetime might suggest that once SWR1 binds NDR DNA in vivo that it will remain bound for several minutes, potentially sequestering the remodeler from performing histone exchange at other +1 nucleosome targets. The in vivo t-bound, however, is likely much shorter due to the higher ionic strength in cells as well as due to effects of molecular crowding, competitor DNA binding, and the activity of endogenous helicases which may oust DNA bound factors such as SWR1. Indeed, a study utilizing single particle tracking in vivo showed that the stable chromatin bound dwell-time for a number of ATP-dependent remodelers is on the order of several seconds (Kim et al., 2021).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Although the presence of relatively accessible DNA may explain some aspects of the targeting of SWR1 complexes, it does not explain why H2AZ is incorporated into +1 nucleosomes to a greater extent than -1 nucleosomes. As a result the one dimensional diffusion model is unable to explain all aspects of SWR1 targeting.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. We have clarified this point in the second and third paragraph of the first section of the discussion titled âReducing the dimensionality of nucleosome target searchâ as well as in the concluding paragraph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Limitations of the biophysical measurements reported in the manuscript in the absence of corroborative evidence relating to SWR1 function in cells should be included in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers. However, previous studies have shown that SWR1 diffusion when bound to chromatin is larger than the diffusion of H2B incorporated on chromatin (Ranjan et al., 2020); this was also comprehensively shown for many other yeast chromatin remodelers in a separate study (Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). We have added this information to the Discussion section and have also stressed at the reviewersâ suggestion that without using mutants of SWR1 which are defective for DNA binding/ DNA scanning, we do not have in vivo cell data that demonstrates the essentiality of DNA binding/ DNA scanning to SWR1 function. Such data would indicate the magnitude to which SWR1 DNA binding and scanning affects H2A.Z incorporation in vivo.</p><p>The following was added to the concluding paragraph:</p><p>âWhile our study lacks cellular data demonstrating the essentiality of 1D scanning for SWR1 target localization efficiency and SWR1 function in vivo, SWR1 bound to chromatin has been shown to have a bound state diffusion coefficient that is ~2-fold larger than the diffusion of chromatin itself (SWR1 D bound 0.063 +/- 0.0003 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/sec versus histone H2B D bound 0.028+/- 0.0002 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/sec) (Ranjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). A later study found that other yeast chromatin remodelers that act on nucleosomes adjacent to the NDR (RSC, SWI/SNF, ISW2, and INO80) are similarly more diffusive than histone H2B in their chromatin-bound states, and are, similar to SWR1, dependent on the ability of their ATPase domains to bind or hydrolyze ATP in order to exhibit this enhanced bound diffusion (Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2021). While several factors could result in this enhanced bound diffusion, such as enhanced diffusion of promoter chromatin or intersegmental transfer of SWR1 (a topic not explored in our study), 1D diffusion may be an important contributor to this enhanced chromatin bound diffusion.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. While it would require additional methods and perhaps beyond the scope of the current studies addressing the following questions could increase the impact of the paper. Can the authors show that diffusion by SWR1 actually enhances H2AZ exchange into nucleosomes? The directionality of H2AZ insertion (+1 vs -1 nucleosomes) is an outstanding question that the authors only elude to in the discussion. Can the authors show that histone acetylation anchors SWR1 to the +1 nucleosome or show that acetylated nucleosomes are preferentially exchanged with H2AZ? Such experiments would support their suggestion regarding directionality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their comments which foreshadow future directions for this project involving the use of acetylated nucleosomes reconstituted on Î» DNA on the optical trap combined with 3-color nucleosome FRET to detect histone exchange on encounter by SWR1 (Poyton et al. 2022). Note that it has already been shown that, in a competition assay using dinucleosomes with linker DNA the length of a typical yeast NDR, SWR1 preferentially exchanges acetylated nucleosomes over unacetylated nucleosomes [See Figure 5, panel B from the referenced study] (Ranjan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2013).</p><p>Our labs are in the process of optimizing fluorescently labeled nucleosomes which can be used to determine if acetylated nucleosomes anchor SWR1 binding, as suggested by the reviewers. We are also in the process of optimizing an instantaneous diffusion analysis pipeline required to perform this dwell-time analysis.</p><p>We have revised the conclusion to clarify these points by adding:</p><p>âWhile 1D diffusion should in principle allow SWR1 to encounter either the +1 or -1 nucleosome at the ends of an NDR, we anticipate that future studies of diffusion towards acetylated nucleosomes may provide insights on how the complex is preferentially enriched at the +1 nucleosome that bears a higher level of histone acetylation.</p><p>References:</p><p>Bagchi, D.N., Battenhouse, A.M., Park, D., and Iyer, V.R.
