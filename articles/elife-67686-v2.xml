Within arthropods, these maternally transmitted bacteria can selfishly hijack host reproductive processes to increase the relative fitness of their transmitting females. One such form of reproductive parasitism called male killing, or the selective killing of infected males, is recapitulated to degrees by transgenic expression of the prophage <italic>WO-mediated killing</italic> (<italic>wmk</italic>) gene. Here, we characterize the genotype-phenotype landscape of <italic>wmk-</italic>induced male killing in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> using transgenic expression. While phylogenetically distant <italic>wmk</italic> homologs induce no sex-ratio bias, closely-related homologs exhibit complex phenotypes spanning no death, male death, or death of all hosts. We demonstrate that alternative start codons, synonymous codons, and notably a single synonymous nucleotide in <italic>wmk</italic> can ablate killing. These findings reveal previously unrecognized features of transgenic <italic>wmk</italic>-induced killing and establish new hypotheses for the impacts of post-transcriptional processes in male killing variation. We conclude that synonymous sequence changes are not necessarily silent in nested endosymbiotic interactions with life-or-death consequences.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Wolbachia</kwd><kwd>male killing</kwd><kwd>transgenics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21 AI133522</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordenstein</surname><given-names>Seth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AI143152</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmutter</surname><given-names>Jessamyn I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Vanderbilt Microbiome Innovation Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>General Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordenstein</surname><given-names>Seth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmutter</surname><given-names>Jessamyn I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI 2109772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perlmutter</surname><given-names>Jessamyn I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An endosymbiont transgene in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> exhibits remarkable phenotypic sensitivity, including to synonymous codon changes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Wolbachia</italic> are maternally transmitted, obligate intracellular bacteria primarily residing in the cells of germline tissues in many arthropod species worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hurst and Frost, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Taylor et al., 2018</xref>.) To facilitate their spread through the host matriline, these bacteria hijack sex ratios, sex determination systems, and embryonic viability to cause various reproductive parasitism phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yen and Barr, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bouchon et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hunter, 1999</xref>). One such phenotype is male killing, whereby sons of infected females are selectively killed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hurst and Jiggins, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charlat et al., 2005</xref>). Male killing selfishly drives the spread of the bacteria when, for instance, brothers and sisters compete for limited resources, and male lethality yields females (the transmitters) a relative fitness benefit due to reduced competition with fewer siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jaenike et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Unckless and Jaenike, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Skinner, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hurst, 1997</xref>). This form of reproductive parasitism can have profound impacts on host behavior and evolution, including a sex role reversal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jiggins et al., 2000</xref>), host nuclear genome changes to resist the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Majerus and Majerus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>), and potentially host population extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groenenboom and Hogeweg, 2002</xref>). Population modelling also suggests male killing may be deployed as a control method to crash the population size of arthropod pests and disease vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berec et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Many lines of evidence suggest a complex relationship between male-killing genotype and phenotype. For example, male killing can be suppressed by host background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Majerus and Majerus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hornett et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaenike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitsuhashi et al., 2011</xref>), where male hosts exhibit resistance to the phenotype even in the presence of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In addition, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> that do not cause male killing in one host species can cause male killing in a second host species upon introgression or transfer to a naÃ¯ve host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaenike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, some strains induce death at different host developmental stages (embryo vs. larvae) or across different sex determination systems (ZW lepidopterans, XY dipterans, XO arachnids), and the number of surviving males may vary widely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riparbelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeh et al., 2005</xref>). Such findings specify that the expression of male killing, and particularly the genotype-phenotype relationship in these symbioses, is more complex than simply the presence or absence of a male-killing gene.</p><p>We recently identified a male-killing candidate gene, <italic>wmk</italic> (<italic>WO-mediated killing</italic>), from prophage WO in the <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strain of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> based on comparative genomic, transgenic, and cytological approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordenstein and Bordenstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>). It is a putative transcription factor with two predicted helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding domains, and transgenic expression in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos recapitulates many cytological and molecular aspects of male killing including accumulation of DNA damage in male embryos that overlaps with sites of dosage compensation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riparbelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harumoto et al., 2018</xref>). The <italic>wmk</italic> gene and two cytoplasmic incompatibility factor (<italic>cif</italic>) genes that underlie cytoplasmic incompatibility (a parasitism phenotype whereby offspring die in crosses between infected males and uninfected females) occur nearby specifically in the eukaryotic association module (EAM) of prophage WO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordenstein and Bordenstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">LePage et al., 2017</xref>), which refers to the phage genome that is inserted into the bacterial chromosome. The EAM is common in WO phages across several <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masui et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wu et al., 2004</xref>) and is rich in genes that are homologous to eukaryotic genes or annotated with eukaryotic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bordenstein and Bordenstein, 2016</xref>). As such, the expression of reproductive parasitism genes from the EAM and tripartite interactions between phage WO, <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, and eukaryotic hosts are central to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>âs ability to interact with and modify host reproduction.</p><p>The discovery of <italic>wmk</italic> has now enabled investigation of the impacts of genetic variation on the transgenic male-killing phenotype. Although the role of <italic>wmk</italic> in male killing has not yet been assessed in nature, evidence based on native <italic>wmk</italic> genotypes and transgenic <italic>wmk</italic> expression in flies suggest refined intricacy to the interactions between genotype and phenotype. For example, the native <italic>Wolbachia wmk</italic> homologs in three closely-related strains (<italic>w</italic>Mel of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>w</italic>Rec of <italic>D. recens</italic>, and <italic>w</italic>Suzi of <italic>D. suzukii</italic>) have nearly identical nucleotide sequences that vary by one to three SNPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>), and yet these strains induce different forms of reproductive parasitism. <italic>w</italic>Mel and <italic>w</italic>Rec induce cytoplasmic incompatibility, <italic>w</italic>Rec also causes male killing in some strains of a sister species, and <italic>w</italic>Suzi is not known to induce any reproductive phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaenike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamm et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoffmann, 1988</xref>). Previous transgenic testing also demonstrated that addition of nine additional amino acids to the N-terminal region of the Wmk protein at the site of a putative alternative start codon ablates the phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perlmutter et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, the Wmk N-terminus is particularly sensitive to genetic alterations, which is notable since small modifications such as protein tags in this location are often common additions to proteins that do not typically interfere with function. Furthermore, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> does not harbor <italic>Wolbachia</italic> known to cause male killing, although transgenic <italic>wmk</italic> expression recapitulates the phenotype in this host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>), and the <italic>w</italic>Mel strain is most closely-related to the <italic>w</italic>Rec male-killing strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Metcalf et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, some <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> contain male-killing <italic>Spiroplasma</italic> symbionts whose plasmid gene <italic>Spaid</italic> can also transgenically recapitulate male killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harumoto and Lemaitre, 2018</xref>). In summary, the evidence for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and <italic>wmk</italic> transgenic male killing suggests an intricate and multifaceted genotype-phenotype landscape.</p><p>Building on this background, several key questions emerge: Do closely-related or distantly-related homologs induce male killing? How sensitive is the <italic>wmk</italic> phenotype to small or large genetic changes? And how adapted are <italic>wmk</italic> homologs to their arthropod hosts? Here, we evaluate codon-optimized <italic>wmk</italic> homologs that span a spectrum of genetic divergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), including homologs (i) from distantly-related hosts, (ii) with putative upstream alternative start codons, (iii) with a single amino acid change, or (iv) with one or more synonymous codon changes, all in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> host. In this way, we aimed to investigate how a variety of genetic alterations to <italic>wmk</italic>, from a single synonymous nucleotide to the gene level, affect the phenotype. In particular, we hypothesized that divergent strains would not induce the phenotype due to co-adaptation with a distantly-related host. We also anticipated that the alternative start codons would inhibit function based on previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perlmutter et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we hypothesized that neither a single amino acid change nor synonymous codon changes would alter the male-killing phenotype. We report that while distant homologs do not cause a male-killing phenotype in this host, single amino acid and synonymous nucleotide changes remarkably do alter the phenotype. Thus, <italic>wmk</italic> male killing is sensitive to the full spectrum of genetic alterations at a fine-scale level not previously recognized. Notably, synonymous sequence changes and post-transcriptional processes appear to play a role in controlling the genotype-phenotype relationships that underpin <italic>wmk</italic> male killing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overview of experimental design.</title><p>To investigate the genotype-phenotype landscape, we transgenically expressed <italic>wmk</italic> homologs with varying degrees of genetic changes.

Compared to <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic>, these transgenes were either divergent homologs from other <italic>Wolbachia</italic> strains, a homolog with a single amino acid change, homologs with an additional nine codons at the 5â ends of the genes starting at an alternative upstream start codon, or variants with a single synonymous codon or nucleotide difference. These genotypes resulted in varying degrees of RNA sequence- and amino acid-level changes.

Of particular note, transgenic <italic>w</italic>Suzi <italic>wmk</italic> (all killing) and the original transgenic <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic> sequence (male killing) produce proteins of the exact same amino acid sequence, but they shared only a 91% sequence identity in the codon-optimized transgene, largely due to an updated codon optimization algorithm. Codon optimization is the norm in transgenic symbiosis research under the common assumption that synonymous codons are functionally redundant. However, codon optimization algorithms often choose a codon based on factors including codon adaptation, mRNA folding, regulatory motifs, nucleotide bias, or codon correlations and biases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). With even a few different codons input into the algorithm as well as algorithm updates over the years, the tested transgenes had different nucleotide sequences.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned results, we next sought to assess the sensitivity of male killing to <italic>wmk</italic> transcriptional and post-transcriptional changes and asked if one synonymous codon or site change was sufficient to alter phenotype. We created three transgenic lines, each with different DNA sequences coding for the same Serine at position 16. With only these minor changes that encode an identical protein sequence to <italic>w</italic>Mel Wmk, the transgenic male-killing phenotype was ablated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, one single codon and even a single nucleotide, remarkably determined male viability. Importantly, this key result implies at the molecular level that endosymbiont phenotypes of reproductive parasites may not simply be governed by DNA sequence alone.</p><p>A key question related to our findings is how synonymous changes cause vastly different phenotypes. It is often assumed in endosymbiont transgenic experiments that synonymous changes do not affect function, and codons for the same amino acid are functionally redundant. However, several decades of research have uncovered mounting evidence that the functional redundancy hypothesis is not always accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>). Indeed, codon bias varies across species (hence the need for codon optimization) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sharp et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson and Kurland, 1990</xref>), and there are several mechanisms through which single or few codons can influence transcription or translation. When there is a rare codon, there are fewer tRNAs available, and the translation rate may be correspondingly lowered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, there is a bias for rare codons in N-terminal regions of bacterial genes, which is likely due to their influence on mRNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goodman et al., 2013</xref>). Lower 5â RNA stability or weaker structure can also be correlated with ease of initiation and faster translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>), and stem loop structures may affect translation rate in varying ways. Indeed, strong 5â RNA secondary structure may inhibit ribosomal initiation or translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Smit and van Duin, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettany et al., 1989</xref>), and there can be selection against SNPs that alter RNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Salari et al., 2013</xref>). There is also evidence for selection across the domains of life on codon usage in the first 30â60 nucleotides of a gene, likely due to their impact on mRNA structure near the site of initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gu et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, early codons with low frequencies can be beneficial by slowing elongation, thus preventing ribosome collisions, or potentially helping to recruit chaperones to the emerging peptide for proper folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tuller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fredrick and Ibba, 2010</xref>). In addition, some specific codons across the sequence are favored for their lower likelihood of mistranslation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Qin et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, synonymous codon differences in genes can result, for instance, in altered gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kudla et al., 2009</xref>), lower organism fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agashe et al., 2013</xref>), or disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sauna and Kimchi-Sarfaty, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Beyond codon sequence, gene expression levels across representatives of all phenotypes are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), supporting post-transcriptional differences as the source of functional variation and refuting the functional redundancy hypothesis in this context. Examining the three synonymous transgenes more closely, we find that codon usage indeed correlates with phenotype. According to the codon usage table for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> on the Genscript website, the original <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic> codon at this position (TCG) has a frequency 16.7 per 1000 codons. In contrast, the <italic>w</italic>Suzi codon (TCC) has a frequency of 19.5/1000, and the <italic>w</italic>Rec codon (AGC) has a frequency of 20.5/1000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">GenScript, 2020</xref>). Therefore, there is a pattern where the more common codons are present in the all-killing transgenes, and at similar frequencies, while the strain expressing partial male killing has a codon at a lower frequency. Thus, some of the phenomena described in studies on synonymous codons and function likely underlie the phenotypic variation observed here.</p><p>Given that transgenic <italic>wmk</italic> expression with silent site changes results in different phenotypes, we used software that estimated RNA secondary structures for the tested transgenes. Indeed, we found that the predicted structures correlate somewhat with phenotype, so synonymous codons may change transcript structure or other post-transcriptional features of the transcript or protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Other small changes including adding a 9-codon N-terminal sequence ablated the phenotype and reversed it to no death, despite the additional sequence being smaller than many common gene tags that typically do not interfere with function. This small change also alters predicted RNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We were unable to assess protein levels to determine translational differences due to lack of an antibody. However, the data demonstrates that the <italic>wmk</italic> transgene is functionally sensitive to some post-transcriptional changes, at least in the N-terminal region.</p><p>What, then, do these results illuminate about transgenic <italic>wmk</italic> function and the utility of transgenic research in light of the potential for marked influences of synonymous changes on phenotype? First, as discussed, the <italic>wmk</italic> transgenic phenotypes are likely sensitive to post-transcriptional processes. This has important implications for understanding <italic>wmk</italic> in a natural male-killing context as soon as feasible techniques are available, since heterologous expression and its reliance on codon optimization may obscure our understanding of the geneâs biology. Second, since three different transgenic phenotypes (sex ratio bias, all killing, no killing) have been found so far with only a few sequences analyzed, it is possible that further testing of new codons may increase the partial male killing to a full male-killing phenotype. Therefore, it would be fruitful and may be possible to continue to uncover a transgenic sequence that fully recapitulates the phenotype to refine this system as a study tool for <italic>Wolbachia</italic> male killing. Third and critically, although the results show that there is some relationship between synonymous codons and phenotype, several points remain for further testing. For example, we cannot conclude that the particular codon tested here is responsible for phenotype alterations in other host genetic backgrounds or species. It is possible that this codon plays a functional role only in a singular host genetic context. Here, we changed <italic>wmk</italic> sequences while holding the host genetic background fixed, but the reverse is required to conclude whether or not the particular codon plays a general role in other genotypes or natural contexts. Second, due to possible coevolution, various codons may or may not yield similar functional effects across different host backgrounds, and additional synonymous sites may contribute to the male-killing phenotype. Thus, the results here illuminate a previously unrecognized need for future research on the functional impacts of synonymous substitutions in endosymbionts. Future work may focus on determining if there is one specific synonymous codon that affects the male-killing function in all cases, if a more general feature exists where alteration of any or a subset of N-terminal or other <italic>wmk</italic> codons affects function, or if the effect of synonymous changes is specific to this background.</p><p>In addition, these findings are informative with regards to the more general study of phenotypes induced by endosymbiont transgenes. It is standard practice to codon optimize genes for maximizing host expression when testing endosymbiont gene function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">LePage et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harumoto and Lemaitre, 2018</xref>), with the assumption that synonymous codons will not alter function. However, if codon optimization potentially changes the interpretation of transgenic findings, then phenotypes should be corroborated in natural contexts once tools such as genetic editing are available in the relevant organism. Specifically, <italic>wmk</italic> should be knocked out in native contexts once it is more technically feasible. In addition, codon optimization algorithms are updated with new information periodically with the assumption that they yield improved results, although it is unclear in practice whether an algorithm is better optimized to produce results that reflect the true biology of a transgene. Future work is necessary to explore these concepts further. For example, comparisons of alleles may need to be performed with alleles identical in sequence except for any engineered differences, and the algorithm should remain constant across all transgenes that are compared to each other. Further, careful analysis and comparison of transgenic phenotypes produced by different algorithms may be necessary in some cases where the phenotype is known or expected. This approach could ensure the algorithm produces a transgenic phenotype that most closely resembles the natural phenotype. In addition, the reliability of certain molecular evolutionary signatures, such as dN/dS, may be compromised since synonymous mutations are assumed to be neutral in these analyses. These principles are particularly important for research on endosymbionts that increasingly relies on heterologous gene expression for functional studies. The smaller genomes of endosymbionts tend to have low GC content overall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McCutcheon et al., 2009</xref>), and GC content is the strongest driver of codon usage bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Knight et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) and contributes to the strength of mRNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Plotkin and Kudla, 2011</xref>), so careful attention to the effects of synonymous changes may be of acute interest to the endosymbiont research community.</p><p>We also find interesting support for the hypothesis that there is co-adaptation between <italic>wmk</italic> homologs and their hosts since male-killing genes may be evolutionary matched for the host sex determination and molecular machinery that they manipulate. We first analyzed <italic>wmk</italic> homologs that are more distantly related to <italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic>, including from male-killing strains <italic>w</italic>Bol1b, <italic>w</italic>Bif, <italic>w</italic>Caub, and <italic>w</italic>Inn/<italic>w</italic>Bor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dyson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyer and Jaenike, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hurst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheeley and McAllister, 2009</xref>). They did not recapitulate male killing when transgenically expressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The lack of a sex ratio bias is expected if either <italic>wmk</italic> does not underpin male killing in these systems or divergent homologs are required to be closely co-adapted to their hosts. This latter hypothesis is based on observations that resistance to male killing is common (evidence of a potential host-microbe arms race) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charlat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Majerus and Majerus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaenike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mitsuhashi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hornett et al., 2008</xref>), and some strains can cause male killing anew when transferred to another, usually closely-related host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jaenike, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fujii et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>) while not causing male killing in all recipient host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Veneti et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hughes and Rasgon, 2014</xref>). It is possible, then, that the <italic>wmk</italic> homologs tested induce a sex ratio bias in their natural hosts, but not in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>If we make the assumption that <italic>wmk</italic> is involved in male killing in nature, which requires confirmation beyond transgenic recapitulation of the phenotype, then the results here give the basis for additional hypotheses that require further testing. First, the killing of both males and females by the closely-related <italic>w</italic>Rec and <italic>w</italic>Suzi <italic>wmk</italic> homologs could indicate that the target is something shared in both males and females, but functions differently within each sex (assuming no off-target effects). Indeed, previous studies on <italic>wmk</italic> and <italic>Wolbachia</italic> male killing demonstrate a positive correlation with between dosage compensation complex (DCC) activity and DNA defects in male embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Riparbelli et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harumoto et al., 2018</xref>). Notably, four of the five protein components of the DCC are expressed in both males and females, and it is only <italic>msl-2</italic> that is male-specific and catalyzes formation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lucchesi and Kuroda, 2015</xref>). Thus, there are several non-sex-specific <italic>wmk</italic> target candidates that the gene product may interact with to cause lethality in males and females. Second, protein divergence and resultant conformational changes may impact the specificity between host target and the Wmk toxin, and could underlie development of host resistance. Male-killing genes are expected to evolve rapidly within hosts in order to counteradapt host resistance mechanisms and keep evolutionary pace with the rapid evolution of sex-related genes that may be the target of a male-killing toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MarÃ­n and Baker, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rodriguez et al., 2007</xref>). As such, major or minor divergence in protein or transcript sequence of either the host target or the microbial toxin may underpin changes that lead to common host resistance, <italic>wmk</italic>-host coadaptation, and functional transgene differences in the foreign <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> host. Third, these findings leave open the possibility of a variety of functionally relevant <italic>wmk</italic> protein or transcript conformations in nature, which could contribute to the marked diversity of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> male killing in terms of host species and sex determination systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hurst et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charlat et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeh et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dyer and Jaenike, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hurst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fialho and Stevens, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Van Borm et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, this work reports previously unrecognized relationships for <italic>wmk</italic>-induced killing and establishes new hypotheses for the impacts of RNA structure and post-transcriptional processes in <italic>wmk</italic>-induced male killing. It also highlights several critical features for the research community regarding assumptions about the broad use of transgenes and the role of synonymous mutations in gene function. If <italic>wmk</italic> is involved in natural male killing, then this work could indicate how silent sequence changes may relate to known male-killing phenomena such as frequent host resistance or male-killing function in diverse hosts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Wolbachia pipientis</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WD0626</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NCBI:WD_RS02815</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Also known as <italic>wmk</italic> <break/>(<italic>WO-mediated killing</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Act5c-Gal4/CyO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">BDSC:3953;

P[CaryP]P2 (BDSC 8622), the WD0626 (<italic>wmk</italic>) and WD0034 (control gene) transgene constructs previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>), and several new transgene constructs. Briefly, each <italic>Wolbachia</italic> gene of interest was codon-optimized for optimal <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> expression using algorithms developed by GenScript Biotech (Piscataway, NJ). These sequences were then synthesized as DNA nucleotides and cloned by GenScript into the pTIGER plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferguson et al., 2012</xref>). The pTIGER vector is a UASp-based plasmid optimized for germline expression and uses PhiC31 integrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Groth et al., 2004</xref>) for targeted integration into the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome. It also includes UAS promoters for inducible expression with a Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Southall et al., 2008</xref>) as well as a <italic>w</italic><sup>+</sup> red eye marker for transformant screening. The plasmids were then sent to BestGene (Chino Hills, CA), which performed injections of the vectors into embryos of the BDSC 8622 background line with PhiC31 integrase to integrate the vector into the attP2 insertion site in the genome. Successful transformants were selected based on the red eye marker, and each transgene line is descended from the offspring of a single transformant (isofemale).</p><p><italic>D. melanogaster</italic> were reared on standard cornmeal, molasses, and yeast (CMY) media (5% w/v cornmeal (Quaker, Chicago IL), 1.875% w/v yeast (Red Star Yeast, Milwaulkee WI), 7.8% v/v molasses (Sweet Harvest Foods, Rosemount MN), 0.5% w/v type II <italic>Drosophila</italic> agar (Genesee Scientific, San Diego CA), 0.056% w/v tegosept (Genesee Scientific, San Diego CA), and 0.39% v/v propionic acid (Sigma Aldrich)). Stocks were maintained at 25 Â°C with virgin flies stored at room temperature. During virgin collections, stocks were kept at 18 Â°C overnight and 25 Â°C during the day. All flies were kept on a 12 hr light/dark cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sex ratio assays</title><p>To assess the effect of transgene expression on adult sex ratios (measurement of male killing), sex ratio assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perlmutter et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, twenty biological replicates of 10 uninfected, 4- to 7-day-old virgin, female <italic>Act5c</italic>-Gal4/CyO driver flies and two uninfected, 1- to 2-day-old virgin, male transgene flies were each set up in vials with CMY media. Individuals were randomly allocated to each vial after all females or males of a given genotype were mixed together. They were left on the media to lay eggs for 4 days at 25 Â°C with a 12 hr light/dark cycle, at which point adults were discarded. The vials are then left at 25 Â°C until the offspring are counted. After 9 days of adult offspring emergence, they were scored for both sex and expression (red eye color from <italic>Act5c</italic>-Gal4 chromosome) or non-expression (curly wings from CyO balancer chromosome). The number of adult offspring per vial across all experiments ranges from 50 to 170, with a mean of 120 (ranges and means per experiment are included in figure captions). Any vials with fewer than 50 adult offspring were removed from the analysis, as this indicates either abnormally poor egg laying or hatching (typically 0â2 vials per group). In addition, vials with no adult emergence, while others of the same genotype had typical levels of offspring, were also excluded (typically 2â3 vials per group). Results were graphed in GraphPad Prism 8.4.0, which applies a âStandard Plot Appearanceâ correction for visibility of data distribution where the width of distribution of points is proportional to the number of points at that y-value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>RNA secondary structures</title><p>RNA secondary structures were generated by uploading the nucleotide sequences of the indicated gene to the RNA fold web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gruber et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>). The structures shown are the graphical outputs of the MFE (minimum free energy) secondary structures. Colors indicate base pair probabilities, from blue to red, with blue indicating a probability of 0 and red indicating a probability of 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Gene expression</title><p>Gene expression was measured in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos aged 4â5 hr AED. Each point represents a biological replicate with the RNA of 30 pooled embryos from crosses between a unique set of 60 uninfected, 4- to 7-day-old virgin, female <italic>Act5c</italic>-Gal4/CyO driver flies and 12 uninfected, 1- to 2-day-old virgin, male transgene flies of the indicated genotype. Each point represents a biological replicate from different bottles. Individuals were randomly allocated to each bottle after all females or males of a given genotype were mixed together. Each collection chamber consisted of a grape juice agar plate with yeast in an eight oz round bottom bottle, and flies. These were placed in a 25 Â°C incubator overnight (16 hr). Then, the plates were swapped with fresh ones. The flies were allowed to lay eggs for 1 hr. The plates were then left at 25 Â°C for an additional 4 hr to age them to be 4â5 hr old (the estimated time of male death in <italic>wmk</italic> crosses). Embryos were then gathered in groups of 30 (each group from a unique bottle/biological replicate) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo), RNase-free DNase (Ambion, Life Technologies), cDNA was generated with SuperScript VILO (Invitrogen), and RT-qPCR was run using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Mix (Bio-Rad). qPCR was performed on a Bio-Rad CFX-96 Real-Time System. Primers are listed in the Key Resources Table. Conditions were as follows: 50 Â°C 10 min, 95 Â°C 5 min, 40 x (95 Â°C 10 s, 55 Â°C 30 s), 95 Â°C 30 s. Differences in gene expression were done by calculating 2<sup>-Îct</sup> (difference in ct values of two genes of interest). Data points were excluded if a sample had low-quality cDNA that did not amplify in qPCR. Data points of each biological replicate are measured as the mean of two technical replicates from each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Phylogenetic trees</title><p>The nucleotide phylogenetic trees of host COI genes and <italic>wmk</italic> native gene or transgene sequences were inferred based on a MUSCLE alignment in Geneious Prime 2020.2.4 followed by stripping all sites with gaps.

Each experiment was completed twice, and statistical tests were applied to both to confirm repetition in differences between treatment groups. In all plots, the first experiment is the representative one shown. For sex ratios, we tested different sample sizes for reliability in sex ratio measurements, and found that 20 biological samples per group, with 10 females and 2 males per sample, resulted in consistently replicable data, which is the standard we apply here. qPCR data was approached similarly, by previous work in the lab demonstrating that with embryos 4â5 h AED, we are able to get consistent, high-quality, replicable data with 30 embryos per sample, and at least eight samples per group.</p><p>All statistical analyses for sex ratios and were performed using GraphPad Prism eight software. For sex ratios, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnâs multiple comparisons test was applied to all gene-expressing categories, followed by the same test but on all non-expressing categories. For gene expression, groups were compared using the same Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA with Dunnâs multiple comparisons test. Significant results are indicated with * symbols in figures, with accompanying p values in captions. Any comparisons with no symbol are nonsignificant.

The endosymbiont carries the prophage WO, which is in the center of interested in this study. The key result of this study is that a synonymous mutation in a prophage gene can explain the differences between sex-ratio distorting and not distorting symbionts. The study uses transgene technology to modify phage genes and to investigate which changes in the gene is involved in the phenotype. The finding, that a synonymous SNP plays a key role is not entirely novel in biology, but there are only few examples known of this type of genotype â phenotype associations. The study does not include experiments to show that the main finding is not limited to one particular background of the fly line used. An experiment including multiple genotypes would be needed to show this.</p><p>The study is mostly clear and easy to follow, but requires a lot of attention. The authors choose to build up the story as I guess it was carried out in the lab. Thus, the reader is guided through every step of the process. While I see that this is appealing from the way the study was carried out, it results in a very long manuscript with a lot of material that would be much better placed in a supplement.</p><p>The introduction seems unfocused. It meanders around, jumping from topic to topic and does not give the reader a sense of where things will go. Figure 1 gives an overview about the different aspects addressed here, but it is not used to guide the reader through the different lines of thought addressed in the introduction. If Figure 1 will stay (I actually think it is not needed) it should be introduced earlier and used as a road map for the paper. Alternatively, the introduction could stay more general and only in the last paragraph the different ways the system is studied will be summarized. Along these lines, it would be good to have a better reasoning for the combination of experiments conducted. It is left to the reader to understand why certain types of experiments have been done. On the other hand, the introduction misses a section on the biology of the phage and its interaction with the host(s). It is hard to understand the biology of the system without getting an understanding of the insect â Wolbachia â phage interactions. For non-specialist, understanding the role of the three players is essential for the system.</p><p>The result section could be easily shortened by focusing on the essential experiments. Experiments that do not contribute to the final result can go into the supplement.</p><p>Also the discussion is much too long. I suggest to reduce it to half and focus on the important points and the take-home messages. Currently the discussion follows the way the results are presented in the result section. However, this is not needed. The important finding should be discussed first. Findings that are important in the development of the project, may not be important for the biology of the system overall. And they may not be important for the reader.</p><p>The text contains many abbreviations. For less specialist readers this become rather difficult. I suggest to reduce abbreviations and to add a list with them, so one can find them fast. All abbreviations have to be explained when they are used for the first time. Furthermore, abbreviations are used in different forms making part of the text or figures messy. As an example, look at Figure 4: going plot by plot from A to E the names of the treatments changes from plot to plot. This is issues persists throughout text and figures of the entire manuscript.</p><p>On line 158-160 it is said that wSuzi differs only by one SNP from wMel. On lines 162-164 it is then said that the transgenes were codon optimized. Why is this necessary, if only 1 position differs? More generally: &quot; codon-optimization &quot; plays an important role in this study. Please explain why codon-optimization was done and what was exactly done.</p><p>For several experiment it is said &quot;The experiment has been performed twice&quot;. How where the data treated? The stats described do not allow a complex design with repeated experiment. Did you pool the data of the two experiments? Did you test if the outcome of the experiments differed?</p><p>Line 241: &quot;Thus, we conclude that small or large wmk transcript sequence changes can lead to alterations in predicted RNA structure or possibly protein structure that may relate to altered phenotypes in wmk homologs.&quot; This is a very vague conclusion. It basically says nothing.</p><p>For the plots of the individual data points a jitter function was used (please say so!). Was the function used to jitter in both dimensions or only in the X-axis dimension?</p><p>Animals were kept on a standard media. Please give references when you make such statements.</p><p>The methods section regarding the transgene constructs is rather short. I would like to see more information to understand what was done, why it was done and how it was done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study aims to unravel the genomic basis to wmk-induced male killing by transgenically expressing homologs of varying relatedness, with synonymous nucleotide changes, and predicted alternative start codons in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> flies. The study builds on previous work showing that expression of wmk in fly embryos recapitulates several aspects of male killing. While more distantly-related homologs did not induce male killing when expressed in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, more closely-related wmk homologs induce either killing of both sexes or male killing only. However, the male-killing phenotype was not due to amino acid differences, but associated with RNA structural differences of the different wmk homologs. In addition, only one synonymous nucleotide change was sufficient to ablate the killing phenotype. These findings suggests that minor and even silent nucleotide differences impact on the expression of male killing in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. It is concluded that a new model incorporating the impacts of RNA structure and post-transcriptional processes in wmk-induced male killing needs to be developed.</p><p>The strength of the study lies in the systematic and carefully controlled approach to quantify the phenotypic effects of both sequence and structural changes to various wmk homologs for inducing the male-killing phenotype. Detailed dissection of the phenotypic impact of minor changes to the wmk homologs including sequence variation, silent nucleotide changes, and RNA structural differences was quantified. This approach reveals a complex genotype-phenotype relationship, but highlights the importance of including post-translational processes. The data is novel in that previous work have largely ignored structural changes and assumed that synonymous differences in codons has no effect on protein function, whereas the current study based on updated codon optimization algorithms reveal that this assumption is incorrect. The finding highlights the importance of considering also structural genetic variation for phenotypic expression differences. This suggestion is further corroborated by the lack of difference in wmk homologue expression levels, indicating that the functional differences are due to post-translational effects.</p><p>There are limitations to the findings of this complex genotype-phenotype relationship. The current study only examined the phenotypic impact by expressing the different homologs in one <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genetic background. Given the variability of the phenotypic pattern revealed based on minor changes to the wmk homologs, it will be critical to repeat some of the main findings in other <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genotypes to determine the importance of the variation in the wmk homologs more generally. It is entirely plausible that the observed changes in the effect and strength of killing is due to an interaction between host and wmk genotype. This has implications for unravelling the underlying genetic basis to the male-killing phenotype more widely. It is as yet to be demonstrated whether wmk is involved in male killing in natural population, and to what extent there are shared patterns and mechanisms of male killing induced by other bacterial endosymbionts such as Spiroplasma.</p><p>I found the study of interest and enjoyed reading this manuscript. Overall, it represents a careful dissection of the functional genomic basis of the wmk candidate gene for the male-killing phenotype in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The experimental design and choice of the putative male-killing wmk homologs of varying relatedness provides an opportunity to examine the importance of genetic similarity, in conjunction with wmk-variants with synonymous nucleotide changes, and predicted alternative start codons for the male killing expression. The complex pattern of genotype-phenotype relationship that is unravelled is perhaps unexpected, but possibly more important is the finding that RNA structural differences are associated with male killing. This finding has several implications such as the need to consider the importance of post-translational processes, but also that the assumption that synonymous differences in codons has no effect on protein function is erroneous. On the whole these complex patterns suggest that we need to re-visit the model for the genotype-phenotype relationship of male killing. As such, the study makes a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p>However, the study also has some shortcomings and limitations. Importantly, the impact of the various wmk homologs were only examined in one <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genotype. Given the variability of the phenotypic pattern based on minor changes to the wmk homologs that was unravelled, it will be critical to repeat the main findings in other <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genotypes to determine the importance of the variation in the wmk homologs for male killing irrespective of host genetic background. The suggestion that caution need to be taken when examining sequence variation and in particular synonymous nucleotide changes as their impact may be dependent on RNA structure is also based on few observations.</p><p>In general, little consideration is made to the evolutionary implications of the finding. It is currently unclear what patterns are to be expected in other host-gene combinations and as such the findings have perhaps low predictive power. It is entirely plausible that the observed changes in the effect and strength of killing is due to the interaction between host and wmk genotype shaped by co-evolution. This caveat has implications for understanding the underlying genetic basis to male-killing more widely, especially since one of the aims of the study was to address the genotype-phenotype relationship that underpins wmk function.

We would also like to thank the Editor and Reviewers for considering and acknowledging the request to not require this experiment for the reasons outlined below. Per the follow-up recommendation, we now acknowledge the limitations of examining one genetic background in the discussion and altered language to avoid perceptions of generalizability. In individual responses to reviewer comments below, we included some more detailed explanation and example text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript requires extensive streamlining. The text is hard to follow and has too many details. The main points are often hidden among details. A more focussed and shortened manuscript would be highly welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this feedback. We agree and removed unnecessary elements in various sections, moved some parts of the results to the supplement, removed any part of the results that were redundant with other parts of the paper, and reordered and streamlined the discussion as well. The discussion is now a few pages shorter, as are the results. Specific changes are outlined where reviewers suggested them below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This study aims to find the genetic mechanisms underlying sex-ratio distortion through male-killing in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> flies infected with the endosymbiont Wolbachia. The endosymbiont carries the prophage WO, which is in the center of interested in this study. The key result of this study is that a synonymous mutation in a prophage gene can explain the differences between sex-ratio distorting and not distorting symbionts. The study uses transgene technology to modify phage genes and to investigate which changes in the gene is involved in the phenotype. The finding, that a synonymous SNP plays a key role is not entirely novel in biology, but there are only few examples known of this type of genotype â phenotype associations. The study does not include experiments to show that the main finding is not limited to one particular background of the fly line used. An experiment including multiple genotypes would be needed to show this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that recapitulating the results in other backgrounds is intriguing and important for establishing a broader role of these findings. We thank the Reviewers and Editor for allowing us to pursue this line of investigation separately from this work, and we now discuss what experiments can be completed to answer these and other questions. We also edited the manuscript to tone down any conclusions that would imply generalizability of the findings at this point. For example:</p><p>âFor example, we cannot conclude that the particular codon tested here is responsible for phenotype alterations in other host genetic backgrounds or species. It is possible that this codon plays a functional role only in a singular host genetic context. Here, we changed wmk sequences while holding the host genetic background fixed, but the reverse is required to conclude whether or not the particular codon plays a general role in other genotypes or natural contexts. Second, due to possible coevolution, various codons may or may not yield similar functional effects across different host backgrounds, and additional synonymous sites may contribute to the male-killing phenotype. Thus, the results here illuminate a previously unrecognized need for future research on the functional impacts of synonymous substitutions in endosymbionts. Future work may focus on determining if there is one specific synonymous codon that affects the male-killing function in all cases, if a more general feature exists where alteration of any or a subset of N-terminal or other wmk codons affects function, or if the effect of synonymous changes is specific to this background.â</p><p>Text summarizing the 06/21/2021 query to the Editor and Reviewers for further clarification: We believe there are several reasons why the results can stand on their own, while appropriately acknowledging caveats. First, we note the lack of genetic background testing on previous transgene experiments driving the major discoveries of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genes involved in reproductive parasitism. This requirement would therefore hold the current work to a novel bar not previously applied by the field. In addition, the genetic background here is the same as used in previous work on these phenotypes, making it the most pertinent to test and inform previous and ongoing studies by many research groups. Second, the results shown here would still stand no matter the results of genetic background testing and would demonstrate that it is possible for synonymous changes to have functional relevance in the transgenic <italic>wmk</italic> phenotype. The major findings are still novel in the field, relevant to ongoing studies of reproductive parasitism, and informative regarding one of the most common genetic backgrounds. Finally, we note that two different lines with unique synonymous codon changes (the final experiment) independently created the same result that a synonymous codon change ablates phenotype, providing additional robustness to our findings. Doing additional experiments would be logistically difficult. Barriers include the relocation of the first author of the work to another lab for a postdoctoral position, completion of the funding for the project, remaining institutional COVID-19 restrictions, and lack of replacement personnel in the lab to continue the work. Notably, there is also the non-trivial requirement to create and test new transgene lines that would be costly and take nearly a year to complete (the experiments in the manuscript already took several years and the new fly lines would cost thousands to make).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study is mostly clear and easy to follow, but requires a lot of attention. The authors choose to build up the story as I guess it was carried out in the lab. Thus, the reader is guided through every step of the process. While I see that this is appealing from the way the study was carried out, it results in a very long manuscript with a lot of material that would be much better placed in a supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We shortened the manuscript by removing redundant information and transferring some parts of the results to the supplement. We also removed about three pages of text from the discussion (before adding in new sections as requested by reviewers).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The introduction seems unfocused. It meanders around, jumping from topic to topic and does not give the reader a sense of where things will go.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a few topics into the Introduction as recommended in other comments, and we edited various portions of the Introduction to connect the ideas together more clearly. We hope the changes are now satisfactory, and we are of course happy to consider further feedback.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 gives an overview about the different aspects addressed here, but it is not used to guide the reader through the different lines of thought addressed in the introduction. If Figure 1 will stay (I actually think it is not needed) it should be introduced earlier and used as a road map for the paper. Alternatively, the introduction could stay more general and only in the last paragraph the different ways the system is studied will be summarized.</p></disp-quote><p>We edited the final paragraph of the Introduction to more comprehensively cover the content of the figure and full direction of the paper. For readers not familiar with the biological system or questions, we believe this figure will serve as a gateway to the genetic alterations conducted in the experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Along these lines, it would be good to have a better reasoning for the combination of experiments conducted. It is left to the reader to understand why certain types of experiments have been done.</p></disp-quote><p>It was not clear to us at the outset of these experiments what results would ultimately emerge and what follow-up experiments would be necessary as our initial hypotheses were proven wrong with many of the surprises from the work. So, there was no <italic>a priori</italic> reasoning for why experiments were done until we had the results of the previous experiments. We agree that this makes the reading a bit confusing. As such, we clarified the logic flow in the Results section as the narrative progresses from experiment to experiment, and we reorganized some of the introduction to improve transition statements and offer a roadmap to readers earlier on.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the other hand, the introduction misses a section on the biology of the phage and its interaction with the host(s). It is hard to understand the biology of the system without getting an understanding of the insect â Wolbachia â phage interactions. For non-specialist, understanding the role of the three players is essential for the system.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We now add a section introducing phage WO and its relevance to the phenotypes tested here.</p><p>âThe wmk gene and two cytoplasmic incompatibility factor (cif) genes that underlie cytoplasmic incompatibility (a parasitism phenotype whereby offspring die in crosses between infected males and uninfected females) occur in the eukaryotic association module (EAM) of prophage WO, which refers to the phage WO genome that is inserted into the bacterial chromosome. The EAM is common in WO phages across several Wolbachia strains and is rich in genes that are homologous to eukaryotic genes or annotated with eukaryotic functions. As such, the expression of reproductive parasitism genes from the EAM and tripartite interactions between phage WO, Wolbachia, and eukaryotic hosts are central to Wolbachiaâs ability to interact with and modify host reproduction.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The result section could be easily shortened by focusing on the essential experiments. Experiments that do not contribute to the final result can go into the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We removed redundant sentences and made some figures supplemental.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the discussion is much too long. I suggest to reduce it to half and focus on the important points and the take-home messages. Currently the discussion follows the way the results are presented in the result section. However, this is not needed. The important finding should be discussed first. Findings that are important in the development of the project, may not be important for the biology of the system overall. And they may not be important for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We reordered the discussion to cover the biggest findings first, and removed about a third of the original writing in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text contains many abbreviations. For less specialist readers this become rather difficult. I suggest to reduce abbreviations and to add a list with them, so one can find them fast. All abbreviations have to be explained when they are used for the first time. Furthermore, abbreviations are used in different forms making part of the text or figures messy. As an example, look at Figure 4: going plot by plot from A to E the names of the treatments changes from plot to plot. This is issues persists throughout text and figures of the entire manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. In the manuscript, we used labels such as â<italic>w</italic>Melâ or â<italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic>â synonymously. Since that resulted in too many labels and acronyms to follow and sift through, we unified the terminology throughout by ensuring that the same label for each genotype remains constant in the text, and we edited the figures to ensure that the terminology is kept constant. For example, we now refer to the original homolog exclusively as â<italic>w</italic>Mel <italic>wmk</italic>â as opposed to using this term in some cases and â<italic>wmk</italic>â in others.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On line 158-160 it is said that wSuzi differs only by one SNP from wMel. On lines 162-164 it is then said that the transgenes were codon optimized. Why is this necessary, if only 1 position differs? More generally: &quot; codon-optimization &quot; plays an important role in this study. Please explain why codon-optimization was done and what was exactly done.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a short explanation to the first figure to explain the codon optimization to readers, but here is an additional, expanded explanation for reference: Codon-optimization is standard for transgenic expression analyses since the DNA sequence comes from an organism (bacteria) that is divergent compared to its destination organism (flies). For synonymous codons, although all code for the same amino acid, each organism has a specific bias for which tRNAs are more or less abundant. Synonymous codon differences can result in variations in RNA folding (based on subtle molecular differences in the codons) as well as differences in translation such as translation rate (based on codon availability in terms of rarity). Expressing a bacterial gene in a fly host without optimizing the codons would mean that the gene would likely contain many codons that are not preferred/as common in the fly host, and this could result in altered translation rates or even early termination when the fly expresses the gene. For this reason, we and others utilizing transgenics take all the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> sequences and put them through an algorithm that gives the same protein sequence, but with the best codon combinations for optimal fly expression. This new âcodon-optimizedâ sequence is then utilized to synthesize the gene anew for insertion into the fly host.</p><p>In the specific lines referenced here, we clarify that while the bacterial sequences differ by a single SNP, they must be codon optimized for fly expression for the reasons explained above, which then of course changes the DNA sequence. Since this is an important principle that we want readers to clearly understand before going into the results, we added a new section to the Introduction to introduce the concept of codon optimization and transgenes. We also expanded the Discussion of this topic as well. The Introduction change is noted below:</p><p>âThese sequences are codon-optimized based on different codon biases due to different tRNA abundances in the divergent bacterial source and eukaryotic destination species.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For several experiment it is said &quot;The experiment has been performed twice&quot;. How where the data treated? The stats described do not allow a complex design with repeated experiment. Did you pool the data of the two experiments? Did you test if the outcome of the experiments differed?</p></disp-quote><p>In each case, experiments were done twice to confirm that the results were repeatable. We applied the same statistical tests to each individual experiment, and we determined that they both showed the same results. However, the data from each individual experiment were not combined. This is because exact y-values often differ from experiment to experiment due to small, uncontrollable environmental factors, even if relative differences between treatment groups are repeatable. This is typical of <italic>Drosophila</italic> egg-laying experiments, where the average number of eggs laid naturally varies within a wide range due to sensitivity to environmental factors and gives minor differences in results. The large sample size and sample size cutoff values were chosen because they largely correct for these small variations and give consistent results relative to groups within each experiment. However, there is still some variation in absolute values from experiment to experiment, so we did not combine data. For the data in the manuscript, all plots were from the first iteration of the experiment as a representative result of the two. Brief statements on this have been added to the methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 241: &quot;Thus, we conclude that small or large wmk transcript sequence changes can lead to alterations in predicted RNA structure or possibly protein structure that may relate to altered phenotypes in wmk homologs.&quot; This is a very vague conclusion. It basically says nothing.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement has been deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the plots of the individual data points a jitter function was used (please say so!).

Overall, it represents a careful dissection of the functional genomic basis of the wmk candidate gene for the male-killing phenotype in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. The experimental design and choice of the putative male-killing wmk homologs of varying relatedness provides an opportunity to examine the importance of genetic similarity, in conjunction with wmk-variants with synonymous nucleotide changes, and predicted alternative start codons for the male killing expression. The complex pattern of genotype-phenotype relationship that is unravelled is perhaps unexpected, but possibly more important is the finding that RNA structural differences are associated with male killing. This finding has several implications such as the need to consider the importance of post-translational processes, but also that the assumption that synonymous differences in codons has no effect on protein function is erroneous. On the whole these complex patterns suggest that we need to re-visit the model for the genotype-phenotype relationship of male killing. As such, the study makes a valuable contribution to the field.</p><p>However, the study also has some shortcomings and limitations.
