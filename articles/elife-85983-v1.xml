Cochlear implantation and auditory brainstem implantation can provide partial hearing sensation, but language development outcomes can vary, particularly for patients with inner ear malformations and/or cochlear nerve deficiency (IEM&amp;CND). Currently, the peripheral auditory structure is evaluated through visual inspection of clinical imaging, but this method is insufficient for surgical planning and prognosis. The central auditory pathway is also challenging to examine in vivo due to its delicate subcortical structures. Previous attempts to locate subcortical auditory nuclei using fMRI responses to sounds are not applicable to patients with profound hearing loss as no auditory brainstem responses can be detected in these individuals, making it impossible to capture corresponding blood oxygen signals in fMRI. In this study, we developed a new pipeline for mapping the auditory pathway using structural and diffusional MRI. We used a fixel-based approach to investigate the structural development of the auditory-language network for profound SNHL children with normal peripheral structure and those with IEM&amp;CND under 6 years old. Our findings indicate that the language pathway is more sensitive to peripheral auditory condition than the central auditory pathway, highlighting the importance of early intervention for profound SNHL children to provide timely speech inputs. We also propose a comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation extending from the cochlea to the auditory-language network, showing significant correlations between age, gender, Cn.VIII median contrast value, and the language network with post-implant qualitative outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>auditory pathway</kwd><kwd>language development</kwd><kwd>sensorineural hearing loss</kwd><kwd>cochlear nerve deficiency</kwd><kwd>dMRI</kwd><kwd>fixel-based analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Major Basic Research 2018SHZDZX05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Shanghai Key Laboratory of Translational Medicine on Ear and Nose diseases 14DZ2260300</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100017950</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Health Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Shanghai Key Clinical Specialty Construction - Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery shslczdzk00802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010167</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Shen Kang Hospital Development Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Frontier Project SHDC12020105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Zhaoyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008233</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Translational Medicine Collaborative Innovation Project TM202011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100008233</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>High-level Local University Construction Project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Hao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Innovative MRI mapping of the auditory pathway reveals that peripheral auditory structure significantly impacts the development of the central auditory-language network in children with profound sensorineural hearing loss, emphasizing the need for early speech input and tailored interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Congenital profound hearing loss (hearing level &gt;90 dB diagnosed at birth or in early childhood) deprives children of spoken language development and has lifelong negative consequences for education, employment, and psychosocial status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kral and O’Donoghue, 2010</xref>). The prevalence of neonatal hearing loss has increased from 1.09 to 1.7 cases per 1000 live births in the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">CDC Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) Hearing Screening &amp; Follow-up Survey (HSFS), 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alicia and Marcus, 2010</xref>). Most congenital hearing loss is caused by sensorineural impairments in the inner ear, cochlear nerve, and/or central auditory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Korver et al., 2017</xref>). The aetiology of these impairments is multifaceted, with genetic factors playing a significant role, alongside external contributors such as congenital infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marazita et al., 1993</xref>). Hearing loss is categorized as syndromic, with accompanying physical or laboratory findings, or non-syndromic, where hearing loss is the sole symptom and has a highly heterogeneous genetic basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Korver et al., 2017</xref>). This article primarily focuses on non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).</p><p>Inner ear malformations and cochlear nerve deficiencies (IEM&amp;CND), identifiable with CT and MRI, contribute to 15–39% of paediatric SNHL cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mafong et al., 2002</xref>). The rest is primarily due to cellular-level abnormalities. The aetiology of IEM&amp;CND is complex and largely unknown, yet these abnormalities suggest an earlier developmental arrest compared to cases with normal inner ear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sennaroglu and Saatci, 2002</xref>). Addressing IEM&amp;CND is vital as it presents specific challenges in clinical management. Cochlear implantation (CI) and auditory brainstem implantation (ABI) are currently the only solutions for profound SNHL, but the choice between CI and ABI presents a dilemma for many IEM&amp;CND patients. CI directly stimulates the spiral ganglion cells, the first-order neurons of the auditory pathway, while ABI bypasses the cochlear nerve and stimulates the second-order auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus (CN) when complex IEM or cochlear nerve aplasia makes CI inapplicable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen and Oghalai, 2016</xref>). Both CI and ABI are capable of providing hearing sensation and language development for children with severe-to-profound prelingual hearing loss, but postoperative outcomes vary among individuals. ABI recipients generally have poorer speech recognition performance and delayed and incomplete language development compared to CI recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sennaroğlu et al., 2016</xref>). However, the prognosis of CI may not necessarily be better than that of ABI for certain IEMs, including common cavity, cochlear hypoplasia, incomplete partition-type I, and cochlear aperture abnormalities, as the presence of sufficient cochlear fibres required for CI success is uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Freeman and Sennaroglu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sennaroğlu and Bajin, 2017</xref>). This uncertainty is hard to address for two reasons: (1) assessing the cochlear nerve through visual inspection of MRI poses challenges, including subjective limitations, image quality, and difficulty distinguishing the cochlear nerve from the cranial nerve VIII (the cochleovestibular nerve) in cases of common cavity; and (2) the absence of the cochlear nerve structurally does not always indicate a lack of functional hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thai-Van et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, distinguishing certain types of IEMs can be problematic and may impact surgical decision-making. For example, differentiating cochlear aplasia with a dilated vestibule (CADV) from a common cavity is challenging; CADV is a definitive indication for ABI, while a common cavity allows for either CI or ABI. These observations underscore the importance of a deep dive into IEM&amp;CND and highlight the limitations of contemporary clinical imaging in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and surgical guidance.</p><p>Speech is transmitted through the auditory pathway and understood at the language network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friederici, 2011</xref>). For children with severe-to-profound prelingual hearing loss, the deprivation of auditory inputs into this workflow may affect the structural and functional development of associated brain regions, the degrees of impairment of which may be relevant to later auditory and language performance after surgical reconstruction of hearing. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies have shown that children with profound SNHL exhibit decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) values along almost the entire auditory pathway, particularly in the inferior colliculus (IC), medial geniculate body (MGB), and auditory radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tarabichi et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, hearing and language outcomes (categories of auditory performance) 6–12 mo following CI were positively correlated with preoperative auditory pathway FA values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, brain structures associated with the language pathway, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG), Broca’s area, superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and uncinate fasciculus (UF), also showed decreased FA values in children with profound hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The FA value of Broca’s area was positively correlated with speech recognition performance after CI implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2012</xref>). These results indicate that children with profound SNHL have a delayed or impaired microstructural organization in the central auditory pathway and the language pathway that may affect subsequent implantation outcomes.</p><p>However, there are several challenges in this field. Firstly, the human auditory pathway is difficult to inspect non-invasively due to its delicate nodes connected by curving and crossing fibres, especially the parts that are buried deep in the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zanin et al., 2019</xref>). Functional MRI (fMRI) responses to natural sounds have been used to locate subcortical auditory structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sitek et al., 2019</xref>), but this method is not applicable to patients with profound hearing loss as no auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) can be detected in these individuals, making it impossible to capture corresponding blood oxygen signals in fMRI. In fact, few studies have located the auditory brainstem of children with profound hearing loss, particularly the CN that ABI targets. Therefore, new localization and tractography methods are needed to precisely map the auditory pathway in vivo for individuals with normal or impaired hearing. Secondly, although earlier studies reported several altered fibre tracts related to language function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2016</xref>), there has been insufficient investigation into the language pathway. Its component streams, which are segmented on both structural and functional bases, do not correspond to the major fibre tracts typically studied in whole-brain analyses. Finally, the diffusion tensor model used in these studies performs poorly in estimating regions with crossing fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Farquharson et al., 2013</xref>), which may lead to problematic tractography (particularly in the auditory pathway) and false interpretations of FA alterations in children with profound hearing loss. To overcome this methodological limitation, the present study implemented a state-of-the-art fixel-based analysis (FBA) approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dhollander et al., 2021</xref>). A ‘fixel’ refers to an individual fibre population within a voxel, allowing for the quantification of white matter properties in fibre-crossing areas.</p><p>Furthermore, previous neuroimaging studies of profound congenital SNHL excluded children with IEM&amp;CND. However, as mentioned earlier, these subjects comprise a significant proportion of patients with congenital hearing loss and are more inclined to be faced with difficult surgical decisions and unsatisfactory post-implantation outcomes. Therefore, it is important to include and focus on children with IEM&amp;CND when studying central adaptations associated with profound hearing loss.</p><p>In the present study, we introduced a new pipeline for reconstructing the human auditory pathway and examined the brain structural development of children with profound congenital SNHL at both the acoustic processing level and the speech perception level. Specifically, we included children under the age of six with profound hearing loss, with and without IEM&amp;CND, as well as normal hearing controls. We segmented the subcortical auditory nuclei using super-resolution track density imaging (TDI) maps and T1-weighted images, and tracked the auditory pathway and the language pathway using probabilistic tractography. Then, we used FBA to investigate the fibre properties of these two pathways. We aimed to investigate (1) the alteration of fibre metrics in the auditory-language network of children with profound SNHL; (2) the potential impact of IEM&amp;CND on the pre-implant structural development of this network; and (3) the relationship between the pre-implant structural development of this network and the auditory-language outcomes following CI or ABI implantation.

These scales predominantly offer a qualitative and observational measure of auditory performance, speech use, and speech intelligibility in various real-life scenarios and are rooted in subjective interpretations. A notable trend was that subjective assessments of auditory and language development, as measured by various scales, appeared to be more responsive to preoperative metrics such as age, gender, choice of surgery, peripheral nerve tissue density, and fibre densities in the central auditory and language pathways.

Gender demonstrated a correlation with IT-MAIS and MUSS at startup and with SIR 6 mo post-activation. This positive correlation implies that female patients (coded as '2') typically achieve higher scores on these scales than their male counterparts (coded as '1'). Contrasting with age and gender, the choice of surgery (CI versus ABI) manifested a unique positive correlation with PTA 6 mo post-activation, but not with auditory and language scales. This suggests a more immediate effect on the objective auditory condition. A positive correlation signifies that the patients who opted for ABI surgeries (coded as '2') typically exhibited higher PTA values (indicating poorer hearing) compared to those who underwent CI surgeries (coded as '1'), at least at the 6-month post-activation.</p><p>In terms of the preoperative variables related to the auditory system, the cn.VIII median contrast value was positively correlated with CAP, IT-MAIS at 6 mo post-activation, and change in SIR. Interestingly, the FD of the central auditory pathway did not present significant correlations with the scales at any point.</p><p>However, a notable trend emerged when assessing the language pathways. CAP at the onset positively correlated with all language pathways, whereas PTA at 6 mo showed no correlation with these pathways. Generally, the FD of most language pathways, particularly most dorsal streams, demonstrated positive correlations with various scales at startup and 6 mo post-activation, and also with MUSS change. These observations highlight the language pathway’s significant role in auditory development beyond the primary hearing level. When comparing the correlations between auditory and language pathways, it becomes apparent that the latter might exert a superior influence on auditory-speech outcomes. This could be attributed to the intricate and compensatory neural mechanisms involved in speech comprehension, especially in patients with auditory implants. Further exploration of these findings is elaborated upon in the ‘Discussion section.</p><p>Despite the uniformly positive and frequently robust correlations (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.5, many &gt; 0.75), most did not pass the stringent FWE correction, and only managed to exceed uncorrected p-value thresholds. The only correlations that survived the rigorous FWE correction were those between age and IT-MAIS at startup, age and MUSS at 6 mo post-activation, and surgery choice and PTA at 6 mo. These findings warrant careful interpretation.</p><p>In addition, our findings presented an unexpected correlation: a positive association was identified between PTA at 6 mo post-activation and the FD of left LL and left BIC within the central auditory pathway. Considering that elevated PTA scores signify a degraded auditory condition, the implication of a positive correlation with the FD in these regions of the central auditory pathway raises a conundrum. Upon further reflection, we suspected that this positive correlation might be an artefact of statistical anomaly due to the polarized distribution of PTA values (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Specifically, the PTA values of the eight patients analysed were situated at either high or low extremes, leaving few intermediate scores. The higher PTA values for ABI recipients, in particular, might skew the overall correlation. To substantiate this theory, we conducted a separate correlation analysis confined to CI recipients (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results showed that the earlier identified positive correlation between PTA and other metrics vanished, thus corroborating our initial hypothesis. We therefore infer that the previously observed positive correlation between PTA and FD in certain regions of the auditory pathway could be a statistical illusion triggered by extreme PTA values in ABI recipients, rather than a genuine relationship. Conversely, the scale scores at both initial and 6-month timepoints did not appear as polarized as the PTA. On reviewing these results, we noted that the overall correlation pattern of the scales established in the all-patient cohort were largely preserved<underline>, </underline>such as the strong correlations with age and the association between language pathways and the majority of scales at both timepoints.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we successfully segmented subcortical auditory regions and reconstructed the auditory and language pathways in vivo. Our findings showed decreased FD and FC mainly in the inferior part of the central auditory pathway and the left language pathway. Additionally, we discovered that the correlation between language pathway fibre metrics and peripheral vestibulocochlear nerve structure is stronger and more significant than that in the central auditory pathway, and that the peripheral nerve structure moderated the developmental trajectory of the central auditory and language pathways. Preoperatively evaluating the structure of the auditory-language network helps predict postoperative audiometric and qualitative language outcomes.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The new pipeline for mapping the human auditory pathway with in vivo MRI</title><p>To address the issue of inability to precisely locate subcortical auditory nuclei using sound-stimulating fMRI tasks for patients with profound hearing loss, we have introduced a new pipeline that only requires the acquisition and postprocessing of structural and diffusional images. The CN appears as an angulated wedge shape along the brainstem surface when viewed from above; it is mostly located between the inferior cerebellar peduncle (ICP) and CSF, with a small width of up to around 2 mm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosahl and Rosahl, 2013</xref>). The SOC is a small cell mass that is buried deep in the brainstem, surrounded by multiple fibre bundles. These two delicate auditory nuclei are prone to partial volume effects due to insufficient resolution and a lack of contrast to differentiate them from their surroundings in in vivo structural MR brain scans (even when using 7T MRI scanner; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sitek et al., 2019</xref>). To address this, we have reconstructed super-resolution TDI maps to provide complementary contrast for high-resolution structural images, allowing the CN and the SOC to be delineated according to track density and track direction at an isotropic resolution of 0.5 mm. The super-resolution properties of TDI maps have been validated using in vivo and in silico data, and the anatomical contrast of TDI maps from ex vivo mouse data has been related to histology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calamante et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Calamante et al., 2012</xref>). TDI maps have been demonstrated to be useful in delineating substructures of the thalamus, the basal ganglia, and brainstem fibre bundle cross-sections to assist fibre tracking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calamante et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kwon et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Epprecht et al. found that significantly different fibre orientations can be detected in the CN area and in the ICP area using diffusion tensor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Epprecht et al., 2020</xref>), which suggests the potential role of fibre direction information in distinguishing the CN from adjacent structures. In the present study, the good inter-rater reliability of segmentation suggests that this method is effective for locating the subcortical auditory nuclei.</p><p>Our results showed that the best way to capture fibre features of different tracts in the auditory pathway is to track them separately and optimize tracking strategies for each part. We implemented probabilistic tractography and deliberately chose seeds and termination ROIs for each tract based on anatomical prior knowledge. MCP fibres were excluded when tracking the TB, which accounted for a large proportion of contralateral streamlines if not controlled and have yet been neglected in earlier studies. Exclusion ROIs are also essential when tracking the AR, because the AR crosses with several major fibre bundles that own greater FOD amplitudes in the corresponding directions. Mafei et al. found that optimal tracking parameters for the ARs were probabilistic tractography with default settings (angle threshold = 45°, step size = 1/2 * voxel size); however, the FOD amplitude threshold was not mentioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maffei et al., 2019</xref>). We examined a range of cutoff values and found that thresholding at 0.05 obtained optimal results for the ARs and 0.1 for subcortical auditory tracts. The tractography parameters established in the present study offer reliable recommendations for future attempts to track the auditory pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Fibre impairment pattern in the central auditory pathway of children with profound SNHL</title><p>Normally, the axonal myelination of the auditory pathway starts at the 26th foetal week, becomes definitive by the 29th week of gestation, and continuously increases in density until at least 1 y postnatal age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Moore et al., 1995</xref>). With the deprivation of hearing inputs, the central auditory pathways of children with congenital profound hearing loss displayed a brainstem-dominant fibre impairment pattern that included both microstructural impairment and macroscopic deficiency: the FD, FC, and FDC of the TB and the FC of the lateral lemnisci were significantly decreased; nevertheless, no significant difference was found in the branchium of inferior colliculus or the AR.</p><p>Current results are partly contradictory to earlier findings using the diffusion tensor model. Huang et al. manually delineated six ROIs along the auditory pathway, including nuclei and fibre bundles, using a 14 mm<sup>2</sup> square box in T2w and FA maps of children with profound hearing loss. They measured DTI-based metrics in the TB, SOC, IC, MGB, AR, and white matter of Heschl’s gyrus (LL and BIC not included) and found decreased FA values in all of these six ROIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huang et al., 2015</xref>). Wu et al. focused on the AR and STG, demonstrating reduced FA values in both regions in children with hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). The discrepancy between the present study and earlier findings may be caused by methodology factors. Unlike DTI metrics, FBA is capable of measuring individual fibre properties in fibre-crossing areas, which is the case along almost the entire auditory pathway. Based on our new pipeline, each fibre bundle in the auditory pathway was defined by tractography separately; FBA metrics were measured in the fixel mask built on the auditory pathway so that presumable contamination from adjacent crossing fibres was excluded. Also, the FWE correction used in FBA is a more rigid multiple comparison method. As a result, we were able to make an accurate and strict examination of the fibre properties of the auditory pathway.</p><p>The TB was the most affected tract in the auditory pathway of children with congenital profound hearing loss. The TB is essential to sound localization because it transfers binaural sound information to the SOC, where interaural level and time differences are compared to identify the sound source. Decreased FD and FDC in the TB indicate an immature myelination or axon loss, which may affect the efficiency of signal transmission. For patients with bilateral cochlear implants, their accuracy and sensitivity of sound localization are still worse than those of normal hearing listeners and hearing aid users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dorman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Verschuur et al., 2005</xref>). One reason for this may be the absent temporal fine structure cues and limited absolute level judgements in the CI system. Another possibility is that the structural impairment of the TB plays a role in the process. If this is true, it raises the interesting question of whether auditory implants may promote structural plasticity in the TB that could enhance sound localization performance over time.</p><p>The formation of a brainstem-dominant impairment pattern warrants investigation. The absence of a significant difference in two high-level auditory pathways, the BIC and AR, may reflect that the susceptibility of fibre structures to auditory deprivation decreases in a bottom-up fashion along the pathway, or that upper pathways in the thalamus and cerebrum may have already undergone cross-modal plasticity so that fibres are still structurally intact but subserve other functions. It has been proposed that the auditory cortex might reorganize to mediate other functions such as vision. Auditory areas in the superior temporal sulcus show greater recruitment in individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss than in hearing individuals when processing visual, tactile, or signed stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bavelier et al., 2006</xref>). However, it is unclear that to what extent the primary auditory cortex may be affected by cross-modal plasticity and whether such cortical plasticity would affect downstream auditory nuclei and in-between fibre bundles. Further studies incorporating structural and functional features of the auditory pathway in larger samples are required to shed light on these questions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The structural development of the language pathway in children with profound SNHL</title><p>After CI and/or ABI implantation, children were able to achieve good hearing sensation, but their performance in speech recognition and production was poorer and varied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sennaroğlu et al., 2016</xref>). One of the most important tasks in this field is identifying the factors that contribute to language outcome after implantation. In this study, we focused on the structural properties of the language pathway and found that patients with profound SNHL had an all-streams-affected fibre impairment that was left-dominant.</p><p>The language pathway was reconstructed based on Angela Friederici’s model, which elucidates the neuroanatomical fibre bundles that underlie specific language functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friederici, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Friederici et al., 2017</xref>). The coordination between BA44 and pSTC subserves syntactic computation, while the ventral streams that connect BA45 and FOP with the temporal cortex support lexical-semantic comprehension. The pSTC integrates syntactic and semantic information for comprehension at the sentence level and is also connected to the PMC as a peripheral sensorimotor interface system. The maturational status of these tracts has been found to be associated with behavioural performance. For example, the tract targeting BA44 is highly predictive of behavioural performance on processing hierarchically complex sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Skeide et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, these four streams were separately reconstructed using probabilistic tractography. FBA results showed that the dorsal streams mainly suffered from reduced FD, while the ventral streams mainly exhibited decreased FC in children with profound SNHL. The combined metric FDC was more sensitive in detecting fibre impairment in both dorsal and ventral streams. These results demonstrate that deprived auditory inputs have a damaging effect on the structural development of all language streams that serve different functions, which may indicate that children with congenital profound hearing loss suffer from an overall underdeveloped language capacity in semantics, syntax, and sensorimotor integration, rather than just struggling with oral communication.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Moderation of central pathway maturation by peripheral auditory structure</title><p>Patients with normal peripheral auditory structure and those with IEM&amp;CND had significantly different cn.VIII median contrast values (which has been shown to represent nerve tissue density; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harris et al., 2021</xref>), but few differences in FD and FC of the central auditory pathway and language pathway. However, several central pathways were positively correlated with cn.VIII median contrast values, including FC of bilateral BIC and LL, FC of two left ventral streams, and FD of bilateral dorsal streams and left ventral streams. Although all patients included in the study were diagnosed with bilaterally profound SNHL, several patients with normal peripheral structure had late-onset or progressive hearing loss that may have allowed a small amount of peripheral auditory inputs to stimulate central development before profound hearing loss. In contrast, all patients with CND failed newborn hearing screening and remained profound hearing loss since (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This phenomenon may partly explain the correlation between peripheral nerve tissue density and central fibre metrics.</p><p>Our findings revealed a stronger and more significant correlation between language pathway fibre metrics and peripheral nerve tissue density than with central auditory metrics. This might seem counterintuitive given the structural and functional connections between the central auditory pathway and the peripheral cochlear nerve. For patients with profound SNHL, who present normal cochlear nerves and inner ear structures, the primary pathology is often located at the cellular level within the cochlea. However, in non-syndromic profound SNHL patients exhibiting IEM&amp;CND, more severe genetic abnormalities are typically suspected. In our study cohort, genetic testing results were acquired for seven participants, revealing mutations in GJB2 (two patients), OTOF (one patient), and MYO15A (one patient). These mutations are largely associated with peripheral auditory deficits, given these genes' critical roles in inner ear development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kelsell et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stelma and Bhutta, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yasunaga et al., 1999</xref>). Consequently, we hypothesized that observed central auditory pathway alterations could be adaptive changes due to these peripheral deficits. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the detected central auditory anomalies stem from genetic factors directly or whether they are the result of underdevelopment due to auditory deprivation following peripheral dysfunction. Our findings suggest a weak association between profound hearing loss-related impaired fixels in the central auditory pathway and cn.VIII tissue density, casting doubt on the former hypothesis. It is important to consider, however, the potential of certain gene mutations such as CDH23 or CHD7 – typically linked with syndromic forms of hearing loss – to directly affect central auditory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astuto et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zentner et al., 2010</xref>). Although our study primarily included non-syndromic hearing loss patients, these potential genetic influences highlight the complexities inherent in interpreting auditory function and call for further in-depth investigation.</p><p>On the other hand, the significant association between FD/FC of profound hearing loss-associated impaired language fixels and cn.VIII tissue density suggests that the language pathway is more sensitive to peripheral auditory condition compared to the central auditory pathway. The language pathway, as the substrate for higher cognitive functions, develops in a way that is highly dependent on external inputs and interaction with the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kuhl and Rivera-Gaxiola, 2008</xref>). More specifically, acquiring proper inputs during a sensitive period is essential for the maturation of the language pathway. This structural developmental feature corresponds with behavioural results from follow-up studies on CI recipients of different age at implantation. Chen et al. compared performances of children implanted before and after 2 years old and found that the younger the age of bilateral cochlear implant surgery, the higher developmental quotient of language, social skills, and adaptability the child could achieve after 2 y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>). Houston et al. studied an earlier demarcation timepoint at 1 year old and found that children implanted during the first year of life had better vocabulary outcomes than children implanted during the second year of life; however, earlier implanted children did not show better speech perception outcomes than later implanted children. They suggested that there is an earlier sensitive period for developing the ability to learn words than for central auditory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Houston and Miyamoto, 2010</xref>).</p><p>To understand the specific impact of peripheral nerve structure on the developmental trajectory of central pathways, we conducted a moderation analysis. Cn.VIII tissue density had a significant negative moderation effect on the relationship between auditory pathway FD and age, and that between language pathway FD and age. In other words, the lower the cn.VIII tissue density, the closer the relationship between FD of central pathways and age. It is worth noting that cn.VIII tissue density only moderated FD maturation; there was no significant moderation effect on FC maturation. These results may imply that the macroscopic developmental trajectory of central pathways is similar among patients with various peripheral conditions, while at the microscopic level, peripheral nerve deficiency may lead to a delayed and slowed axon generation or myelination in central pathways, which may reflect as an increased association of central FD with age in the participants ranging from 6 months to 6 years old. However, when controlling gender, gestational weeks, and birth weights, the moderation effect was not significant, necessitating a cautious interpretation of the findings. Taken together, to prevent aberrant structural development in the auditory-language network in the absence of hearing, auditory interventions should be implemented as early as possible. Special attention should be paid to patients with CND. Early interventions would provide children with timely auditory inputs during the critical period of language development and lead to better long-term outcomes.</p><p>Indeed, the quantitative differences observed between the effects on the central auditory and language structures may be influenced by the varying ability to accurately image each pathway with current neuroimaging technologies. The central auditory pathway, largely situated in the brainstem, faces severe distortion in diffusion images due to the inherent properties of the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence used. Despite distortion correction methods, it is challenging to entirely eliminate these effects. In contrast, the language pathways, primarily located in the cerebrum, have less distortion, allowing for more accurate imaging. Additionally, the auditory pathways in the brain (e.g. the auditory radiations) intersect with numerous cerebral fibre tracts, complicating accurate tractography. While the Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) modelling approach we employed is currently the most advanced method for addressing crossing fibres, it is not entirely exempt from these issues. The language pathways, on the other hand, intersect with fewer fibre tracts, facilitating more precise reconstruction. Lastly, the language pathways are more extensive and possess more fibres than the auditory pathways. From a statistical perspective, this enables more ‘sampling’ when extracting average metrics such as FD, resulting in more stable outcomes. Therefore, the differences in our ability to visualize and quantify these pathways might have influenced the comparative effects observed. As neuroimaging technologies and methodologies continue to advance, we anticipate that our understanding of the differential effects of hearing loss on the central auditory and language structures will continue to evolve and improve. Another limitation is that the normal hearing control group did not undergo scanning with the CISS sequence, precluding the establishment of a baseline for comparing the development of auditory and language pathways in SNHL to normal development, which requires future research to include a baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Integrating pre-surgical evaluations for optimized auditory-language rehabilitation</title><p>Our study delivers novel insight into the quantification of central auditory structural development and advocates an individualized, comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation of the auditory-language network to inform surgical decisions and predict prognosis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Further research should explore association and causation between neural and more robust auditory (e.g. speech-in-noise) and language evaluations.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation of the auditory-language network.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85983-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Comprehensive auditory system assessment: Informed surgical decisions</title><p>By refining the CISS-based estimation of cn.VIII tissue density, we enable more accurate quantitative assessment of peripheral nerve structure, which is essential for characterizing CND. The positive correlation of cn.VIII median contrast value with CAP and IT-MAIS at 6 mo post-activation, and with change in SIR, underscores its clinical value in predicting postoperative auditory performance.</p><p>Furthermore, by reconstructing the entire central auditory pathway, we enable measurements of FD and FCs to assess the structural maturity and integrity of the central auditory pathway. Although correlations with auditory-language scales were not significant in the all-patient analysis, among CI recipients, correlations were observed in specific regions of the auditory pathway. This suggests that this approach might be indicative of postoperative auditory information transmission efficiency and highlight the need for further investigations.</p><p>Moreover, by integrating the findings from HRCT, CISS MRI, and reconstruction of the central auditory pathway, we offer a holistic view from the cochlea to the auditory cortex, which may guide critical surgical decisions such as the choice between CI and ABI, and the side of implantation. Our study primarily includes patients with normal peripheral structures undergoing CI, but patients with varying malformations may also be CI candidates. Thus, while our findings provide initial insights, further investigations encompassing a more diverse patient population with different types of IEM&amp;CND are warranted. It is also worth noting that the timepoint of outcomes post-implantation is important when comparing ABI and CI. Although our study found that ABI generally resulted in poorer PTA 6 mo post-activation compared to CI, clinical experience suggests that ABI patients may show considerable improvements over a longer term (within a year or two post-activation). Therefore, longer-term follow-up is essential to fully understand the outcomes of different surgeries. Our study’s 6-month follow-up lays the groundwork for future, more comprehensive studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Language pathways: Central to post-implant speech outcomes</title><p>We found that FD of most language pathways positively correlates with auditory and language scales. Our findings indicate the potentially central role of the structural development of the language pathway in predicting auditory and language outcomes following implantation.</p><p>Language has a recursive hierarchical structure, and the brain’s mechanism of language processing reflects this through its hierarchical representations that unfold across time and space in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Friederici, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hickok and Poeppel, 2007</xref>). Speech processing requires the transformation of continuous acoustic inputs into discrete linguistic constructs, termed the acoustic-phonological mapping. Many studies have found that Heschl’s gyrus (HG) preferentially processes spectrotemporal features of sound, while STG preferentially processes phonological and intelligible features, indicating an ascending hierarchical progression from HG to STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Obleser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peelle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Venezia et al., 2019</xref>). However, recent research conducted by Edward Chang and colleagues demonstrated that transient functional disruptions or focal ablation of the HG did not impair speech comprehension, thereby suggesting a parallel processing between HG and STG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamilton et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, while STG is the computational hub for acoustic-phonological mapping, its response to speech stimuli is also modulated by cognitive factors such as attention, as well as high-level linguistic knowledge such as language familiarity and contextual information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leonard and Chang, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>). The dynamic interplay between STG and higher-level centres such as the frontal cortex is crucial for speech processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cope et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leonard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sohoglu et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, to some extent, STG in conjunction with these higher-level centres could be viewed as a speech processing network that operates independently of tonotopic mapping within HG. The language pathways reconstructed in this study form a significant part of this network.</p><p>Our findings revealed that subjective auditory-speech performance was predominantly correlated with the preoperative FD of the language pathway, rather than the structural status of the auditory system. This observation underscores the potential necessity of employing language-specific metrics to evaluate speech prognosis. It is noteworthy that sound information contains a significant redundancy for speech processing, as evidenced by the fact that people can understand degraded speech. In the context of patients with auditory implants, the received auditory signals tend to be unnatural and degraded. It is possible that the restoration of precise tonotopic mapping in these patients may not substantially influence their speech perception; instead, the dynamic interplay between STG and higher-order brain regions is instrumental in their speech comprehension capabilities. Predictions provided by higher-level centres aid patients in understanding and learning language. Peelle et al. found that listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing when listening to spoken words, indicating a compensatory role of the frontal lobe in language processing for implant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sherafati et al., 2022</xref>). As such, evaluating the structural integrity of connecting fibres between STG and higher-level centres preoperatively may predict the postoperative efficiency of information transmission within the network, which could be indicative of language-related behavioural outcomes.</p><p>Additionally, our results also indicate a significant positive correlation between age at the time of preoperative MRI scanning and postoperative performance. At first glance, this appears to be contradictory to the widely held view that there are advantages to performing surgery at an early age. However, it is important to note that the postoperative performance data in this study was gathered at 6 mo following surgery. Older children typically possess a more extensive repository of abstract concepts and might have a more developed top-down predictive function in higher-level brain areas. Consequently, in this short-term postoperative timeframe, older children may exhibit superior performance due to their advanced cognitive development. However, once the timeframe is extended, a wealth of behavioural evidence suggests that undergoing surgery earlier offers advantages in various areas, including auditory, linguistic, and cognitive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Friedmann and Rusou, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, 2019</xref>). Therefore, in the context of clinical decision-making, it is advisable to perform surgery at the earliest feasible juncture. At this early stage, when the age range is narrow, evaluating the development of the language pathway preoperatively could hold substantial prognostic value.</p><p>Overall, while the study’s findings emphasize the value of these preoperative metrics in determining postoperative outcomes, we acknowledge the need for additional research to corroborate these findings and unlock the full potential of these evaluations. By pushing forward in these investigations, we can continue to refine and enhance auditory rehabilitation, delivering patient-specific care and ultimately improving postoperative auditory and language outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The strengths of the present study include (1) the first comprehensive in vivo reconstruction of the central auditory pathway independent of using auditory stimuli; (2) the inclusion of children with IEM&amp;CND in addition to those with normal inner ear structures to provide a more complete picture of children with congenital profound hearing loss; and (3) a precise inspection of fibre structures of the auditory pathway, the language pathway, and their subdivisions using a fixel-based approach that address crossing fibre issues.</p><p>We also acknowledge some limitations of this study: (1) the genetic dataset in our study is incomplete and heterogeneous. While two patients underwent extensive testing of over 200 genes, five were tested for select common genes. For a thorough understanding of the genetic factors in auditory deficits, future studies should employ uniform and comprehensive genetic testing across participants. (2) Our cohort is of a limited size, which may limit the generalizability of these findings to a larger population. (3) The potential discrepancies in the ability to image auditory and language pathways could have influenced the observed effects. Specifically, the more pronounced distortion of the auditory pathway in diffusion images, the complex fibre-crossing issue within the auditory pathway, and the fewer fibres present compared to the language pathway may have contributed to the observed differences. (4) A ‘floor effect’ was observed in the PTA of ABI recipients and in some auditory and language scale scores. This may have masked the full extent of the relationships between the structural parameters and postoperative progress, as significant improvements could potentially be observed in some patients over a more extended period.

Additionally, our investigation uncovered significant correlations between fibre densities of auditory and language pathway subdivisions and various auditory and language outcomes, underscoring the potential predictive value of these structural parameters. This provides structural evidence supporting the necessity of early auditory intervention and establishes a promising comprehensive pre-surgical evaluation of the auditory-language network for children with severe-to-profound SNHL to assist with surgical planning and prognosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study sample</title><p>Twenty-three children aged under 6 years old, including 13 patients with bilateral profound congenital SNHL and 10 controls matched on age and gender, were included.</p><p>The patients met the following criteria: (1) diagnosis of bilateral profound SNHL: click ABR threshold &gt;95 dB nHL, or pure tone average (PTA, 0.5–4k Hz) threshold &gt;95 dB HL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2011</xref>); and (2) non-syndromic hearing loss (no association with any other systemic manifestations). The controls had normal hearing in both ears (click ABR threshold/PTA &lt;20 dB HL).

The diffusional images were then upsampled to 1.25 mm isotropic voxels for subsequent better estimation of fibre orientation distribution (FOD).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Behavioral data on the speech and language abilities of the children are available and should be reported.</p><p>2) The clinical evaluation and presentation of the children, both genetically and auditorily, is inadequate. Please provide any further details that would be useful for interpreting the other results.</p><p>3) The distinction between the groups isn't adequately considered. Please provide further details.</p><p>4) The practical relevance of the auditory-language pathways is unclear. Aside from behavioral data (point 1, above), a broader consideration of the studied pathways in the overall processing of hearing and language by the brain is needed.</p><p>5) Add discussion of the possibility that the quantitative difference between effects on central auditory and language structures is due to the different ability to image each pathway.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall, the authors have done a beautiful job creating high-resolution maps of the auditory pathway in these children. This type of imaging is not my speciality and so I cannot comment on the methodology or analysis behind the imaging. However, I am an expert on pediatric hearing loss and so I evaluated this manuscript from that perspective.</p><p>Detailed recommendations are below:</p><p>1) There are some major deficiencies with respect to the clinical evaluation/presentation of the children in this study which makes interpretation of the results difficult. First of all, there is no diagnosis provided. The causes of pediatric hearing loss is extraordinarily complex with hundreds of genetic forms and environmental causes as well. Hearing loss is not a diagnosis but is instead a symptom of an underlying pathologic change to the peripheral and/or central auditory system. The authors do not provide a diagnosis for the 13 children with hearing loss and as such any conclusions are limited. For example, if some of the children have GJB2 hearing loss, I would expect differences compared to children with CDH23 hearing loss (which has been shown to have some central auditory effect). Similarly, variants in CHD7, are associated with CHARGE syndrome and are a common cause of cochlear nerve deficiency, with some presumed central effect. The authors should provide more clinical history on individual patients, including hearing testing, and should at the least have performed genetic testing for a full evaluation of hearing loss. Ideally, the authors would then separate their subjects into groups (i.e. those with GJB2 hearing loss, versus others). This would make their study more powerful.</p><p>2) This study does not include cochlear implant and/or auditory brainstem implant outcomes. Therefore, the authors cannot have any claims to determining or predicting outcomes with these devices until their correlate this finding with those results. This would be an excellent follow-up study and the authors should temper their statements on clinical applicability until this is completed.</p><p>3) I assume that the CIs and ABIs were implanted after imaging? This is not specified anywhere that I could find.</p><p>4) The figure legends are confusing. Please indicate whether each image is an individual patient or an average and which group each image belongs to.</p><p>5) The graphs in Figure 3 are very very difficult to read. The authors should reformat these so that there is a white background and the bars are filled (or at least not use the current color scheme).</p><p>6) The authors should be careful about how they use the word 'deaf'. 'Deaf or hard of hearing' is an appropriate way to describe individuals with hearing loss. Severe-to-profound or profound are accurate ways to describe the severity of a hearing loss. The use of the word 'deaf' to describe profound hearing loss is generally discouraged as it is not scientific and may be confused by 'Deaf' (capital D) which describes members of the Deaf community.</p><p>Please see above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>General comments</p><p>– Although the paper tried to justify why focusing on IEM and CND is important, such decision seems still arbitrary to this reviewer. More discussion on what makes these hearing loss etiologies distinct from other etiologies would help.</p><p>– The paper does not discuss how these results help with a better understanding of speech sound encoding and decoding in listeners with normal and impaired hearing. It is particularly important to discuss these findings in the context of mapping sound patterns to phonological units.</p><p>– Also, there is a rich literature on hearing, language comprehension, and speech perception network from Gregory Hickok, David Poeppel, and Jonathan Peelle which are not discussed in this paper.</p><p>Title</p><p>– The title needs to be more specific to the questions of this study.

We have expanded our discussion to encompass a broader consideration of the auditory and language pathways in speech processing.

We have also addressed the implications of our findings within this context (Page 23-24, Line 584-619). For more details, please refer to our response to Reviewer 2's Comment 2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Add discussion of the possibility that the quantitative difference between effects on central auditory and language structures is due to the different ability to image each pathway.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We agree that the inherent challenges in imaging each pathway might indeed contribute to the observed differences in their structural effects. To address this concern, we have added an in-depth discussion on this point in the sections where we discuss the respective results of the auditory and language pathways (Page 22, Line 524-545). Specifically, we have included considerations on factors such as the severe distortion in diffusion images of the auditory pathway, particularly within the brainstem, the complex fiber crossing issue that is more pronounced within the auditory pathway, and the inherent differences in fiber numbers between the auditory and language pathways.</p><p>“Indeed, the quantitative differences observed between the effects on the central auditory and language structures may be influenced by the varying ability to accurately image each pathway with current neuroimaging technologies. The central auditory pathway, largely situated in the brainstem, faces severe distortion in diffusion images due to the inherent properties of the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence used. Despite distortion correction methods, it is challenging to entirely eliminate these effects. In contrast, the language pathways, primarily located in the cerebrum, have less distortion, allowing for more accurate imaging. Additionally, the auditory pathways in the brain (e.g., the auditory radiations) intersect with numerous cerebral fibre tracts, complicating accurate tractography. While the Constrained Spherical Deconvolution (CSD) modelling approach we employed is currently the most advanced method for addressing crossing fibres, it is not entirely exempt from these issues. The language pathways, on the other hand, intersect with fewer fibre tracts, facilitating more precise reconstruction. Lastly, the language pathways are more extensive and possess more fibres than the auditory pathways. From a statistical perspective, this enables more &quot;sampling&quot; when extracting average metrics such as fibre density, resulting in more stable outcomes. Therefore, the differences in our ability to visualize and quantify these pathways might have influenced the comparative effects observed. As neuroimaging technologies and methodologies continue to advance, we anticipate that our understanding of the differential effects of hearing loss on the central auditory and language structures will continue to evolve and improve.”</p><p>Additionally, we have included a summary of this discussion in the 'Limitations' section of our paper (Page 27, Line 654-658) to underscore its potential impact on our results. We hope that these additions sufficiently address your comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall, the authors have done a beautiful job creating high-resolution maps of the auditory pathway in these children. This type of imaging is not my speciality and so I cannot comment on the methodology or analysis behind the imaging. However, I am an expert on pediatric hearing loss and so I evaluated this manuscript from that perspective.</p><p>Detailed recommendations are below:</p><p>1) There are some major deficiencies with respect to the clinical evaluation/presentation of the children in this study which makes interpretation of the results difficult. First of all, there is no diagnosis provided. The causes of pediatric hearing loss is extraordinarily complex with hundreds of genetic forms and environmental causes as well. Hearing loss is not a diagnosis but is instead a symptom of an underlying pathologic change to the peripheral and/or central auditory system. The authors do not provide a diagnosis for the 13 children with hearing loss and as such any conclusions are limited. For example, if some of the children have GJB2 hearing loss, I would expect differences compared to children with CDH23 hearing loss (which has been shown to have some central auditory effect). Similarly, variants in CHD7, are associated with CHARGE syndrome and are a common cause of cochlear nerve deficiency, with some presumed central effect. The authors should provide more clinical history on individual patients, including hearing testing, and should at the least have performed genetic testing for a full evaluation of hearing loss. Ideally, the authors would then separate their subjects into groups (i.e. those with GJB2 hearing loss, versus others). This would make their study more powerful.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful comment regarding the complex etiologies of pediatric hearing loss, and the importance of understanding the specific diagnoses, including potential genetic causes, to fully interpret our results. We agree that the genetic basis of hearing loss could potentially influence the outcomes we have studied, and that this is a limitation of our current study. As stated in our response to the Essential Revision, we have now included more detailed clinical, auditory, and available genetic data for all patients in our study.</p><p>To further elucidate our study participants' audiological profiles, we have included a detailed table in the supplements. This comprehensive table delineates each patient's audiological history and current status, including newborn hearing screening results, initial diagnosis parameters, intervention details, and recent preoperative audiometric evaluations. We believe this enriched data set will provide valuable context for interpreting our study's results (see Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Notably, all children included in our study have been clinically characterized as having non-syndromic hearing loss (see Supplementary file 2). Comprehensive family histories have been obtained, with no reported congenital hearing loss or known genetic disorders within their immediate families. In addition, full-body examinations have been performed to exclude any syndromic forms of hearing loss. Therefore, while we appreciate the importance of genetic factors as pointed out by the reviewer, it is important to note that our cohort is composed of children clinically diagnosed with non-syndromic hearing loss. To enhance clarity, we have included this information in the first paragraph of the ‘Introduction’ (Page 2, Line 9-14).</p><p>“The etiology of these impairments is multifaceted, with genetic factors playing a significant role, alongside external contributors such as congenital infections (Marazita et al., 1993). Hearing loss is categorized as syndromic, with accompanying physical or laboratory findings, or non-syndromic, where hearing loss is the sole symptom and has a highly heterogeneous genetic basis (Korver et al., 2017). This article primarily focuses on non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss.”</p><p>We have added the available genetic testing results for half of our patients (seven out of thirteen, see Supplementary file 2) and have included a discussion on the possible implications of these results for our study's findings (see Page 21, Line 469-490). However, it is not feasible for us to recall the remaining patients for this testing due to practical constraints. We acknowledge in the manuscript that the absence of genetic testing results for all patients limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions regarding the impact of specific genetic variants on our findings (see Page 27, Line 649-653).</p><p>(Page 21, Line 469-490) “Our findings revealed a stronger and more significant correlation between language pathway fibre metrics and peripheral nerve tissue density than with central auditory metrics. This might seem counterintuitive given the structural and functional connections between the central auditory pathway and the peripheral cochlear nerve. For patients with profound SNHL, who present normal cochlear nerves and inner ear structures, the primary pathology is often located at the cellular level within the cochlea. However, in non-syndromic profound SNHL patients exhibiting IEM&amp;CND, more severe genetic abnormalities are typically suspected. In our study cohort, genetic testing results were acquired for seven participants, revealing mutations in GJB2 (two patients), OTOF (one patient), and MYO15A (one patient). These mutations are largely associated with peripheral auditory deficits, given these genes' critical roles in inner ear development and function (Kelsell et al., 1997; Stelma &amp; Bhutta, 2014; Wang et al., 1998; Yasunaga et al., 1999). Consequently, we hypothesized that observed central auditory pathway alterations could be adaptive changes due to these peripheral deficits. Nevertheless, it remains uncertain whether the detected central auditory anomalies stem from genetic factors directly or whether they are the result of underdevelopment due to auditory deprivation following peripheral dysfunction. Our findings suggest a weak association between profound hearing loss-related impaired fixels in the central auditory pathway and cn.VIII tissue density, casting doubt on the former hypothesis. It is important to consider, however, the potential of certain gene mutations such as CDH23 or CHD7 – typically linked with syndromic forms of hearing loss – to directly affect central auditory pathways (Astuto et al., 2002; Zentner et al., 2010). Although our study primarily included non-syndromic hearing loss patients, these potential genetic influences highlight the complexities inherent in interpreting auditory function and call for further in-depth investigation.”</p><p>(Page 27, Line 649-653) “We also acknowledge some limitations to this study: (1) The genetic dataset in our study is incomplete and heterogeneous. While two patients underwent extensive testing of over 200 genes, five were tested for select common genes. For a thorough understanding of the genetic factors in auditory deficits, future studies should employ uniform and comprehensive genetic testing across participants;”</p><p>Subsequent adjustments to the methodological and Results sections have been made accordingly, which can be found in Page 28, Line 701-705 (Methods) and Page 5, Line 117-119 (Results).</p><p>We hope that these additions address the reviewer's concerns, and we thank them for prompting us to more thoroughly discuss these important issues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This study does not include cochlear implant and/or auditory brainstem implant outcomes.

As addressed in our response to the essential revisions, we have now incorporated these outcomes into our analysis (see Page 15-17). Additionally, we have introduced a section titled “Integrating pre-surgical evaluations for optimized auditory-language rehabilitation” in the ‘Discussion’ to elaborate on the implications and limitations of these results (see Page 23-25). This inclusion lends more substantiation to our assertions regarding the predictive value of the pre-operative MRI metrics for CI/ABI outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I assume that the CIs and ABIs were implanted after imaging?

The 'Clinical data' and 'CT, MRI acquisition, and quality assessment' aspects have been incorporated under the 'Pre-operative clinical and imaging evaluation' subsection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The figure legends are confusing.

'Deaf or hard of hearing' is an appropriate way to describe individuals with hearing loss. Severe-to-profound or profound are accurate ways to describe the severity of a hearing loss. The use of the word 'deaf' to describe profound hearing loss is generally discouraged as it is not scientific and may be confused by 'Deaf' (capital D) which describes members of the Deaf community.</p><p>Please see above.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. The revised terms are now highlighted in green color throughout the manuscript. We consistently use 'profound hearing loss' to describe the patients in this study (hearing level over 95 dB at both sides before operation) and choose accurate descriptions when referencing the work of other authors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>General comments</p><p>– Although the paper tried to justify why focusing on IEM and CND is important, such decision seems still arbitrary to this reviewer. More discussion on what makes these hearing loss etiologies distinct from other etiologies would help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable feedback. We understand the reviewer's concern regarding the justification for focusing on IEM&amp;CND and the need to address it more comprehensively.</p><p>Emphasizing IEM &amp; CND is crucial because it poses increased challenges in clinical decision-making compared to cases with normal inner ear structures, particularly in determining the suitable surgical intervention.</p><p>It is worth noting that the etiology of IEM&amp;CND involves both genetic and environmental factors, similar to patients with normal inner ears. However, the genetic basis of non-syndromic IEM&amp;CND is not extensively studied, which makes establishing clear genetic correlations challenging. Nonetheless, it is generally understood that the developmental arrest associated with IEM&amp;CND occurs earlier compared to cases with normal inner ears.</p><p>To address these concerns, we have revised the second paragraph of the ‘Introduction’ (see Page 2, Line 15-43). This revised section elaborates on the challenges in clinical management posed by IEM&amp;CND, provides an explanation for its complex etiology, and highlights the limitations of contemporary clinical imaging in diagnosing, evaluating prognosis, and guiding surgical strategies for profound SNHL patients, particularly those with IEM&amp;CND.</p><p>“Inner ear malformations and cochlear nerve deficiencies (IEM&amp;CND), identifiable with CT and MRI, contribute to 15-39% of pediatric sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) cases (Li et al., 2011; Mafong et al., 2002). The rest is primarily due to cellular-level abnormalities. The etiology of IEM&amp;CND is complex and largely unknown, yet these abnormalities suggest an earlier developmental arrest compared to cases with normal inner ear structures (Sennaroglu &amp; Saatci, 2002). Addressing IEM&amp;CND is vital as it presents specific challenges in clinical management. Cochlear implantation (CI) and auditory brainstem implantation (ABI) are currently the only solutions for profound SNHL, but the choice between CI and ABI presents a dilemma for many IEM&amp;CND patients. CI directly stimulates the spiral ganglion cells, the first-order neurons of the auditory pathway, while ABI bypasses the cochlear nerve and stimulates the second-order auditory neurons in the cochlear nucleus when complex inner ear malformation or cochlear nerve aplasia makes CI inapplicable (Chen &amp; Oghalai, 2016). Both CI and ABI are capable of providing hearing sensation and language development for children with severe-to-profound prelingual hearing loss, but postoperative outcomes vary among individuals. ABI recipients generally have poorer speech recognition performance and delayed and incomplete language development compared to CI recipients (Sennaroğlu et al., 2016). However, the prognosis of CI may not necessarily be better than that of ABI for certain IEMs, including common cavity, cochlear hypoplasia, incomplete partition-type I, and cochlear aperture abnormalities, as the presence of sufficient cochlear fibres required for CI success is uncertain (Freeman &amp; Sennaroglu, 2018; Sennaroğlu &amp; Bajin, 2017). This uncertainty is hard to address for two reasons: (1) assessing the cochlear nerve through visual inspection of MRI poses challenges, including subjective limitations, image quality, and difficulty distinguishing the cochlear nerve from the cranial nerve VIII (the cochleovestibular nerve) in cases of common cavity; and (2) the absence of the cochlear nerve structurally does not always indicate a lack of functional hearing (Thai-Van et al., 2000). Furthermore, distinguishing certain types of IEMs can be problematic and may impact surgical decision-making. For example, differentiating cochlear aplasia with a dilated vestibule (CADV) from a common cavity is challenging; CADV is a definitive indication for ABI, while a common cavity allows for either CI or ABI. These observations underscore the importance of a deep dive into IEM&amp;CND, and highlight the limitations of contemporary clinical imaging in diagnosis, prognosis evaluation, and surgical guidance.”</p><p>Additionally, the penultimate paragraph of the introduction reinforces the inclusion of IEM&amp;CND in our study (Page 3, Line 83-88).</p><p>“Furthermore, previous neuroimaging studies of profound congenital SNHL excluded children with IEM&amp;CND. However, as mentioned earlier, these subjects comprise a significant proportion of patients with congenital hearing loss, and are more inclined to be faced with difficult surgical decisions and unsatisfactory post-implantation outcomes. Therefore, it is important to include and focus on children with IEM&amp;CND when studying central adaptations associated with profound hearing loss.”</p><p>We hope that these modifications effectively justify the significance of focusing on IEM&amp;CND and adequately address the concerns raised by the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The paper does not discuss how these results help with a better understanding of speech sound encoding and decoding in listeners with normal and impaired hearing. It is particularly important to discuss these findings in the context of mapping sound patterns to phonological units.</p><p>– Also, there is a rich literature on hearing, language comprehension, and speech perception network from Gregory Hickok, David Poeppel, and Jonathan Peelle which are not discussed in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your feedback regarding the need to contextualize our findings in the understanding of speech processing in listeners with normal and impaired hearing.</p><p>We opted to employ Angela D. Friederici's language model, given its explicit elucidation of the neuroanatomical fiber bundles associated with specific language functions. This aspect is particularly aligned with our study's emphasis on white matter structure. While Hickok and Poeppel's dual-stream model offers valuable insights, it does not directly associate the processing streams with specific neuroanatomical fiber bundles. However, it is noteworthy that there are considerable similarities between the two models, as both recognize the role of ventral streams in semantic processing and dorsal streams in sensorimotor integration. Additionally, Friederici's model includes a dorsal stream dedicated to syntactic processing. Our reason for basing our language pathway tracking on Friederici's model has been added in the Discussion section (Page 20, Line 437-439).</p><p>Further, we have expanded our discussion to elaborate on how our findings contribute to a better understanding of speech processing. We have included a discussion on both the hierarchical and parallel theories of acoustic-phonological mapping in HG and STG. Additionally, we have highlighted the significance of the dynamic interplay between STG and higher-level brain areas in speech perception, particularly under challenging conditions such as the use of auditory implants.

Although the primary objective of Figure 3 was to compare the hearing-impaired patients as a collective group against the normal control group, we have addressed your request by incorporating an additional figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), which compares the ABI, CI, and NH groups. Initially, we employed a one-way ANOVA to assess FD, FC, and FDC at the fixel-level with FWE correction, but no significant fixels were observed, possibly due to the small sample size. Subsequently, tract-level measures were used to illustrate the trend of differences among these three groups in Figure 3—figure supplement 1. We did not perform an ANOVA or post hoc tests at the tract-level to avoid the double dipping issue, especially since the fixel-level ANOVA did not yield significant results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 167-168: please elaborate on why such surgical decisions have limited value.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We have elaborated on the challenges faced in making surgical decisions for patients with IEM&amp;CND in a new paragraph in the ‘Introduction’ section, where we discuss the limitations of relying solely on visual inspection through CT and MRI (please refer to our response to your first comment). In light of this addition, we have decided to remove this sentence in the ‘Results’ section as the issue is now addressed in the ‘Introduction’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Line 193: Report the actual p–values</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you.

Enhance the reliability and replicability of research findings by increasing the sample size for both SNHL and NH children. The current sample size is insufficient for between-group comparisons and correlational analyses, particularly when examining sub-groups of SNHL children with only 6 or 7 subjects per group.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comments. We wholeheartedly agree that a larger sample size can provide more robust and generalizable results. However, in the context of our current study, we are confronted with practical constraints, including the unique characteristics of our target population and limited available resources. Expanding the participant pool requires specific procedures such as patient recruitment, informed consent, data collection, and data processing. Given the scope of our current study and resources, it is challenging to significantly expand our sample size at this stage. Despite this limitation, we believe our findings are valuable, shedding light on an area with limited prior research. We have exercised rigorous statistical controls and analyses to maximize the validity and reliability of our findings within the confines of our sample size. We recognize the necessity for further research with larger, more diverse cohorts, and have acknowledged this need in the limitations section of our paper. Thank you once again for your constructive suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Incorporate post-surgical behavioral outcome measures into the analysis to assess the value of pre-surgical neuroimaging and neural analyses. This will help elucidate the relationship between pre-surgical neuroimaging and post-surgical behavioral benefits, informing clinical decision-making.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your suggestion to incorporate post-surgical behavioral outcome measures into our analysis. As we mentioned in our responses to previous comments, we have incorporated these measures into our analysis (see Page 15-17 and Page 23-25). The correlation between pre-operative MRI metrics and post-implant behavioral outcomes further supports the potential utility of our imaging markers in informing clinical decision-making.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Reevaluate data analyses for potential double dipping issues, specifically in lines 153-155 and Figure 3 C&amp;D.

We sincerely appreciate your feedback, and it will undoubtedly guide our future research efforts.</p><p>“Another limitation is that the normal hearing control group did not undergo scanning with the CISS sequence, precluding the establishment of a baseline for comparing the development of auditory and language pathways in SNHL to normal development, which requires future research to include a baseline assessment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Ensure that modulation effects displayed in Figure 4 are controlled for confounding variables, such as residual hearing, sex, gestational weeks, birth weight, etc. to improve the validity of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We acknowledge that these variables could potentially impact the validity of the results. We acknowledge the importance of considering residual hearing as a potential factor; however, it is worth noting that all patients in our study exhibited click ABR and/or pure tone thresholds (at 0.5k, 1k, 2k, and 4k Hz) that were over 95 dB HL bilaterally, indicating a profound degree of hearing loss. In fact, the pure tone audiometry results showed thresholds over 95 dB HL at each frequency of 0.5k, 1k, 2k, and 4k Hz for all patients who took the exam. Given this, we did not include residual hearing as a covariate in our analysis. However, we have re-calculated the moderation analyses while controlling for other variables including gender, gestational weeks, and birth weights. The results of these analyses can be found in Figure 4-source data 2, and are described in the relevant sections under ‘Results’ (Page 12, Line 239-241) and ‘Discussion’ (Page 22, Line 517-519). The moderation effect became non-significant after controlling these variables, potentially due to a relatively small sample size in comparison to the number of control variables. We appreciate your insightful suggestion, as it has urged us to interpret the results with greater caution.</p><p>We hope that the revisions and our responses adequately address the reviewers' comments and meet the standards of <italic>eLife</italic>.
