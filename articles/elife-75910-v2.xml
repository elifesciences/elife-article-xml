Understanding their origins is a long-term goal for neuroeconomics, but progress on this front has been limited. Here, we examined choice biases observed when two goods are offered sequentially. In the experiments, rhesus monkeys chose between different juices offered simultaneously or in sequence. Choices under sequential offers were less accurate (higher variability). They were also biased in favor of the second offer (order bias) and in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). Analysis of neuronal activity recorded in the orbitofrontal cortex revealed that these phenomena emerged at different computational stages. Lower choice accuracy reflected weaker offer value signals (valuation stage), the order bias emerged during value comparison (decision stage), and the preference bias emerged late in the trial (post-comparison). By neuronal measures, each phenomenon reduced the value obtained on average in each trial and was thus costly to the monkey.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>behavioral economics</kwd><kwd>neuroeconomics</kwd><kwd>rationality</kwd><kwd>orbitofrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>monkey</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-MH104494</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Padoa-Schioppa</surname><given-names>Camillo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009607</institution-id><institution>McDonnell Center for Systems Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CCSN Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Weikang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuronal activity in the primate orbitofrontal cortex reveals different choice biases observed when offers are presented sequentially originate at different stages of the decision process.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Some of the most mysterious aspects of economic behavior are choice biases documented in behavioral economics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camerer et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kahneman and Tversky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lichtenstein and Slovic, 2006</xref>). Standard economic theory fails to account for these effects, and shedding light on their origins is a long-term goal for neuroeconomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Camerer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glimcher and Rustichini, 2004</xref>). Progress on this front has been relatively modest, largely because the neural underpinnings of (even simple) choices were poorly understood until recently. However, the last 15 years have witnessed substantial advances. An important turning point was the development of experimental protocols in which subjects choose between different goods and relative subjective values are inferred from choices. Decision variables defined from these values are used to interpret neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Plassmann et al., 2007</xref>). Studies that adopted this paradigm showed that neurons in numerous brain regions represent the values of offered and chosen goods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amemori and Graybiel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosokawa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jezzini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Louie and Glimcher, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pastor-Bernier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shenhav and Greene, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, recent experiments using electrical stimulation showed that offer values encoded in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) are causally linked to choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballesta et al., 2020</xref>). These results are of high significance for three reasons.</p><p>First, the identification in OFC and other brain regions of distinct groups of neurons encoding different decision variables is essential to ultimately understand the neural circuit and the mechanisms through which economic decisions are formed.</p><p>Second, in a more conceptual sense, the results summarized above provide a long-sought validation for the construct of value. The proposal that choices entail computing and comparing subjective values was put forth by early economists such as Bernoulli and Bentham (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niehans, 1990</xref>). Although this idea has remained influential, values defined at the behavioral level suffer from a fundamental problem of circularity. On the one hand, choices supposedly maximize values; on the other hand, values cannot be measured behaviorally independent of choices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samuelson, 1938</xref>). Because of this problem, the construct of value gradually lost centrality in economic theory. Thus, in the standard neoclassic formulation choices are ‘as if’ driven by values, but there is no commitment to the idea that agents actually compute values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samuelson, 1947</xref>). In this perspective, the fact that neuronal firing rates in any brain region are linearly related to values defined at the behavioral level constitutes powerful evidence that choices indeed entail the computation of values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Camerer, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Third and less frequently discussed, the identification of neurons encoding offer values and other decision variables, together with some rudimentary understanding of the decision circuit, provides the opportunity to break the circularity problem described above. To appreciate this point, consider the fact that economic choices are often affected by seemingly idiosyncratic biases. For example, while choosing between two options offered sequentially, people and monkeys typically show a bias favoring the second option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Krajbich et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rustichini et al., 2021</xref>). This order bias might occur for at least two reasons. (1) Subjects might assign a higher value to any given good if that good is offered second. (2) Alternatively, subjects might assign identical values independent of the presentation order, and the bias might emerge downstream of valuation, for example during value comparison. In the latter scenario, by introducing the order bias, the decision process would actually fail to maximize the value obtained by the agent. Due to the circularity problem described above, these two hypotheses are ultimately not distinguishable based on behavior alone. However, access to a credible neural measure for the offer values makes it possible, at least in principle, to disambiguate between them. The results presented in this study build on this fundamental idea.</p><p>We focused on choice biases measured when two goods are offered sequentially. In the experiments, monkeys chose between two juices offered in variable amounts. In each session, we randomly interleaved two types of trials referred to as two tasks. In Task 1, offers were presented simultaneously; in Task 2, offers were presented in sequence. Comparing choices across tasks revealed three phenomena. (1) Monkeys were substantially less accurate (higher choice variability) in Task 2 (sequential offers) compared to Task 1 (simultaneous offers). (2) Choices in Task 2 were biased in favor of the second offer (order bias). (3) Choices in Task 2 were biased in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). These effects are especially interesting because in most daily situations offers available for choice appear or are examined sequentially. Thus, we investigated the neuronal origins of these phenomena.</p><p>Neuronal recordings focused on the OFC. Earlier work on choices under simultaneous offers identified in this area different groups of cells encoding individual offer values, the binary choice outcome (chosen juice), and the chosen value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). Furthermore, previous analyses indicated that choices under sequential offers engage the same neuronal populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2022a</xref>). In other words, the cell groups labeled <italic>offer value</italic>, <italic>chosen juice</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic> can be identified in either choice task and appear to preserve their functional role. In first approximation, the variables encoded in OFC capture both the input (offer values) and the output (chosen juice, chosen value) of the choice process, suggesting that the cell groups identified in this area constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017</xref>). A series of experimental (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballesta et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Camille et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>) and theoretical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedrich and Lengyel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Solway and Botvinick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) results support this view. Here, we put forth a more articulated computational framework. In our account, different groups of OFC neurons participate in value computation and value comparison, and these processes are embedded in an ensemble of mental operations taking place before, during, and after the decision itself. In this view, sensory information, memory traces, and internal states are processed upstream of OFC and integrated in the activity of <italic>offer value</italic> cells. These neurons provide the primary input to a circuit formed by <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells, where values are compared. The output of this circuit feeds brain regions involved in working memory and the construction of action plans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Computational framework.</title><p>Information about sensory input, stored memory, and the motivational state is integrated during the computation of offer values. In orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), <italic>offer value</italic> cells provide the primary input to a decision circuit composed of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells. The detailed structure of the decision circuit is not well understood, but previous work indicates that decisions under sequential offers rely on circuit inhibition. In essence, neurons encoding the value of the first offer (offer1) indirectly impose a negative offset on the activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells associated with the second offer (offer2). Notably, this circuit might also subserve working memory. The decision output, captured by the activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells, informs other brain regions that transform it into a suitable action plan. Choice measured behaviorally is ultimately defined by the motor response. This framework highlights the fact that choice biases and/or noise might emerge at multiple computational stages. The arrows indicated here capture only the primary connections.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-75910-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This framework guided a series of analyses relating the activity of each cell group to the choice biases described above. Our results revealed that different phenomena emerged at different computational stages. The lower choice accuracy observed under sequential offers reflected weaker offer value signals (valuation stage). Conversely, the order bias did not have neural correlates at the valuation stage, but rather emerged during value comparison (decision stage). Finally, the preference bias did not have neural correlates at the valuation stage or during value comparison; it emerged late in the trial, shortly before the motor response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reduced accuracy and biases in choices under sequential offers</title><p>Two monkeys participated in the experiments. In each session, they chose between two juices labeled A and B, with A preferred. Offers were represented by sets of colored squares on a monitor, and animals indicated their choice with a saccade. In each session, two choice tasks were randomly interleaved. In Task 1, offers were presented simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>); in Task 2, offers were presented in sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The relative values measured in the two tasks were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>). At the same time, our analyses revealed three interesting phenomena. First, for both animals, sigmoids measured in Task 2 were significantly shallower compared to Task 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G, H</xref>). In other words, presenting offers in sequence reduced choice accuracy. Second, in Task 2, both animals showed a consistent order bias favoring offer2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref>). Third, in both animals, relative values in Task 2 were significantly higher than in Task 1 (<italic>ρ<sub>Task2</sub></italic> &gt; <italic>ρ<sub>Task1</sub></italic>), and this effect increased with the relative value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, F</xref>).

In both animals and in both sets of trials, the ellipse marking the 90% confidence interval was rotated counterclockwise compared to the identity line. Furthermore, the ellipse measured for BA trials was higher than that for AB trials. We quantified these observations with an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) using the presentation order (AB and BA) as a covariate and imposing parallel lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, F</xref>). In both animals, the two regression lines were significantly distinct (difference in intercept &gt;0, p ≤ 0.002 in each animal). This result confirmed the presence of an order bias favoring offer2 in Task 2. Concurrently, in both animals the regression slope was significantly &gt;1 (p ≤ 0.04 in each animal; ellipse rotation). This result indicated that the animals had an additional bias favoring juice A in Task 2, and that this bias increased as a function of the relative value <italic>ρ</italic>.

We begin by discussing the computational framework for the analyses.</p><p>Economic choice is thought to entail two stages: values are assigned to the available offers and a decision is made by comparing values. Importantly, in our tasks and in most circumstances, choices elicit an ensemble of mental operations taking place before, during, and after the computation and comparison of offer values. Upstream of valuation, choices examined here entail the sensory processing of visual stimuli and the retrieval from memory of relevant information (e.g., the association between color and juice type). Downstream of value comparison, the decision outcome must guide a suitable motor response. In addition, performance in Task 2 requires holding in working memory the value of offer1 until offer2, remembering the decision outcome for an additional delay, and mapping that outcome onto the appropriate saccade target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In principle, choice biases could emerge at any of these computational stages. Likewise, each of these mental operations could be noisy and thus contribute to choice variability.</p><p>Neuronal activity in OFC does not capture all of these processes. However, previous work indicates that neurons in this area participate both in value computation and value comparison. In the framework proposed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), sensory and limbic areas feed <italic>offer value</italic> cells, where values are integrated. In turn, <italic>offer value</italic> cells provide the primary input to a neural circuit constituted by <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells, where decisions are formed. Finally, the decision circuit is connected with downstream areas, such as lateral prefrontal cortex, engaged in working memory and in transforming choice outcomes into suitable action plans. This scheme reflects the anatomical connectivity of OFC and other prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carmichael and Price, 1995a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Carmichael and Price, 1995b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrides and Pandya, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Saleem et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takahara et al., 2012</xref>); it is motivated by neurophysiology results from OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ballesta et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rich and Wallis, 2016</xref>) and connected areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai and Padoa-Schioppa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sasikumar et al., 2018</xref>); and it is consistent with computational models of economic decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Friedrich and Lengyel, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Solway and Botvinick, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Of note, both <italic>offer value</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells encode subjective values.

Since this phenomenon pertains only to choices under sequential offers, we included in the analyses an additional data set recorded in the same animals performing only Task 2 (see Methods).</p><p>In the framework of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we first inquired whether the order bias emerged during valuation. If this was the case, for any given good, <italic>offer value</italic> cells should encode a higher value when the good is presented as offer2. To test this hypothesis, we pooled <italic>offer value</italic> cells associated with the two juices. For each neuron, ‘E’ indicated the juice encoded by the cell and ‘O’ indicated the other juice. We thus refer to EO trials and OE trials. For any given cell, we compared the response recorded in EO trials (post-offer1 time window) with the response recorded in OE trials (post-offer2 time window). If the order bias emerged during valuation, the mean activity and/or the activity range should be higher for the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Contrary to this prediction, across a population of 128 cells, we did not find any systematic difference in mean activity or activity range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). Furthermore, the difference between the activity parameters measured in OE and EO trials did not correlate with the order bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). In conclusion, assigned values did not depend on the presentation order.</p><p>We next examined whether the order bias emerged during value comparison. If so, the bias should be reflected in the activity of both <italic>chosen juice</italic> and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For <italic>chosen value</italic> cells, the hypothesis might be tested noting that in post-offer1 and post-offer2 time windows these neurons encoded the value currently offered independently of the juice type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Thus, the activity measured in these time windows in AB and BA trials provided neuronal measures for the relative values of the two juices. More specifically, for each <italic>chosen value</italic> cell, we derived the two measures <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>AB</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>BA</sub></italic> for AB trials and BA trials, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; see Methods). We also defined the difference Δ<italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup></italic> = <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>BA</sub> − ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>AB</sub></italic>.

In first approximation, each cell encodes the same variable across time windows. Under sequential offers, OFC neurons encode different variables in different time windows. However, the vast majority of them present one of eight specific patterns of variables, referred to as variable ‘sequences’ and detailed here. Furthermore, there is a clear correspondence between neurons encoding a particular variable in Task 1 and neurons encoding a particular sequence in Task 2.

Including these cells in the analysis did not substantially alter the results.

Confirming previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>), neuronal and behavioral measures of relative value were highly correlated. Similarly, the two neuronal measures of relative value, <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>AB</sub></italic> and <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>BA</sub></italic>, were correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Most importantly, the difference Δ<italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup></italic> and the order bias <italic>ε</italic> were significantly correlated across the population (Spearman <italic>r</italic> = 0.3, p = 0.007; Pearson <italic>r</italic> = 0.2, p = 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Hence, session-to-session fluctuations in the activity of <italic>chosen value</italic> cells correlated with fluctuations in the order bias.</p><p>Further insights on the order bias came from the analysis of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells. Again, for each neuron, E and O indicated the juice encoded by the cell and the other juice, respectively. A previous study found that the baseline activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells recorded in OE trials immediately before offer2 was negatively correlated with the value of offer1 (i.e., the value of the other juice) – a phenomenon termed circuit inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). If the decision is conceptualized as the evolution of a dynamic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rustichini and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang, 2002</xref>), circuit inhibition sets the system’s initial conditions and is thus integral to value comparison. In this account, the evolving decision is essentially captured by the activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells in OE trials, which reflects a competition between the negative offset set by the value of offer1 (initial condition) and the incoming signal encoding the value of offer2. If so, the intensity of circuit inhibition should be negatively correlated with the order bias.</p><p>We tested this prediction as follows. First, we replicated previous findings and confirmed the presence of circuit inhibition in our primary data set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then focused on a 300-ms time window starting 250 ms before offer2 onset. For each <italic>chosen juice</italic> cell, we regressed the firing rate against the normalized offer1 value (see Methods). Thus, the regression slope <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> quantified circuit inhibition for individual cells. Across a population of 295 <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells, mean(<italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>) was significantly &lt;0 (p = 5 × 10<sup>−6</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test; p = 9 × 10<sup>−8</sup>, Wilcoxon test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

In other words, stronger circuit inhibition (more negative <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>) corresponded to a weaker order bias (smaller <italic>ε</italic>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Order bias and circuit inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Circuit inhibition in <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells (primary data set, <italic>N</italic> = 160 cells).

In this panel, Q1, Q2, and Q3 indicate low, medium, and high values of offer1. In OE trials, shortly before offer2, the activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells was negatively correlated with V(O) – a phenomenon termed circuit inhibition.

Indicating with <italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> and <italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> the tuning intercept and tuning slope (see Methods, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ8">Equation 8</xref>), we computed the difference in intercept Δ<italic>b</italic><sub>0</sub> = <italic>b</italic><sub>0,</sub><italic><sub>Task2</sub> − b</italic><sub>0,</sub><italic><sub>Task1</sub></italic> and the difference in slope Δ<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>b</italic><sub>1,</sub><italic><sub>Task2</sub> − b</italic><sub>1,</sub><italic><sub>Task1</sub></italic> for each cell. We then examined the relation between these measures and the relative value <italic>ρ</italic> across the population, separately for each cell group.

It shows that the chosen value represented in the brain in Task 2 was equal to that inferred from choices in Task 1, and significantly different from that inferred from choices in Task 2. This fact implies that the preference bias was costly for the monkey, as it reduced the value obtained on average at the end of each trial (see Discussion).</p><p>In summary, the preference bias did not reflect differences in the values assigned to individual offers (offer values). Furthermore, insofar as the activity of <italic>chosen value</italic> cells reflects the decision process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the preference bias did not seem to emerge during value comparison. So how can one make sense of this behavioral phenomenon? At the cognitive level, the preference bias might be interpreted as due to the higher demands of Task 2. When the two saccade targets appeared on the monitor, information about values was no longer on display (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If at that point the animal had not finalized its decision, or if it had failed to retain in working memory the decision outcome, the animal might have selected the target associated with the better juice (juice A). Such bias would have been especially strong when the value difference between the two juices was large. In this view, the preference bias would reflect a ‘second thought’ occurring after value comparison, in some trials.</p><p>To test this intuition, we turned to the activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells. As noted above, in Task 2, the evolving decision was captured by the activity of these neurons recorded in OE trials immediately before and after offer2 onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). More specifically, the state of the ongoing decision was captured by the distance between the two traces corresponding to the two possible choice outcomes (E chosen, O chosen). For any neuron, we quantified this distance with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, which provided a choice probability (CP). In essence, CP can be interpreted as the probability with which an ideal observer may guess the eventual choice outcome based on the activity of the cell. For each <italic>chosen juice</italic> cell, we computed the CP at different times in the trial. Across the population, mean(CP) exceeded chance level starting shortly before offer2, consistent with the above discussion on circuit inhibition. We then proceeded to investigate the origins of the preference bias.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Preference bias and choice probability (CP) in <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Profiles of activity and CP (<italic>N</italic> = 160 cells).

If the preference bias emerged late in the trial – perhaps after target presentation, if animals had not already finalized their decision – the intensity of the preference bias should be inversely related to the animals’ commitment to the eventual choice outcome measured earlier in the trial. In other words, there should be a negative correlation between the preference bias and CPs computed at the time when decisions normally take place (shortly before or after offer2 onset). Our analyses supported this prediction. To quantify the preference bias intensity independent of the juice pair, we defined the preference bias index (PBI) = 2 (<italic>ρ<sub>Task2</sub> − ρ<sub>Task1</sub></italic>)/(<italic>ρ<sub>Task2</sub> + ρ<sub>Task1</sub></italic>).

However, the concept of value is somewhat slippery, because values relevant to choices cannot be measured behaviorally other than from choices themselves. This circularity problem haunted generations of scholars, dominating academic debates in the 19th and 20th centuries. In the end, neoclassic economic theory came to reject (cardinal) values and to rely only on (ordinal) preferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niehans, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Samuelson, 1947</xref>). In other words, standard economics is agnostic as to whether subjective values are computed at all.

They validate the concept of value and effectively break the circularity surrounding it. Indeed, a neuronal population whose activity is reliably correlated with values measured from choices (behavioral values) may be used to derive independent measures of subjective values (neuronal values). In most circumstances, neuronal values and behavioral values should be (and are) indistinguishable. However, in specific choice contexts, the two measures might differ somewhat. When observed, such discrepancies indicate that choices are partly determined by processes that escape the maximization of offer values. If so, suitable analyses of neuronal activity may be used to assess the origins of particular choice biases.</p><p>These considerations motivated the analyses conducted in this study. In our experiments, monkeys chose between two juices offered simultaneously or sequentially. Choices under sequential offers were less accurate, biased in favor of the second offer (order bias), and biased in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). It is generally understood that good-based economic decisions take place in OFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cisek, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Padoa-Schioppa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>) and that the encoding of decision variables in this area is categorical in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirokawa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Onken et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>). Earlier studies had identified in OFC three groups of neurons encoding individual offer values, the chosen juice and the chosen value. Furthermore, choices under simultaneous or sequential offers were found to engage the same groups of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2022a</xref>). Notably, the variables encoded in OFC capture both the input and the output of the decision process. This observation and a series of experimental and theoretical results lead to the hypothesis that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017</xref>). More specifically, we hypothesize that <italic>offer value</italic> cells provide the primary input to a circuit formed by <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells, where decisions are formed. In this view, different cell groups in OFC may be associated with different computational stages: <italic>offer value</italic> cells instantiate the valuation stage; <italic>chosen value</italic> cells reflect values possibly modified by the decision process; and <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells capture the evolving commitment to a particular choice outcome. In this framework, we examined the activity of each cell group in relation to each behavioral phenomenon.</p><p>Our results may be summarized as follows. (1) Other things equal, neuronal signals encoding the offer values were weaker (smaller activity range) under sequential offers than under simultaneous offers. The reason for this discrepancy is unclear, but this neuronal effect was correlated with the difference in choice accuracy measured at the behavioral level. In other words, the drop in choice accuracy observed under sequential offers originated, at least partly, at the valuation stage. (2) The order bias did not correlate with any measure in the activity of <italic>offer value</italic> cells. However, the order bias was negatively correlated with circuit inhibition in <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells – a phenomenon seen as key to value comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). Furthermore, session-to-session fluctuations in the order bias correlated with fluctuations in the neuronal measure of relative value derived from <italic>chosen value</italic> cells. These findings indicate that the order bias emerged during value comparison. (3) The preference bias did not have any correlate in the activity of <italic>offer value</italic> cells or <italic>chosen value</italic> cells. Moreover, the preference bias was inversely related to a measure derived from <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and quantifying the degree to which the decision was finalized when offer values are ‘normally’ compared (i.e., upon presentation of the second offer). These findings indicate that the preference bias emerged late in the trial. As a caveat, the hypothesis discussed above, linking different cell groups in OFC to specific decision stages, awaits further confirmation.</p><p>Two of our findings are particularly relevant to the distinction between behavioral values and neuronal values. First, the activity of <italic>offer value</italic> cells did not present any difference associated with the presentation order or with the juice preference. Second, relative values derived from <italic>chosen value</italic> cells under sequential offers differed significantly from behavioral measures obtained in the same task, and were indistinguishable from behavioral measures obtained in the other task (simultaneous offers). Thus, the order bias and the preference bias highlighted significant differences between neuronal and behavioral measures of value. These observations imply that the order bias and the preference bias emerged downstream of valuation. Importantly, they also imply that the two choice biases imposed a cost to the animals, in the sense that they reduced the (neuronal) value obtained on average in any given trial. Notably, it would be impossible to draw such conclusion based on choices alone.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the origins of choice biases building on the distinction between behavioral values and neuronal values. At the same time, some of our results are not unprecedented. Earlier work showed that human and animal choices are affected by a bias favoring, on any given trial, the same good chosen in the previous trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alós-Ferrer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goodwin, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schoemann and Scherbaum, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Senftleben et al., 2021</xref>). The origins of this phenomenon, termed choice hysteresis, are hard to pinpoint based on behavioral evidence alone. However, previous analysis of neuronal activity in OFC revealed that choice hysteresis is not reflected in the encoding of offer values. Conversely, choice hysteresis correlates with fluctuations in the baseline activity of <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells, which is partly influenced by the previous trial’s outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>). Thus, similar to the order bias, choice hysteresis appears to emerge at the decision stage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The cost of choice biases</title><p>We have noted that the three behavioral phenomena described here were detrimental to the animals. This point bears a few comments.</p><p>Let us consider, in a very general sense, choices between two goods A and B, taking place in two possible conditions 1 and 2. We may refer to the subjective values of the two goods in the two conditions as <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,1</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,2</sub>, <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,1</sub>, and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,2</sub>. Lets also assume the presence of a choice bias such that in condition 1 the animal consistently chooses A, while in condition 2 it consistently chooses B. In broad strokes, that might be for two reasons. Either (1) values differ across conditions such that <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,1</sub> &gt; <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,1</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,2</sub> &lt; <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,2</sub>, or (2) the value of each good remains unchanged across conditions (<italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,1</sub> = <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>A</italic>,2</sub> and <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,1</sub> = <italic>V</italic><sub><italic>B</italic>,2</sub>) and choices are affected by some other process, downstream of value computation. If so, in one of the two conditions the animal consistently chooses the lower value. In other words, the choice bias is detrimental to the animal. Coming to our experiments, the analysis of neuronal activity indicates that the subjective values of offered juices were independent of the choice task, and independent of the presentation order in Task 2. Thus, scenario (2) held true with respect to both the order bias and the preference bias. Consequently, both biases were detrimental to the animals.</p><p>With respect to the preference bias, one question is whether the bias affected choices in Task 1 or in Task 2 (in principle, there could be a bias favoring the unpreferred juice in Task 1). The fact that <italic>ρ<sup>behavioral</sup><sub>Task1</sub></italic>, <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>Task1</sub></italic>, and <italic>ρ<sup>neuronal</sup><sub>Task2</sub></italic> were all indistinguishable from each other while <italic>ρ<sup>behavioral</sup><sub>Task2</sub></italic> differed from them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) argues for the latter understanding.</p><p>It is interesting to speculate whether the choice biases documented here might benefit the animal in some more general sense. For example, one might wonder whether the cost imposed by the preference bias was lower than the metabolic cost the monkey would have incurred to increase its performance level and avoid that bias. If so, the preference bias would be, in fact, ecologically adaptive. Addressing this question would require quantifying the metabolic cost of increasing performance in the same value units used for the juices – a challenge open for future studies. However, independent of that assessment, our present results indicate that the putative metabolic cost of increasing performance in the task did not explicitly enter the decision process. If metabolic cost affected behavior, it did so in a meta-decision sense.</p><p>Similar considerations hold for the difference in choice accuracy measured across tasks. The fact that sigmoid functions are not infinitely steep (i.e., the presence of choice variability) means that on some trials the animal chooses the lower value. In fact, one can quantify the loss in expected payoff as a function of the sigmoid steepness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Constantinople et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rustichini et al., 2017</xref>). That sigmoids were shallower in Task 2 means that the average payoff was lower in that task – a detriment to the animal. Again, it is interesting to speculate whether weaker offer value signals recorded in Task 2 might also benefit the animal in some way, perhaps by reducing cognitive or metabolic costs. This question remains open for future studies. Importantly, such costs did not explicitly enter the decision process; if they affected behavior, they did so in a meta-decision sense.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The past two decades have witnessed a lively interest for the neural underpinnings of choice behavior. In this effort, a significant breakthrough came from the adoption of behavioral paradigms inspired by the economics literature, in which subjective values derived from choices are used to interpret neural activity. Without renouncing this approach, here we took a further step, showing that the decision process sometimes falls short of selecting the maximum offer value, and that choices are sometimes affected by processes taking place downstream of value comparison. In other words, behavioral values and neuronal values sometimes differ. These results might seem uncontroversial, but they have deep implications for economic theory and beyond. Looking forward, the framework developed here, in which the computation and comparison of offer values are central, but choices can also be affected by other processes accessible through neuronal measures, may help understand the origins of other choice biases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All the experimental procedures adhered to the <italic>NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</italic> and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Washington University (protocol number 190931).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal subjects, choice tasks, and neuronal recordings</title><p>This study presents new analyses of published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2022a</xref>). Experimental procedures for surgery, behavioral control, and neuronal recordings have been described in detail. Briefly, two male monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; monkey J, 10.0 kg, 8 years old; monkey G, 9.1 kg, 9 years old) participated in the study. Under general anesthesia, we implanted on each animal a head restraining device and an oval chamber (axes 50 × 30 mm) allowing bilateral access to OFC. During the experiments, monkeys sat in an electrically insulated environment with their head fixed and a computer monitor placed at 57 cm distance. The gaze direction was monitored at 1 kHz using an infrared video camera (Eyelink, SR Research). Behavioral tasks were controlled through custom written software based on Matlab (v2016a; MathWorks Inc). The code is available online (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hwang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shi et al., 2022b</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov">https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov</ext-link>).</p><p>In each session, the animal chose between two juices labeled A and B (A preferred) offered in variable amounts. Trials with two choice tasks, referred to as Task 1 and Task 2, were pseudorandomly interleaved. In both tasks, offers were represented by sets of colored squares displayed on the monitor. For each offer, the color indicated the juice type and the number of squares indicated the quantity. Each trial began with the animal fixating a large dot. After 0.5 s, the initial fixation point changed to a small dot or a small cross; the new fixation point cued the animal to the choice task used in that trial. In Task 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), cue fixation (0.5 s) was followed by the simultaneous presentation of the two offers. After a randomly variable delay (1–1.5 s), the center fixation point disappeared and two saccade targets appeared near the offers (go signal). The animal indicated its choice with an eye movement. It maintained peripheral fixation for 0.75 s, after which the chosen juice was delivered. In Task 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), cue fixation (0.5 s) was followed by the presentation of one offer (0.5 s), an interoffer delay (0.5 s), presentation of the other offer (0.5 s), and a wait period (0.5 s). Two colored saccade targets then appeared on the two sides of the fixation point. After a randomly variable delay (0.5–1 s), the center fixation point disappeared (go signal). The animal indicated its choice with a saccade, maintained peripheral fixation for 0.75 s, after which the chosen juice was delivered. Central and peripheral fixation were imposed within 4–6 and 5–7 degrees of visual angle, respectively. Aside from the initial cue, the choice tasks were nearly identical to those used in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>).</p><p>For any given trial, <italic>q<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>q<sub>B</sub></italic> indicate the quantities of juices A and B offered to the animal, respectively. An ‘offer type’ was defined by two quantities [<italic>q<sub>A</sub> q<sub>B</sub></italic>]. On any given session, we used the same juices and the same sets of offer types for the two tasks. For Task 1, the spatial configuration of the offers varied randomly from trial to trial. For Task 2, the presentation order varied pseudorandomly and was counterbalanced across trials for any offer type. The terms ‘offer1’ and ‘offer2’ indicated, respectively, the first and second offer, independently of the juice type and amount. Trials in which juice A was offered first and trials in which juice B was offered first were referred as ‘AB trials’ and ‘BA trials’, respectively. The spatial location (left/right) of saccade targets varied randomly. The juice volume corresponding to one square (quantum) was set equal for the two choice tasks and remained constant within each session. It varied across sessions between 70 and 100 μl for both monkeys. The association between the initial cue (small dot, small cross) and the choice task varied across sessions in blocks. Across sessions, we used 12 different juices (and colors) and 45 different juice pairs. Based on a power analysis, in most sessions the number of trials for Task 2 was set equal to 1.5 times that for Task 1.</p><p>Neuronal recordings were guided by structural MRI scans (1 mm sections) obtained before and after surgery and targeted area 13 m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ongür and Price, 2000</xref>). We recorded from both hemispheres in both monkeys. Tungsten single electrodes (100 µm shank diameter; FHC) were advanced remotely using a custom-built motorized microdrive. Typically, one motor advanced two electrodes placed 1 mm apart, and 1–2 such pairs of electrodes were advanced unilaterally or bilaterally in each session. Neural signals were amplified (gain: 10,000) bandpass filtered (300 Hz to 6 kHz; Lynx 8, Neuralynx), digitized (frequency: 40 kHz) and saved to disk (Power 1401, Cambridge Electronic Design). Spike sorting was performed offline (Spike2, v6, Cambridge Electronic Design).

Here, we briefly summarize those findings.</p><p>The original data set included 1526 neurons (672 from monkey J, 854 from monkey G) recorded in 306 sessions (115 from monkey J, 191 from monkey G). For each neuron, trials from Task 1 and Task 2 were first analyzed separately using the procedures developed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Padoa-Schioppa and Assad, 2006</xref>). For Task 1, we defined four time windows: post-offer (0.5 s after offer onset), late-delay (0.5–1 s after offer onset), pre-juice (0.5 s before juice onset), and post-juice (0.5 s after juice onset). A ‘trial type’ was defined by two offered quantities and a choice. For Task 2, we defined three time windows: post-offer1 (0.5 s after offer1 onset), post-offer2 (0.5 s after offer2 onset) and post-juice (0.5 s after juice onset). A ‘trial type’ was defined by two offered quantities, their order and a choice. For each task, each trial type and each time window, we averaged spike counts across trials. A ‘neuronal response’ was defined as the firing rate of one cell in one time window as a function of the trial type. Neuronal responses in each task were submitted to an analysis of variance (factor: trial type). Neurons passing the p &lt; 0.01 criterion in ≥1 time window in either task were identified as ‘task-related’ and included in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Following earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padoa-Schioppa, 2013</xref>), neurons in Task 1 were classified in one of four groups <italic>offer value A</italic>, <italic>offer value B</italic>, <italic>chosen juice</italic>, or <italic>chosen value</italic>. Each variable could be encoded with positive or negative sign, leading to a total of eight cell groups. Each neuronal response was regressed against each of the four variables. If the regression slope <italic>b<sub>1</sub></italic> differed significantly from zero (p &lt; 0.05), the variable was said to ‘explain’ the response. In this case, we set the signed <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> as <italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup> = sign(<italic>b<sub>1</sub></italic>) <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>; if the variable did not explain the response, we set <italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0. After repeating the operation for each time window, we computed for each cell the <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>) across time windows. Neurons explained by at least one variable in one time window, such that <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>) ≠ 0, were said to be tuned; other neurons were labeled ‘untuned’. Tuned cells were assigned to the variable and sign providing the maximum |<italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)|, where |·| indicates the absolute value. Thus, indicating with ‘+’ and ‘<italic>−’</italic> the sign of the encoding, each neuron was classified in one of nine groups: <italic>offer value A+</italic>, <italic>offer value A</italic>−, <italic>offer value B+</italic>, <italic>offer value B−</italic>, <italic>chosen juice A</italic>, <italic>chosen juice B</italic>, <italic>chosen value+</italic>, <italic>chosen value−</italic>, and <italic>untuned</italic>.</p><p>Neuronal classification in Task 2 followed the procedures described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). Under sequential offers, neuronal responses in OFC were found to encode different variables defined in relation to the presentation order (AB or BA). Specifically, the vast majority of responses were explained by one of 11 variables including 1 binary variable capturing the presentation order (<italic>AB | BA</italic>), 6 variables representing individual offer values (<italic>offer value A | AB</italic>, <italic>offer value A | BA</italic>, <italic>offer value B | AB</italic>, <italic>offer value B | BA</italic>, <italic>offer value 1</italic>, and <italic>offer value 2</italic>), 3 variables capturing variants of the chosen value (<italic>chosen value</italic>, <italic>chosen value A</italic>, and <italic>chosen value B</italic>), and a binary variable representing the binary choice outcome (<italic>chosen juice</italic>). Each of these variables could be encoded with a positive or negative sign. Most neurons encoded different variables in different time windows. In principle, considering 11 variables, 2 signs of the encoding and 3 time windows, neurons might present a very large number of variable patterns across time windows. However, the vast majority of neurons presented one of eight patterns referred to as ‘sequences’. Classification proceeded as follows. For each cell and each time window, we regressed the neuronal response against each of the variables predicted by each sequence. If the regression slope <italic>b<sub>1</sub></italic> differed significantly from zero (p &lt; 0.05), the variable was said to explain the response and we set the signed <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> as <italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup> = sign(<italic>b</italic><sub>1</sub>) <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>; if the variable did not explain the response, we set <italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0. After repeating the operation for each time window, we computed for each cell the <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>) across time windows for each of the eight sequences. Neurons such that <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>) ≠ 0 for at least one sequence were said to be tuned; other neurons were untuned. Tuned cells were assigned to the sequence that provided the maximum |<italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)|. As a result, each neuron was classified in one of nine groups: <italic>seq #1</italic>, <italic>seq #2</italic>, <italic>seq #3</italic>, <italic>seq #4</italic>, <italic>seq #5</italic>, <italic>seq #6</italic>, <italic>seq #7</italic>, <italic>seq #8</italic>, and <italic>untuned</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The results of the two classifications were compared using analyses for categorical data. In essence, we found a strong correspondence between the cell classes identified in the two choice tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 2022a</xref>). Hence, we may refer to the different groups of cells using the standard nomenclature – <italic>offer value</italic>, <italic>chosen juice</italic>, and <italic>chosen value</italic> – independently of the choice task. Based on this result, we proceeded with a comprehensive classification based on the activity recorded in both choice tasks. For each task-related cell, we calculated the <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>) for the eight variables in Task 1 (<italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>Task1</sub></italic>) and eight sequences in Task 2 (<italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>Task2</sub></italic>) as described above. We then added the corresponding <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>Task1</sub></italic> and <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>Task2</sub></italic> to obtain the final <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>final</sub></italic>. Neurons such that <italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>final</sub></italic> ≠ 0 for at least one class were said to be tuned; other neurons were untuned. Tuned cells were assigned to the cell class that provided the maximum |<italic>sum</italic>(<italic>sR</italic><sup>2</sup>)<italic><sub>final</sub></italic>|.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data sets</title><p>In some sessions, one or both choice patterns presented complete or quasicomplete separation – that is, the animal split choices for &lt;2 offer types in Task 1 and/or in Task 2. In these cases, the probit regression did not converge, the resulting steepness <italic>η</italic> was high and unstable, and the relative value was not unique. This issue affected the classification analyses described above only marginally, but for the present study it was critical that behavioral measures be accurate and precise. We thus restricted our analyses to stable sessions by imposing an interquartile criterion on the sigmoid steepness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tukey, 1977</xref>). Defining IQR as the interquartile range, values below the first quartile minus 1.5*IQR or above the third quartile plus 1.5*IQR were identified as outliers and excluded. Thus, our entire data set included 1204 neurons (577 from monkey J, 627 from monkey G) recorded in 241 sessions (101 from monkey J, 140 from monkey G). In this population, the classification procedures identified 183 <italic>offer value</italic> cells, 160 <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells, and 174 <italic>chosen value</italic> cells. These neurons constitute the primary data set for this study.</p><p>Most of our analyses compared choices and neuronal activity across tasks and were restricted to the primary data set. However, some analyses included only trials from Task 2 and quantified the effects due to the presentation order (AB vs. BA). In these analyses, we included an additional data set recorded previously from the same two animals performing only Task 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>). All the procedures for behavioral control and neuronal recording were essentially identical to those described above. Furthermore, behavioral analyses and inclusion criteria were identical to those used for the primary data set. The resulting data set included 1205 neurons (414 from monkey J, 791 from monkey G) recorded in 196 sessions (51 from monkey J, 145 from monkey G). In this population, the classification procedures identified 243 <italic>offer value</italic> cells, 182 <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells, and 187 <italic>chosen value</italic> cells. We refer to these neurons as the additional data set. Importantly, the order bias was also observed in these sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The interquartile criterion was also used to identify outliers in all the analyses conducted throughout this study.

This analysis was conducted on raw spike counts, without kernel smoothing, time averaging or baseline correction. We restricted the analysis to offer types for which the animal split choices between the two juices and we excluded trial types with &lt;2 trials.

Building on previous work from the lab, the authors focus on neural coding of decision variables in the orbitofrontal cortex of rhesus monkeys, and convincingly argue that different biases arise at different stages of the decision-making process. The reviewers found the study rigorous and believe that the results will be of broad interest. Understanding the neural mechanisms that produce biases in decision-making is an important goal for the field of decision-making and neuroeconomics, and also has relevance to conditions that involve disordered decision-making.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75910.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rich</surname><given-names>Erin L</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04a9tmd77</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Stuphorn</surname><given-names>Veit</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00za53h95</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.11.07.467645">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.07.467645v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Veit Stuphorn (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, reviewers found the study convincing and the results a significant advance in understanding circuit-level computations underlying decision-making. However, they raised multiple important issues to improve the clarity and specificity of the claims. The most important points to be addressed in revision are listed below, and the reviewers' individual comments are attached in full to provide additional context and suggestions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The main topic that arose in reviewer consultation was the degree to which the conclusions rely on the lab's previous work parsing neural responses into discrete categories. Whereas this work has shown the reliability of these categories within the lab's own data, other literature has found conflicting results. Given that the degree to which categorical boundaries can be set within a continuum of response profiles is debatable, the reviewers think it's important to include discussion of the issue and acknowledgement of the explicit assumptions of the authors' methods and framework. Importantly, it's not just the categorization that the interpretation relies on: it's the assumption that each plays specific decision roles (valuation vs. comparison). (R1/R2/R3)</p><p>2. Conceptualizing the two tasks as computationally identical may not be accurate. The authors should discuss potential roles of working memory in task 2, and assess their model fits to behavior in each task independently. (R2/R3)</p><p>3. The idea of optimality, bias, and what constitutes reduced accuracy was also raised, and should be addressed by clarifications of the text: e.g. describe how exactly the different choice effects are 'detrimental', whether effects should be considered biases versus stochasticity, and how the findings here relate to classic effects in economic choice. (R2)</p><p>4. Please describe the rationale behind the order bias calculation, as opposed to using the a4 coefficient. In addition, consider how the signs of the neural order biases predict a consistent behavioral order bias. (R1/R2)</p><p>5. Please address why output signals do not reflect the reduced value sensitivity of the input signals. (R3)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The core premise of their interpretation/model is that the functional cell types they define (offer value, chosen value cells) are (mostly?) non-overlapping populations, if they contribute to distinct aspects of behavior. Is that strictly true, or are there subsets of cells that belong to both groups? In the methods section, it sounds like they force neurons to belong to only one group (&quot;Tuned cells were assigned to the cell class that provided the maximum |sum(sR2 )final|&quot;). This decision seems arbitrary but central to the interpretation that these really are different functional cell types.</p><p>2. On page 7, they define the order bias as ε = 2 ρTask2 a4/a3. Why don't they just evaluate the magnitude of the a4 coefficient? If it were 0, wouldn't that indicate no order bias? The sign would indicate the bias for first vs. second, and the magnitude the strength of the bias? Perhaps I am missing something, but that seems like a much more straightforward way to obtain an estimate of order bias from this model.</p><p>3. The authors show that offer value cells exhibit reduced responses for sequential compared to simultaneous offers. Is this true for both offer1 and offer2? They show an example neuron for both offer1 and offer2, but the population activity pools those responses together.</p><p>4. Related to point #1, it sounds like they combine data from task 1 and task 2 when they determine whether a cell is an &quot;offer cell&quot; or a &quot;chosen cell.&quot; Are most of the offer value cells categorized based on their task 1 responses (i.e., is the maximum |sum(sR2 )final| the task1 offer value)? I am wondering the following: because there is a pre-stimulus cue at the beginning of each trial that tells the monkey which task it is performing, it's possible that the monkey/OFC treats them as two different tasks, and that slightly different populations of neurons encode offer value in each case. If that were the case, then using the task 1 responses to define the cells as encoding offer value could trivially result in the first finding, that there are reduced offer value responses in task 2. What if the authors determined whether cells were offer value cells based on the task 2 responses only? Does the result hold that the offer value responses are reduced, relative to task 1?</p><p>5. Figure 4F, the correlation is not very compelling. Is there something different about the sessions in which the sigmoid steepness and δ activity range go in opposite directions (i.e., the upper left and lower right quadrants?)</p><p>6. Throughout the paper, it is hard to remember what the different Greek letters refer to. For instance, on page 13, when ε reappears, I couldn't remember what that referred to. When possible, for clarity it might help to use interpretable terms when possible (e.g., order bias instead of ε).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Much of my feedback can likely be gleaned from the public review, but I'll be specific (and probably repetitive) here:</p><p>(1) It would be helpful if the authors provided a more detailed framing of existing behavioral economic choice biases and how the current choice effects relate. For terminology, it is a bit confusing that these previous findings are labelled &quot;biases&quot; but that one of the effects discussed here is increased stochasticity (reduced accuracy) rather than a bias – can the authors find some way of being more general about choice effects?</p><p>(2) For the analysis of choice behavior and the use of probit regression, it would help if the authors could quantify the goodness of fit of their choice functions (probit model using log amount ratios), specifically against alternative models (logit, and/or models with amount difference rather than log ratio). The big issue is that the relevant measures (accuracy, order bias, preference bias) depend largely on parameters derived form these fits, so it is important to see that the fits good and the model is appropriate. for the order effect in particular, have the authors examined the data while relaxing the assumption of a constant sigmoid?</p><p>(3) Re: the documentation of the preference bias, I would like the authors to be clearer in the text about the statistical test of the basic preference effect (higher rho in Task 1 vs. Task 2) – the effect is rather strong, and just needs to be clearly conveyed in the text. I do think that the dependence of the effect on relative value (i.e. rotation of the ellipse) seems to be less well supported: beyond clearing up the presentation of the significance of the results, perhaps this could be places in a clearer context vis a vis the basic preference bias – I don't think it is necessary to the general findings.</p><p>(4) Please be clearer about how exactly the different effects are detrimental. I think this point related directly to the initial framing about the difficulty of characterizing the optimality of value-based choice using behavior alone.</p><p>(5) Regarding the interpretation of OFC activity within the Rustichini/Wang modeling framework, I realize that the authors have good reason (and past data) to adopt this interpretation – I think it would be fair to at least acknowledge the explicit assumptions for the general reader.</p><p>(6) One interpretation issue that remains is whether the OFC neural effects are causal or correlational (particularly the accuracy and order effects, which can be seen in OFC activity). One issue that points towards the latter, at least in the order bias, is the sign of the neuronal effects (Figure 5C, Figure 6C). While the behavioral order bias is overwhelming positive, the neural effects (difference in AB vs BA rhos, circuit inhibition) do not on average differ from zero, even if they are correlated with the behavioral effect. If these neural effects drive the bias, shouldn't hey also be biased in the correct direction? Can the authors provide an interpretation?</p><p>(7) Additional points:</p><p>– How exactly is the preferred item (A vs. B) defined – across both tasks combined?</p><p>– Given the initial framing, it seems to me that these data – especially the preference bias effect – provides insight into the goods versus action based choice discussion (and relates to some previous work like Cai and Padia-Schioppa). Perhaps it would be relevant to discuss this briefly at the end of the paper.</p><p>– A conceptual question: given that all three effects are presented as suboptimal, why should this be the case given the initial framing that sequential decisions are the prevalent, natural form of choices?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The paper is written very clearly and the underlying logic for the different analysis is very well described. The results are for the most part convincing, albeit sometimes of a weak effect size.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75910.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Our analyses were designed, and the results were interpreted, under a series of assumptions:</p><p>(a) Good-based decisions take place in OFC</p><p>(b) Different groups of neurons in OFC encode categorically distinct variables</p><p>(c) Choices under simultaneous and sequential offers engage the same cell groups</p><p>(d) These cell groups constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit. Specifically, offer value cells provide input to a circuit composed of chosen value cells and chosen juice cells, where values are compared and the decision is formed (Figure 1)</p><p>Assumption (a) builds on a broad literature and is generally accepted in the field (Cisek, 2012; Padoa-Schioppa, 2011; Rushworth et al., 2012). It is also supported by recent results showing that weak electrical stimulation of OFC selectively disrupts value comparison without inducing any choice bias (Ballesta et al., 2021). Assumptions (b) and (c) are directly supported by a series of studies showing categorical encoding in OFC (Hirokawa et al., 2019; Onken et al., 2019; Padoa-Schioppa, 2013) and by previous analysis of the same data examined here (Shi et al., 2022). In contrast, assumption (d) remains a working hypothesis, in the sense that the organization and mechanisms of the decision circuit are not well understood. Importantly, the scheme proposed here is very general in the sense that we don’t make any particular assumption about the connections between the cell groups, except that <italic>offer value</italic> cells are upstream of the other cell groups. This point is supported by analyses correlating choice variability with trial-by-trial variability in the activity of <italic>offer value</italic> cells (Conen and Padoa-Schioppa, 2015). However, we recognize that more work is needed to ascertain the anatomical organization of the decision circuit.</p><p>We revised the manuscript including in the Discussion the following paragraph that summarizes these points:</p><p>“In our experiments, monkeys chose between two juices offered simultaneously or sequentially. Choices under sequential offers were less accurate, biased in favor of the second offer (order bias), and biased in favor of the preferred juice (preference bias). It is generally understood that good-based economic decisions take place in OFC (Cisek, 2012; Padoa-Schioppa, 2011; Rushworth et al., 2012) and that the encoding of decision variables in this area is categorical in nature (Hirokawa et al., 2019; Onken et al., 2019; Padoa-Schioppa, 2013). Earlier studies had identified in OFC three groups of neurons encoding individual offer values, the chosen juice and the chosen value. Importantly, choices under simultaneous or sequential offers engage the same neurons (Shi et al., 2022). Notably, the variables encoded in OFC capture both the input and the output of the decision process. This observation and a series of experimental (Ballesta et al., 2021; Rich and Wallis, 2016) and theoretical results lead to the hypothesis that the cell groups identified in OFC constitute the building blocks of a decision circuit (Padoa-Schioppa and Conen, 2017). In this view, <italic>offer value</italic> cells provide the primary input to a circuit formed by <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells and <italic>chosen value</italic> cells, where decisions are formed. Different cell groups in OFC may thus be associated with different computational stages: <italic>offer value</italic> cells instantiate the valuation stage; <italic>chosen value</italic> cells reflect values possibly modified by the decision process; and <italic>chosen juice</italic> cells capture the evolving commitment to a particular choice outcome. In this framework, we examined the activity of each cell group in relation to each behavioral phenomenon.</p><p>[…] As a caveat, our results rely on the hypothesis that different cell groups identified in OFC play specific roles in the decision process. This working hypothesis awaits further confirmation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Conceptualizing the two tasks as computationally identical may not be accurate. The authors should discuss potential roles of working memory in task 2, and assess their model fits to behavior in each task independently. (R2/R3)</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, we don’t describe the two tasks as identical. In fact, we discuss how Task 2 involves a series of cognitive operations not required in Task 1, each of which could in principle introduce noise or biases (p.6). That said, we do argue that the two tasks engage the same groups of neurons in OFC. This statement is based on empirical evidence – that is, previous analyses of this same data set (Shi et al., 2022). We elaborate on this issue below in response to R1 (Major comments, point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The idea of optimality, bias, and what constitutes reduced accuracy was also raised, and should be addressed by clarifications of the text: e.g. describe how exactly the different choice effects are 'detrimental', whether effects should be considered biases versus stochasticity, and how the findings here relate to classic effects in economic choice. (R2)</p></disp-quote><p>We added to the Discussion a new section ‘<italic>The cost of choice biases</italic>’ (p.13) that elaborates on this important issue. In a nutshell, if in two conditions (e.g., Task1 and Task2) subjective values are the same but choices are different, in one or both conditions the subject fails to choose the higher value. In that sense, the choice bias is detrimental. Our analyses of neuronal activity indicated that subjective offer values were the same in the two tasks, and were the same independent of the offer presentation in Task 2. Hence, both the preference bias and the order bias were detrimental to the animal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In the same section, we also explain the rationale for defining the order bias as we did, and we report that control analyses based on alternative definitions of the order bias provided essentially the same results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Please address why output signals do not reflect the reduced value sensitivity of the input signals. (R3)</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this result was puzzling and we gave this issue more thought. We realized that our definition of activity range for chosen value cells was arbitrary and – in some sense – not consistent across tasks. In Task 2, in the time windows of interest for this analysis (post-offer1 and post-offer2), these neurons encode the value of the offer currently on display. That value ranges between zero (forced choices for the other good) and the max offer value. In contrast, in Task 1, in the relevant time window (post-offer), these neurons encode the chosen value. That value ranges between the minimum chosen value (which is always &gt;0) and the max offer value. In our previous definition of activity range, we had overlooked this difference. We have now corrected our definition, defining the activity range as that corresponding to the range of values [0, max offer value] in both tasks. According to this new and better definition, the activity range of <italic>chosen value</italic> cells is reduced in Task 2 compared to Task 1. Of note, this issue is not relevant to <italic>offer value</italic> cells, because for those neurons the minimum encoded value is always =0 in both tasks. The revised manuscript reports the new results (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

This decision seems arbitrary but central to the interpretation that these really are different functional cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is partly addressed above, under Essential Revisions, point (1). Here we would like to emphasize a few points.</p><p>First, this study relies on previous work in monkeys (Onken et al., 2019; Padoa-Schioppa, 2013) and rodents (Hirokawa et al., 2019) showing that the encoding of decision variables in OFC is categorical in nature. In other words, in a statistical sense, different groups of neurons encode different variables. Of course, our ability to assess the class of a particular cell is limited by neuronal noise, a finite number of trials, and the fact that the encoded variables are correlated with each other. Hence, we certainly make some classification errors. In previous work (Xie and Padoa-Schioppa, 2016), we estimated our classification precision to be ~80%.</p><p>Second, previous analyses of this same data set indicated that the cell groups identified in the two tasks are one and the same (Shi et al., 2022).</p><p>Third, it is clear that classifying cells using trials from both tasks will (a) reduce our classification errors and (b) avoid biasing any further analysis in favor of one task of the other. Indeed, this is why we classified neurons using both tasks.</p><p>Finally, while it is true that the idea of distinct cell groups is central to our analyses and thus to the interpretation, classification errors are not a confounding factor for any of our results. Indeed, classification errors are like noise, and will generally make it harder – not easier – to demonstrate differences between cell groups and correlations between behavioral measures and neuronal measures derived for a particular cell group.</p><p>These considerations leave us confident that our results are valid and not artifactual.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

For terminology, it is a bit confusing that these previous findings are labelled &quot;biases&quot; but that one of the effects discussed here is increased stochasticity (reduced accuracy) rather than a bias – can the authors find some way of being more general about choice effects?</p></disp-quote><p>See Public review, weaknesses, point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For the analysis of choice behavior and the use of probit regression, it would help if the authors could quantify the goodness of fit of their choice functions (probit model using log amount ratios), specifically against alternative models (logit, and/or models with amount difference rather than log ratio). The big issue is that the relevant measures (accuracy, order bias, preference bias) depend largely on parameters derived form these fits, so it is important to see that the fits good and the model is appropriate. for the order effect in particular, have the authors examined the data while relaxing the assumption of a constant sigmoid?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for raising this question. To address it, we conducted a series of control analyses.</p><p>First, we kept the assumption of parallel sigmoids and we repeated the behavioral analysis using different regression functions (logit instead of probit) and different models (value difference instead of log value ratio). For each fit, we derived measures of the relative value (in each task), the sigmoid steepness (in each task) and the order bias (in Task 2), as well as a measure for the goodness of fit. Importantly, the measures obtained for different fits were all very similar. To compare the goodness of fit obtained with different functions and models, we used the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref> illustrates the 3 most relevant comparisons (pooling data for Task 1 and Task 2). In essence, the logit typically provided a better fit than the probit, and the log value ratio model typically provided a better fit than the value difference model. The latter result is consistent with theoretical considerations (Padoa Schioppa, 2022).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Comparing behavioral models (N = 241 sessions, pooled Task 1 and Task 2).</title><p>(A) BIC difference between probit regression with log ratio vs.. logit regression with log ratio.

I do think that the dependence of the effect on relative value (i.e. rotation of the ellipse) seems to be less well supported: beyond clearing up the presentation of the significance of the results, perhaps this could be places in a clearer context vis a vis the basic preference bias – I don't think it is necessary to the general findings.</p></disp-quote><p>See Public review, weaknesses, point 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Please be clearer about how exactly the different effects are detrimental.

One issue that points towards the latter, at least in the order bias, is the sign of the neuronal effects (Figure 5C, Figure 6C). While the behavioral order bias is overwhelming positive, the neural effects (difference in AB vs BA rhos, circuit inhibition) do not on average differ from zero, even if they are correlated with the behavioral effect. If these neural effects drive the bias, shouldn't hey also be biased in the correct direction? Can the authors provide an interpretation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important issue. Aside from other considerations, the experiments and analyses conducted in this study can only show correlations – not causal relations – between neural activity and behavioral effects. Having recently conducted causal experiments, we are very primed to this distinction, and we think that our writing throughout this manuscript is unambiguous about this issue. That said, the signs in Figure 5C and Figure 6C brought up by R2 deserve some discussion.</p><p>With respect to Figure 6C, the location of the data cloud on the axis is actually consistent with our predictions and understanding. The reason is that we expect some amount of circuit inhibition (y-axis) even in the absence of order bias. In fact, we think that this amount of circuit inhibition is critical to the decision process under sequential offers (Ballesta and Padoa-Schioppa, 2019). In this view, reduced circuit inhibition would correlate with the order bias. Consistently, the regression line that summarizes the data cloud has a negative intercept (y&lt;0 for x=0; presence of circuit inhibition when the order bias = 0) and positive slope (reduced circuit inhibition correlating with positive order bias).</p><p>In contrast, the cloud of data points in Figure 5C differs somewhat from our natural intuition. Specifically, the regression line has a negative intercept (y&lt;0 for x=0). In other words, the entire data cloud is displaced downwards compared to where one might have thought. As a result, if we project the whole cloud on the y axis, the center of the distribution does not differ significantly from zero. As we conclude this study, we don’t have a good interpretation for this phenomenon, and future work will need to revisit this issue. We clarified this point in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Additional points:</p><p>– How exactly is the preferred item (A vs. B) defined – across both tasks combined?</p></disp-quote><p>Juice A was defined such that (ρ<sub>Task1</sub> + ρ<sub>Task2</sub>)/2 ≥ 1. (We typically knew ahead of time what juice was preferred; in rare cases where the inequality turned out in the opposite direction, we inverted the definition of A and B.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Given the initial framing, it seems to me that these data – especially the preference bias effect – provides insight into the goods versus action based choice discussion (and relates to some previous work like Cai and Padia-Schioppa). Perhaps it would be relevant to discuss this briefly at the end of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The debate about action-based vs good-based decisions has traditionally been about whether value comparison takes place in the space of actions of in the space of goods. The present results do not revisit that issue – in fact, we start from the assumption that values are compared in goods space. That said, even if one embraces the good-based model, as we do, it is clear that the choice outcome has to be transformed into a suitable action. To this point, which we made many other times, the present study adds a simple consideration: noise and biases affecting choices could also emerge late, after value comparison. Furthermore, we show that the preference bias indeed emerged late. This result might be perceived as resonating with the idea of a “distributed consensus” involving multiple representations (Cisek, 2012). However, in our understanding of the distributed consensus model, different representation would be engaged in parallel and not serially as we argue here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– A conceptual question: given that all three effects are presented as suboptimal, why should this be the case given the initial framing that sequential decisions are the prevalent, natural form of choices?</p></disp-quote><p>Great question, and we don’t have a definite answer. But here are a few thoughts. In the behavioral economics literature, there has long been the idea that acquiring information or paying attention to all aspects of the offers is costly, and thus in some situations it may be rationale to make choices that appear affected by systematic errors (i.e., biases) but that reduce the attentional cost (Simon, 1956; Sims, 2003). Along similar lines, the two biases documented here might reflect some ecological trade-off. For example, maintaining in working memory the value of offer1 until offer2 must have some metabolic cost. The animal would be better off remembering offer1 faultlessly and choosing the higher value, but there is some trade-off between the metabolic cost of working memory and the cost of choosing the lower value once in a while. And if the animal forgets the value of offer1, it makes sense to bias the choice in favor of offer2 (order bias). The important point is that this trade-off involving metabolic costs does not enter explicitly the encoding and the comparison of offer values. In other words, insofar as the metabolic cost of remembering offer1 affects choices, it does so in a meta-decision sense. Similar arguments can be made apropos the preference bias and the drop in choice accuracy. In the revised Discussion, we included a new section ‘<italic>The cost of choice biases</italic>’, where we discuss these issues.</p></body></sub-article></article>
