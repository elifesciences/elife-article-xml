Mitochondria provide fuel, metabolites, and ATP during different phases of the cell cycle, however it is not completely understood how mitochondrial function and the cell cycle are coordinated. CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) is a post-transcriptional regulator of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and several metabolic pathways. Here, we show a role of CLUH in regulating the expression of astrin, which is involved in metaphase to anaphase progression, centrosome integrity, and mTORC1 inhibition. We find that CLUH binds both the <italic>SPAG5</italic> mRNA and its product astrin, and controls the synthesis and the stability of the full-length astrin-1 isoform. We show that CLUH interacts with astrin-1 specifically during interphase. Astrin-depleted cells show mTORC1 hyperactivation and enhanced anabolism. On the other hand, cells lacking CLUH show decreased astrin levels and increased mTORC1 signaling, but cannot sustain anaplerotic and anabolic pathways. In absence of CLUH, cells fail to grow during G1, and progress faster through the cell cycle, indicating dysregulated matching of growth, metabolism, and cell cycling. Our data reveal a role of CLUH in coupling growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CLUH</kwd><kwd>SPAG5</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>mTORC1</kwd><kwd>astrin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>269925409</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rugarli</surname><given-names>Elena I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>411422114-GRK 2550</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rugarli</surname><given-names>Elena I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>open access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Langer</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CLUH links growth signaling pathways and mitochondrial metabolism with cell cycle progression by regulating astrin-1 synthesis and stability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proliferating cells adjust their metabolism to each individual phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buchakjian and Kornbluth, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee and Finkel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salazar-Roa and Malumbres, 2017</xref>). Before division cells must double their biomass and DNA content. This entails a prominent rewiring of metabolism to foster biosynthetic pathways allowing the synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids. During mitosis, an increase in ATP production supplies the energy needed for pulling apart and segregating the chromosomes. As metabolic organelles, mitochondria are key actors in the metabolic reprogramming of proliferating cells. On the one hand, cell cycle regulators influence mitochondrial metabolism in various ways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leal-Esteban and Fajas, 2020</xref>). For example, CDK1 phosphorylates components of the respiratory chain during G2 and of the mitochondrial translocase of the outer membrane during mitosis, probably to enhance oxidative respiration and ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harbauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). On the other hand, energy deficiency is sensed by cell cycle checkpoints causing cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mandal et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salazar-Roa and Malumbres, 2017</xref>). Mitochondrial dynamics is also intimately linked to cell cycle progression. A hyperfused mitochondrial network is important for the G1–S transition, while mitochondria must fragment before cells enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitra et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, proliferating cells depend on several coordinated mechanisms to regulate how mitochondria utilize nutrients to fuel cell growth or energy production during the cell cycle. However, how mitochondrial metabolism and respiratory function are coordinated during the cell cycle is still largely unclear. Unraveling these mechanisms is crucial since they are often dysregulated in cancer.</p><p>One of the ways, how mitochondrial metabolism can be rewired is through regulation of RNA regulons by RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schatton and Rugarli, 2018</xref>). CLUH (clustered mitochondria homolog) is a conserved RNA-binding protein, which binds transcripts encoding proteins involved in the respiratory chain, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and other mitochondrial metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). Upon loss of CLUH, target mRNAs are subjected to faster decay and their respective proteins are decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatton et al., 2017</xref>). This leads to alterations in mitochondrial distribution (mitochondrial clustering as the gene name alludes to) mitochondrial cristae integrity, respiratory defects, loss of mtDNA, and decreased activity of TCA cycle enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatton et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pla-Martín et al., 2020</xref>). In the mouse, constitutive loss of <italic>Cluh</italic> causes neonatal lethality, while a liver-specific <italic>Cluh</italic> knockout (KO) led to hypoglycemia and defective ketogenesis upon starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatton et al., 2017</xref>). CLUH and its target mRNAs form ribonucleoprotein particles in primary hepatocytes. These CLUH granules are important not only to protect target mRNAs from degradation, but also to restrict mTORC1 activation and promote mitophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pla-Martín et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in postmitotic hepatocytes CLUH controls the balance between catabolism and anabolism, allowing a survival response to starvation.</p><p>Astrin (also called SPAG5) is a multifunctional protein with a well-established role during mitosis. The complex astrin/kinastrin/DYNLL1 is involved in the stabilization of the kinetochore–microtubule interactions in metaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kern et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, cells lacking astrin or its interactor kinastrin show defects in chromosome segregations and a delayed metaphase to anaphase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gruber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>). Astrin has however other roles in interphase, ranging from mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thedieck et al., 2013</xref>), centrosome integrity and centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>), and regulation of p53 levels during G2 after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halim et al., 2013</xref>). Astrin is highly expressed in several cancers and it is considered a poor prognostic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Fatah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertucci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ying et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We show here that in HeLa cells astrin exists in two isoforms, astrin-1 and astrin-2. We reveal that CLUH binds the <italic>SPAG5</italic> mRNA, as well as the astrin-1 protein. The interaction of CLUH and astrin-1 occurs during interphase and protects astrin-1 and kinastrin from degradation. Moreover, we show that CLUH positively regulates mitochondrial anaplerotic pathways that sustain mTORC1 activation.

To test these hypotheses, we produced different constructs expressing the 5′ UTR and the coding region of the <italic>SPAG5</italic> cDNA, and we mutagenized the uATG, the ATG1, or downstream ATGs individually or in different combinations to GGG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). When we expressed the uATG<sup>GGG</sup>-SPAG5 construct, the expression of astrin-2 was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, mutagenesis of ATG1 confirmed the existence of a downstream alternative translation start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overexpression of the constructs harboring mutagenized downstream ATGs revealed that astrin-2 is the product of alternative translation starting from ATG3-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The identity of astrin-1 was also confirmed by pull-down of this isoform only using an antibody directed against the N-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To evaluate whether the interaction domain of astrin that binds to CLUH lies in the N-terminal part of astrin-1, we transfected a construct expressing both astrin-1 and astrin-2 (ATG1-SPAG5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or an N-terminus deleted variant (Δ151-SPAG5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and performed reciprocal IPs in HeLa wildtype and <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). An interaction was observed only with full-length astrin, proving that CLUH binds within the N-terminus of astrin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, the astrin interactor kinastrin has no binding preference to any of the two astrin isoforms, consistent with the previously mapped interaction domain between these two proteins (residues 482–693 of astrin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Friese et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kern et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kern et al., 2017</xref>). CLUH still interacts with astrin-1 upon kinastrin depletion, suggesting that kinastrin is not required for the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Overexpression of both astrin-1 and astrin-2 led to a diffuse cytosolic staining and to the formation of granular structures that vary in size, likely depending on the level of expression. Endogenous CLUH was characteristically recruited to astrin-1 but not astrin-2-positive structures, in agreement with the biochemical characterization of this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p><p>In polysome profiles performed after chemical crosslinking, CLUH migrated in lighter fractions, as well as in fractions containing the monosome and polysomes, while astrin and kinastrin were only detected in the lighter fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating the existence of distinct CLUH complexes. In conclusion, we identify the expression of two astrin isoforms via alternative initiation of translation, and establish CLUH as a specific molecular partner of astrin-1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CLUH controls astrin-1 and kinastrin stability and astrin expression</title><p>In absence of CLUH, kinastrin and astrin-1, but not astrin-2, are decreased in abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

CLUH controls the expression of some of its target mRNAs by preventing their degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schatton et al., 2017</xref>).

To avoid analyzing cells with large astrin-1 aggregates, we focused on cells expressing lower levels of astrin-1. In some cells, astrin-1 labeled a dotty structure that was positive at one extremity for CEP43 and partially colocalized with PCM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However, in other cells astrin-1-positive punctae were not decorated by centrosomal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This suggests that overexpressed astrin-1 can accumulate at the centrosome, but also at non centrosomal structures. Since lack of specific antibodies against endogenous astrin-1 precluded us to further explore this localization, we asked if endogenous CLUH can be found at the centrosome. CLUH and CEP43 stainings did not overlap in unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), indicating that CLUH is not a constitutive component of the centrosome.

Metabolomic analyses during starvation (a treatment that arrests cell proliferation and blocks entry in G2/M) have revealed opposite signatures in cells lacking CLUH or astrin, indicating a perturbed metabolic rewiring. We therefore hypothesized that the functional significance of the interaction of CLUH with astrin is to couple mitochondrial metabolism to cell cycle progression. Assessment of unsynchronized cells using markers for different phases of the cell cycle showed a reduction of the levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRB1-Ser807/811) in absence of CLUH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A, B</xref>). pRB1 is hyperphosphorylated during the progression through the cell cycle by cyclin D/CDK4/6. This phosphorylation releases the RB inhibitory binding to E2F transcription factors, thus allowing gene transcription required for the progression through S phase.</p><p>To further investigate the cell cycle dysregulation in <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells, we used a double thymidine block (DTB) to synchronize wildtype and <italic>CLUH</italic> KO HeLa cells at the beginning of S phase, followed by release for different time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

Surprisingly, <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells cycled faster than control cells, with more cells already in G2/M 3 hr after the release and more cells entering the next cell cycle at 8 hr after release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–G</xref>). In absence of CLUH, pRB1-Ser807/811 increased less during the progression of the cell cycle and peaked earlier compared to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>). Cyclin D3 also showed a flattener profile in the KO compared to wildtype cells during the first 8 hr after release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>). In contrast, the inactivating phosphorylation of CDK1 on Tyr15, which occurs in G2 and allows progression into M, and the phosphorylation of serine 10 of histone 3, which marks cells in mitosis showed a similar temporal profile to wildtype cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>). These results hint at the ability of <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells to overcome cell cycle checkpoints at the G1/S transition. Remarkably, while CLUH levels did not change during the cell cycle, astrin-1 and to a lesser extent astrin-2 levels dropped prematurely in <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells 6 hr after synchronization, a time point where most cells are in G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H, I</xref>).

Mechanistically, CLUH controls the synthesis and the stability of astrin-1, the full-length protein product of the <italic>SPAG5</italic> gene. Astrin is a coiled-coil protein, with a well-established role during mitosis to stabilize kinetochore–microtubule interactions and allow correct orientation of chromosomes at the metaphase plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manning et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunsch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kern et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ying et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, additional roles of astrin have been reported in interphase, including mTORC1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thedieck et al., 2013</xref>), centriole duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>), and the recovery from DNA damage at the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Halim et al., 2013</xref>). We show here that the interaction of CLUH with astrin is regulated during the cell cycle, and ensures the matching of the mitochondrial metabolic output with the progression of the cell cycle.</p><p><italic>SPAG5</italic> upregulation in several cancers has been associated with poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdel-Fatah et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertucci et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Human cancer cell lines show the expression of two isoforms of astrin, however the origin of these isoforms has not been investigated up to now. We demonstrate that the two astrin isoforms arise by alternative translation initiation, and are regulated by the presence of an uORF and downstream AUGs with good Kozak sequences. Intriguingly, CLUH interacts only with the full-length astrin-1 protein. The N-terminal region of astrin is an unstructured domain that is dispensable for interaction with kinastrin, DYNLL1, MYCBP, and the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kern et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, the PLK1 kinase has been shown to interact with and phosphorylate the astrin N-terminus, an important step to stabilize the kinetochore–microtubule attachment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Geraghty et al., 2021</xref>). Based on our findings, we speculate that N-terminal phosphorylations are responsible for the lack of interaction of CLUH and astrin-1 in PM. Thus, astrin detaches from CLUH during mitosis when it is required for metaphase to anaphase progression.</p><p>Interestingly, CLUH appears to regulate astrin-1 expression at multiple levels. The <italic>SPAG5</italic> transcript represents an exception to the finding that mRNAs bound by CLUH mainly encode mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). We show here that the <italic>SPAG5</italic> mRNA decays faster and that the synthesis of astrin-1 is impaired in absence of CLUH. It is known that during cytokinesis the E3-ubiquitin ligase MID2 ubiquitinates astrin, targeting it for proteosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gholkar et al., 2016</xref>). CLUH may be implicated in supporting synthesis of astrin-1 to replenish its levels in G1. Astrin-1 then accumulates during the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle and is stabilized, together with kinastrin, by binding CLUH. While we established the role of CLUH binding to prevent astrin-1 degradation, more experiments are required to determine to what extent the synthesis of astrin-2 is also modulated by CLUH.</p><p>The interaction of CLUH with astrin-1 led us first to investigate the possibility of a role of astrin-1 in concert with CLUH in regulating mitochondrial metabolism. Our data do not support this scenario, since depletion of astrin or kinastrin do not recapitulate the prominent mitochondrial defects observed upon CLUH downregulation or KO. Upon loss of astrin or kinastrin, mitochondria are normally dispersed in the cytoplasm, show normal morphology and ultrastructure, do not lose mtDNA and efficiently assemble respiratory supercomplexes. <italic>SPAG5</italic> ind-KO cells showed a mild decrease of the levels of mitochondrial proteins encoded by CLUH target mRNAs. Furthermore, starved cells lacking astrin or CLUH display strikingly opposite metabolic profiles. Finally, astrin and kinastrin are not detected in polysomal fractions, in contrast to CLUH. In agreement with our data, a recent study has also identified astrin as a CLUH partner and showed that <italic>SPAG5</italic> knockdown does not affect the interaction of CLUH with nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins occurring before their import in the organelle and revealed by Bio-ID proximity labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hémono et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that the formation of the astrin-1–CLUH complex competes with the function of CLUH at the polysomes. This remains a hypothesis at present and more work will be required to assess this possibility.</p><p>Our data establish an essential role of CLUH in the metabolic rewiring directed by mTORC1 signaling. Upon starvation, both <italic>CLUH</italic> KO and <italic>SPAG5</italic> ind-KO cells showed inappropriate mTORC1 activation, in agreement with astrin being a negative regulator of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thedieck et al., 2013</xref>). It remains to be established if mTORC1 hyperactivation observed upon loss of CLUH is entirely dependent on astrin destabilization, or whether different pathways are at play. However, the metabolic defects caused by loss of CLUH were discordant with this signaling, with a decrease in the TCA cycle intermediates and in the pool of glycolytic intermediates, some nucleotides, and polyamines. Enzymes of the TCA cycle as well as characteristic anaplerotic enzymes, such as pyruvate carboxylase, proprionyl-CoA carboxylase, and other branched chain amino acid catabolic enzymes are encoded by <italic>bona fide</italic> CLUH target mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). These pathways are essential to replenish the TCA cycle intermediates to compensate for their loss upon activation of biosynthetic pathways following mTORC1 signaling. Indeed, a compensatory increase in anaplerotic pathways occurs under conditions of chronic mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dutchak et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, CLUH tunes mTORC1 signaling in two independent ways, by regulating the expression of astrin-1 and by ensuring the maintenance of mitochondrial anaplerotic pathways via its RNA-binding function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our data demonstrate another connection between mTORC1 signaling and mitochondrial function. mTORC1 positively regulates the translation of mitochondrial proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morita et al., 2017</xref>), while inhibition of mTORC1 activates a lipid signaling cascade that triggers YME1L-mediated intramitochondrial proteolysis to limit mitochondrial biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacVicar et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, mTORC1 hyperactivation is part of the integrated stress response that follows mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khan et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Proliferating cells must shunt metabolites into mitochondrial pathways that promote cell growth or oxidative respiration and ATP production, depending on the cell cycle phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeBerardinis et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salazar-Roa and Malumbres, 2017</xref>). In G1 cells double their mass and depend on glycolysis to fuel the TCA cycle and sustain biosynthetic pathways, while in S synthesis of nucleotides is required and glutamine oxidation is prevalent. Interestingly, the TCA cycle intermediates fluctuate during the cell cycle, and it is known that these variations are not transcriptionally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Olsen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahn et al., 2017</xref>). In mammalian cells, mTORC1 activation is important for the transition from G1 to S, an important check point when the energy levels and the growth status of the cell are sensed, and from G2 to M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuyàs et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that by regulating astrin-1 and stabilizing an RNA regulon involved in the TCA cycle and anaplerotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gao et al., 2014</xref>), CLUH ensures that the progression of the cell cycle is adjusted with activation of mTORC1 signaling and the mitochondrial metabolic profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using a post-transcriptional mechanism to coordinate mitochondrial function with cell cycle phases allows a fast and flexible mean to control a broad gene program. Consistently, cells lacking CLUH have cell cycle defects, characterized by a faster cell cycle progression despite failure to properly double the cell mass.</p><p>Astrin is a component of centriolar satellites in interphase, and it is required for the centrosomal localization of CDK5RAP2, a protein involved in microcephaly, and for proper centriole duplication in S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani et al., 2015</xref>), a step which is crucial for cell cycle progression. Astrin-1 overexpression depletes endogenous CLUH from the cytoplasm and recruits it to structures that are close to centrosomes or contain centrosomal markers. However, we could not demonstrate the recruitment of endogenous CLUH at the centrosome at least in unsynchronized cells. Whether and how astrin-1 is involved in regulating CLUH subcellular localization remains to be determined.</p><p>Finally, our data add to the evidence that astrin plays additional roles outside mitosis. Astrin was also identified in an unbiased screen to be essential for the reentry in mitosis after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Halim et al., 2018</xref>). This interphase role of astrin should be further explored in view of our findings, as possibly involving dysregulated or enhanced CLUH activity. HeLa cells, as many human cancer cells, overexpress not only astrin-1 but also astrin-2, an isoform of astrin competent to bind all other interactors (kinastrin, DYLNN1, and MYCPB) and the kinetochore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kern et al., 2017</xref>), but not CLUH. We propose that expression of astrin-2 endows cancer cells with the ability to proliferate, despite a dysregulated coupling between mitochondrial metabolism and the cell cycle, making CLUH a possible novel therapeutic target in cancers overexpressing <italic>SPAG5</italic>. In conclusions, our findings reveal a novel post-transcriptional mechanism coordinating mitochondrial metabolism and the cell cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>HeLa WT and <italic>CLUH</italic> KO cells were obtained from Guy Lenaers lab (Université d’Angers) and previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wakim et al., 2017</xref>).

The samples were analysed using a Dionex ion chromatography system (Integrion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwaiger et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, 5 µl of polar metabolite extract were injected in push partial mode using an overfill factor of 3, onto a Dionex IonPac AS11-HC column (2 mm × 250 mm, 4 μm particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Dionex IonPac AG11-HC guard column (2 mm × 50 mm, 4 μm, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column temperature was held at 30°C, while the auto sampler was set to 6°C. A potassium hydroxide gradient was generated using a potassium hydroxide cartridge (Eluent Generator, Thermo Scientific), which was supplied with deionized water. The metabolite separation was carried at a flow rate of 380 µl/min, applying the following gradient conditions: 0–3 min, 10 mM KOH; 3–12 min, 10–50 mM KOH; 12–19 min, 50–100 mM KOH; 19–21 min, 100 mM KOH; 21–22 min, 100–10 mM KOH. The column was re-equilibrated at 10 mM for 8 min. For the analysis of metabolic pool sizes the eluting compounds were detected in negative ion mode [M−H]<sup>−</sup> using multiple reaction monitoring mode with the following settings: capillary voltage 2.7 kV, desolvation temperature 550°C, desolvation gas flow 800 l/hr, collision cell gas flow 0.15 ml/min. The detailed quantitative and qualitative transitions and electronic settings for the analyzed metabolites are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>.

Several burning questions arise and certainly they cannot be answered in one study.</p><p>Having understood that uncovering spatial regulation requires additional deep investigation efforts beyond the scope of this manuscript, it is suggested to limit some possible scenarios and address some (limited) aspects of the cellular distribution of astrin and Cluh. The fact that Cluh interacts with both mRNA and astrin-1 may suggest the role in some kind of translational hot-spots, acting rather far away from chromosomes and during interphase. The further interactions of Cluh with microbular and centrosome proteins do not exclude such a scenario. On the other hand the localization of Cluh to centrosomes, and its dependence on astrin-1 is not demonstrated, as the granular structures of Cluh in the absence of astrin remains enigmatic.

This suggests that they are made from the same mRNA. As they show later on that loss of CLUH destabilizes the SPAG5 mRNA, why would only be the synthesis of the longer isoform be affected? The trend is observed in the figure but not mentioned in the text. If there is a true difference, how would CLUH only affect translation of one astrin isoform and not the other? Is this connected to the region of the mRNA that is bound by CLUH?</p><p>2) Astrin overexpression beautifully regulates CLUH localization. I would really appreciate some blow ups of the images or arrows pointing to the dots here to make it more obvious.</p><p>3) Could expression of astrin1 vs 2 rescue CLUH localization in SPAG5 KO cells? If yes this would be an important tool to untangle the impact of CLUH mislocalization from loss of astrin.</p><p>4) Metabolomics of starved CLUH vs starved Astrin KO cells are polar opposites, which the authors suggest could be due to CLUH also regulating the expression of TCA enzymes etc. via its RNA-binding function. This seems reasonable, but is confounded by the fact that loss of astrin will directly impact mTOR via Raptor, but also relocalize CLUH. As mentioned above, re-expression of astrin2, which judging by Thedieck et al. 2013 still binds Raptor, in SPAG5 KO may help to untangle the direct impact of astrin on mTOR and the indirect one via CLUH, which the authors have previously proposed to regulate mTOR by sequestering it into G3BP1-containing granules (Pla-Martin et al. 2020).</p><p>5) Judging by Suppl Figure 6 the combination of CLUH and astrin loss on mTOR signaling is additive, which supports the hypothesis that CLUH affects mTOR via a pathway separate from astrin, probably via G3BP1. How does loss of G3BP1 impact mTOR activation in SPAG5 KO?</p><p>6) The authors claim a &quot;different temporal profile for CDK1 on Tyr15&quot;. This needs to be more precisely defined; to me, the temporal pattern looks similar but the magnitude is higher in CLUH KO cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74552.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should perform additional experiments in accord with the remarks appended in the individual reviews, with a special focus on the issue of localization.

We have now performed additional experiments to shed light on a possible localization of CLUH at the centrosome and how it may depend on astrin-1. Mild overexpression of astrin-1 leads to the formation of a punctate perinuclear structure that resembles the centrosome. Using markers for the centrosomes (CEP43) and the pericentriolar material (PCM1), we confirmed that astrin-1 localizes to these structures, as previously demonstrated. Cells overexpressing astrin-1 can also form additional aggregates that are not coincident with the centrosome. However, these experiments should be taken with caution, since they are performed upon overexpression. More experiments will be required to understand the exact nature of these additional structures. We now show examples for both types of occurrence in the revised Figure 3D.</p><p>We have also performed experiments to test if endogenous CLUH localizes at the centrosome. Analysis of thousands of cells in unsynchronized cultures did not reveal staining of endogenous CLUH at the centrosome (Figure 3E). While these experiments cannot exclude the presence of CLUH at the centrosome during a particular phase of the cell cycle, we can rule out the relevance of such a localization for the main function of CLUH during interphase.</p><p>To further investigate how lack of astrin impacts on CLUH subcellular localization, and to control for specificity of experiments in the <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO clones, we performed rescue experiments by transiently re-expressing different astrin isoforms in <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells (see also response to Reviewer # 2, point 3). However, we could not rescue the abnormal localization of CLUH at the periphery of the cells by expressing astrin-1, astrin-2 or both. Surprisingly, these proteins were also recruited at focal adhesions together with CLUH. It is possible that this abnormal CLUH localization is a clone-specific feature, or that it reflects cell cycle defects observed in these cells, or a metabolic phenotype that cannot be rescued by transient overexpression. Moreover, to detect this localization of CLUH at focal adhesion it is important to culture the cells at high confluence. To fully understand the significance of these CLUH-positive structures, more experiments and the generation of rescue clones with endogenous levels of astrin re-expression are required. We believe that these experiments are outside the scope of the current manuscript. We have therefore decided to remove these data from the manuscript, as they are too preliminary and their interpretation is speculative. We have amended the discussion accordingly. We think that omitting these data does not change the main message of our manuscript that focuses on revealing how CLUH regulates astrin-1 levels and integrates mitochondrial metabolism with the cell cycle.</p><p>We show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> the rescue experiment results to the Reviewers.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Confocal immunofluorescence pictures of HeLa cells overexpressing for 24 h FLAG-tagged astrin-1 and astrin-2, astrin-1 or astrin-2 alone stained for FLAG (red) and CLUH (green).</title><p>DAPI was used to stain nuclei (blue).

This suggests that they are made from the same mRNA. As they show later on that loss of CLUH destabilizes the SPAG5 mRNA, why would only be the synthesis of the longer isoform be affected? The trend is observed in the figure but not mentioned in the text. If there is a true difference, how would CLUH only affect translation of one astrin isoform and not the other? Is this connected to the region of the mRNA that is bound by CLUH?</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is right in noticing that there is a tendency towards reduction of the synthesis also of astrin-2, as it would be expected if CLUH stabilizes the <italic>SPAG5</italic> mRNA. We have now performed an additional experiment to increase the biological replicates, however we still observed a consistent reduction of the newly synthesized astrin-1 while the synthesis of astrin-2 was affected in some experiments but not in others. One problem in the interpretation of this experiment is that astrin-1 is also immediately stabilized in wild-type cells by binding CLUH. We therefore likely observe here a combination of the effects that lack of CLUH has on translation and on protein stability of astrin-1. For this reason, we have now rephrased in a more cautionary tone our conclusion in the Result section: “We observed that newly synthesized astrin-1 is reduced in absence of CLUH to a greater extent than astrin-2, probably reflecting the decreased stability of the longer isoform (Figure 2H-I).” Moreover, we have added the following sentence to the Discussion: “While we established the role of CLUH binding to prevent astrin-1 degradation, more experiments are required to determine to what extent the synthesis of astrin-2 is also modulated by CLUH.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Astrin overexpression beautifully regulates CLUH localization.

If yes this would be an important tool to untangle the impact of CLUH mislocalization from loss of astrin.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for raising this point. We have performed rescue experiments by transiently re-expressing different astrin isoforms in <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells (see also response to Reviewer # 1).

This seems reasonable, but is confounded by the fact that loss of astrin will directly impact mTOR via Raptor, but also relocalize CLUH. As mentioned above, re-expression of astrin2, which judging by Thedieck et al. 2013 still binds Raptor, in SPAG5 KO may help to untangle the direct impact of astrin on mTOR and the indirect one via CLUH, which the authors have previously proposed to regulate mTOR by sequestering it into G3BP1-containing granules (Pla-Martin et al. 2020).</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer is asking if astrin regulates mTORC1 only via its ability to sequester raptor in stress granules, or also by enhancing CLUH function. Answering this question requires the generation of cell lines that express only astrin-2 or astrin-1 at the endogenous level in absence of <italic>SPAG5</italic>. Although we have attempted to generate these cell lines during the time of the revision, we were not successful. Transient experiments are not suited to this purpose, given the high variability of mTORC1 signaling among cells and different experiments. We agree with the Reviewer that this is an important point to investigate in the future, however it is not in the focus of our current manuscript. Our main message here is that CLUH regulates astrin-1 and in this way couples mitochondrial metabolism with the cell cycle. This opens several questions on the role of astrin itself, especially in the context of cancer biology, which are outside the scope of the current manuscript. In addition, it is possible that the mTORC1 hyperactivation in cells lacking <italic>SPAG5</italic> is the result of a more complicated signaling dysregulation than what was reported by Thedieck at al. To unravel this abnormal mTORC1 signaling will require many more experiments and is a story on its own.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Judging by Suppl Figure 6 the combination of CLUH and astrin loss on mTOR signaling is additive, which supports the hypothesis that CLUH affects mTOR via a pathway separate from astrin, probably via G3BP1. How does loss of G3BP1 impact mTOR activation in SPAG5 KO?</p></disp-quote><p>In Suppl Figure 6, the combination of CLUH and astrin loss shows indeed an additive effect on mTORC1 activation. However, an alternative explanation is that CLUH downregulation further depletes astrin, also from those cells that were not targeted by the inducible CRISPR-Cas9 system. Therefore, any conclusion based on this experiment is premature.</p><p>We have tested if <italic>G3BP1</italic> downregulation impacts mTORC1 activation in <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells (using total KO cells to avoid the problem mentioned above). These experiments show that depletion of G3BP1 leads to mTORC1 hyperactivation (in agreement with data from Prentzell et al., 2021, PMID: 33497611), and this is not significantly enhanced in <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells, at least in four independent experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). However, we think that adding these data to the paper will only trigger additional questions, and we would therefore prefer to leave them outside the manuscript. Dissecting in depth if astrin and CLUH regulate mTORC1 in separate ways and the role of G3BP1 is a long-term project. Although we are interested in further exploring this question, we think that it is not important for the conclusion of the current paper. In fact, the only point that we want to make here is that, despite a similar abnormal signaling of mTORC1 upon starvation, the metabolic profile of <italic>CLUH</italic> and <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells is very different. We also want to point out that CLUH is regulating the expression of mitochondrial proteins that are required to fully allow the metabolic reprogramming induced by mTORC1 signaling. We have now added in the Discussion the following sentence: “It remains to be established if mTORC1 hyperactivation observed upon loss of CLUH is entirely dependent on astrin destabilization, or whether different pathways are at play.”</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(A) Western blot for the indicated antibodies in WT and <italic>SPAG5</italic> KO cells downregulated with control of <italic>G3BP1</italic> siRNA in basal and HBSS conditions.</title><p>(B) Quantification of four biological replicates.

We have now performed additional experiments and quantified the temporal pattern of all the antibodies used. Results have been added to Figure 7I. The Reviewer was indeed right and the temporal profile of CDK1-Tyr15 was not changed, while this quantification revealed different profiles of pRB1, cyclin D3, and astrin-1.
