action are still limited to few examples. We recently identified pCharme, a chromatin-associated lncRNA whose functional knockout in mice results in defective myogenesis and morphological remodeling of the cardiac muscle. Here, we combined Cap-Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE), single-cell (sc)RNA sequencing, and whole-mount in situ hybridization analyses to study pCharme cardiac expression. Since the early steps of cardiomyogenesis, we found the lncRNA being specifically restricted to cardiomyocytes, where it assists the formation of specific nuclear condensates containing MATR3, as well as important RNAs for cardiac development. In line with the functional significance of these activities, pCharme ablation in mice results in a delayed maturation of cardiomyocytes, which ultimately leads to morphological alterations of the ventricular myocardium. Since congenital anomalies in myocardium are clinically relevant in humans and predispose patients to major complications, the identification of novel genes controlling cardiac morphology becomes crucial. Our study offers unique insights into a novel lncRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism promoting cardiomyocyte maturation and bears relevance to Charme locus for future theranostic applications.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ncRNA</kwd><kwd>lncRNA</kwd><kwd>cardiomyogenesis</kwd><kwd>heart</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd><kwd>development</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004271</institution-id><institution>Sapienza Università di Roma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM11916B7A39DCE5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballarino</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004271</institution-id><institution>Sapienza Università di Roma</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RM12117A5DE7A45B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballarino</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009880</institution-id><institution>Regione Lazio</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2020-T0002E0001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballarino</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministero dell'Istruzione, dell'Università e della Ricerca</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CN3221842F1B2436 CN3_Spoke 3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ballarino</surname><given-names>Monica</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lncRNA pCharme controls the expression of cardiomyocyte maturation genes and heart development by orchestrating the formation of MATR3-enriched nuclear condensates.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In all vertebrates, heart development occurs through a cascade of events in which a subtle equilibrium between proliferation, migration, and differentiation ultimately leads precursor cells to mature into all the major cardiac cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bruneau, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Moorman and Christoffels, 2003</xref>). At the molecular level, the execution of the developmental program is governed by the dynamic interplay of several cardiac regulators, whose expression and functions are coordinated in time and space. Alteration of this process results in abnormal cardiac morphogenesis and other congenital heart defects that in humans represent the most common types of birth defects and cause of infant death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zimmerman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Srivastava, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020</xref>). Mutations of transcription factors and their protein cofactors have emerged as causative of a broad spectrum of heart malformations, although only 15–20% of all congenital heart defects have been associated to known genetic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Morton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kodo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bouveret et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ang et al., 2016</xref>). The need to find more targets for diagnosis and therapy has therefore evoked interest in new categories of disease-causing genes, whose discovery has been accelerated by impressive advancements in genomics. In this direction, improvements in the next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionised many areas of the biomedical research, including cardiology, by the discovery of long noncoding RNA (lncRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mattick, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cipriano and Ballarino, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yao et al., 2019</xref>). LncRNAs form a heterogeneous class of non-protein coding transcripts, longer than 200 nucleotides, participating in many physiological (i.e., cell stemness, differentiation, or tissue development) and pathological (i.e., cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular, or neurodegeneration) processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mirzadeh Azad et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Riva et al., 2016</xref>). In the heart, several biologically relevant lncRNAs have been identified, with functions related to aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jusic et al., 2022</xref>) and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pagano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Specifically for cardiac development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pinheiro and Naya, 2021</xref>), most of the lncRNA-mediated mechanisms were dissected by cell culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Klattenhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ounzain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kim et al., 2021</xref>), while in vivo characterizations remained limited to few instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grote et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hazra et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>The importance of lncRNA for adult heart homeostasis has been often described by linking their aberrant expression to cardiac anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Han et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ballarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Han et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ponnusamy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anderson et al., 2021</xref>). Along this line, in 2015 we identified a new collection of muscle-specific lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ballarino et al., 2015</xref>) and focused our attention on Charme (Chromatin architect of muscle expression) (mm9 chr7:51,728,798–51,740,770), a mammalian conserved lncRNA gene, whose loss of function in mice causes progressive myopathy and, intriguingly, congenital heart remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ballarino et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we look at the function of this lncRNA in a developmental window and assign an embryonal origin to the cardiac defects produced by its knockout. By using molecular and whole-tissue imaging approaches, we give an integrated view of Charme locus activation in the developing heart and show that the functional pCharme isoform, retaining intron-1, is expressed already in fetal tissues, progressively dropping down after birth. Single-cell (sc)RNA sequencing analyses from available datasets also reveal a strong cell type-specific expression of pCharme in the embryonal heart, where it is restricted to cardiomyocytes (CM). In line with this specific location, high-throughput transcriptomic analyses combined with the phenotypic characterization of WT and Charme<sup>KO</sup> developing hearts highlight a functional role of the lncRNA in CM maturation and in the regulation of trabecular genes transcriptional network. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated from fetal cardiac biopsies upon the cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) of MATR3, a nuclear pCharme interactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desideri et al., 2020</xref>), reveals the existence of a specific RNA-rich condensate containing pCharme as well as RNAs for important regulators of embryo development, cardiac function, and morphogenesis. In accordance with the functional importance of the pCharme/MATR3 interaction in developing cardiomyocytes, the binding of these transcripts with MATR3 is altered in Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts. Moreover, MATR3 depletion in mouse-derived cardiac primary cells leads to the downregulation of such RNAs, which suggests an active crosstalk between MATR3, pCharme, and cardiac regulatory pathways.</p><p>Understanding the basics of cardiac development from a lncRNA <italic>point of view</italic> is of interest not only for unraveling novel RNA-mediated circuitries but also for improving treatment options aimed at enhancing cardiomyogenic differentiation. Indeed, despite the recent advancements in generating cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells through tissue engineering-based methods, most protocols produce immature cells, which lack many attributes of adult cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Uosaki et al., 2015</xref>). Consequently, the cells generated cannot be used for efficient drug screening, modeling of adult-onset disease, or as a source for cell replacement therapy. We identify here pCharme as a new non-coding regulator of cardiac maturation and characterize the molecular interactome acting with the lncRNA in vivo. This research not only advances our understanding of heart physiology but in the next few years may serve as a foundation for new human diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Charme locus expression in developing mouse embryos and cardiomyocytes</title><p>Our earlier studies revealed the occurrence of muscle hyperplasia and cardiac remodeling upon the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Charme loss of function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ballarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desideri et al., 2020</xref>). Intriguingly, the morphological malformations were clearly displayed in both adult and neonatal mice, strongly suggesting possible roles for the lncRNA during embryogenesis. With the purpose to trace back the developmental origins of Charme functions, we started by analyzing the whole collection of FANTOM5 mouse promoterome data to quantify transcription initiation events captured by CAGE-seq across the lncRNA locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noguchi et al., 2017</xref>). In addition to its cardiac specificity, this profiling revealed the highest expression of the locus during development (E11-E15) followed by a gradual decrease at postnatal stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then evaluated the expression of the two splice variants, pCharme and mCharme, produced by the locus at E15.5 and postnatally (day 2, after birth). RT-qPCR analyses with specific primers confirmed the CAGE output and revealed that both the isoforms are more expressed at the fetal than the postnatal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). More importantly, we found pCharme to be 50% more abundant than mCharme, which is particularly intriguing in consideration of the prominent role of the nuclear isoform previously shown in skeletal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desideri et al., 2020</xref>). Using in situ hybridization (ISH) approaches, we then profiled by imaging the spatiotemporal expression of Charme during development. These analyses revealed an initial expression of Charme locus already in the tubular heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, E8.5), within territories which will give rise to the future atria and ventricles (V), with the inflow (IFT) and outflow (OFT) tracts displaying the highest signals. ISH also confirmed the expression of the locus at later stages of development, both in cardiac tissues and somites (S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, E13.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A similar expression pattern was found within intact embryos and fetal hearts by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Searching for cardiac regulators, we identified canonical motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and enriched sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) for the T-box transcription factor-5 (TBX5). In addition to being a key regulator of heart development, known to activate genes associated to CM maturation in early development and morphogenesis at later stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nadadur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Steimle and Moskowitz, 2017</xref>), TBX5 was recently found to control the expression of several lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yang et al., 2017</xref>), a subset of them intriguingly enriched, as for pCharme, in the chromatin fraction of cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hall et al., 2021</xref>). A more in-depth analysis of the scRNA-seq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jackson-Weaver et al., 2020</xref>), revealed a positive and highly significant correlation between <italic>Tbx5</italic> and pCharme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, left panel) in CM, with some differences occurring across the CM cluster subtypes (see, for instance, CM-IVS/CM-OFT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, right panel).

In both conditions, ChIP-seq analyses revealed the specific occupancy of TBX5 to highly conserved spots within the pCharme promoter, which increases with differentiation. However, while in differentiated cardiomyocytes pCharme expression was insensitive to TBX5 ablation, the lncRNA abundance was consistently decreased by TBX5 knockout in progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). As progenitor CM represent a cell resource for recapitulating (ex vivo) the early establishment of cardiac lineages and for mimicking cardiomyocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kattman et al., 2011</xref>), these results are consistent with the role of TBX5 for Charme transcription at fetal stages. The presence of consensus sites for other TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and the known attitude of TBX5 to interact, physically and functionally, with several cardiac regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akerberg et al., 2019</xref>), also predict the possible contribution of other regulators to pCharme transcription which may act, in cooperation or not, with TBX5 during CM maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Genome-wide profiling of cardiac Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> transcriptomes</title><p>Over the years, we have accumulated strong evidence on the role played by pCharme in skeletal myogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ballarino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Desideri et al., 2020</xref>); however, important questions are still pending on the role of pCharme in cardiomyogenesis.

Similar to pCharme activity in skeletal myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ballarino et al., 2018</xref>), we did not find DEGs within the neighboring chromatin environment (370 kb around Charme) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>A Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment study was then applied separately to the up- and downregulated DEGs. These analyses revealed that the upregulated DEGs were primarily enriched (FDR-values &lt; 1,0E-10) in cell cycle and cell division categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel), which parallels with a slight increase in the number of KI-67<sup>+</sup> mitotic Charme<sup>KO</sup> nuclei, as quantified from neonatal cardiac sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The same study was applied to the downregulated DEGs, which revealed their enrichment to more functional and morphogenetic GO categories and primarily referred to anatomical structure morphogenesis (FDR 5.77E-07) and circulatory system development (FDR 3.1338E-06) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, these top-ranked categories include TFs involved in pivotal steps of embryo development, such as <italic>Smad3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>) and <italic>Nocth3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">MacGrogan et al., 2018</xref>), and functional components of cardiomyocytes, such as the voltage-dependent calcium channel subunit <italic>Cacna1c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wang et al., 2018</xref>), and Myosin-18b (<italic>Myo18b</italic>), known to regulate cardiac sarcomere organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Latham et al., 2020</xref>). By expanding the analysis from neonatal to embryonal timepoints (E12.5, E15.5, and E18.5), we found that the expression of these genes was significantly decreased upon pCharme ablation from the fetal E15.5 stage onward,as compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, the <italic>Myh6</italic>/<italic>Myh7</italic> ratio, which measures CM maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">England and Loughna, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Scheuermann and Boyer, 2013</xref>) and that increases over the wild-type timepoints, displays a gradual decrease in the Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts from E15.5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To note, the expression of cell-cycle and proliferation genes was not affected by pCharme ablation over the same developmental window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hence, we argue that their upregulation in neonatal KO hearts was likely a consequence of the cardiac maturation impairment, which leads to a shift to a more fetal and proliferative state of cardiomyocytes upon birth.</p><p>Overall, these findings suggest that during cardiac development, pCharme regulates morphogenetic pathways whose dysregulation causes a pathological remodeling of the heart. Accordingly, histological analyses performed by hematoxylin and eosin staining of Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> cardiac cryo-sections (E15.5) showed a pronounced alteration of the myocardium, with a clear decrease of the area of the ventricular cavities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The histological investigation was then deepened to the trabeculated myocardium, the tissue directly surrounding ventricle cavities. To this purpose, we performed immunofluorescence staining and Western blot analysis for the natriuretic peptide A (NPPA) factor, a known marker of the embryonal trabecular cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Choquet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horsthuis et al., 2008</xref>). In parallel, heart sections were analyzed for cardiac vasculature since (i) the process of trabeculae formation is known to be temporally coupled with the formation of blood vessels during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Samsa et al., 2013</xref>) and, importantly, (ii) the ‘circulatory system development’ category was among the main GO enriched for pCharme downregulated DEGs. We found that, with respect to WT, mutant hearts display a significant reduction of NPPA<sup>+</sup> tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), which parallels the decreased expression of the <italic>Irx3</italic> and <italic>Sema3a</italic> trabecular markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Choquet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>), and the diminished density of the capillary endothelium imaged by lectin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Hence, the fetal expression of pCharme is necessary for the achievement of morphogenetic programs important for CM maturation, myocardial geometry, and vascular network formation. Overall, these ensure the preservation of the cardiac function and structure in adulthood, as a progressive deterioration of the systolic function, which becomes significant at 9 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1I</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>), was observed in Charme<sup>KO</sup> mice.

Interestingly, MATR3 was found highly expressed in cardiomyocytes from newborn mice and heterozygous mutations in MATR3 resulted in congenital heart defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quintero-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). This raises the intriguing possibility that pCharme may play a role in cardiomyocyte maturation through MATR3. To examine this hypothesis, we first assessed the subcellular localization of pCharme in fetal (E15.5) hearts by biochemical fractionation. RT-qPCR analyses revealed that, in line with what was previously observed in skeletal muscle, in cardiomyocytes pCharme mainly localizes in the nucleus, while the fully spliced mCharme is enriched in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We next applied high-resolution RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) to visualize pCharme alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>) or relatively to MATR3 through combined immunofluorescence IF/RNA-FISH approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In agreement with the subcellular fractionation, the imaging experiments confirmed the nuclear localization of pCharme, which exhibits its typical punctuate pattern. Further analysis of the three-dimensional distribution of pCharme and MATR3 revealed a clear colocalization of their signals and the formation of nuclear condensates, as quantified by 3D Pearson’s correlation coefficient applied to the overlapping signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on these results, we then tested if the presence of pCharme could influence the nuclear localization of MATR3. To this end, we performed MATR3 IF assays in wild-type and Charme<sup>KO</sup> fetal (E15.5) muscle biopsies and in spinal cord nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

Therefore, our results indicate the formation of MATR3-containing condensates inside the nucleus of cardiomyocytes which contain pCharme, as the most abundant lncRNA, and pre-mRNAs encoding for important cardiac regulators.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The pCharme/MATR3 interaction sustains developmental gene expression in fetal cardiomyocytes</title><p>On a transcriptome scale, we found that in the heart the expression of MATR3-bound RNAs was globally reduced by pCharme knockout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Indeed, while MATR3 targets were under-represented among transcripts whose expression was unaffected (invariant) or increased (upregulated) by pCharme ablation, 12% of the downregulated DEGs (41 out of 340, pCharme included) were bound by MATR3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To note, these common targets were significantly enriched across the top three GO classes, previously defined for Charme<sup>KO</sup> downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This evidence suggests that pCharme is needed to sustain the cardiac expression of MATR3 targets. To investigate the possible implication of the lncRNA for MATR3 binding to RNA, we proceeded with a differential binding (DB) analysis of MATR3 CLIP-seq datasets between the Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Among the shared peaks, DB revealed that the main consequence of pCharme depletion was a significant decrease of MATR3 enrichment on the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Loss), while the increase of protein binding was observed on a lower fraction of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Gain). In line with the specificity for MATR3 binding, also in these sets of differentially bound regions, the MATR3 motif was positioned close to the summit of the peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). By mapping these differentially bound regions to the MATR3 targets that are also responsive to pCharme ablation (DEGs), we found that while the gained peaks were equally distributed, the loss peaks were significantly enriched in a subset (20 out of 40, 50%) of downregulated DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, upper panel).

Furthermore, the maintenance of specific lncRNAs on the chromatin, combined with their scaffolding activity for RNA and proteins, can cunningly seed high-local concentrations of molecules to specific loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhat et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ribeiro et al., 2018</xref>). The occurrence of alternative RNA processing events eventually leads to the formation of diverse lncRNA isoforms, thus refining the biochemical properties and the binding affinities of these ncRNAs. This suggestive model perfectly fits with pCharme and provides mechanistic insights into the physiological importance of this lncRNA in muscle. In fact, of the two different splicing isoforms produced by the Charme locus, only the unspliced and nuclear pCharme isoform was found to play an epigenetic, architectural function in skeletal myogenesis under physiological circumstances.</p><p>Here, we took advantage of our Charme<sup>KO</sup> mouse model to extend the characterization of this lncRNA to embryogenesis. We show that the temporal and cell-type-specific expression of pCharme is critical for the activation of pro-differentiation cardiac genes during development. Mechanistically, we provide evidence that this activity relies on the formation of pCharme-dependent RNA-rich condensates acting as chromatin hubs for MATR3, a nuclear matrix DNA/RNA-binding protein highly abundant in the fetal heart and source, upon mutation, of congenital defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Quintero-Rivera et al., 2015</xref>). MATR3 ability to bind RNA can lead to the formation of dynamic shell-like nuclear condensates, whose composition depends on the integrity of the two RNA recognition motifs (RRM1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Malik et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sprunger et al., 2022</xref>).

Along this view, the pCharme-dependent regulation of the MATR3 cardiac interactome emphasizes the need of cell-type-specific lncRNAs for directing its activity to specific RNAs, in tissue-distinctive and spatiotemporal manners. Moreover, as the impairment in the nuclear distribution of MATR3 can exert adverse effects in diverse tissues, our study may provide a more inclusive viewpoint on myopathies but also neuromuscular disorders, where alteration in muscle development involves not only the myogenic lineage but also the interaction of the myogenic cells with the surrounding tissues.</p><p>These results also underlie the importance of studying cardiomyogenesis in animal models, which allow a better appreciation of the balance between the proliferation and maturation processes in cardiomyocytes and, importantly, the study of the cardiac functions in adulthood. In our case, adult Charme<sup>KO</sup> mice develop a significant reduction of systolic function with initial signs of cardiac dilation, which denotes an early phase of cardiomyopathy.

After this iterative procedure, the few remaining cells not fitting any cluster were discarded. A dataset of 4014 cells and 34 clusters was obtained. COTAN function <italic>clustersDeltaExpression</italic> (GitHub devel branch) was used to obtain a correlation coefficient and a p-value for each gene and each cluster. From the correlation matrix, a cosine dissimilarity between clusters was estimated and used to plot a dendrogram (with the ward.D2 algorithm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The tree was used to decide which clusters could be merged. Cell type for each final cluster was assigned based on a list of markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jackson-Weaver et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2016</xref>) as follows. Cardiomyocytes (1834 cells): Myh6+, Nppa+, atrial CM (333 cells): are also Myl1+, Myl4+, ventricular CM (1289): are also Myl2+, Myl3+, interventricular septum CM (117 cells): are also TBX20+, Gja5+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Franco et al., 2006</xref>), venous pole CM (95 cells): also Osr1+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meilhac and Buckingham, 2018</xref>), outflow tract CM (72 cells): also Isl1+, Sema3c+, neural crest cells (there are two clusters expressing their markers: 1.NC with 48 cells and 2.NC with 68 cells): Msx1+, Twist1+, Sox9+, epicardial cells (359 cells): Cebpb+, Krt18+, fibroblasts-like cells (278 cells): Tcf21+, Fn1+, endothelial cells (168 cells): Klf2+, Pecam1+, Cdh5+, smooth muscle cells (710 cells): Cnn1+, Acta2+, Tagln2+, Tagln+, hemopoietic myeloid cells (79 cells): Fcer1g+, hemopoietic red blood cells (397 cells): Hba-a1+. The final UMAP plot with the cell assignment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>. Heatmap in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref> shows a coherent assignment between final clusters and cell type with additional marker genes. For correlation analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), relevant genes in each subpopulation of interest (CM-VP, CM-OFT, A-CM, CM-IVS, V-CM) were analyzed separately by applying COTAN on a test dataset composed by the subpopulation in exam, together with a fixed contrasting cell group with the SM and EC cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Echocardiography</title><p>The echocardiographer was blinded to the phenotypes. Mice were anesthetized with 2.5% Avertin (Sigma T48402) to perform echocardiographic structural (measurement of left ventricular diameters and wall thickness) and functional (fractional shortening) analyses with a VEVO 3100 (Visualsonics) using a mx550d probe. We used avertin since it does not induce significant cardiodepressant effects, potentially affecting our echocardiographic experiments compared to ketamine combinations, such as ketamine + xylazine. The fractional shortening (FS) of the left ventricle was calculated as FS% = (left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) – left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD)/LVEDD) × 100, representing the relative change of the left ventricular diameters during the cardiac cycle. The mean FS of the left ventricle was determined by the average of FS measurements of the left ventricular contraction over three beats.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical methods and rigor</title><p>Statistical tests, p-values, and n for each analysis are reported in the corresponding figure legend.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Lucile Miquerol as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide evidence that Charme KO does not affect the expression of adjacent genes, which could indirectly induce the cardiac phenotype.</p><p>2. A more detailed analysis of the embryonic cardiac phenotype is required including the expression of key cardiac genes that can induce the observed phenotypes.</p><p>3. A deep analysis of the CLIP–seq data should be added to clarify the proposed mechanism of the role of Charme in cardiac development. Please investigate the transcript (CLIP–seq) and genome occupancy (ChIP–seq) of MATR3 in the absence of Charme in E15 hearts. A combinatorial analysis of these data with the RNA seq data is highly desirable.</p><p>4. The discussion should be revised to extend the mechanism further with regards to MATR3 and its interactions in the absence of Charme.</p><p>The full review below provides some guidance about revisions that are required to make the manuscript suitable for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Be consistent by using either &quot;embryonic&quot; or &quot;embryonal&quot; throughout the manuscript and avoid both, this is disturbing.</p><p>– l119: the term &quot;early stages of cardiac specification&quot; is not appropriate for data at E11 since cardiac specification arises much earlier when mesodermal cells are migrating. Are these data quantitative? The expression of pCharme looks higher during development compared to postnatal stages but hard to say that a pic of expression is detected at E14–E15.</p><p>– l128: At E8,5, the heart tube is formed not initiated.</p><p>– l135: Prenatal should be replaced by fetal (E15.5), there are still 4 days before birth.</p><p>– In Figures 1C and 1D, the colored lines are useless and masking the signaling (example on the E13.5 section where the red line is covering the right ventricle). It is very difficult from this section to be quantitative and say that higher level of expression is detected in ventricles. Higher magnification of these images could help.</p><p>– In figure 1D, the overall anatomy of the mutant heart is strange, what was the angle of view for this image? The drawing lines are not helpful, do you observe an anatomical change in mutant hearts?</p><p>– Tbx5 expression is not homogenous during embryonic development, being more expressed in the LV, does this could be correlated with the pattern of expression of pCharme?</p><p>– Could you explain this sentence &quot;Remarkably, the lncRNA expression consistently decreases upon TBX5 knockout, which points to the relevance of this TF for the transcriptional regulation of Charme locus.&quot; When looking at figure 1H, there is no significative difference in pCharme expression between WT and Tbx5KO in CM ? Does Tbx5 required at fetal stages for pCharme expression?</p><p>– l220, &quot;developing WT…&quot; it is important to precise the timepoint when RNAseq experiment was done because pCharme expression is temporally regulated and can have different roles during cardiac development.</p><p>– The overgrowth of compact layer is not convincing from the images in Figure2F, 2G and suppl Figure 2D and 2E. First of all, these images are not taken at the level on the Dorso–ventral axis and this could interfere with the thickness of the ventricular wall. The thickness of the ventricular wall and compact layer, in particular, should be measured for the same ventricle (LV or RV) and at the same level to confirm that compact layer is increased in mutant hearts. Do you see increase in IVS thickness ? What about the expression of compact myocardial marker such as Hey2?</p><p>– The expression of Nppa is not sufficient to affirm that a significant reduction of trabeculae is present in mutant hearts. May the low expression of Nppa is a direct target of pCharme regulation and trabeculae are still present. Other markers should be looked at. Do you see down regulation of trabecular markers in the RNAseq dataset?</p><p>– Immunofluorescence is not a quantitative method, what is your reference when you perform your quantification of fluorescence of Nppa?</p><p>– The lectin staining is not convincing, why not using endothelial cell marker such as pecam1 or endomucin, an endocardial marker to stain the endocardium which can be useful to evaluate if trabeculae and compact layer formation is disturbed.</p><p>– l310 : E15.5 represents a foetal stage and not embryonal.</p><p>– l311: why using the term biochemical fractionation while you are performing RT–qPCR ? Do you mean subcellular fractionation?</p><p>– l379: E15.5 represents a foetal stage and not embryonal.</p><p>– It is not clear whether pCharme phenotype is directly linked to MATR3. In what extent the cardiac phenotype in these two mutants are resembled? Do cell cycle activity disturb in MATR3 mutants?</p><p>– In Figure 6, why cell cycle activity is not mentioned?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Key recommendations:</p><p>1) Effect of Charme loss on neighboring genes considering its proximity. For example, MYBPC2 (essential for cardiac sarcomere) and EMC10 (neural crest) are in close proximity to Charme locus. It is important to show (a) does loss of Charme influences the expression of MYBPC2 in E11– E15 ventricle/ cardiomyocytes. (b) If Charme loss affects the expression of neighboring genes in E12.5 heart or E15 cardiomyocytes, does pCharme locus harbor enhancer/ regulatory regions controlling MYBPC2 or EMC10 or its loss affect the enhancer/ promoter interactions of MYBPC2 in E12.5 ventricle/cardiomyocytes?</p><p>2) The transcriptome analysis of postnatal whole hearts upon Charme loss is revealing regarding the molecular abnormalities. However, a detailed characterization of cardiac developmental defect is essential to provide clarity to the molecular developmental phenotype. WISH analysis for stage–specific cardiac development markers and cardiomyocytes markers of staged embryos from E8.5, E10.5, E12.5, E14.5, and P0 would reveal (a) what are the early and late developmental defects leading to cardiac abnormalities detailed in the manuscript and (b) whether the gene expression defects seen in postnatal hearts is due to developmental defect at an earlier stage during embryogenesis. This could be further clarified by the addition of qPCR analysis of the selected genes (for example, those shown in Figure 2E) or transcriptome sequencing, along with the cardiogenic developmental window from E8.5 to P0 using RNA from cardiogenic regions/ventricular tissue.</p><p>3) Based on the gene expression changes, the authors claim the role of Charme in cardiomyocyte maturation and cell cycle. While the data may suggest an effect in that direction unless validated, such claims should be toned down. If the authors want to explore in that direction to keep the claims, then answering the following questions is of significance (a) does the timing and progression of the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes affected by the loss of Charme? (b) is the proposed effect on the cell cycle an aftereffect of defective early cardiogenesis or due to molecular processes determining the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes that are directly controlled by Charme? (c) detailed analysis of the maturation of ventricular cardiomyocytes, including their electrical activity in the absence of Charme, to claim defects in cardiomyocytes maturation and at least a hypothesis on how the loss of Charme directly or indirectly affects the maturation of cardiomyocytes molecularly.</p><p>4) What are the proximal genomic regions in the 3D space to Charme locus in embryonic cardiomyocytes? Authors can re–analysis published Hi–C data sets from embryonic cardiomyocytes or perform a 4–C experiment using pCharme locus for this purpose. (ii) does the loss of Charme affect the splicing landscape of MATR3 bound pre–mRNAs in E12.5 ventricles in general and those arising from the NCTC region specifically? (iii) based on the authors' own previous data, MATR3 binds DNA as well. Is the MATR3 genomic binding altered by Charme loss in cardiomyocytes? Overlapping MATR3 genomic binding changes and transcriptome binding changes to differentially expressed genes in the absence of Charme would better clarify the MATR3–centric mechanisms proposed here. Further connecting that to 3D genome changes due to Charme loss could better support the mechanistic model proposed, which states a direct MATR3–based role for Charme in cardiac development.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have some concerns that would benefit from clarification in the manuscript. These are as follows:</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) For the in situ hybridization probe, the authors mention that the pCharme specific probe was designed to include exons 2 and 3. As per their previous work (Ballarino et al., 2018), it appears that exons 2 and 3 are also part of the mCharme isoform – is this true? While mCharme is expressed at lower levels than pCharme, it is still expressed in the heart (Figure 1B). A clarification is needed here or a more detailed description of the probe in the methods would be helpful.</p><p>2) It would be useful to show all the other transcription factor binding sites also detected in the general regulatory region of the Charme locus (maybe add in the supplementary region). Additionally, it is interesting to note that loss of Tbx5 affects pCharme expression significantly only in the cardiac progenitor state and not in the mature cardiomyocyte – a statement discussing this would definitely build up on the developmental role of pCharme.</p><p>3) Which Charme KO allele was used in the paper? It's not clearly mentioned in the Materials and methods. This is important since, in the authors' previous works, they have generated 2 KO alleles – one which specifically abolishes only the pCharme isoform. This is important to mention and then also demonstrate that the mCharme isoform is not changed and/or not responsible for the phenotype observed in Charme KO hearts.</p><p>4) The authors use a different number of hearts in the pools for the RNA sequencing experiments. Why? A single neonatal heart should be sufficient and if not, at least the same number of hearts should have been used in each pool?</p><p>5) Is there increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in the Charme KOs at E13.5 since the hyperplasia phenotype is already evident by then? What is the earliest stage at which the phenotype becomes most evident since pCharme appears to be expressed as early as E8.5? Also, a caveat to note would be that the RNA–seq data obtained from postnatal KO hearts is probably reflective of the molecular changes due to the phenotype itself and not entirely indicative of the initial molecular changes that may be causative.</p><p>6) The RNA–seq was performed on post–natal hearts whereas the CLIP–seq was performed on E15.5 hearts – the authors should clarify why these two separate time points were used? Additionally, would it be possible to show what happens to some MATR3 bound RNAs (especially cardiac transcripts) in Charme KOs (maybe by CLIP–qPCR)? This would strengthen the work further by directly showing how MATR3 interacts with cardiac transcripts upon loss of pCharme. Currently, the evidence provided is correlative and this could be a more direct approach.</p><p>7) Do the authors observe any effects on splicing of different RNA transcripts? While the authors demonstrate interaction and suggest the presence of these condensates, the authors could speculate in the discussion about how pCharme may actually be regulating the transcription – at the level of splicing or stability or something else?

There are no morphological abnormalities concerning trabeculae in these hearts. However the expression of trabecular–specific genes such as Nppa, Irx3, and Sema3a is decreased, this suggests that pCharme impacts cardiac maturation by regulating the transcriptional network of the trabecular gene.

Provide evidence that Charme KO does not affect the expression of adjacent genes, which could indirectly induce the cardiac phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken up this question by combining several different approaches. First, we have analysed available Hi-C datasets (Rosa-Garrido et al. 2017) to select the genes <italic>adjacent</italic> to Charme locus, both “linearly” and “tri-dimensionally”. Prior estimation of pairwise chromatin contacts led us to consider a 370 Kb-long region, spanning 240 Kb upstream to 115 Kb downstream Charme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5A</xref>), which includes thirty-nine potential loci. Among them, none of the cardiac expressed genes (9/39) were deregulated by Charme ablation in both, neonatal (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1C) and fetal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5B</xref>) hearts (see details below; Rev 2, point 1). Thus, we concluded that the cardiac phenotype is not dependent on the effects of Charme ablation on adjacent genes.</p><p>The following comment was added to the text: “Similar to pCharme activity in skeletal myocytes (Ballarino et al. 2018), we did not find DEGs within the neighbouring chromatin environment (370 Kb around Charme) (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1C)” (lines 192-194)</p><p>We thank the reviewers since this clarification has provided more general insights into the mechanisms of Charme epigenetics and a better understanding of the cardiac phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

The new results clearly indicate that the pCharmemediated regulation of morphogenesis and differentiation genes is detectable from E15.5 onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>/Revised Figure 2E). Coherently with the altered maturation of the pCharme KO cardiomyocytes, also the myosins Myh6/Myh7 ratio diminished by around 69% of the physiological levels at neonatal stages (Revised Figure 2F). Interestingly, alteration of this parameter starts to appear as early as E15.5. Finally, the gene expression analysis on <italic>Ki67</italic>, <italic>Birc5</italic> and <italic>Ccna2</italic> (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) at the same time-points definitively rules out the influence of pCharme ablation on cell-cycle genes and cardiomyocytes proliferation, thus allowing a more careful interpretation of the embryonic phenotype.</p><p>Phenotypic analysis by hematoxylin-eosin staining of new <italic>dorso-ventral</italic> cryosections from Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts, confirmed a significant cardiac malformation at the E15.5 stage (Revised Figure 2G).

A deep analysis of the CLIP–seq data should be added to clarify the proposed mechanism of the role of Charme in cardiac development.

A combinatorial analysis of these data with the RNA seq data is highly desirable.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with the need to clarify the proposed mechanism, we performed new MATR3 CLIP-seq experiments from E15.5 Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts (see details below; Rev 2, point 2; Rev 3, point 6). As now reasoned within the text (<italic>lines 276-279</italic>), previous experience from our (Desideri et al., 2020) and other labs (Zeitz et al., 2009 J Cell Biochem), indicate that Chromatin IP is not the most suitable approach for identifying MATR3 specific targets because of the broad distribution of MATR3 over the genome (see answers to Rev 2 point 2). Also considering the number of animals needed, we moved further to strengthen our MATR3 CLIP evidence by adding the (i) Charme<sup>KO</sup> MATR3 CLIP-seq control and the (ii) combinatorial analysis of MATR3 CLIP-seq with the RNA-seq data.</p><p>We now show that the cooperation between pCharme and MATR3 activities in cardiomyocytes is needed for the expression of specific RNAs. Indeed, differential binding analysis of Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> MATR3 peaks (Revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C) revealed a significant decrease of MATR3 enrichment on a subset of cardiac expressed RNAs (Revised Figure 5C) upon pCharme ablation. MATR3 “loss” peaks were significantly enriched in a subset of pCharme down-regulated DEGs (50%, 20 out of 41) (Revised Figure 5D, upper panel), which include genes biologically important for embryo development and anatomical structure morphogenesis (i.e. <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, <italic>Notch3</italic>) (Revised Figure 5D, lower panel).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Data in Figure 1I provide functional support to the occupancy of TBX5 (ChIP-seq data, Figure 1H) on pCharme promoter and demonstrates the need of TBX5 for pCharme expression at early stages of development. Indeed, cardiomyocyte precursors (P-CM) represent an <italic>ex-vivo</italic> “window” for recapitulating the pathways that control the early establishment of the cardiac lineage, thus mimicking in vivo cardiomyocyte development (Kattman et al., 2011 Cell Stem Cell).</p><p>As it was confusing, we have extensively rephrased the statement as follows:</p><p>– lines 169-177 “However, while in differentiated cardiomyocytes pCharme expression was insensitive to TBX5 ablation, the lncRNA abundance was consistently decreased in TBX5 knockout progenitor cells (Figure 1I).

The overgrowth of compact layer is not convincing from the images in Figure2F, 2G and suppl Figure 2D and 2E. First of all, these images are not taken at the level on the Dorso–ventral axis and this could interfere with the thickness of the ventricular wall. The thickness of the ventricular wall and compact layer, in particular, should be measured for the same ventricle (LV or RV) and at the same level to confirm that compact layer is increased in mutant hearts. Do you see increase in IVS thickness ? What about the expression of compact myocardial marker such as Hey2?</p></disp-quote><p>We addressed this issue with the use of two different approaches, both suggested by this Reviewer.</p><p>First, we have quantified the IVS thickness and other morphometric parameters (i.e. heart area, ventricles area) by performing HandE staining on <italic>dorso-ventral</italic> E15.5 cardiac sections. The fetal stage (E15.5) was chosen based on the new gene expression analyses indicating this stage as the first developmental time point in which we observed a conspicuous and significant downregulation of morphogenetic genes upon pCharme ablation. The new histological analyses of mutant hearts (now included in Revised Figure 2G) evidence an interesting, although non-significant, 25% increase of the IVS thickness which parallels a significant 50% decrease in the area of the left and right ventricle cavities. To note, a similar morphometric alteration was previously described in the same mice at more adult stages (Ballarino et al., 2018).</p><p>As further suggested, we have checked the expression of Hey2 using our RNA-seq datasets and also extended the analysis to other “compact” myocardial markers (i.e. MycN, Tbx20 and Loxl2, Choquet et al., 2019). No significant difference was found between Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts in the expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). We further checked the expression of Hey2 in fetal hearts by RT-qPCRs. At this stage, Hey2 mRNA showed a weak tendency to be more abundant in Charme<sup>KO</sup> condition. However, the trend was not supported by western-blot analyses from protein extracts collected at the same time-point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>).

It is not clear whether pCharme phenotype is directly linked to MATR3. In what extent the cardiac phenotype in these two mutants are resembled? Do cell cycle activity disturb in MATR3 mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We previously found that sequence determinants within pCharme guide its physical interaction with MATR3, and that this binding is crucial for their respective physiological activities. Indeed, mice expressing a pCharme mutant isoform (Desideri et al., 2020) in MATR3 binding sites develop a cardiac phenotype similar to the pCharme full KO mice. Here, we propose that pCharme and MATR3 cooperate during development to regulate specific classes of cardiac morphogenetic genes. In this direction, combined RNA-seq and MATR3 CLIP-seq analyses revealed that a significant overlap exists between DEGs downregulated upon Charme ablation (and belonging to GO categories, such as embryo development, circulatory system development and anatomical structure morphogenesis) and the binding of MATR3 to the correspondent RNAs (Revised Figure 5D<bold>)</bold>. In accordance with a combined regulative role of MATR3/pCharme molecular binomial<italic>,</italic> MATR3 depletion in primary cardiac cells results in a significant downregulation of pCharme target genes belonging to these categories.</p><p>Note that this pCharme and MATR3 crosstalk appears to be specific for morphogenetic genes, as transcripts upregulated in Charme<sup>KO</sup> mice, which enrich cell-cycle GO categories, are not bound by MATR3 (Revised Figure 5A). This result is now substantiated by the analysis of MATR3-CLIP from KO hearts showing that only a little overlap exists between MATR3 differentially bound transcripts and these genes (Revised Figure 5D). Furthermore, their expression is not consistently altered by MATR3 depletion in primary cardiac cells. (Author response image.4). Therefore, while we found a clear interleaved relationship between MATR3 and pCharme in sustaining the expression of cardiac maturation genes (i.e <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, <italic>Notch3</italic>, <italic>Myo18B</italic>), we finally excluded a direct effect of the pCharme/MATR3 interplay on the expression of proliferation-related genes.

For example, MYBPC2 (essential for cardiac sarcomere) and EMC10 (neural crest) are in close proximity to Charme locus. It is important to show (a) does loss of Charme influences the expression of MYBPC2 in E11– E15 ventricle/ cardiomyocytes. (b) If Charme loss affects the expression of neighboring genes in E12.5 heart or E15 cardiomyocytes, does pCharme locus harbor enhancer/ regulatory regions controlling MYBPC2 or EMC10 or its loss affect the enhancer/ promoter interactions of MYBPC2 in E12.5 ventricle/cardiomyocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>Although the <italic>cis</italic>-activity represents a mechanism-of-action for several lncRNAs, our previous work does not reveal this kind of activity for pCharme. To add stronger evidence, we have now analysed the expression of pCharme neighbouring genes in cardiac muscle. Genes were selected by narrowing the analysis not only on the genes in “linear” proximity but also on eventual chromatin contacts, which may underlie possible candidates for <italic>in cis</italic> regulation. To this purpose, we made use of the analyses that in the meantime were in progress (to answer point 2) on available Hi-C datasets (RosaGarrido et al. 2017). Starting from a 1 Mb region around Charme locus, we found that most of the interactions with Charme occur in a region spanning from 240 kb upstream and 115 kb downstream of Charme for a total of 370 Kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5A</xref>). This region includes 39 genes, 9 of them expressed in the neonatal heart but none showing significant deregulation (see Supplementary File 2). To note, this genomic region also included the MYBPC2 locus, for which we did not find a decreased expression in the heart from our RNA-seq data (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and Supplementary File 2). This trend was confirmed through RT-qPCR analyses of several genes from E15.5 extracts, which revealed no significant difference in their abundance upon Charme ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig5">Author response image 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig5" position="float"><label>Author response image 5.</label><caption><title>Expression analysis of Charme neighbouring genes.</title><p>(A) Contact map depicting Hi-C data of left ventricular mice heart retrived from GEO accession ID GSM2544836.

However, a detailed characterization of cardiac developmental defect is essential to provide clarity to the molecular developmental phenotype. WISH analysis for stage–specific cardiac development markers and cardiomyocytes markers of staged embryos from E8.5, E10.5, E12.5, E14.5, and P0 would reveal (a) what are the early and late developmental defects leading to cardiac abnormalities detailed in the manuscript and (b) whether the gene expression defects seen in postnatal hearts is due to developmental defect at an earlier stage during embryogenesis. This could be further clarified by the addition of qPCR analysis of the selected genes (for example, those shown in Figure 2E) or transcriptome sequencing, along with the cardiogenic developmental window from E8.5 to P0 using RNA from cardiogenic regions/ventricular tissue.</p></disp-quote><p>We did our best to answer this concern.</p><p>Let us first emphasise that, since their generation, we have never observed any particular tissue alteration, morphological or physiological, when dissecting the Charme<sup><italic>K</italic>O</sup> animals other than the muscular ones. The high specificity of pCharme expression, as also shown here by ISH (Figure 1C-D, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-B, Figure 3A), together with the minimal alteration applied to the locus for CRISPR-Cas-mediated KO (PolyA insertion), strongly excludes the presence of an alteration in other tissues and their involvement in the development of the phenotype.</p><p>Nevertheless, we now add more developmental details to the cardiac phenotype (see also Essential revision point 2).</p><p>1. First of all, gene expression analyses performed at 12.5E, 15.5E, 18.5E and neonatal (PN2) stages allowed us to identify, at the molecular level, the developmental time point when Charme<sup><italic>K</italic>O</sup> effects on the cardiac muscle can be found. Our new results clearly indicate that the pCharme<italic>-</italic>mediated regulation of morphogenic and cardiac differentiation genes is detectable from E15.5 fetal stage onward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>/Revised Figure 2E). Together with the analysis of pCharme targets and coherently with the altered cardiac maturation and performance, this evidence is also supported by the analysis of the myosins Myh6/Myh7 ratio, which diminution in Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts starts from E15.5 up to 69% of control levels at PN stages (Revised Figure 2F).</p><p>2. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of <italic>dorso-ventral</italic> cryosections from Charme<sup>WT</sup> and Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts confirmed the fetal malformation at the E15.5 stage (Revised Figure 2G). Moreover, the hypotrabeculation phenotype of Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts, which was initially examined by immunofluorescence, now finds confirmation by the analysis of key trabecular markers (<italic>Irx3</italic> and <italic>Sema3a</italic>), which expression significantly decreases upon pCharme ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>/Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1G).</p><p>3. Finally, the gene expression analysis on <italic>Ki-67</italic>, <italic>Birc5</italic> and <italic>Ccna2</italic> (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1E) definitively rules out the influence of pCharme ablation on cell-cycle genes and cardiomyocytes proliferation, thus allowing a more careful interpretation of the embryonic phenotype. Note that, coherently with the lncRNA implication at later stages of development, the expression of important cardiac regulators, such as <italic>Gata4</italic>, <italic>Nkx2-5</italic> and <italic>Tbx5</italic>, is not altered by its ablation at any of the tested time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig7">Author response image 7</xref>), while pCharme absence mainly affects genes which are expressed downstream of these factors.</p><p>These new results have been included in the revised version of the manuscript and better discussed.</p><fig id="sa2fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Expression analysis of Gata4, Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 transcripts at embryonal stages.</title><p>RT-qPCR quantification Gata4, Nkx2-5 and Tbx5 in <italic>Charme</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>Charme</italic><sup>KO</sup> cardiac extract at E12.5, E15.5 and E18.5 days of embryonal development.

While the data may suggest an effect in that direction unless validated, such claims should be toned down. If the authors want to explore in that direction to keep the claims, then answering the following questions is of significance (a) does the timing and progression of the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes affected by the loss of Charme? (b) is the proposed effect on the cell cycle an aftereffect of defective early cardiogenesis or due to molecular processes determining the cell cycle in cardiomyocytes that are directly controlled by Charme? (c) detailed analysis of the maturation of ventricular cardiomyocytes, including their electrical activity in the absence of Charme, to claim defects in cardiomyocytes maturation and at least a hypothesis on how the loss of Charme directly or indirectly affects the maturation of cardiomyocytes molecularly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now substantiated the analysis of pCharme ablation on the proliferation/differentiation of cardiomyocytes and toned down our claims. We believe that Charme<sup>KO</sup> alteration of the cell cycle is a secondary and indirect effect of defective maturation of cardiomyocytes.

Authors can re–analysis published Hi–C data sets from embryonic cardiomyocytes or perform a 4–C experiment using pCharme locus for this purpose. (ii) does the loss of Charme affect the splicing landscape of MATR3 bound pre–mRNAs in E12.5 ventricles in general and those arising from the NCTC region specifically? (iii) based on the authors' own previous data, MATR3 binds DNA as well. Is the MATR3 genomic binding altered by Charme loss in cardiomyocytes? Overlapping MATR3 genomic binding changes and transcriptome binding changes to differentially expressed genes in the absence of Charme would better clarify the MATR3–centric mechanisms proposed here. Further connecting that to 3D genome changes due to Charme loss could better support the mechanistic model proposed, which states a direct MATR3–based role for Charme in cardiac development.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the authors' own previous data, MATR3 binds DNA as well.

These are as follows:</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) For the in situ hybridization probe, the authors mention that the pCharme specific probe was designed to include exons 2 and 3. As per their previous work (Ballarino et al., 2018), it appears that exons 2 and 3 are also part of the mCharme isoform – is this true? While mCharme is expressed at lower levels than pCharme, it is still expressed in the heart (Figure 1B). A clarification is needed here or a more detailed description of the probe in the methods would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for having raised this point, which needed clarification.</p><p>Although the ISH probes recognise both pCharme and <italic>m</italic>Charme, our preliminary set-up of the experiment (not included in the manuscript) revealed a signal intensity restricted to nuclei as also compared to Malat-1 lncRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig8">Author response image 8</xref>). Together with the minor abundance of <italic>m</italic>Charme in cardiomyocytes, this result led us to assume pCharme as the main isoform stained by these probes. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that this was an inaccuracy and we have revised the figures (Revised Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) and the text accordingly (<italic>line 125</italic>) by removing the reference to the specific isoform, pCharme, both in the figures and their legends.</p><p>The RNA-FISH probes used in later analysis to characterise Charme/MATR3 interaction (Figure 3A and 3B) are pCharme specific, since they were designed against intron 1.</p><fig id="sa2fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title>Charme and Malat-1 lncRNAs expression in neonatal hearts.</title><p><italic>Charme</italic> (left) and <italic>Malat-1</italic> (right) in situ hybridization performed on whole (PN) sections.

Additionally, it is interesting to note that loss of Tbx5 affects pCharme expression significantly only in the cardiac progenitor state and not in the mature cardiomyocyte – a statement discussing this would definitely build up on the developmental role of pCharme.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we took advantage of the enrichment analysis tool available on the ChIP Atlas database (https://chip-atlas.org/enrichment_analysis) using the cardiovascular class of TFs and setting the threshold for significance at 200 across mammalian species. The analysis confirmed the binding of TBX5 as well as other TFs on Charme promoter (included in Revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1F). The functional data in Figure 1I prove that TBX5 has an important role in cardiomyocyte precursors. We have now better specified that loss of TBX5 affects pCharme expression significantly only in the cardiac progenitor state and not in the mature cardiomyocyte (lines 169-173).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Which Charme KO allele was used in the paper? It's not clearly mentioned in the Materials and methods. This is important since, in the authors' previous works, they have generated 2 KO alleles – one which specifically abolishes only the pCharme isoform. This is important to mention and then also demonstrate that the mCharme isoform is not changed and/or not responsible for the phenotype observed in Charme KO hearts.</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry if the KO allele was not described properly. We have used the mutant mice previously generated in our lab through the insertion of a strong termination signal inside Charme locus by CRISPR-Cas (Charme<sup>KO</sup>, Ballarino et al. 2018). We have now better clarified this part in the Material and Methods section (lines 415-416). Our previous data provide evidence that the muscle phenotypes are caused by the loss of the nuclear functions. Indeed, <italic>m</italic>Charme overexpression is unable to rescue the phenotype caused by in vitro knock-down of both isoforms (Ballarino et al. 2018). Moreover, the mouse model with a specific mutation in the pCharme intron-1 (Charme<sup>ΔInt</sup>), also generated in the lab (Desideri et al., 2020), develops a cardiac phenotype similar to the full KO although the <italic>m</italic>Charme isoform is still expressed in the cytoplasm. This is now mentioned in the text (lines 237-239).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors use a different number of hearts in the pools for the RNA sequencing experiments. Why? A single neonatal heart should be sufficient and if not, at least the same number of hearts should have been used in each pool?</p></disp-quote><p>The use of pools (instead of single hearts) was thought to reduce the high variability between different individuals with the same genotype. The difference in the number of hearts is due to the fact that each pool represents a different litter (with a different number of pups). We preferred to include instead to exclude littermates <italic>unbiasedly</italic> only for maintaining the same number of hearts for each pool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Is there increased cardiomyocyte proliferation in the Charme KOs at E13.5 since the hyperplasia phenotype is already evident by then? What is the earliest stage at which the phenotype becomes most evident since pCharme appears to be expressed as early as E8.5? Also, a caveat to note would be that the RNA–seq data obtained from postnatal KO hearts is probably reflective of the molecular changes due to the phenotype itself and not entirely indicative of the initial molecular changes that may be causative.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point.</p><p>We have now strengthened the analysis on the expression of cell-cycle genes, and we did not find their significant alteration upon Charme loss at fetal stages (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, left panel). Furthermore, Ki-67 IF analysis on E15.5 sections confirmed that there is no difference in cardiomyocyte proliferation between the two genotypes (Revised Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, right panel). On the contrary, pCharme<italic>-</italic>mediated regulation of morphogenesis and differentiation genes is detectable from E15.5 onward (Revised Figure 2E). Coherently with the altered maturation of the pCharme KO cardiomyocytes, also the myosins <italic>Myh6</italic>/<italic>Myh7</italic> ratio diminished by around 69% of the physiological levels at neonatal stages (Revised Figure 2F). Interestingly, alteration of this parameter starts to appear as early as E15.5.</p><p>Overall, we agree with this reviewer that gene expression alteration in neonatal that increased proliferation is not the key for explaining the overgrowth phenotype of Charme<sup>KO</sup> hearts. We believe that the upregulation of cell-cycle genes Charme<sup>KO</sup> neonatal hearts can be considered as secondary to defective cardiomyocyte maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The RNA–seq was performed on post–natal hearts whereas the CLIP–seq was performed on E15.5 hearts – the authors should clarify why these two separate time points were used?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that this was a gap, originally filled by validating the alteration of pCharme targets in neonatal and E15.5 hearts. Now we provide new phenotypic details to E15.5 (Revised Figure 2G) and also extended the gene expression analysis to other time-points (E12.5 and E18.5) (Revised Figure 2E). Again, we ended up with E15.5 as the earliest developmental stage when the onset of pCharme functional impact occurs. The hook with MATR3 CLIP-seq is now clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, would it be possible to show what happens to some MATR3 bound RNAs (especially cardiac transcripts) in Charme KOs (maybe by CLIP–qPCR)? This would strengthen the work further by directly showing how MATR3 interacts with cardiac transcripts upon loss of pCharme. Currently, the evidence provided is correlative and this could be a more direct approach.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we have now performed a MATR3 CLIP-seq in Charme<sup>KO</sup> cardiac extracts. Through MATR3 differential binding analysis, we found a significant decrease of the protein enrichment on numerous peaks, while the increase of its binding was observed on a smaller fraction (Revised Figure 5C). As a control, we performed MATR3 motif enrichment analysis on the differentially bound regions revealing its proximity to the peak summit (+/- 50 nt) (Revised Figure 5—figure supplement 1D) close to the strongest enrichment of MATR3, further confirming a direct and highly specific binding of the protein to these sites. In order to better characterize the relationship between MATR3 and pCharme, we then intersected the newly identified regions with the MATR3-bound transcripts which expression was altered by Charme depletion. While gain peaks were equally distributed across DEGs, loss peaks were significantly enriched in a subset of pCharme down-regulated DEGs (Revised Figure 5D, upper panel), suggesting a crosstalk between the lncRNA and the protein in regulating the expression of this specific group of genes. Interestingly, these RNAs mainly distribute across the same GO categories (embryo development, anatomical structure morphogenesis and circulatory system development) (Revised Figure 5D, lower panel) and include genes, such as <italic>Cacna1c</italic>, <italic>Notch3</italic> and <italic>Myo18B</italic> that were already identified and validated as pCharme<italic>/</italic>MATR33 targets in the previous version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Do the authors observe any effects on splicing of different RNA transcripts? While the authors demonstrate interaction and suggest the presence of these condensates, the authors could speculate in the discussion about how pCharme may actually be regulating the transcription – at the level of splicing or stability or something else? This would significantly enrich the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>As also raised by the Reviewer 2, this is a very intriguing issue. Indeed, new evidence shows that the reactivation of fetal-specific RNA-binding proteins, including MATR3, in the injured heart drives transcriptome-wide switches through the regulation of early steps of RNA transcription and processing (D'Antonio et al., 2022).</p><p>Using the rMATS software on our neonatal RNA-Seq datasets we then investigated the effect of pCharme depletion on splicing. All classical splicing alterations were investigated, such as exonskipping, alternative 5’ splice site, alternative 3’ splice site, mutually excluded exons and intron retention.</p><p>As a prosecution of the project, Nanopore sequencing of these samples on a MinION platform is currently undergoing in the lab to obtain a better characterization of alternative splicing events in response to pCharme ablation during development.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>– The term hypo–trabeculation (l38, l884) is not appropriate as trabeculation (numerous cardiac invaginations) is still present in the pCharme mutant hearts (visible on sections). There are no morphological abnormalities concerning trabeculae in these hearts. However the expression of trabecular–specific genes such as Nppa, Irx3, and Sema3a is decreased, this suggests that pCharme impacts cardiac maturation by regulating the transcriptional network of the trabecular gene. The sentences referring to this hypotrabeculation need to be changed and it would be necessary to modify Figure 6 to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have addressed the remaining issues and modified the sentences referred to hypotrabeculation.</p><p>Specifically,</p><p>– Line 38 has been changed from “…to morphological alterations of the myocardium and ventricular hypo-trabeculation”.
