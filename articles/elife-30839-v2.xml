Terminal/perisynaptic Schwann cells (TPSCs) are a perisynaptic glial cell at the neuromuscular junction that respond to nerve-derived substances such as acetylcholine and purines. Here, we provide genetic evidence that activity-induced calcium accumulation in neonatal TPSCs is mediated exclusively by one subtype of metabotropic purinergic receptor. In <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutant mice lacking these responses, postsynaptic, rather than presynaptic, function was altered in response to nerve stimulation. This impairment was correlated with a greater susceptibility to activity-induced muscle fatigue. Interestingly, fatigue in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants was more greatly exacerbated by exposure to high potassium than in control mice. High potassium itself increased cytosolic levels of calcium in TPSCs, a response which was also reduced <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants. These results suggest that activity-induced calcium responses in TPSCs regulate postsynaptic function and muscle fatigue by regulating perisynaptic potassium.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A muscle that contracts over and over again will become tired.

Failing to send the correct signals to the muscles at these junctions can lead to muscle fatigue. Studies to date have focused on the role of nerve cells and muscle cells in these communication failures. But there is also a third cell type present at the neuromuscular junction, known as the terminal/perisynaptic Schwann cell (TPSC). Stimulating motor nerves in a way that produces muscle fatigue also activates TPSCs.</p><p>To investigate whether TPSCs contribute to or counteract muscle fatigue, Heredia et al. studied the responses of these cells at the neuromuscular junctions of young mice. Stimulating motor nerves caused TPSCs to release calcium ions from their internal calcium stores. However, this did not occur in mice that lacked a protein called the P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor. In normal mice, activating the P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor directly also made the TPSCs release calcium. This calcium release in turn prompted the TPSCs to take up potassium ions. Nerve and muscle cells release potassium during intense activity, and removal of potassium by TPSCs helped to prevent muscle fatigue.</p><p>Therapeutic strategies that make TPSCs release more of their internal calcium stores – and thus increase their potassium uptake – could help ease muscle fatigue. A valuable first step would be to use drugs and genetic techniques to show this effect in mice. The results could then guide the development of corresponding strategies in patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>perisynaptic</kwd><kwd>Schwann</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>potassium</kwd><kwd>fatigue</kwd><kwd>neuromuscular</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000097</institution-id><institution>National Center for Research Resources</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 RR018751</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hennig</surname><given-names>Grant W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103513</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hennig</surname><given-names>Grant W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20 GM103554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 GM110767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gould</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A genetic strategy reveals that the perisynaptic glial response to neural activity in one population of these glia regulates postsynaptic function and therefore muscle fatigue.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Muscle fatigue is defined as the decline in muscle performance that occurs in response to continued muscle activation. Muscle fatigue is a clinically important feature of myopathies such as muscular dystrophy, neuromuscular disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) such as multiple sclerosis, or diffuse conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome and cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Katirji, 2002</xref>). A wide variety of mechanisms in the central and peripheral nervous systems contribute to muscle fatigue. In simplified preparations of muscle and peripheral nerve, central sources of input are eliminated, permitting the examination of peripheral sites of fatigue, such as the presynaptic release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nanou et al., 2016</xref>), sensitivity of postsynaptic ACh receptors, propagation of the muscle action potential along the sarcolemma and into the t-tubules, release of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from sarcoplasmic reticulum, and activation of the contractile apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boyas and Guével, 2011</xref>). Proposed mediators of fatigue at these sites include changes in the concentration of intracellular and extracellular ions, such as calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), or protons (H<sup>+</sup>); metabolites, such as inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>), or lactate; and reactive oxygen species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2008</xref>). For example, high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of nerve or muscle raises the level of extracellular K<sup>+</sup> or [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, which may mediate fatigue by depolarizing muscle membrane, inactivating Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 voltage-gated sodium channels at the NMJ, and consequently blocking the production of muscle action potentials (APs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 2015</xref>) This mechanism may also underlie the muscle weakness observed in patients with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, a neuromuscular disorder caused by dominant mutations in the <italic>Scna4</italic> gene encoding the Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 channel and characterized by episodic muscle stiffness and weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannon, 2015</xref>).</p><p>In addition to presynaptic nerve terminals and muscle endplates, terminal or perisynaptic Schwann cells (TPSCs) reside at the NMJ. TPSCs are a non-myelinating Schwann cell subtype that influence the regeneration of injured peripheral motor axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Son et al., 1996</xref>), maintain developing synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddy et al., 2003</xref>), and participate in synaptic pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). TPSCs also respond to neural activity by increasing cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jahromi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reist and Smith, 1992</xref>) and are therefore functionally similar to other perisynaptic glial cells, such as astrocytes and enteric glia. In addition to responding to neurotransmitter released during neural activity by mobilizing Ca<sup>2+</sup>, astrocytes regulate the concentration of extracellular metabolites produced by activity through the expression of various ion channels and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Olsen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boscia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weller et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, TPSCs, as the perisynaptic glia of the NMJ, likely act to modulate the concentrations of these ions at the NMJ and thereby regulate muscle fatigue.</p><p>In astrocytes, activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is largely mediated by neurotransmitter-mediated stimulation of Gq G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), leading to the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the second messenger inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Volterra et al., 2014</xref>). Astrocytic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in turn modulates synaptic transmission and contributes to functional hyperemia, although each of these effects remains controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agulhon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonder and McCarthy, 2014</xref>). The interpretation of these effects is complicated by the observation that the mechanisms contributing to activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the fine processes of astrocytes are distinct from those underlying this signal in the cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bazargani and Attwell, 2016</xref>). Additionally, the diversity of astrocyte subtypes in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eugenín León et al., 2016</xref>) and of neuronal subtypes associated with individual astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perea and Araque, 2005</xref>) further challenge the precise identification of activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in these cells. Finally, the extent to which IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling reflects all of the effects of activity-induced Gq GPCR activation remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agulhon et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>TPSCs, by contrast, are only associated with the nerve terminals of cholinergic motor neurons (MNs). The NMJ is large and amenable to optical analysis owing to its discrete location at the central endplate band region of muscle. TPSCs do not elaborate extensive processes or make specialized contacts with the microcirculation. Together, these features make the TPSC suitable for the genetic manipulation of their response to and regulation of neural activity. However, the examination of activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in TPSCs and the functional effects of these responses have been largely conducted by imaging individual TPSCs injected with fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darabid et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, whether the effects of single TPSC manipulation on individual synapses lead to global effects on neuromuscular function cannot be examined.</p><p>Using mice that express the genetically-encoded calcium indicator GCaMP3 in all Schwann cells including TPSCs, we observed that high-frequency, motor nerve stimulation-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within TPSCs of the neonatal diaphragm was completely abolished in the absence of the purinergic 2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor (P2Y<sub>1</sub>R). We therefore utilized <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutant mice lacking these receptors as a model to investigate the functional effects of activity-induced, Gq GPCR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in TPSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in populations of TPSCs in Wnt1-GCaMP3 mice</title><p>In order to study the Ca<sup>2+</sup> response to neural activity in populations of TPSCs, we first evaluated transgene expression in TPSCs of the diaphragm muscle at postnatal day 7 (P7) from Wnt1-Cre, conditional GCaMP3 (Wnt1-GCaMP3) mice. Wnt1-Cre mice drive Cre-dependent transgene expression in neural crest derivatives, which include Schwann cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Danielian et al., 1998</xref>). We first assessed Wnt1-Cre mice by crossing them to mice conditionally expressing the fluorescent reporter TdTomato. Robust expression of TdTomato was observed at early ages in all Schwann cells in the diaphragm, including myelinating Schwann cells of the phrenic nerve as well as non-myelinating TPSCs at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), visualized using fluorescent α−bungarotoxin (α-BTX). We then crossed Wnt1-Cre mice to mice conditionally expressing GCaMP3, which encodes a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-conjugated calmodulin that fluoresces upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zariwala et al., 2012</xref>). In whole-mounts of P7 diaphragm muscle incubated with GFP antibodies to label GCaMP3, S100 antibodies to detect Schwann cells, and α-BTX to visualize NMJs, we observed expression of GCaMP3 in all TPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, these results show that Wnt1-Cre drives robust expression of GCaMP3 in TPSCs of the early postnatal diaphragm.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Wnt1-Cre drives expression of reporters and activity sensors to Schwann cells of the neonatal diaphragm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole mounts of P7 Wnt1-TdTomato diaphragm were labeled with 488-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX).

Imaging these responses before and after nerve stimulation at low magnification (20X), we observed large populations of TPSCs that responded to 45 s of 40 Hz tonic phrenic nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Higher magnification images (60X) showed that each individual TPSC, identified by labeling with fluorescent α-BTX (data not shown), responded to HFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We used stat maps of the standard deviation of fluorescence intensity (SD map) to spatially represent the distribution of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients within individual TPSCs from high-magnification videos and traces of intensity to examine their temporal characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The onset of these transients occurred 1.8 ± 0.74 s (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>c</italic> = 54) after the initiation of HFS, reached peak intensity at 2.86 ± 0.49 s after the onset of the transient, and shortly thereafter declined in amplitude (time to 50% decay = 13.35 ± 4.22 s). Most transients lasted the entire duration of the nerve stimulation period, although the intensity at the end of the stimulation period was usually less than 10% of that at the initial peak. GCaMP3-expressing TPSCs responded to multiple stimulations, providing a useful tool to measure the effects of different stimuli on the same TPSCs. Similar to a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darabid et al., 2013</xref>), the peak intensity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients observed after a subsequent 45 s bout of 40 Hz stimulation was lower than that of the first (17.3 ± 2.5 vs. 13.3 ± 1.1 dB, first vs. second stim, <italic>n</italic> = 5; p&lt;0.05). Interestingly, analyses of transients in TPSCs across large regions of the diaphragm from low-magnification videos showed substantial variability in the onset after nerve stimulation (from 0.8 s to 4.3 s). This pattern could be achieved by differential transmitter release, differential transmitter breakdown in the perisynaptic space, or differential signal transduction in TPSCs. Because individual muscle fibers across the entire diaphragm exhibit shortening at nearly the same onset after nerve stimulation (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>), this result does not appear to result from differential transmitter release.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Wnt1-GCaMP3 mice exhibit activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>responses in all perisynaptic glia cells of the neonatal diaphragm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) (Left panel) An average intensity image generated before application of a stimulus (Pre-stim) shows the overall structure of GCaMP3-expressing Schwann cell elements.

Alternatively, the lateral diffusion of nerve-derived ACh to perisynaptic TPSC-derived mAChRs may be limited by the activity of the cholinesterases acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in the synaptic cleft.

These challenge experiments were modeled on those used to characterize the effects of hypo- and hyperkalemia on skeletal muscle function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).

We next examined whether the effect of high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was caused by depolarization of the postsynaptic muscle membrane. After stimulation with several bouts of HFS in 5 mM [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, muscle cells were impaled and recorded before and after changing the [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to 10 mM.

We observed that the RMP of TPSCs depolarized in response to treatment with 10 mM KCl by an amount that was close to that predicted by the Hodgkin-Goldman-Katz equation (data not shown).

The absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling within TPSCs does not appear to affect the structural and molecular development of the NMJ, nor does it alter the presynaptic release of neurotransmitter, but rather affects the postsynaptic AP during sustained HFS, where longer, smaller APs were correlated with a failure to maintain peak muscle force. Because previous studies observed that administration of high K<sup>+</sup> induced similar effects on muscle APs subjected to fatiguing muscle stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cairns et al., 2015</xref>), we examined muscle fatigue in response to this treatment and found that it was enhanced to a greater degree in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants lacking activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling.

Nerve terminals also release ATP, which as itself or ADP stimulates in TPSCs (yellow) the release of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) from intracellular stores via P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptors (P2Y<sub>1</sub>R). This signal leads to the movement into TPSCs of perisynaptic potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), produced by both neurons and muscle cells in response to stimulation.

The onset after nerve stimulation and time to peak intensity of Ca<sup>2+-</sup> transients using this method are similar to those of published studies using Ca<sup>2+-</sup> sensitive dyes in TPSCs loaded with Fluo-3 as well as astrocytes expressing GCaMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jahromi et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reist and Smith, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Darabid et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akerboom et al., 2013</xref>), demonstrating that this genetic technique is a valid tool to measure these responses in large populations of TPSCs. The most striking finding from this study is the complete dependence of TPSC Ca<sup>2+-</sup> responses on a single GPCR, P2Y<sub>1</sub>R. Therefore, despite the fact that bath administration of a multiple substances induces widespread Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in neonatal TPSCs, activity-induced responses are only mediated by adenine nucleotides. In contrast to these results, studies of adult TPSCs support a role for ACh and other factors in mediating these responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Darabid et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, the early exclusive dependence on P2Y<sub>1</sub>R-activating adenine nucleotides may broaden over time. Alternatively, TPSCs at the NMJs of the diaphragm may continue to depend exclusively on P2Y<sub>1</sub>R signaling. At the oldest ages at which we were able to examine population responses (P15-P20), activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were completely dependent on the P2Y<sub>1</sub>R pathway, supporting this latter idea. Moreover, the prevention of ACh diffusion to perisynaptic mAChRs by cholinesterase is unlikely to represent a developmentally transient response. Indeed, a recent report described a functional role for TPSC-derived BChE at the adult NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrov et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results fail to support the idea that TPSC Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses affect the presynaptic release of ACh, in contrast to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robitaille, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Castonguay and Robitaille, 2001</xref>). NMJs at the diaphragm do exhibit dynamic changes of ACh release such as facilitation and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vautrin et al., 1993</xref>), arguing against the absence of plasticity at diaphragm NMJs as an explanation of these differences. Rather, they may be attributable to different species, muscle, age or technique. Interestingly, using a similar genetic approach to study the effect of eliminating activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes neurotransmitter release was unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agulhon et al., 2010</xref>). On the other hand, postsynaptic function was affected at the NMJ in response to HFS in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants. Whereas the number of successful muscle APs, reflecting the presynaptic release of and response to ACh, was not different in response to HFS, the characteristics of these APs changed significantly in response to prolonged nerve stimulation. These results suggest that muscle APs may not be transduced as efficiently in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutant mice. The reduced intensity of muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in response to pharmacological blockade of P2Y<sub>1</sub>Rs supports this contention, as does the enhancement of muscle fatigue in response to pharmacological or genetic inhibition of this pathway. These effects may result from the absence of P2Y<sub>1</sub>R function in muscle, as the mice used in this study were constitutive mutants. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al. (2001)</xref> found that stimulation of chick muscle fibers with 100 μM ATP triggered Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from intracellular stores, a response blocked by the pan-P2 blocker suramin. Together with the expression of P2Y<sub>1</sub>R by muscle, these findings suggest that nerve-derived ATP may modulate intracellular muscle Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and thus muscle fatigue. However, we failed to observe Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in response to ATP in the muscle cells of Myf5-GCaMP3 mice. Moreover, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in TPSCs were observed in response to treatment with lower doses of ADP/ATP (10–20 μM) than those used to evoke these signals in chick muscle cells. Finally, Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in TPSCs were blocked after P2Y<sub>1</sub>R was blocked by specific pharmacological and genetic tools, rather than the pan-P2R blocker suramin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Choi et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, we favor the idea that the reduction of muscle cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants is caused by the absence of this protein in TPSCs rather than in muscle cells.</p><p>The effects of HFS on muscle APs suggested the possibility that perisynaptic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> was dysregulated in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants. Supporting this idea, treatment with high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> enhanced muscle fatigue to a greater extent in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutant than in WT mice. Together with a report that intense exercise increases [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> in muscle to 10–14 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mohr et al., 2004</xref>), a level sufficient to cause muscle fatigue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sjøgaard, 1990</xref>); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shushakov et al., 2007</xref>), these data indicate that muscle fatigue is enhanced in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants as a result of elevated perisynaptic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, caused by a failure of TPSCs to spatially buffer or take up K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kofuji and Newman, 2004</xref>). In order to test this idea, we examined the effects of treatment with high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, reasoning that if K<sup>+</sup> uptake mechanisms in TPSCs were impaired in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants lacking activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling, these effects would be diminished. Indeed, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to 10 mM [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> were markedly reduced in these mutants, providing indirect evidence that K<sup>+</sup> uptake was impaired. Interestingly, elevation of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> to 20 mM also induced a robust increase of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cultured astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duffy and MacVicar, 1994</xref>). However, in contrast to the current study, this response was mediated entirely by external influx through voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (VGCC). Therefore, K<sup>+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in TPSCs do not appear to result from depolarization-mediated ingress through VGCC, but rather by the release from intracellular stores. Together, these data suggest that activity stimulates perisynaptic K<sup>+</sup> uptake in TPSCs by both feedforward Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses initiated by neurotransmitter and feedback signals initiated by high [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> itself.</p><p>The intracellular uptake of K<sup>+</sup> has been demonstrated in Müller glia in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Newman et al., 1984</xref>) as well as in other glial subtypes and may be mediated by several mechanisms, including inwardly-rectifying potassium channels (Kir), Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPases, and Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporters. The importance of perisynaptic K<sup>+</sup> regulation by glial cells has been demonstrated by several genetic studies. For example, mice lacking Kir4.1 in astrocytes exhibit impaired K<sup>+</sup> and neurotransmitter uptake, leading to seizures, ataxia and early lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Djukic et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al. (2012b)</xref> observed that activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in astrocytes are required for K<sup>+</sup> uptake through an ouabain-sensitive Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup> ATPase activity. Future studies will determine which if any inward K<sup>+</sup> conductance is expressed in and stimulated by activity within TPSCs, as well as the mechanisms by which increases of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> lead to enhanced K<sup>+</sup> uptake. Of note, it has been established that nonmyelinating Schwann cells in sympathetic nerves possess Kir currents that are sensitive to neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Konishi, 1994</xref>).</p><p>In addition to [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, the extracellular concentrations of other ions are dysregulated during muscle fatigue, including [Na<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and [H<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2008</xref>). Because astrocytes express an abundance of transporters and ion channels that modulate the levels of these ions in response to neuronal activity, TPSCs may similarly regulate these ions in response to stimulation of muscle, in addition to [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. On the other hand, muscle itself is equipped for this role, expressing an abundance of ion channels and transporters along the extensive t-tubule system that regulate muscle membrane potential and excitability during activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fraser et al., 2011</xref>). However, the importance of ionic homeostasis at the NMJ may depend on additional mechanisms, such as those proposed here. For example, the sensitivity of Na<sub>v</sub>1.4, which is expressed at high levels in a restricted region in the depths of the postsynaptic junctional folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stocksley et al., 2005</xref>), to the inactivating effects of depolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cannon, 2015</xref>), may require enriched expression of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> buffering proteins by TPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

We found that in the absence of purinergic signaling, postsynaptic rather than presynaptic function was altered, leading to enhanced muscle fatigue in response to HFS. These effects were correlated with elevated [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> and reduced responsivity to [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>, suggesting that activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in TPSCs regulate perisynaptic [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o.</sub> Future studies will determine the mechanisms underlying K<sup>+</sup> uptake and [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> accumulation in TPSCs.

Image sequences were recorded at 25 frames per second, and were exported as 8-bit TIFF files into custom-written software (Volumetry G8d; logic underlying methods in Source code file 1). A Gauss filter (3 × 3 pixel, sd = 1.0) was applied to reduce camera noise, and motion-correction routines were used to stabilize neural and Schwann cell elements in the movie (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hennig et al., 2015</xref>). Changes in background fluorescence were stabilized by subtracting the average intensity near the main phrenic nerve branch. An average intensity image was generated before stimulus application (‘Pre-stim’ ~1 s) to quantify basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in Schwann cells. These images are presented using a blue-&gt;green color lookup table (CLUT). This image was subtracted from the entire movie, thereby filtering out static fluorescent structures and displaying only objects that changed their intensity, i.e., Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients. A number of statistical maps (stat maps) were used to portray and analyze the pattern of activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in TPSCs. The main stat map type used to portray the amplitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in TPSCs was the standard deviation (SD) map. This map was calculated in similar fashion to the average intensity image, except the standard deviation of 16-bit fluorescence intensity units (SD iu<sub>16</sub>) at every pixel prior to the application of the stimulus (0.5–1.0 s) extending to 60 s was calculated. Intensity SD projections (SD iu<sub>16</sub>) were used to portray changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced fluorescence as they are more descriptive of the overall changes in intensity during the recording; average intensity projections (iu<sub>16</sub>) can be somewhat misleading depending on how much of the ‘non-active’ time before and after an event is included in the average. Intensity averages also don’t describe how much the signal fluctuates. Per pixel maximum or maximum-minimum calculations can also be misleading as they include the maximum noise amplitude and/or artifacts (i.e., shot noise). SD remedies these issues, as it describes intensity fluctuations (noise or event) in standardized units and it is less sensitive to the time periods chosen to perform the projection/s. Overall, this approach isolates actively fluorescing structures more clearly than other types of projections. SD maps were color coded using a ‘Fire’ CLUT.</p><p>Traces of fluorescence intensity were generated from movies and presented as changes in fluorescence with respect to initial fluorescence (ΔF/F<sub>avg(prestim)</sub> or ΔF/F<sub>o</sub>). Peak intensities of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients were calculated as a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in which peak standard deviation values were divided by the prestim standard deviation value. The log<sub>10</sub> of this ratio was generated and multiplied by 20 to standardize the SNR as decibels (dB). Decibels (signal-to-noise) are commonly used in signal transduction to describe the strength of a signal in terms of its ‘resolvability’ above background. This approach allows one to definitively characterize signals in terms of the ‘noise’ in the surrounding environment. We have begun using imaging decibels to more accurately portray Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in relation to the surrounding environment - which essentially relates the peak amplitude of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> event to the standard deviation of the signal before the event (on a log scale). For more information on the logic flow underlying these routines, see source code file entitled, ‘Image Analysis.’</p><p>Drugs were either bath applied in proximity to the motor endplate or pressure injected (PDES-O2DX; NPI Electronic). Drugs dissolved in DMSO were either perfused in or diluted in 1 mL of Kreb’s-Ringer’s before bath application, as bath application of small volumes of DMSO (~8 μl into 8 ml chamber) caused fluorescence within Wnt1-GCaMP3-expressing TPSCs. For experiments with altered potassium, a stock solution of 3M [KCl] was added to the bath to change the concentration from 5 mM to 10 mM immediately prior to imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Diaphragms were dissected and pinned on a 6 cm Sylgard-coated dish containing oxygenated Krebs-Ringer’s solution at RT according to standard procedure.

Briefly muscle APs were recorded after treatment with 100 μM BHC for 30 min, followed by 30 min of washing.

Signals were amplified, digitized, recorded and analyzed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Heredia et al., 2016</xref>). The temporal dynamics of EPPs (rise to peak; time to 50% decay) were recorded as gross approximations of endplate current (EPC) kinetics changes, as has been done previously in the presence or absence of cholinesterase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fatt and Katz, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beránek and Vyskocil, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kuba and Tomita, 1971</xref>). Only muscle fibers with resting membrane potentials between −60 and −75 mV were included for analysis. Stimulation episodes of the phrenic nerve over 10 Hz were separated by 30 min rest periods to allow recovery. In order to calculate percent failure (APs) or percent transmitter release rundown (EPPs), the average of three potentials at a particular timepoint (e.g., the time at which fewer than half of nerve stimuli produced a successful muscle AP) was taken and expressed as a percent of the average of the first three potentials. For experiments with altered KCl, NaCl was adjusted accordingly to maintain the same Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration before being perfused into the dish. For recording of whole cell membrane potential, diaphragms from Wnt1-GCaMP3 mice were treated with 10 mg/ml collagenase for 30 min at 37°C. TPSCs near the surface were identified by green fluorescent GCaMP3 signal in somatic cytosol, located adjacent to red fluorescent α-BTX-stained endplates. Whole cell recording configuration was achieved using 2 μm borosilicate pipettes pulled to 5–7 mΩ tip resistance. Whole cell access was 8–20 mΩ, and leak current was &lt;-50 pA when voltage-clamped at −60 mV command potential. Pipette internal solution contained (in mM): 97.5 K-gluconate, 32.5 KCl, 40 HEPES, 12 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 MgATP, 0.5 GTP, and 0.5 EGTA. Voltage recordings were made using current-clamp mode (I = 0) on a HEKA EPC 10 amplifier controlled by Patchmaster software. Current injection steps of 100 ms duration were given in increments between −200 to +700 pA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Wesley Thompson (Reviewer #1); Markus Schwab (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Heredia et al. have studied an important topic in glial cell biology, the role of terminal/perisynaptic Schwann cells (TPSCs) at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in the control of motor functions. Specifically, the authors investigated a preparation of the diaphragm muscle (which includes the phrenic nerve) from neonatal transgenic mice that express a genetically encoded Ca-sensor TPSCs, and in TPSCs lacking the purinergic P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor. The authors carefully quantify the Ca responses and show the stimulus frequencies that elicit them and the temporal characteristics of the signals. Major conclusion of the paper are (1) nerve activity-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in neonatal TPSCs is mediated by neuronal adenine nucleotide-mediated stimulation of P2Y<sub>1</sub>R, which is nevertheless dispensable for normal development and for synapse elimination; and (2) Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in TPSCs modulates the transduction of muscle action potentials and thereby adds to muscle fatigue. The authors provide evidence that the latter is not synaptic but rather relates to the ability of muscle cells to generate action potentials, possibly reflecting the perisynaptic potassium concentration. This study significantly adds to our knowledge about TPSC functions in motor control and provides a conceptual framework for subsequent studies on the mechanisms of glial Ca-signaling at the NMJ.</p><p>Towards the end of the Results section, the paper becomes somewhat hard to follow and should be better explained, e.g. the potassium buffering idea. The authors should also deal with the following:</p><p>1) There is no direct measurement of potassium uptake by TPSCs shown (or the measurement of perisynaptic K<sup>+</sup> by K<sup>+</sup>-sensitive electrodes). The most direct measurement could be the difference between the anticipated membrane potential of the glia – given a change in potassium concentration – and the actual measured membrane potential. There is also no obvious connection between external potassium manipulations and the calcium release inside the glia. Do potassium manipulations produce the glial potassium responses in the absence of nerve stimulation?</p><p>2) The calculation of the &quot;rise to peak&quot; or &quot;time to 50% decay&quot; is not appropriate for EPPs or mEPPs because of the cell's capacitance. Can the respective current responses be measured in a voltage-clamp procedure?</p><p>3) It is unclear how the TPSCs located at the synapse can affect the fatigue of the entire muscle fiber. If the presumed effect is on the portion of the muscle fiber under the synapse (and perhaps the transmission of action potentials from this region of the fiber to the rest of the fiber) this should be discussed. The authors should also address the question over what length of fiber the altered perisynaptic potassium can be effective in changing action potentials of the entire fiber.</p><p>4) Revision of Figures:</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: are the sensory axons of the phrenic nerve recombined in Wnt-Cre mice (i.e. tdtomato+)?

In these TTX-treated preps, treatment with potassium still produced calcium responses in TPSCs. Therefore, the calcium responses were not likely to be caused indirectly by potassium-mediated nerve activation, followed by nerve-derived, ATP-mediated P2Y<sub>1</sub>R activation on TPSCs. Additionally, potassium triggered TPSC calcium responses in P2Y<sub>1</sub>R mutants, in which nerve stimulation itself failed to elicit calcium responses. This result also suggests that the TPSC calcium response to potassium is not indirectly caused by an effect of potassium on the nerve, followed by nerve-derived ATP-mediated P2Y<sub>1</sub>R activation on TPSCs.</p><p>Second to last question: We do not know the mechanism by which potassium triggers calcium responses in TPSCs, other than that it is not caused by external calcium, but rather by release from internal stores. We do have new information that potassium depolarizes TPSCs (see directly below). Therefore, TPCSs, similar to neurons (Ryglewski et al., PLoS Biol, 2007 5(4):e66), may possess a membrane voltage sensor that activates metabotropic signaling pathways leading to intracellular calcium release.</p><p>First question: With the help of Robert Renden, a colleague in the department who specializes in the recording of whole cell potentials and currents in tissue slices, we tested whether TPSCs exhibited a response to external potassium ([K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.) by obtaining whole cell voltage recordings of perisynaptic/terminal Schwann cells (TPSCs) from P6-P7 diaphragm muscle derived from <italic>Wnt1-GCaMP3</italic> mice. After treatment of the muscle with 10mg/ml collagenase for 30 minutes at 37 <sup>0</sup>C, TPSCs near the surface were identified by green fluorescent GCaMP3 signal in somatic cytosol, located adjacent to red fluorescent a-BTX-stained endplates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Whole cell recording configuration was achieved using 2-mm borosilicate pipettes pulled to 5-7 mΩ tip resistance. Whole cell access was 8-20 mΩ, and leak current was &lt;-50 pA when voltage-clamped at -60 mV command potential. Pipette internal solution contained (in mM): 97.5 K-gluconate, 32.5 KCl, 40 HEPES, 12 Na-phosphocreatine, 2 MgATP, 0.5 GTP, and 0.5 EGTA. Voltage recordings were made using current-clamp mode (I=0) on a HEKA EPC 10 amplifier controlled by Patchmaster software.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.044</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30839-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Current injection steps of 100 ms duration were given in increments between -200 to +700 pA (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>). No spiking or voltage-dependent conductance was observed in two cells, while a single small spike (&lt;-20 mV peak) was observed in one cell. Depolarization due to +100 pA current injections was used to calculate input resistance (R=dV/dI) at 0.171 ± 0.025 mΩ. Resting membrane potential was between -42 and -30 mV (-36.6 ± 5.7mV), after correcting for 9mV liquid junction potential. [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. was then altered by superfusion of bath solution from 5 to 10 mM KCl to determine if a potassium conductance existed in these cells at resting membrane potential. Hodgkin-Goldman-Katz (HGK) equation predicted changes of +4.59 mV between 5 and 10 mM KCl, in these recording conditions. Our observed changes were +4.53+ ± 0.37 mV shift in three cells. In summary:</p><p>- No spiking</p><p>- Low input resistance</p><p>- Closely predicted change, according to HGK equation, of resting membrane potential in response to changes of [K<sup>+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.045</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30839-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>These results suggest that two of the three cells recorded from shared characteristics with central perisynaptic glial cells, and contained a potassium-permeable channel, at rest. The identity of the third cell is unknown, but showed nonlinearity in input resistance, a small voltage-dependent spike, and less negative resting membrane potential.</p><p>We think based on their preliminary nature, together with the fact that this represents the first analysis of whole cell currents of TPSCs that we are aware of, that these data are best included as data not shown. We have included the data as such, but have included a description of the methods in the appropriate sub-section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The calculation of the &quot;rise to peak&quot; or &quot;time to 50% decay&quot; is not appropriate for EPPs or mEPPs because of the cell's capacitance. Can the respective current responses be measured in a voltage-clamp procedure?</p></disp-quote><p>While we were aware that the EPC is faster than the EPP based on seminal contributions of Takeuchi and Takeuchi (1959), and that EPC kinetics change based on the changing potential during the EPP (Magleby and Stevens, 1972) we were still under the impression that a comparison of EPP/mEPP kinetics between two genotypes not shown/presumed to exhibit different muscle membrane capacitance was valid. The literature appears full of examples of such comparisons (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al; J Neurosci, 2015 35(4):1606-16; Yang et al., Neuroscience, 2007 149(4): 768–778, etc.) including those studying the function of TPSC Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling (Castonguay and Robitaille J Neurosci., 2001 21(6):1911-22). Of particular relevance to our manuscript, Fatt and Katz (J Physiol, 1951 115(3):320-70.); Beránek and Vyskocil (J Physiol 1968 195(2):493-503) and Kuba and Tomita (J Physiol 1971 213(3): 533–544) as well as others showed a lengthening of the decay of the EPP in response to AChE inhibitors, while many others have demonstrated similar effects examining EPCs. However, we concede that we have not empirically demonstrated that <italic>P2ry1</italic> wild-type and mutant muscle membrane capacitance is not different.</p><p>Our major goal was to determine the amplitude of the EPP in <italic>P2ry1</italic> wild-type and mutants at the beginning and end of high-frequency trains. Thus, while an analysis of the kinetics of membrane currents from muscle endplates is possible and would better support the lack of functional AChE involvement at the <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutant NMJ than the temporal kinetics of EPPs/mEPPs, we do not feel that such data would sufficiently enhance the main findings of our manuscript.Accordingly, if the reviewers wish, we will remove the rise-to-peak and time-to-decay data of the mEPPs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is unclear how the TPSCs located at the synapse can affect the fatigue of the entire muscle fiber. If the presumed effect is on the portion of the muscle fiber under the synapse (and perhaps the transmission of action potentials from this region of the fiber to the rest of the fiber) this should be discussed. The authors should also address the question over what length of fiber the altered perisynaptic potassium can be effective in changing action potentials of the entire fiber.</p></disp-quote><p>First item for discussion: This was discussed in the original version of the manuscript. However, we felt that additional experiments could help further shed light as to whether the enhanced fatigue we observed in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants was mediated by perisynaptic events or by events along the entire muscle fiber. We reasoned that if direct muscle stimulation caused a similarly enhanced muscle fatigue in <italic>P2ry1</italic> mutants, then this would fail to support the idea that perisynaptic dysfunction, such as the failure to maintain potassium ionic homeostasis, was responsible for the effects on nerve stimulation-induced fatigue. We performed these experiments in muscle strips at P15, because we were unable to place the field stimulation electrodes at the appropriate positions to reproducibly cause fatigue in whole diaphragms at P7, similar to the setup used to produce fatigue in response to nerve stimulation. Moreover, we had performed nerve stimulation-induced fatigue in diaphragm strips at P15 and found an effect similar to that observed in P7 whole diaphragm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). When we performed these experiments, we found that peak force and fatigue were not statistically different between <italic>P2ry1</italic> WT and mutant mice (peak force, 283.3<underline>+</underline>19.3 vs. 277<underline>+</underline>10.7 mN, <italic>P2ry1</italic> WT vs. mutant; <italic>p</italic>=0.32; ending vs. peak force, 93.2+2.1% vs.89.6+5.8%, <italic>P2ry1</italic> WT vs. mutant; <italic>p</italic>=0.19; <italic>n</italic>=3; see representative example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>). In the revised manuscript, we added 2 sentences describing these experiments and described them as “data not shown.” We also added “the perisynaptic region of” in front of muscle fibers in the following sentence, in order to highlight this conceptual point of the finding. We also added a sentence in the Discussion that utilizes this data to support the idea that the fatigue-enhancing effects of high potassium are more likely to be caused by perisynaptic events rather than events along the entire fiber. Finally, we added a line about direct muscle stimulation in the Materials and methods.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30839.046</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30839-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>Second item for discussion: The direct stimulation experiments argue against the idea that calcium signaling within TPSCs regulates the effects of potassium on muscle APs far outside the perisynaptic region. One way to measure the precise distance away from the endplate that is affected would be to record muscle APs at variable distances from this synaptic region during the latter stages of high-frequency nerve stimulation in <italic>P2ry1</italic> WT and mutant diaphragm. Muscle APs recorded in this manuscript were generated from synaptically positioned intracellular electrodes (e.g., in which the rise times of mEPPs were under 0.2 ms). We feel that while such an experiment is valid and would help address the precise distance away from the motor endplate that these effects could be achieved, that it is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Revision of Figures:</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: are the sensory axons of the phrenic nerve recombined in Wnt-Cre mice (i.e. tdtomato+)?
