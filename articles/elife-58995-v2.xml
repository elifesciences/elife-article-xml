unique pH-sensitive hemoglobins that allow O<sub>2</sub> to be delivered to the retina at PO<sub>2</sub>s more than ten-fold that of arterial blood (Damsgaard et al., 2019). Here, we show strong evidence that vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase in the vascular structure supplying the retina act together to acidify the red blood cell leading to O<sub>2</sub> secretion. In vivo data indicate that this pathway primarily affects the oxygenation of the inner retina involved in signal processing and transduction, and that the evolution of this pathway was tightly associated with the morphological expansion of the inner retina. We conclude that this mechanism for retinal oxygenation played a vital role in the adaptive evolution of vision in teleost fishes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rainbow trout</kwd><kwd>carbon dioxide</kwd><kwd>carbonic anhydrase</kwd><kwd>proton pump</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>vision</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF16-0713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damsgaard</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF17-0195</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damsgaard</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF18-0658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Damsgaard</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002808</institution-id><institution>Carlsbergfondet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CF17-0778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauridsen</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 1754994</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tresguerres</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kwan</surname><given-names>Garfield T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008397</institution-id><institution>Velux Fonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lauridsen</surname><given-names>Henrik</given-names></name><name><surname>Thomsen</surname><given-names>Jesper S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018-04172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brauner</surname><given-names>Colin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The study design, data collection, and interpretation were not influenced by any funders.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel mode of oxygen delivery facilitated the adaptive evolution of vision in teleost fishes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The retina of vertebrates, containing the light-sensitive photoreceptors required for visual perception, has a very high metabolic rate that must be supported by an adequate supply of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linsenmeier and Braun, 1992</xref>). To support such a high O<sub>2</sub> demand, most tissues possess a dense network of capillaries that minimize diffusion distances, facilitating the transfer of O<sub>2</sub> from the red blood cells (RBCs) to the respiring mitochondria. However, pigmented RBCs in capillaries on the vitreous side of the retina scatter incoming light and absorb photons before they reach the photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttery et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chase, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu and Cringle, 2001</xref>). The result may be an impairment of visual acuity, which may explain why only the choroidal vessels lining the back of the retina (also called the choriocapillaris) perfuse the retinae of most vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for retinal anatomy). The combination of a high O<sub>2</sub> demand and limited O<sub>2</sub> diffusion associated with this anatomical arrangement introduces a tradeoff between retinal O<sub>2</sub> supply and visual performance common to all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, any evolutionary increase in retinal thickness to support longer photoreceptors for improved light sensitivity, more ganglion cells for improved visual acuity, and more synaptic connections for improved visual processing would limit O<sub>2</sub> flux due to the larger diffusion distance, necessitating compensatory mechanisms that ensure O<sub>2</sub> delivery by either decreasing diffusion distance or increasing the O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure (PO<sub>2</sub>) gradient; the driving force for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellhorn, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttery et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chase, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2009</xref>). Some vertebrates that evolved a thick retina, did so by lining the retina's inner (i.e. light facing) side with a high capillary density to halve the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion distance and thus promote O<sub>2</sub> delivery, while some mammals and a few teleosts have capillaries inside the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>). In stark contrast, some teleost fishes evolved a unique solution to ensure sufficient O<sub>2</sub> delivery to their thick retina despite a complete lack of internal capillaries by using an exceptional system for O<sub>2</sub> supply, which delivers O<sub>2</sub> at a PO<sub>2</sub> far above that of the arterial blood (henceforth: O<sub>2</sub> secretion). A similar O<sub>2</sub> secretion mechanism was initially described in the teleost swim bladder, where blood acidification in the capillaries drives O<sub>2</sub> from hemoglobin (Hb) into the swim bladder lumen in order to regulate buoyancy against high hydrostatic pressures at depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenbrink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Steen, 1963a</xref>). Later, O<sub>2</sub> secretion was also described in the teleost retina, where blood PO<sub>2</sub> can increase from around 85 mmHg in the central arteries to beyond 1300 mmHg in the retina of some fish species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Randall and Cameron, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wittenberg and Wittenberg, 1962</xref>). Oxygenated blood is supplied to the retina from the pseudobranch that drains into a counter-current rete (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barnett, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Copeland, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Müller, 1841</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walls, 1942</xref>), the choroid rete mirabile, which allows the high PO<sub>2</sub> to be magnified and localized behind the retina by permitting diffusion of O<sub>2</sub> from the venous to the arterial side of the rete. The evolutionary innovation of the choroid rete provided a high O<sub>2</sub> flux to the thick fish retina without obstructing the optical path. It likely enabled an increase in visual performance that may have facilitated niche expansions and novel feeding types and may have contributed to the explosive adaptive radiation of the teleosts, that today, represent half of all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenbrink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Randall et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retinal micro-anatomy and oxygen distribution in the retina of rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>) (<bold>A</bold>) and white sturgeon (<italic>Acipenser transmontanus</italic>) (<bold>B</bold>).</title><p>Histology indicates a thick retina and presence of a choroid rete mirabile in the rainbow trout and a thin retina and absence of a choroid rete mirabile in the white sturgeon.

Thus, reductions in RBC pH lead to a significant right-shift of the O<sub>2</sub> equilibrium curve and, consequently, a pronounced increase in blood PO<sub>2</sub>. However, the specific mechanisms responsible for acidifying the blood reaching the eye has remained largely elusive. While the pseudobranch slightly acidifies the blood before it reaches the eye, this acidification is not sufficient to activate the Root effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bridges et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kern et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waser and Heisler, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Waser and Heisler, 2004</xref>), as otherwise, this would lead to a maladaptive loss of O<sub>2</sub> to the surrounding water. Thus, an additional source of H<sup>+</sup>-secretion of the blood draining the pseudobranch is required to activate the Root effect and induce retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion. We propose that a key candidate for excreting H<sup>+</sup>s from the endothelial cells into the lumen is the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (VHA). This multi-subunit enzyme uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to transport H<sup>+</sup> across biological membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tresguerres, 2016</xref>). VHA is expressed in cells within the pseudobranch and the swimbladder gas-gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boesch et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kern et al., 2002</xref>). However, H<sup>+</sup>s do not rapidly cross the red blood cell membrane and must be combined with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> to form CO<sub>2</sub> (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> dehydration) that readily diffuses across the RBC membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brauner et al., 2019</xref>). This dehydration reaction is slow relative to rates of blood capillary transit, so we also propose that a catalytic plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (paCA) is required to take advantage of VHA H<sup>+</sup>-excretion for RBC acidification. Once CO<sub>2</sub> is within the RBC, it must rapidly be converted into H<sup>+</sup> by a RBC CA to activate the Root effect, as the vast majority of teleost Hbs are insensitive to direct CO<sub>2</sub>-binding and respond solely to changes in RBC pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Damsgaard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weber and Fago, 2004</xref>). Thus, the first aim of this study was to determine whether the choroid rete mirabile is a H<sup>+</sup>-secreting gland that can enhance retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion in teleosts, and more specifically, whether this process relies on the combined action of paCA and VHA in the rete blood vessels.</p><p>Retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion appears highly beneficial, as it magnifies the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion gradient and permitted the evolution of a thicker retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>). However, nothing is known about how this superior mode of O<sub>2</sub> delivery affected the function and evolution of the different retinal segments, which can shed insight into the co-evolutionary interactions between retinal O<sub>2</sub> delivery and specific visual modalities. The photoreceptor layer (PEPRL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AB</xref>) constituting the outer retina lie directly adjacent to the choroid and are readily supplied with O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walls, 1942</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AB</xref> for an overview of the retinal anatomy). In contrast, the components of the inner retina are positioned more distantly to the choroid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Walls, 1942</xref>), and hence, changes in choroidal O<sub>2</sub> delivery would be expected to have profound effects on inner retinal function. Because this region includes the synaptic layers for lateral inhibition, the ganglion cells for signal integration, and the nerve fiber layer for signal transduction (ONL to NFL in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AB</xref>), visual performance could be greatly impaired by limited O<sub>2</sub> delivery. Thus, the secondary aim of this study was to assess the functional sensitivity of the inner and outer retina to changes in choroidal O<sub>2</sub> supply, by inhibiting the different components of the hypothesized oxygen secretion pathway. Moreover, to further compare those findings with the morphological evolution of the inner and outer retina during evolutionary gains and losses of retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion based on existing literature data.</p><p>We designed this study to test three hypotheses: i) that the choroid rete mirabile acidifies the blood using VHA and paCA, which act together to permit O<sub>2</sub> secretion and thus greatly augment O<sub>2</sub> supply to the retina. ii) that the functional significance of O<sub>2</sub> secretion is greatest to the inner retina, which is therefore more sensitive to changes in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> compared to the outer retina. iii) consequently, the evolutionary gains and losses of the choroid rete mirabile were associated with corresponding changes in the morphology of the inner, but not the outer, retina. To test these hypotheses, we first used immunohistochemical staining of choroid rete mirabile of rainbow trout to identify the presence and localization of VHA and paCA. Next, we measured retinal function and choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> simultaneously in an in vivo rainbow trout model during sequential inhibition of extra- and intracellular CAs, revealing both the mechanisms for retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion in the choroid rete mirabile and the effects of choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> on retinal function. Finally, we compared these functional findings to literature data on retinal morphology from multiple species to investigate whether the most PO<sub>2</sub>-sensitive parts of the retina display the most extensive morphological changes during evolutionary gains and losses of the choroid rete mirabile.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinal oxygen distribution in species with and without a choroid rete mirabile</title><p>First, we confirmed the previous descriptions of a choroid rete mirabile and high PO<sub>2</sub> in the eye of rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, Walbaum, 1792) and to compare the retinal PO<sub>2</sub> values to those of white sturgeon (<italic>Acipenser transmontanus</italic>, Richardson, 1836) that is not expected to possess a choroid rete mirabile based on the absence of this structure in other members of the genus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenbrink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>).

In addition, by studying the mechanism using various different techniques, we were able to independently verify this pathway using biochemical assays, immunohistochemistry and western blotting.

However, the role of the choroid rete mirabile and the specific mechanisms in blood acidification was poorly understood and was primarily shaped by observations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fairbanks et al., 1974</xref>. They showed that CA was present in choroid rete mirabile homogenates and hypothesized that <italic>if</italic> this CA was expressed in the venous side of the rete, and <italic>if</italic> it was also plasma-accessible, then this paCA would catalyze the hydration of CO<sub>2</sub> into H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> in the venous part of the rete, thereby facilitating the venous to arterial transport of HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> within the rete. However, this paCA-catalyzed CO<sub>2</sub> hydration in isolation appears maladaptive as it would i) buffer the H<sup>+</sup>s secreted into the blood in the pseudobranch, increasing the demands for anaerobic CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-production by the retina to fuel O<sub>2</sub> secretion, ii) prevent counter-current multiplication of CO<sub>2</sub> in the rete, and iii) lead to a pronounced efflux of H<sup>+</sup>s from the rete into the systemic circulation. In contrast to this previous framework for choroid rete mirabile function, our data strongly support an active H<sup>+</sup>-secretory role of the choroid rete mirabile by identifying a VHA lining the endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A co-localized paCA in the choroid rete mirabile dehydrates H<sup>+</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> into CO<sub>2</sub> that can diffuse into the RBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The presence of plasma-accessible CA4 is critical for this last step, as fish plasma has no carbonic anhydrase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Henry et al., 1997</xref>).

This pathway is very significant for O<sub>2</sub> secretion, as inhibition of paCA with C18 resulted in a 60% reduction in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub>. Thus, our data suggest that blood supplied from the pseudobranch is actively acidified within the choroid rete mirabile to activate the Root effect before the blood reaches the retina. This pathway does not contradict pseudobranchial H<sup>+</sup>-secretion, as proposed earlier, but instead indicates that the two tissues may act in concert to actively augment O<sub>2</sub> unloading from Hb within the rete.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>A proposed pathway for oxygen secretion in the choroid rete mirabile of teleost fishes.</title><p>Endothelial H<sup>+</sup>-secretion by vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (VHA, green) drives CO<sub>2</sub> production facilitated by a plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase (CA4, blue).

These data indicate that photoreceptor function was only affected by retinal hypoxemia when choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> fell below normal arterial levels. In contrast, the b-wave amplitude showed higher sensitivity to a reduction in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting a more pronounced dependence of the inner retinal layers to the mechanism of O<sub>2</sub> secretion by the choroid rete. These results show a tremendous sensitivity of the retina to reductions in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> where retinal hypoxemia likely impairs the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria followed by the inability to maintain the transmembrane ionic gradients required for phototransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bickler and Buck, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutilier and St-Pierre, 2000</xref>). These differences in sensitivity of the inner and outer retina to reductions in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> possibly stems from their different positions relative to the O<sub>2</sub> supply from the choroid rete: The photoreceptors comprising the outer retina lie directly adjacent to the choroid and experience the highest part of the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion gradient and are therefore less sensitive to reductions in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub>. However, the synaptic layers comprising the inner retina are positioned further from the choroid and are, therefore, much more affected by reductions in choroidal PO<sub>2</sub>. These results suggest that any phenotypic changes in the capacity to deliver O<sub>2</sub> at a high PO<sub>2</sub> in the retina have the most pronounced effects on the function of the inner retina. Such phenotypic changes may include ontogenetic changes in the expression of Hb isoforms with altered Root effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bianchini, 2012</xref>), an ATP-mediated reduction in the Root effect during hypoxia acclimation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weber and Lykkeboe, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wood and Johansen, 1972</xref>), and an arterial desaturation during hypoxia or exercise making a smaller O<sub>2</sub> concentration available for O<sub>2</sub> secretion. Assessing the interactions between vision and environmental stressors that affect blood O<sub>2</sub> transport may provide novel insight into the respiratory mechanisms that affect fishes' visual performance.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The choroid rete mirabile and the evolution of retinal functional morphology</title><p>Our in vivo identification of a higher PO<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of the inner- versus the outer retina suggests that any evolutionary change that increases choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> may act to offset an O<sub>2</sub> diffusion limitation on inner retinal O<sub>2</sub> supply and, thus, be a pre-requisite for the evolutionary expansion of the inner retina. Our interspecific comparison of retinal morphology in species with and without a choroid rete mirabile strongly supports this idea. Taken together, our in vivo and phylogenetic data independently suggests that the O<sub>2</sub> diffusion limitation to retinal thickness proposed in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buttery et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chase, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Country, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yu and Cringle, 2001</xref>) is mainly attributed to an O<sub>2</sub> constraint on the inner retinal morphology. A thicker inner retina can house more synaptic connections for intra-retinal detection of motion, changes in brightness, and contrast generation in the inner plexiform layer before visual information is relayed via the ganglion cells to the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rodieck, 1998</xref>). Thus, our findings imply that the origin of retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion around 270 million years ago in a common teleost ancestor was associated with improved visual processing, which may have facilitated novel feeding strategies involving visual prey identification and tracking. Further, multiple groups have secondarily lost the O<sub>2</sub> secretory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenbrink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>), which correspondingly suggest, that these groups have reduced capacities for visual processing.</p><p>Our retinal PO<sub>2</sub>-values in white sturgeon and rainbow trout are consistent with expected values in the retina of species with and without a choroid rete mirabile, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wittenberg and Wittenberg, 1962</xref>).

However, the 10-fold higher choroidal PO<sub>2</sub> associated with the presence of a choroid rete mirabile was not associated with a proportional difference in retinal thickness between trout and sturgeon. Instead, the slope of the PO<sub>2</sub> profile was 6.2-fold higher in trout compared to sturgeon, which equals a proportionally higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate in the trout retina than the sturgeon retina (assuming equal diffusive capacity for O<sub>2</sub> in the retinae of the two species). Despite depending on two species only, this data set strongly suggests that the origin of O<sub>2</sub> secretion permitted not only the evolution of a thicker retina, but also the evolution of much higher metabolic rates of the retina. Increased retinal thickness is typically associated with a higher area density of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeffery and Williams, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Potier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Querubin et al., 2009</xref>), which may explain the higher O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate, and which may provide an additional advantage to vision in terms on increased spatial resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Damsgaard et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Summary</title><p>The choroid rete mirabile in the eye of teleost fishes allows for the generation of exceptionally high PO<sub>2</sub>s in the retina and permitted the functional evolution of some of the most extreme retinal phenotypes among vertebrates with substantial expansions in the retinal layers associated with visual processing. Our identification of the VHA-paCA pathway for blood acidification to facilitate retinal O<sub>2</sub> secretion represents a novel physiological function of the choroid rete mirabile in addition to counter-current gas-exchange, which together permit greatly enhanced O<sub>2</sub> delivery to the retina. Our data further suggest that the origin of O<sub>2</sub> secretion not only permitted the evolution of a thicker retina, but also added fuel to the metabolic fire to visual perception. These significant advantages to vision possibly allowed teleost fishes to explore new food resources and colonize novel environments, which may have contributed to the extraordinary adaptive radiation of the teleost fishes, which today represent half of all vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berenbrink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Randall et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal housing</title><p>Rainbow trout (<italic>Oncorhynchus mykiss</italic>, Walbaum, 1792) and white sturgeon (<italic>Acipenser transmontanus</italic>, Richardson, 1836) were purchased as juveniles from Miracle Springs Inc (Mission, BC) and gifted from Vancouver Island University (Nanaimo, BC), respectively.

Dr. Michael Country further pointed out that he had long discussions with you about future collaboration in the topic, but judged that he would be able to give an unbiased review.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. As one reviewer stated: &quot;There are sufficient data at present for a publication without extra experiments being carried out although reference to future work directions could be made&quot;. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Damsgaard et al. demonstrate that the choroid rete mirabile in the teleost eye contains V-type proton-pump and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase, which greatly enhances oxygenation of the retina when Root effect Hb is present. The results suggest that this mechanism has been important to enable inner retina to become thicker thus increasing visual acuity.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the manuscript has many new findings, definitive proof of the claims would have required (i) that the intracapillary pH and PCO<sub>2</sub> were measured and (ii) that it had been shown that inhibition of the proton pump affected the choroid Po<sub>2</sub>. While it is acceptable that these measurements could not be done, their need should be stated in a future perspectives paragraph in the end of the Discussion. Because the involvement of proton pump in acidifying is not definitively shown, such involvement should be presented as intriguing and supported hypothesis, not a conclusive fact.</p><p>2) The existence of a metabolon between VHA and paCA is also a reasonable hypothesis that is worth proposing and discussing, but the authors should avoid definitive statements that one exists (of which there are many: Abstract, Results and Discussion) because the study has not provided convincing evidence for one. In order to be considered a metabolon, the two proteins would need to be shown to be in very close proximity to allow for substrate channeling. The data only show that both proteins can be found on the apical side of endothelial cells in the choroid rete. The proteins were separately identified in this general location, and they were not shown to be co-localized.</p><p>3) Do the authors have a trace of impaired ERG performance in low O2, for Figure 5?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58995.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the manuscript has many new findings, definitive proof of the claims would have required (i) that the intracapillary pH and PCO<sub>2</sub> were measured and (ii) that it had been shown that inhibition of the proton pump affected the choroid PO<sub>2</sub>.

We have included a paragraph in the section “The role of the choroid rete mirabile in localized blood acidification”, where we discuss the limitations of the study, including the lack of intracapillary pH and PCO<sub>2</sub>. Here, we also point out that pharmacological VHA inhibition in vivo is not possible due to VHA´s involvement in multiple other physiological processes. Specifically, we write on: “While the current data strongly support the functional significance of a VHA – CA4 pathway for RBC acidification in the choroid rete mirabile, measurements of pH and PCO<sub>2</sub> in the afferent and efferent vessels of the choroid rete mirabile are necessary to provide conclusive evidence of a proton secretory function of the choroid rete. […] Thus, further detailed studies on the role of VHA in acid excretion conducted ex vivo in isolated rete preparations are required.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The existence of a metabolon between VHA and paCA is also a reasonable hypothesis that is worth proposing and discussing, but the authors should avoid definitive statements that one exists (of which there are many: Abstract, Results and Discussion) because the study has not provided convincing evidence for one.

Unfortunately, the antibodies against VHA and CAIV were both raised in rabbits, which prevents co-localization studies on the same histological sections due to concerns about cross-reactivity of the secondary antibody (which is the same for the VHA and the CAIV antibodies). In response to this valid comment, we have rephrased all sentences that mention a metabolon to make it clear that we only showed that both, VHA and CAIV, are expressed on the luminal side of the choroid rete, and that they very likely are functionally linked for the purpose of red blood cell acidification (but without implying that they form a physically associated complex that mediates substrate channeling; i.e. metabolon).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Do the authors have a trace of impaired ERG performance in low O<sub>2</sub>, for Figure 5?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we have revised Figure 5 to include a ERG trace in low O<sub>2</sub>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
