Contrasting young and aged mice, spatial analysis revealed a metabolic shift in aged blastema associated with an increased bioenergetic requirement. This enhanced metabolic turnover was associated with increased hypoxia and angiogenic signaling, leading to excessive vascularization and altered regenerated bone architecture in aged mice. Administration of the metabolite oxaloacetate decreased the oxygen consumption rate of the aged blastema and increased WNT signaling, leading to enhanced in vivo bone regeneration.

While wound repair is highly conserved in all organisms, the ability to regenerate complex limb structures is limited and, in mammals, restricted to the distal one-third of the third phalangeal element (P3). This regenerative response is specific to the level of amputation: amputation of the distal one-third of the terminal phalangeal element (P3) can regenerate, whereas an amputation through the middle phalangeal element (P2) forms a hypertrophic callus of the bone. This regenerative response has been well documented in rodents, monkeys, and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bryant et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brockes and Kumar, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernando et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simkin et al., 2013</xref>). Central to this process is the dedifferentiated tissue structure called the blastema that will ultimately give rise to the regenerated structure. Regeneration follows a defined sequence, including (i) initial injury and inflammatory response (degradation and epidermal closure days 7–10), (ii) anabolic cell dedifferentiation, recruitment, and proliferation during formation of the critical blastema (day 10), and (iii) differentiation (day 14 and later) in which the bone is regenerated via direct intramembranous ossification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernando et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simkin et al., 2013</xref>). These distinct and independent phases of regeneration lead to bone produced via direct ossification and provide a controlled model to study bone regeneration within the context of aging.</p><p>Energetic demands are affected by cell type and function, local environment, and a cell’s progression along the differentiation pathway. As a result, proliferating skeletal progenitors and differentiated osteoblasts exhibit different levels and types of cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Gastel and Carmeliet, 2021</xref>). Proliferating progenitors require ATP for energy and carbon for biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>) and are highly glycolytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salazar-Noratto et al., 2020</xref>). This glycolytic dependency increases in differentiated osteoblasts due to the high metabolic demand of matrix and amino acids synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Gastel and Carmeliet, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Capulli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonewald, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). The aging process disrupts cell metabolism by decreasing NAD<sup>+</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neri and Borzì, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Song et al., 2019</xref>) and mitochondrial function and content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellantuono et al., 2009</xref>), leading to a loss of osteogenic potential. Prior research such as Seahorse analysis has allowed us to analyze mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in live cells in vitro as it relates to osteoblast function. However, a better understanding of how cell metabolism regulates gene expression during aging, and how these changes can be modulated to benefit potential regenerative strategies in the future, is needed.</p><p>Digit regeneration via direct ossification taps into an endogenous bone regrowth process that, once dissected, has the potential to be impactful in many bone disease and injury models. Significant effort has been placed on dissecting out the essential regenerative signaling pathways for their application in non-regenerative models and tissue engineering-based approaches. Up until recently, this has proven technically challenging owing to an inability to accurately interrogate the transcriptional profile of the blastema. To this end, recent papers have made use of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to generate a blastema-specific gene signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). While these published works were able to provide incredible insight into the cellular heterogeneity of the blastema, scRNAseq is unable to provide spatial context to these identified transcriptional profiles. Identifying the spatial localization of the signals that drive limb regeneration is a critical piece in discerning the mechanisms that drive limb patterning and the timing of differentiation during this multi-tissue process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bassat and Tanaka, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storer and Miller, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson and Lehoczky, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Here, for the first time, we make use of spatial transcriptomics to investigate the spatially defined transcriptional profile of the regenerating blastema. Using this approach, we generated a gene signature for the blastema with high specificity and fidelity across published transcriptomic data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). To further characterize the blastema, we utilized aging as a model of impaired regeneration. Comparative spatial analysis revealed multiple age-dependent changes in pathway activation transcripts, including changes in proliferation and cell metabolism. Hypothesizing that age-dependent impaired regeneration was a function of dysregulated cell metabolism, we sought to modulate this response using exogenous metabolites. Administration of the metabolite oxaloacetate (OAA) reversed bone thickness and volume deficits observed in aged mice. Spatial transcriptomic analysis suggests that this rescue may be mediated through increased expression of bioenergetic transcripts and WNT pathway activation. These findings suggest that cell metabolism underpins many aspects of tissue regeneration and underscores the potential of metabolite intermediates to enhance and modify regenerative capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatial transcriptomics defines the regenerating blastema</title><p>Traditionally, identifying molecular markers specific to the blastema has been difficult because of the heterogeneity of cell types present in the blastema, as well as the shared expression of previously identified markers (i.e. developmental genes such as <italic>Msx1</italic>, stem-like genes such as <italic>Cxcl12</italic>) with other dermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storer and Miller, 2020</xref>). Instead, the blastema is defined histologically within the new growing tissue area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Storer and Miller, 2020</xref>). In light of this, we amputated the distal one-third of the third phalangeal element (P3), allowed formation of the regenerative blastema (D10), then made use of spatial transcriptomics to provide a whole transcriptome characterization of the blastema as a complete structure within the context of its surrounding tissue in situ. This technique makes use of gene expression slides coated in poly-T primers and encoded with a unique spatial barcode. Fresh frozen sections are placed on a tissue optimization slide and subjected to varying times of enzymatic permeabilization to release cellular mRNA. Captured mRNA is visualized through incorporation of fluorescent nucleotides during on-slide cDNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To assess gene expression, a similar protocol is followed using pre-determined optimal digestion times. Following library preparation and sequencing, reads are aligned, and the unique spatial barcode is used to determine the spatial location of origin for each transcript, registered to the original hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This technique yielded ~4500 spatial ‘spots’ containing ~1900 unique genes (nFeature) and ~5500 unique transcripts (nCount) per spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) at a spatial resolution of 55 µm, corresponding to ~5–10 cells per spatial spot, depending on the relative location within the blastema. Spatially restricted gene expression and image registration was confirmed by using positive marker genes for the epithelium (<italic>Krt14</italic>) and bone (<italic>Bglap2</italic>), by expression of previously proposed blastema markers <italic>Pdgfra (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>) and <italic>Mest (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, although hematopoietic cells infiltrate the digit at relatively high numbers after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simkin et al., 2017</xref>), these cells are present in a more diffuse pattern, surrounded by other cell types. This resulted in minimal detection of the hematopoietic cell marker CD45 (encoded by <italic>Ptprc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Owing to the registration of transcriptomic data to histological images, spatial transcriptomics allows us to spatially define the area of the blastema relative to the rest of the digit. This allowed for the manual segmentation and identification of the blastema, boundary (spots overlaying both the blastema and surrounding connective tissue), and the remaining digit structure using morphological parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Differential gene expression was used to determine those genes showing enriched expression within the spatially defined blastema, boundary, and remaining digit regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1 supp2 supp3">Supplementary files 1-3</xref>). These results identified 829 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) enriched in the blastema, 146 of which were also enriched within the 337 boundary spot DEGs, and no overlap with the 214 DEGs identifying the remaining digit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Interestingly, pathway analysis on blastema DEGs showed enrichment in gene ontology terms linked to cellular bioenergetics, in addition to major signaling pathways such as transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ), PI3K-Akt, and MAPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional profiling of the blastema using spatial transcriptomics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative spatial gene expression of epithelial (<italic>Krt14</italic>), bone (<italic>Bglap2</italic>), blastema (<italic>Pdgfra</italic>, <italic>Mest</italic>), and hematopoietic cell (CD45, encoded by <italic>Ptprc</italic>) transcripts.

Spatial transcriptomics blastema signature genes were selected based first on the regional specificity for the blastema, then on log fold change in gene expression between the blastema and surrounding tissue, and finally for adjusted statistical significance (see Materials and methods for details). Module scoring, reflecting the average expression of a selected gene list relative to random gene list controls, and spatial localization of our blastema signature showed a high degree of specificity for the regenerating blastema and minimal labeling of the remaining digit tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Recently, two scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>) have proposed genetic signatures of the blastema from micro-dissected tissue. To validate our spatially derived blastema signature, we cross-compared our blastema signature with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>) scRNAseq-defined blastema signatures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Briefly, we used the same selection criteria that was applied to our spatial transcriptomics blastema signature, which excluded genes from cluster 8 enriching for proliferative genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), to identify a blastema gene signature from each original data set. Genes from Storer et al. were selected from category 1 identified in Table S2 of the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>), and genes from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref> were selected from fibroblast-enriched genes identified in Table S1A. All blastema signatures showed preferential enrichment, to varying extents, within our blastema region relative to other regions of the digit, further validating this spatial transcriptomics technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To determine the widespread feasibility of our spatial blastema signature to label blastema fibroblasts, we next conducted the reciprocal analysis, applying our blastema gene signature derived from spatial back to the two original sets of scRNAseq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). ScRNAseq data sets derived from Storer et al. (D10/14) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and Johnson et al. (D11) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>) were reanalyzed to generate UMAP similar to those presented within the original publications. Clusters circled in red denote fibroblast-like clusters used to define the blastema by the original authors. Module scoring confirmed the spatial transcriptomics-derived blastema gene signature had a high specificity for the blastema in both scRNAseq data sets, distinguishing the blastema fibroblasts from other cell types, and specifically excluded more mature osteogenic clusters (cluster 6 from Storer et al. data and cluster 5 from Johnson et al. data). Following validation of our blastema gene signature, we next applied reductive iterations to our spatial blastema gene list in order to identify a threshold of signature genes required to successfully label the blastema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These results demonstrate that, although no single gene was able to show efficient labeling of the entire blastema, specific labeling of the blastema could be achieved using a reduced gene list of ~5 genes (<italic>Edil3</italic>, <italic>Mmp14</italic>, <italic>Chrdl1</italic>, <italic>Ptx3,</italic> and <italic>Bmp5</italic>).

These data revealed that, while aged mice showed no difference in the timing of the histolytic event (D7), a marked delay in the transition from blastema to anabolic bone formation was observed. While new bone was observed at D14 in young mice, new bone wasn’t observed in aged mice until D21. This delay in mineralization was associated with a reduction in trabecular bone volume and thickness, and a concordant increase in trabecular spacing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To identify potential discerning pathways differentially regulated between regenerating and non-regenerating tissue, we applied spatial transcriptomic analysis in an aged mouse model. Our results show impaired digit regeneration in aged mice, associated with increased proliferation and decreased bone building, as well as differential proximal-distal patterning of glycolysis and OxPhos. These increased metabolic demands in aged mice are associated with increased intracellular hypoxia, VEGF signaling, and vascularization. Finally, we demonstrate that administration of the metabolite OAA can partially rescue this age-dependent decline in regeneration.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Age-dependent delays in regeneration</title><p>While extensive work has been conducted to characterize the blastema in multiple animal models and regenerating conditions, it was only recently that a comprehensive transcriptional profile was available for blastema fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Using scRNAseq, these studies made significant contributions to our understanding of blastema cell subtypes and their transition throughout the regenerative process. Single-cell analysis, however, is unable to provide spatial information, making it difficult to place the blastema in the context of its neighboring tissues. Spatial transcriptomics, shown here for the first time in digit regeneration, allows transcriptional insight into the histologically defined blastema in the context of its spatial position within the regenerating digit. Using this technique, we identified a blastema transcriptional profile delineating this structure in not only our own spatial data, but also within previously published scRNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). The strong correlation between these data sets suggests a high degree of conservation between spatial transcriptomic and scRNAseq data, and thus, opens up exciting new avenues for future research across platforms.</p><p>Even for highly regenerative animals like the Mexican axolotl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McCusker et al., 2015</xref>), age is associated with a decline in regenerative capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Seifert and Voss, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vieira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McCusker and Gardiner, 2011</xref>). Similarly, in humans, while regenerative capacity of the digit tips persists into adulthood, fidelity of regeneration appears to decline with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muneoka et al., 2008</xref>). We show here that age is associated with a delay in the switch from bone catabolism to bone anabolism, and that the final regenerate has significantly increased trabecular spaces, reduced volume, and overall impaired bone patterning, suggesting a defect in bone anabolism in aged mice. This delay is accompanied by increased proliferation, which may indicate that delays in bone regeneration may be linked to delays in cell cycle progression in the aged blastema. Increased proliferation in the aged blastema may also explain the increases in cell metabolism, since proliferation would require both energy and biosynthesis. Most studies agree that formation of the blastema relies on, at least in part, the dedifferentiation of terminal cells within the remaining digit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lehoczky et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rinkevich et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, proliferation is thought to play a relatively less critical role in blastema formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). While our studies are not able to determine the relative contribution of dedifferentiation to blastema formation in young and aged mice due to the lack of reliable markers, this increased proliferation may point to a potential loss of plasticity, and the subsequent loss of dedifferentiation within aged cells. Another possible explanation for the delay is that the increased intracellular hypoxia may be suppressing osteoblast differentiation, a concept demonstrated in both osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Utting et al., 2006</xref>) and in the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sammarco et al., 2014</xref>).

However, in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kurokawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Prior et al., 2014</xref>) suggest that this hypoxia may be directly driven by oxygen consumption by the electron transfer chain in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman and Nunnari, 2014</xref>) and continues to be an ongoing area of research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous and Harris, 2013</xref>). A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yao et al., 2019</xref>, confirmed this same phenomenon in bone in vivo, noting that intracellular hypoxia modulates epigenetic modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallipoli and Huntly, 2019</xref>), as well as gene and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Semenza, 2017</xref>). Functionally, Yao et al. demonstrate that the use of non-oxidative glycolysis protects hypoxic tissues from anoxia by regulating intracellular hypoxia during development. Lee et al. fortify this finding by showing that reduced oxygen consumption is a hallmark of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Guided by our results, and in concert with these published findings, we propose that upregulation of OxPhos during skeletal regeneration in aged mice facilitates hypoxia-driven vasculature that ultimately disrupts bone architecture.</p><p>Bioenergetics were some of the major pathways altered during aging regeneration. Our spatial transcriptomic data and Seahorse data show increased glycolysis and OxPhos in aged D10 blastema fibroblasts when compared to the young blastema. We sought to address the unmet energy needs of the aged blastema with OAA, given that mature osteoblasts rely heavily on the malate-aspartate shuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2020</xref>), and that OAA provides a source of both NADH and biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stephanopoulos et al., 1998</xref>). Phenotypically, OAA partially resolved the aged phenotype by increasing bone volume and thickness, but did not decrease trabecular spacing.</p><p>Closer investigation of the transcriptomic changes at the early bone formation stage (D21) revealed that OAA had differential effects on the fibroblasts and bone regions at D21. Within the fibroblast region, OAA increased glycolysis and OxPhos, proliferation, and hypoxia, and reduced VEGF signaling and vascular markers. Within the bone region, OAA demonstrated increased glycolysis, but not OxPhos, and was accompanied by an increase in proliferation and VEGF signaling, but not vascular markers or hypoxia. These OAA-dependent changes were accompanied by increases in WNT pathway expression in both fibroblasts and bone, which may be driving these anabolic bone processes. The regulatory axis between WNT and cell metabolism has only recently begun to be explored in bone, and while evidence has grown showing the impact of WNT on cell metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karner and Long, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karner et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kobayashi et al., 2016</xref>), data is scarce in understanding the converse relationship where cell metabolism modulates WNT signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Delgado-Deida et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Risha et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). WNT is a central regulator of bone repair and regeneration, and is known to differentially affect various cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houschyar et al., 2018</xref>), which may partially explain the divergent effects in fibroblasts and bone. Further work is required to determine whether OAA-mediated rescue requires WNT signaling activation, and whether WNT is directly or indirectly regulated by OAA-induced cell metabolism.</p><p>While OAA-dependent increases in glycolysis and OxPhos could be attributed to the differential effects of WNT signaling, it’s also important to consider the critical signaling role of OxPhos-mediated ROS generation in limb regeneration. ROS production after tail amputation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> is necessary for regeneration, possibly through WNT signaling and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Love et al., 2013</xref>), and leptin and melanocortin 4 receptor, key molecules regulating energy balance, are critical in tadpole tail regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Love et al., 2011</xref>) and digit regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). While we chose OAA partially because it supplemented the elevated cell metabolism levels seen at D10, these increased metabolism levels may be an inherent and essential part of limb regeneration, with OAA potentially providing building blocks for cell growth and expansion, further increasing cell metabolism. Thus, it may be misguided to think of promoting regeneration by reversing a molecular phenotype, and may, instead, be an exercise in determining what is needed metabolically and providing that substrate within the existing framework. Future studies with treatment of OAA or other metabolites, combined with the ability to spatially analyze signaling pathways and cell metabolism, may identify molecular targets to better promote skeletal regeneration and bone repair and further refine the timing of these treatments.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Considerations for future studies</title><p>While spatial transcriptomics offers the unique ability to discern gene patterning in tissue across the entire transcriptome, it is important to note the limitations of this approach. Optimal permeabilization is a balance between RNA release and excess diffusion that results in loss of spatial specificity. This balance does not promote the complete recovery of mRNA within the overlaid tissue section, restricting the capture efficiency of the transcriptome. Analytically, while our results suggest that the level of transcriptional information obtained per spatial spot is consistent with typical drop-seq-based single-cell experiments, the latter relies on a large sample size to help computationally ‘fill in’ dropout transcriptional information with that of its co-clustering neighbors. Our spatial information likely reflects a similar loss of transcriptional information but without the availability of thousands of spots to compensate. As such, individual gene signatures must be considered with this limitation in mind. To overcome this drawback, we made use of module scoring, which assess the expression distribution of a list of genes (relative to a random background list). Another limitation is the low resolution, with each spatial spot representing the transcriptome from multiple cells. As such, we are unable to distinguish cell heterogeneity within close proximity. This is evident by a lack of <italic>Ptprc</italic> expression within the regenerating digit, in contrast to previous works which have demonstrated the essential presence of, for instance, macrophages in the regenerative process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Simkin et al., 2017</xref>). This lack of <italic>Ptprc</italic> expression likely reflects the fact that immune cells are scattered among other cell types, resulting in ‘masking’ of their individual transcriptome. In addition, we make use of recently developed SpatialTime analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tower et al., 2021</xref>) which allows concatenation of multiple samples to reflect gene expression changes across an ‘average’ blastema. These tools significantly mitigate inherent limitations within each individual spatial spot.</p><p>This study addresses a direct comparison of young and aged digit regeneration where our data support an age-dependent delay in bone regeneration. To address differences in gene expression, we analyze both the aged and young blastema 10 days after amputation. While time course studies suggest regeneration delays occur at the level of osteogenic commitment and mineralization, using day 10 for both ages may capture differences that are merely representative of a chronological shift. Our studies in hypoxia and proliferation suggest that these gene expression differences are not simply a delay, however it is important to take this possibility into consideration. These data pave the way for additional studies that will hopefully illuminate the temporal activation pathways throughout the entire regenerative process.</p><p>While our data demonstrate that OAA can reverse aging-induced declines in regeneration, the exact mechanism of rescue remains to be elucidated. In our studies, OAA was administered throughout the blastema and bone formation phases. While pro-osteogenic transcriptional changes observed at D21, prior to any significant changes in bone architecture, suggests that OAA-mediated rescue, at least in part, functions upstream of the mineralization process to promote cell fate determination, we cannot rule out the possibility that OAA may act at the level of promoting osteoblast mineralization during bone formation and late-stage remodeling. In light of the differential effects of OAA on the fibroblast and bone areas of the digit, future work is needed to address the specific effects of OAA on the blastema and bone formation phases separately.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study provides spatial registration of blastema gene expression differences in aged and young mice, and confirms prior expression profiles of the blastema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Storer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggest that cell metabolism is altered during aging, resulting in impaired regeneration, and that while administration of the metabolite OAA is able to enhance bone formation, it is only able to partially rescue the phenotype. Furthermore, our data show that OAA-dependent regeneration is driven, at least in part, by upregulation of canonical WNT signaling. Future studies will focus on further dissecting the molecular mechanisms link metabolite signaling to these pathways.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

In all cases mice had free access to low-fluorescence rodent chow and water in a 12 hr dark-light cycle room. For all studies, mice of either sex were used and mice were randomly allocated to experimental groups. The ages of mice used for experiments ranged from 6 to 22 months. Experimental endpoints are noted in the figure legend. Wild-type CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (strain 022).

Mice were anesthetized with 1–5% isoflurane gas with continuous inhalation. The second and fourth digits of both hindlimbs were amputated at the P3 distal level as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sammarco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busse et al., 2019</xref>) and regenerating digits were collected at days 0, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, and 42 for analysis. The third digit was used as an unamputated control. OAA (Sigma, 07753) was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pH-adjusted with NaOH to 7.0 to allow the OAA solution to drift toward alkaline levels as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilkins et al., 2016</xref>. Mice were treated daily with 0.5 g/kg OAA in 200 µL via i.p. injection based on our own studies that showed aged mice routinely survived repeated doses at 0.5 g/kg but not 2 g/kg as described in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilkins et al., 2016</xref>).

Bone was decalcified for 48 hr in a formic-acid-based decalcifier (Decal I, Surgipath). Once decalcified, all samples were processed for paraffin embedding. Sections were stained with Masson’s trichrome (Poly Scientific, K037-16OZ) and mounted using permanent mounting medium (Thermo, SP15-100). Immunofluorescent staining was performed on deparaffinized and rehydrated sections. Antigen retrieval was performed using heated antigen retrieval solution (Vector, H-3300) and allowed to cool to room temperature prior to blocking with blocking solution (Thermo, 37515). Sections were incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and subsequently incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:500) for 1 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies: Hypoxyprobe-1 Plus (Hypoxyprobe, 4.3.11.3); PCNA (Abcam, ab29); CD31 (Abcam, ab182981). For hypoxyprobe primary signal was amplified with either Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Invitrogen) or a tyramide signal amplification kit (Invitrogen, T20924) per manufacturer’s instructions. Administration of Hypoxyprobe-1 was as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sammarco et al., 2014</xref>). For immunofluorescence quantification, ImageJ was used to quantify images. Image subtraction was used to isolate fluorescence within the DAPI<sup>+</sup> nuclei. For Hypoxyprobe signal, the fluorescent intensity of Hypoxyprobe was measured, adjusted for background signal outside of the digit. For PCNA quantification, PCNA fluorescence was thresholded and normalized to the number of positive nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Cell culture and metabolic assays</title><p>For Seahorse analysis with blastema, a single blastema was dissected from the digit at day 10, removing all nail, skin, bone, and soft tissue and placed directly into an Agilent Seahorse culture plate containing blastema media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sammarco et al., 2014</xref>). Cells were allowed to expand in the well and were assayed after 2 weeks. Complete seahorse medium was prepared from Agilent Seahorse XF Base Medium (Agilent, 102353) to contain 10 mM glucose (Agilent, 103577-100), 2 mM glutamine (Agilent, 103579-100), and 1 mM pyruvate (Agilent, 103578-100), adjusted to pH 7.4. Cells were incubated in 180 µL complete seahorse medium at 37°C for 1 hr before measurements in a Seahorse XFe24 analyzer. Stressor concentrations were as follows: 2 µM oligomycin, 0.75 µM FCCP, 1 µM rotenone, and 1 µM antimycin A. Cells were evaluated using the Seahorse Bioscience Mito Stress Test (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) using the standard protocol after optimization of both cell seeding density and FCCP concentration as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busse et al., 2019</xref>). OCR and ECAR were normalized to total protein. For the Glycolytic Rate Assay, complete seahorse medium was prepared from Agilent Seahorse XF Base Medium to contain 11 mM glucose, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco, A24940-01), 2 mM glutamine (Agilent, 103579-100), and 5 mM HEPES (Gibco, 103337-100) adjusted to pH 7.4. Blastemas were treated with 2 mM OAA for 24 hr prior to Seahorse analysis (Sigma, 07753).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Micro-computed tomography</title><p>Digits were scanned on a Bruker SkyScan 1172 at a pixel size of 4 µm with 0.2 rotation angle and 5 frame averaging using a 0.25 mm aluminum filter. The X-ray source used was 50 kV, 201 µA, and 10 W. The raw scans were reconstructed using NRecon. Each scan was reconstructed with a beam hardening correction of 24%, no smoothing correction, and a dynamic range of 0.00–0.339. Reconstructed output files were in 8-bit BMP format. Digits were rotated three dimensionally in DataViewer during which the regenerated woven bone was separated from the cortical stump. Whole bone and trabecular bone data sets were binarized in CTAn. Global thresholds were used for all data sets with minimum threshold value of 0 and maximum threshold value of 74. P3 was then cropped away from P2 in three dimensions using the 3D Viewer plugin in ImageJ2. Bone volume for whole bone and trabecular bone was generated using the volume function in the BoneJ plugin for ImageJ2. Trabecular and cortical thickness values were generated using the thickness function in the BoneJ plugin. Trabecular spacing stacks were generated from the trabecular bone data sets using the background subtract function in ImageJ2. A rolling ball value of 29 was chosen such that the marrow cavity space was excluded but all trabecular spaces were included during the background subtract function. The despeckle function was then run to remove artificially small spaces on the exterior of the bone. Trabecular spacing values were generated using the thickness function in BoneJ. For 2D analysis, scans were realigned along the proximal-distal axis and an ROI was selected, beginning at the most proximal slice free of bone from the residual amputated stump. Images were thresholded as above and 2D measurements of bone area were generated in CTan (Bruker). Inner void fraction and 3D translucent images were quantified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffseth et al., 2021</xref>). For OAA-treated micro-CT analysis, digits were aligned so that image stacks were aligned along the proximal-distal axis. The regenerated region was isolated based on the increased porosity and decreased cortical bone thickness associated with the transition from residual bone stump to newly deposited bone. 2D and 3D analyses for these digits were conducted in CTan.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-5"><title>Spatial transcriptomics</title><p>Spatial transcriptomics was conducted using the Visium Spatial Gene Expression System (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA). Digits 10 days after amputation were harvested, arrayed in a 2 × 2 grid, fresh frozen in OCT, then stored at –80°C. Samples were cut at –26°C at a thickness of 12 µm. Optimization and gene expression assays were carried out according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, slides were fixed in –20°C methanol, dried with isopropanol, and stained with H&amp;E. A tile scan image of all reaction areas was generated using a Leica DM6 B microscope (Leica Microsystems Inc). For tissue optimization, enzymatic permeabilization was conducted for 0–40 min, followed by first-strand cDNA synthesis with fluorescent nucleotides. The slide was reimaged using standard Texas Red filter cube. An optimal permeabilization time of 13 min was determined by visual inspection to maximize mRNA recovery while at the same time minimizing diffusion. For gene expression, initial workflow was consistent with optimization. Library preparation, clean-up, and indexing were conducted using standard procedures. Samples were subjected to pair-ended sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq generating ~400 M reads. Alignment and demultiplexing were conducted using the <italic>SpaceRanger</italic> pipeline with subsequent analyses conducted using <italic>Seurat</italic> in <italic>R</italic>. Pathway analysis was conducted using DAVID. Pathway scoring was determined using the <italic>AddModuleScore</italic> function in Seurat using gene lists obtained from validated KEGG pathways and published literature. Spatial feature plots represent a representative image, while all quantitative measures represent the cumulative data of multiple digits (5 young digits, 7 aged digits; 4 aged controls, 7 OAA-treated aged). To determine significance between genes/modules in spatial, the Wilcox method of <italic>stat_compare_means</italic> function from the <italic>R</italic> package <italic>ggpubr</italic> was used. For SpatialTime analysis, a reference line was manually drawn along the residual bone stump. Minimum 2D geometric distances were calculated between each spatial spot within the defined blastema and this reference line using the spatial coordinates and individually scaled to values between 0 (spatial spot closes to the bone stump) and 1 (furthest spot from the bone stump) for each blastema. Once the SpatialTime values were calculated for each blastema, samples are concatenated to increase statistical power and visualize gene expression across an ‘average’ blastema.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>ScRNAseq and ‘blastema gene signature’</title><p>Previously published scRNAseq data sets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus repository and analyzed using default settings in Seurat to replicate original publication as closely as possible.

For the blastema signatures from our spatial data, blastema-specific DEGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), the top 200 genes were highlighted after sorting for first the adjusted p-value, then the log fold change, and finally for specificity (defined as the ratio between spatial spots which expressed each gene within the blastema relative to spots expressing the gene outside the blastema). Genes highlighted in each of the three selection criteria were chosen first, with subsequent genes highlighted in two of the three criteria (weighted with specificity &gt;log fold change &gt;adjusted p-value) later selected to reach a list of 100 genes. Similar selection criteria were applied to Table S1A from Johnson et al. for genes enriched in fibroblast clusters. Following initial selection, genes derived from fibroblast cluster 8 from Johnson et al. were excluded to generate a final blastema gene list. To generate a blastema signature from Storer et al., the top 100 gene entries were selected from category 1 genes in Table S2 from the original publication. As described above, module scoring was used to show enrichment of blastema gene signatures in each of the individual scRNAseq data sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS (v.26, IBM) and Graphs were compiled using GraphPad Prism (version 7) (GraphPad, San Diego, CA).</p><p>Micro-CT data: Eight digits were precluded from the analysis due to breakage, as determined by visual inspection of 3D digit renderings.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The introduction is very abbreviated, uses a large number of field-specific terms, and several places could be expanded. For example, the description of different phases of digit regeneration should be expanded as this is critical information to guide non-digit regeneration aficionados through the rest of the manuscript's results. Likewise, for a large portion of the text, information is contained in parentheses when it should just be expanded into its own sentence. This would help with the flow of information in the manuscript.</p><p>2. There is no mention in the text or methods as to the X/Y/Z resolution that is achieved via spatial transcriptomics. Some approximation should be made to the number of cells per barcoded spot.</p><p>3. The PCNA staining between young and aged digits should be quantified with consideration of total cell number and density. It is not overwhelmingly obvious that there is a difference.</p><p>To distinguish whether there is in fact increased percentage of proliferating cells and/or a lengthening of the aged digit cell cycle, the authors should consider a BrdU/EdU pulse-chase that can give kinetics of the cell cycle stages between young and aged regenerating digits.</p><p>4. Despite the impressive analysis presented, the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of the limitations of the spatial transcriptomics technique as the low read depth in single cell transcriptomes are known to limit the detection of important genes that have low expression values, and this could be further compounded by the slide-based barcoding technique. An example of such a gene would be PTPRC where the authors show in Figure 1A a lack of spatial detection of a gene carried by all immune cells. In conflict with this, the authors previous work had already identified a large number of PTPRC+ cells within the mouse digit at this time point (Development. 2017 Nov 1; 144(21): 3907-3916. doi: 10.1242/dev.150086).</p><p>5. As aged digits are slower to enter the anabolic phase of bone growth it is possible that the &quot;spatial time&quot; data obtained at a single timepoint may simply reflect that delay. The authors should acknowledge this limitation in interpretation. If there would be a delay in the progression of blastema and bone formation between young and aged mice, as shown in Figure 2A, would experimental samples at the same days post amputation be equivalent samples between aged and young digits? Perhaps the authors have done this analysis of heterochronic timepoint comparison, but this is not immediately apparent in the methods or text. The reviewers had a difficult time understanding how comparisons were made between young and aged cohorts.</p><p>6. One of the primary differences uncovered by the authors is the increase in the number of cells expressing the active cell cycle marker PCNA (although this is not quantified) as well as an increase in expression of S/G2/M phase genes in aged digits relative to young regenerating digits. The interpretation by the authors is that there is increased proliferation in young versus aged regenerating digits. This was interpreted to mean that a greater percentage of all cells are actively moving through the cell cycle as opposed to remaining quiescent. An alternative explanation is that there is a lengthening of the S/G2/M phases in aged cells resulting in a higher proportion of cells at a given static timepoint being in these phases. These two interpretations are not mutually exclusive, but the authors do not consider a lengthening of the cell cycle and the impact that might have on the overall process of regeneration. A slower cell cycle could potentially explain lags in blastema/bone formation. The conclusions regarding cell cycle therefore must be tempered and other possible conclusions acknowledged.</p><p>7. The authors postulate in the discussion that there could be an effect on cell dedifferentiation and redifferentiation that correlates to the lag in bone anabolism. &quot;Most studies agree that formation of the blastema relies, at least in part, on the dedifferentiation of terminal cells within the remaining digit (6, 7, 28, 29). In contrast, proliferation is thought to play a relatively less critical contribution to blastema formation (6,7).&quot; Can the authors easily support this claim and perhaps demonstrate deficiencies in aged digits by ratiometric comparison of spatial expression of genes that would relate to dedifferentiation (or lack of differentiation) relative to proliferation and cell cycle markers?</p><p>8. The reviewers wondered if authors had considered that the observed hypoxia might be influencing osteoblast differentiation, which is leading to a lag in bone anabolism? There is literature suggesting that hypoxia can influence differentiation of osteogenic cells, although studies seem mixed as to whether hypoxia is beneficial or suppresses differentiation (one example is PubMed ID: 16529738). This seems like a question that the authors can easily address using their spatial datasets and immunohistochemistry in addition to their already generated in vitro assays.</p><p>9. The authors claim that the increased energetic demand drives intracellular hypoxia and increased blood vessel formation providing both spatial transcriptomic data, &quot;hypoxyprobe&quot; data and blood vessel immunofluorescent staining to support these claims. This data would be more convincing and reliable if the relative levels were quantified between old and young digits and if it was made clear where the vascular changes occurred relative to the spatial transcriptomics.</p><p>10. Figure 3B: Reviewers were confused about which regions of the spatial transcriptomics profile went into the identification of differentially expressed genes between young and aged mice. In Figure 1B, the authors have highlighted a specific portion of the image as the blastemal (pink color). In the text describing Figure 3, the authors state, &quot;…Pathway analysis of DEGs showing differential expression in the young or old blastemal identified…(Figure 3A) &quot; and then later state &quot;…Metabolic analysis showed increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in the blastema of aged mice… (Figure 3B)&quot;. It is confusing, therefore, that the images shown in Panel 3B show expression patterns in regions of the tissue that are not necessarily localized to the blastema. For example, OxPhos signatures for the young mice seem to be concentrated below the blastema in the digit itself; this raises the question of whether the authors segmented their gene lists to the blastema only while analyzing pathways, or whether the whole section was considered? Perhaps the authors could outline the region of the blastema with a dashed line, to emphasize where their pathway analyses were focused? If otherwise, please clarify. Notably, a similar concern could be raised about Figure 4B and 4C and should be likewise addressed in these areas.</p><p>11. The concern was raised that the data showing in Figure 4A to be somewhat unnecessary for the paper. While the Figure 3 cell energetics data are quite relevant as they are from young and aged blastema, the data in Figure 4A are only provided from an osteogenic cell line (which has limited relevance to this study overall). Presumably these data are provided to link the exciting cell energetics data in Figure 3 to the hypoxia data in Figure 4. The reviewers recommended that the data be removed from the paper, moved to a supplementary figure as they detract from (rather than add to) the nice narrative the authors have otherwise put together. The reviewers requested that these experiments be repeated with blastema tissue rather than osteogenic cells, which would provide a much better linkage between the story told in Figure 3 and the continued story in Figure 4. A similar concern could be raised about Figure 5A-B as was raised above for Figure 4. The authors have clearly demonstrated the ability to perform these assays with blastema tissue (Figure 3D and S4C) and the justification for moving to a cell line is thin and unsupported. The reviewers were concerned because the relative importance of the Seahorse assays must be assumed to translate from osteogenic cells to blastema, rather than being directly supported with experimental evidence.</p><p>12. In Figure 3D, the authors state that OCR associated with ATP, maximal, and non-mitochondrial respiration were significantly higher in aged vs. young blastemas. However, these data are not shown anywhere, and statistical analyses are not presented in Panel D. Please add these graphs and the related statistical analyses.</p><p>All of the reviewers struggled with the presentation and interpretation of the results of the OAA study. Overall, there are so much confusion about what OAA is doing and what these data mean, that it became difficult for the reviewers to reconcile this OAA study with the hypotheses and premise of the rest of the paper. The following two comments address this part of the paper and are considered essential issues that must be resolved.</p><p>13. The choice of intervention (treatment with the anapleurotic metabolite oxaloacetate (OAA)) is hard to follow and poorly justified. The authors showed that the aged mice already had elevated OCR already vs. young mice (Figure 3B,C,D), as well as enhanced proliferation (Figure S4C). The data they provide in Figure 5 show that OAA increases OCR and proliferation. So, why is this drug a good choice when it produces the same phenotype already seen in the aged mice? This part of the story, accordingly, becomes hard to follow. As written, the rationale is unclear and should be clarified for the reader. This is particularly important because OAA did not rescue the hypoxia phenotype seen in the aged mice, despite providing a modest rescue of bone regeneration endpoints. While it is recognized that the authors likely used the MC3T3 osteoblast cell line to restrict analysis to bone producing cells to match the in vivo enhanced bone anabolism phenotype, performing the OAA treatments ex vivo, in primary culture of aged blastema tissue using procedures they have already documented (Figure 3) is a necessary addition for their conclusions to be supported.</p><p>14. The failure of OAA to alter trabecular separation and a full rescue of the aged phenotype data broadly support this hypothesis although a discussion of alternative hypotheses are not discussed (i.e., cell specific effects of OAA on cell phenotype, alternative metabolic pathway activation with excess OAA, mineralization specific gene activation etc..?). It appears that OAA acted so in a way that is apparently largely outside of the pathways identified in the spatial transcriptomics analyses. The documentation of timeline for any changes in the initiation of bone anabolism (outgrowth) upon OAA treatment are strangely missing and would be important for understanding if metabolic energy deficit is responsible for the delay or if some other pathway is involved. The actual mechanism of action of OAA is never defined but the addition of OAA seems to have decoupled bone anabolism from hypoxia, so this may not be the case. Perhaps there are non-osteogenic cells that are primarily affected by hypoxia and these cells are not assayed in vitro? Do the authors have the spatial resolution to distinguish osteogenic cell gene expression from other non-osteogenic cell types?</p><p>15. There is something counterintuitive and unexplained in the authors data related to the aged regenerative phenotype. They first observe an increased proliferation in aged blastemas and increased expression of metabolic pathways. Postulating that cells are compensating for a metabolic deficit, they add an OxPhos metabolite OAA. in vitro, this metabolite increases proliferation and oxidative phosphorylation. It is not well explained what is being achieved through the rescue experiment relative to the baseline aged phenotype other than an increased mineralization. Is it because these assays were done with the MC3T3 cell line and not primary digit explants? This is not explained sufficiently, and the in vitro assays using cell lines may not be an adequate proxy for aged tissue cells.</p><p>Please address any comments and issues raised in addition to the essential reviewer comments listed above.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors set out to apply the new technology of spatial transcriptomics to the context of digit tip regeneration and identify possible targets regulating the age-related decline in regeneration quality. The application of spatial transcriptomics to this model was extremely convincing as they were able to incorporate several published datasets into their pipeline. During their analysis they were able to spatially identify a blastemal region and a border region with different gene signatures to the rest of the digit.</p><p>The authors then confirm the morphological changes in aged vs young mice using rigorous bone measurements reporting the main defects in aged mice occurring which is in agreement with a previous study by Brunauer et al., characterizing the bone volume changes in young vs aged mice. This current study adds trabecular thickness and trabecular separation measurements which can add to the understanding of regeneration quality in aged mice.</p><p>The manuscript then focuses on metabolism as a major instigator for disruption of regenerative quality. The spatial transcriptomics approach is used to reveal changes in metabolism location in the proximo-distal axis in aged digits. This analysis could be really important for understanding the dynamic spatial nature of how cells communicate within a blastema. Additional ex vivo seahorse data is supplied showing changes in metabolic parameters of aged digit cells that supports the hypothesis that changes in the aged digits metabolism may be important in age related decline in regeneration quality. The authors claim that the increased energetic demand drives intracellular hypoxia.</p><p>Next the authors perform in vitro analysis on a cultured osteoblast cell line treated with oxaloacetate (OAA) demonstrating changes in cell energy use parameters, proliferation and mineralization. They then perform studies examining OAA treatment in vivo and show data on aged digits 28 days post-amputation measuring increased bone volume and thickness. The authors also demonstrate that OAA fails to modulate hypoxia in the aged digits and put forward the hypothesis that hypoxia driven angiogenesis results in the failure of OAA to alter trabecular separation and a full rescue of the aged phenotype. Overall, the data broadly support this hypothesis, however the question of if the metabolic energy deficit is responsible for the delay or if some other pathway is involved remains unresolved.</p><p>The work presented in this manuscript is of high interest to regeneration and developmental biology disciplines. One key problem in these specialties is the difficulty in obtaining spatial information of gene expression for a large number of genes simultaneously. One can use modern in situ hybridization techniques such as RNAscope or HCR fluorescent probe (biased) analyses to identify the location of a particular gene on a tissue section however this is limited to a small number of genes at a time. The non-biased spatial transcriptomics approach has many advantages and will advance the field significantly. The authors do a good job at demonstrating this advanced technique at a single point in the regeneration timeline and add some interesting insights into the role of metabolism in aged-related decline in regeneration quality.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Spatial transcriptomics is a fairly newly emerging field where the transcriptome from a section of tissue can be ascertained while also retaining information regarding those transcripts' spatial location in the tissue – preserving important relational information which can increase the utility of the resulting molecular data. While this technique is becoming more widely used in certain model systems (e.g., zebrafish) and tissues / organ systems (e.g., brain), it had not yet been described in the context of regenerating musculoskeletal tissue. A major strength of the manuscript, which does exactly that, is that the authors perform these analyses and then compare their results against two other recent datasets – collected using single cell RNA sequencing, another technique increasing in popularity – and compare / contrast against their own findings. Many similarities exist between the datasets, which highlights the likelihood that both spatial transcriptomics and single cell RNA-seq techniques are providing an accurate description of the molecular events taking place in digit regeneration, but notable differences exist that highlight the particular strength of spatial transcriptomics technology in this circumstance.</p><p>Another strength of the manuscript is that it does not simply stop at proving the utility of spatial transcriptomics for tracking the molecular signature of regenerating tissue – the authors go further to apply their new technology to a known instance of impaired regeneration (aging), and then use spatial transcriptomics to define the molecular events that lead to that expected outcome. This provides novel data to the literature, in that the authors have identified (using their technology) a molecular signature of impaired cellular bioenergetics, which was then pursued with other experiments (e.g., Seahorse, hypoxia endpoints, etc.) to test how and why aging tissue fails to regenerate like younger tissue.</p><p>A weakness of the manuscript is that the choice of intervention (treatment with the anapleurotic metabolite oxaloacetate (OAA)) as this drug induced, rather than blunted, the same metabolic effects seen in the aged animals that the authors hypothesized would be causative for their phenotype. This drug also produced a partial rescue of the impaired bone regeneration phenotype but did so in a way that is apparently largely outside of the pathways identified as differentially regulated between aged and young mice identified in the spatial transcriptomics analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript by Tower et al., the authors address an important consideration related to regeneration which is the complexity and dynamicity of the process is somewhat lost in bulk and single cell transcriptomic approaches. Using a spatial transcriptomic approach, the authors can compartmentalize the regeneration process to the stump tissue, the regenerative blastema, and the boundary zone. To highlight the utility of this approach, the authors re-analyze two recent scRNAseq datasets of digit regeneration to identify consensus gene sets that predict spatial proximity within the blastema, in contrast to clustering by cell type which is the norm for scRNAseq datasets. This is well done and provides good justification for why high throughput spatial gene expression studies are necessary. The authors then shift focus to look at a primary biological question related to regeneration which is why regenerative ability declines with age. Using young and aged cohorts of mice, the authors find a decline in the speed of regeneration in aged mice, specifically in the creation of new bone and its patterning relative to young regenerating or uninjured digits. Transcriptomic analysis suggested that three potentially interconnected processes were changed – cell proliferation, hypoxia, and increased glycolytic and OxPhos cell metabolism – all increased in aged digits. The authors posit that a metabolic deficit could be underlying changes to these processes and use a metabolite that enhances oxidative metabolism to see if they can rescue aged digit regeneration. This treatment is able to somewhat rescue bone growth but cannot rescue the observed hypoxia and bone density which seems to be due to the increased vascularization that is a consequence of hypoxia.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Spatial transcriptomics reveals increased energetic requirements underpinning age-dependent declines in digit regeneration rescued through administration of OAA&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewer and editor found it unfortunate that a OAA treated vs vehicle control aged mouse time course was not supplied to demonstrate this enhanced anabolism. Measurement of bone volume, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation, of regenerated control and OAA treated bone at a single Day 28 timepoint does not tell the scientific community where the OAA is acting between 10 and 28 DPA. If these MicroCT measurements can be added reasonably quickly and would certainly help with the interpretation of the OAA effects on partially rescuing the aged bone anabolic defect. For example, if the OAA only altered bone volume between D21- D28 or if the OAA was acting earlier to advance the start the anabolism (D12-D14). If these measures cannot be collected quickly as the samples are not in hand, please expand the discussion to address this limitation of the paper.

At D21 this manifests as a significant difference in Bone Volume. The Tb. thickness and Tb. spacing differences are not significant at D21 (in figure 2) and are only significant a D28. Taking this into consideration, the OAA treatment data presented (in figure 6) show no differences in bone volume, Tb. thickness and Tb. spacing at D21 and OAA effects are only really observed in volume and thickness at D28 with no differences in spacing. This could be interpreted as the effect of OAA not affecting the onset of anabolism at all, but rather providing support for late-stage remodeling phase. The authors MUST discuss this, as this interpretation contradicts the statement given by the authors that &quot;This data fortifies our findings in spatial transcriptomics (D21) that indeed OAA acts in advance to the start of anabolism.&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71542.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Additionally, we have included spatial transcriptomic analysis of genes linked to cell cycle activity, including cyclins and components of the anaphase promoting complex (Figure 3E) to further support that genes linked to entry into, and progression through, the cell cycle is elevated in the aged blastema.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Despite the impressive analysis presented, the manuscript would benefit from a discussion of the limitations of the spatial transcriptomics technique as the low read depth in single cell transcriptomes are known to limit the detection of important genes that have low expression values, and this could be further compounded by the slide-based barcoding technique. An example of such a gene would be PTPRC where the authors show in Figure 1A a lack of spatial detection of a gene carried by all immune cells. In conflict with this, the authors previous work had already identified a large number of PTPRC+ cells within the mouse digit at this time point (Development. 2017 Nov 1; 144(21): 3907-3916. doi: 10.1242/dev.150086).</p></disp-quote><p>Additional text has now been added to the discussion to clearly state the limitations associated with the low efficiency conversion of the transcriptome into cDNA for sequencing. This limitation has led us to primarily focus on overall comparisons between blastemas, the use of module scoring (which relies on a list of genes rather than an individual marker) and the use of SpatialTime which allows the concatenation of samples to display an ‘average’ blastema across space with increased statistical power.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. As aged digits are slower to enter the anabolic phase of bone growth it is possible that the &quot;spatial time&quot; data obtained at a single timepoint may simply reflect that delay. The authors should acknowledge this limitation in interpretation. If there would be a delay in the progression of blastema and bone formation between young and aged mice, as shown in Figure 2A, would experimental samples at the same days post amputation be equivalent samples between aged and young digits? Perhaps the authors have done this analysis of heterochronic timepoint comparison, but this is not immediately apparent in the methods or text. The reviewers had a difficult time understanding how comparisons were made between young and aged cohorts.</p></disp-quote><p>To address differences in gene expression we analyze both the aged and young blastema 10 days after amputation. As stated by the reviewer, this approach may capture differences that are merely representative of a similar, but delayed, gene expression pattern in the aged sample relative to young controls. However, our studies in hypoxia and proliferation suggest that these gene expression differences are not simply a delay, but an actual shift in cell function that sustains throughout regeneration. We have added discussion of this limitation to the text of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. One of the primary differences uncovered by the authors is the increase in the number of cells expressing the active cell cycle marker PCNA (although this is not quantified) as well as an increase in expression of S/G2/M phase genes in aged digits relative to young regenerating digits. The interpretation by the authors is that there is increased proliferation in young versus aged regenerating digits. This was interpreted to mean that a greater percentage of all cells are actively moving through the cell cycle as opposed to remaining quiescent. An alternative explanation is that there is a lengthening of the S/G2/M phases in aged cells resulting in a higher proportion of cells at a given static timepoint being in these phases. These two interpretations are not mutually exclusive, but the authors do not consider a lengthening of the cell cycle and the impact that might have on the overall process of regeneration. A slower cell cycle could potentially explain lags in blastema/bone formation. The conclusions regarding cell cycle therefore must be tempered and other possible conclusions acknowledged.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we looked at the expression of genes linked to cell cycle progression and cyclin destruction (Figure 3E). These new data suggests not only high levels of cyclin transcripts, but also several genes linked to cyclin destruction and cell cycle progression. While analysis of transcripts does not provide definitive evidence to distinguish these two possibilities, these new data supports active progression through the cell cycle over lengthening or delays of progression. Text has been added to the results to reflect these new data, as well as in the discussion to temper our original conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors postulate in the discussion that there could be an effect on cell dedifferentiation and redifferentiation that correlates to the lag in bone anabolism. &quot;Most studies agree that formation of the blastema relies, at least in part, on the dedifferentiation of terminal cells within the remaining digit (6, 7, 28, 29). In contrast, proliferation is thought to play a relatively less critical contribution to blastema formation (6,7).&quot; Can the authors easily support this claim and perhaps demonstrate deficiencies in aged digits by ratiometric comparison of spatial expression of genes that would relate to dedifferentiation (or lack of differentiation) relative to proliferation and cell cycle markers?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment that showing reduced dedifferentiation in aging mice would be ideally suited in our model. However, we were unable to find a clear transcriptional based approach to quantify dedifferentiation in young or aged blastemas. Many pathways, such as Notch and Pi3K-Akt pathways have been linked to dedifferentiation, but also in proliferation and differentiation. As such, we feel presenting these results as dedifferentiation markers may be misleading. Further, many additional markers previously proposed were not found to be expressed at meaningful levels within the blastema, likely owing to their low expression and the relatively low coverage of the whole transcriptome provided by spatial (this limitation is now stated in the discussion). In addition, we probed several genes linked to osteogenic differentiation. Seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, our results show that while several genes were significantly downregulated (Runx2, Spp1), no strong evidence was obtained that osteogenesis was impaired in aged mice. This may be the result of the fact that our samples were obtained at day 10, while mineralization typically does not initiate until approximately day 14.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>No notable shift in osteogenic transcript expression is observed by spatial transcriptomics.</title><p>Relative expression of osteogenic genes in the blastema of young and aged mice 10 days post amputation.

The reviewers wondered if authors had considered that the observed hypoxia might be influencing osteoblast differentiation, which is leading to a lag in bone anabolism? There is literature suggesting that hypoxia can influence differentiation of osteogenic cells, although studies seem mixed as to whether hypoxia is beneficial or suppresses differentiation (one example is PubMed ID: 16529738). This seems like a question that the authors can easily address using their spatial datasets and immunohistochemistry in addition to their already generated in vitro assays.</p></disp-quote><p>The hypoxia data from the Arnett Lab indeed provides an excellent foundation for what is the relationship between hypoxia and osteoblasts, and provided the motivation for some of our earlier studies in oxygen. Interestingly, we found that hypoxia delayed bone mineralization in the blastema (PMID: 24753124) during digit regeneration and noted this deviation from the Arnett lab findings. While spatial would be an excellent approach to further study this relationship, particularly in the blastema, our new data showing that OAA increases bone volume and thickness without decreasing hypoxia (comparably to the untreated mice) certainly adds a layer of complexity to the relationship between hypoxia and regeneration, at least in the digit model. Additionally, Figure R1 (above, #7 response) shows no strong evidence that osteogenesis was impaired in aged mice. As with dedifferentiation, this may be a result of the fact that our samples were obtained at day 10, prior to bone formation. We find our data intriguing and hope to further explore this relationship with multiple timepoints across regeneration in the future with more timepoints.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The authors claim that the increased energetic demand drives intracellular hypoxia and increased blood vessel formation providing both spatial transcriptomic data, &quot;hypoxyprobe&quot; data and blood vessel immunofluorescent staining to support these claims. This data would be more convincing and reliable if the relative levels were quantified between old and young digits and if it was made clear where the vascular changes occurred relative to the spatial transcriptomics.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity when describing the data. Numbers below the spatial (Figure 5A) and hypoxyprobe images (Figure 5B) denote quantification of gene expression and average fluorescent intensity, respectively, within the blastema of aged mice, normalized to young (values greater than 0 indicating higher levels of transcripts/fluorescence in aged blastemas). Text has been added to clarify this quantification. We have also added additional analysis to show the expression level of our vessel scoring relative to SpatialTime (Figure 5E) to show that not only is vascularization increased in the aged blastema, but that these vessels are present throughout the blastema.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Figure 3B: Reviewers were confused about which regions of the spatial transcriptomics profile went into the identification of differentially expressed genes between young and aged mice. In Figure 1B, the authors have highlighted a specific portion of the image as the blastemal (pink color). In the text describing Figure 3, the authors state, &quot;…Pathway analysis of DEGs showing differential expression in the young or old blastemal identified…(Figure 3A) &quot; and then later state &quot;…Metabolic analysis showed increased glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) in the blastema of aged mice… (Figure 3B)&quot;. It is confusing, therefore, that the images shown in Panel 3B show expression patterns in regions of the tissue that are not necessarily localized to the blastema. For example, OxPhos signatures for the young mice seem to be concentrated below the blastema in the digit itself; this raises the question of whether the authors segmented their gene lists to the blastema only while analyzing pathways, or whether the whole section was considered? Perhaps the authors could outline the region of the blastema with a dashed line, to emphasize where their pathway analyses were focused? If otherwise, please clarify. Notably, a similar concern could be raised about Figure 4B and 4C and should be likewise addressed in these areas.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. All analyses, unless otherwise stated, were confined to the blastema as defined by Figure 1B. To better demonstrate this point, figures 3B, 4, 5, 7, S4 and S5 have been updated to reflect signal within the blastema only. Hopefully the reviewers will find these new representative images more precise and easier to interpret with regard to the corresponding quantitation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The concern was raised that the data showing in Figure 4A to be somewhat unnecessary for the paper. While the Figure 3 cell energetics data are quite relevant as they are from young and aged blastema, the data in Figure 4A are only provided from an osteogenic cell line (which has limited relevance to this study overall). Presumably these data are provided to link the exciting cell energetics data in Figure 3 to the hypoxia data in Figure 4. The reviewers recommended that the data be removed from the paper, moved to a supplementary figure as they detract from (rather than add to) the nice narrative the authors have otherwise put together. The reviewers requested that these experiments be repeated with blastema tissue rather than osteogenic cells, which would provide a much better linkage between the story told in Figure 3 and the continued story in Figure 4. A similar concern could be raised about Figure 5A-B as was raised above for Figure 4. The authors have clearly demonstrated the ability to perform these assays with blastema tissue (Figure 3D and S4C) and the justification for moving to a cell line is thin and unsupported. The reviewers were concerned because the relative importance of the Seahorse assays must be assumed to translate from osteogenic cells to blastema, rather than being directly supported with experimental evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>Consistent with the reviewer’s request, we have removed the MC3T3 cell and now present Seahorse data from blastema cells treated with OAA (Figure 6A). In addition, to further characterize the effects of OAA in vivo, new spatial transcriptomic experiments were conducted (Figure 7) to better unravel the mechanism of action through which OAA rescues our impaired regeneration phenotype.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In Figure 3D, the authors state that OCR associated with ATP, maximal, and non-mitochondrial respiration were significantly higher in aged vs. young blastemas. However, these data are not shown anywhere, and statistical analyses are not presented in Panel D. Please add these graphs and the related statistical analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not including the statistical analyses relevant to the kinetic data. We have edited figures 4 and 6 to indicate specific time-point analysis and statistical significance for the third read after start and the third read after each stressor injection as our team has previously shown for OCR associated with basal, ATP, maximal, and non-mitochondrial respiration (PMID: 30953371).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All of the reviewers struggled with the presentation and interpretation of the results of the OAA study. Overall, there are so much confusion about what OAA is doing and what these data mean, that it became difficult for the reviewers to reconcile this OAA study with the hypotheses and premise of the rest of the paper. The following two comments address this part of the paper and are considered essential issues that must be resolved.</p><p>13. The choice of intervention (treatment with the anapleurotic metabolite oxaloacetate (OAA)) is hard to follow and poorly justified. The authors showed that the aged mice already had elevated OCR already vs. young mice (Figure 3B,C,D), as well as enhanced proliferation (Figure S4C). The data they provide in Figure 5 show that OAA increases OCR and proliferation. So, why is this drug a good choice when it produces the same phenotype already seen in the aged mice? This part of the story, accordingly, becomes hard to follow. As written, the rationale is unclear and should be clarified for the reader. This is particularly important because OAA did not rescue the hypoxia phenotype seen in the aged mice, despite providing a modest rescue of bone regeneration endpoints. While it is recognized that the authors likely used the MC3T3 osteoblast cell line to restrict analysis to bone producing cells to match the in vivo enhanced bone anabolism phenotype, performing the OAA treatments ex vivo, in primary culture of aged blastema tissue using procedures they have already documented (Figure 3) is a necessary addition for their conclusions to be supported.</p></disp-quote><p>In the manuscript, we have better explained and justified our choice of OAA for the reviewers. The reviewer is correct that our data propose an increase in both glycolytic and oxidative metabolism pathways in the aged blastema as well as enhanced proliferation, suggesting an increased energy demand. Because of these data, we hypothesized that unmet energy needs may underpin age-dependent metabolic increases. Therefore, we tested if supplementing these cells with a substrate to off-set these increased energy requirements would enhance regeneration. OAA is able to directly generate NADH in the mitochondria. As such, we use this intervention as a way to test our hypothesis. We have modified the text that OAA rescue is likely mediated through helping to meet the new metabolic requirements of aged cells, rather than attempting to rescue and revert these aged cells back to a “young” phenotype. Additionally, we have added Seahorse analysis of OAA treated blastemas from aged mice. Results from this analysis show that administration of OAA reduced the maximal respiration of aged blastemas (D10) supporting a role of OAA in reducing energy demand by aged blastema cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The failure of OAA to alter trabecular separation and a full rescue of the aged phenotype data broadly support this hypothesis although a discussion of alternative hypotheses are not discussed (i.e., cell specific effects of OAA on cell phenotype, alternative metabolic pathway activation with excess OAA, mineralization specific gene activation etc..?). It appears that OAA acted so in a way that is apparently largely outside of the pathways identified in the spatial transcriptomics analyses. The documentation of timeline for any changes in the initiation of bone anabolism (outgrowth) upon OAA treatment are strangely missing and would be important for understanding if metabolic energy deficit is responsible for the delay or if some other pathway is involved. The actual mechanism of action of OAA is never defined but the addition of OAA seems to have decoupled bone anabolism from hypoxia, so this may not be the case. Perhaps there are non-osteogenic cells that are primarily affected by hypoxia and these cells are not assayed in vitro? Do the authors have the spatial resolution to distinguish osteogenic cell gene expression from other non-osteogenic cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewers. To better understand the mode of action of OAA, we have included new data on OAA-treated mice using spatial transcriptomics. These data point to a divergent effect of OAA on differentiated and undifferentiated cells. Additional analyses indicate OAA promotes proliferation and suggest this rescue may be due in part through re-activation of the WNT pathway in aged digits. We have expanded the discussion to include OAA’s ability to only partially resolve the phenotype. While OAA was not able to resolve the intracellular hypoxia seen in aged mice, this outcome is consistent with our belief that OAA helps meet the energetic needs of highly metabolically active aged cells, rather than reversing metabolism back to a young-like state. We have additionally added language to describe the lack of rescue in trabecular spacing, likely due to the inability to resolve the VEGF signaling at day 21. It is interesting to note that OAA enhanced bone deposition with minimal changes in overall hypoxia signaling (Figure 7D,E), supporting the reviewer’s thoughts that OAA treatment seems to affect osteogenesis through mechanisms outside of hypoxia.</p><p>We have also placed greater focus on the idea that while signaling pathways such as WNT are known to modulate cell metabolism, here we show the converse where cell metabolism is altering signaling pathways (Figure 7), a mechanism that warrants further investigation in future studies. As a result, we have garnered new insight into the OAA-driven mechanisms that played a role in this. While the resolution does not allow us to distinguish which individual cell types express elevated transcripts linked to hypoxia, our new data support upregulation of WNT signaling as a potential mechanism through which OAA may rescue aging-impaired regeneration.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. There is something counterintuitive and unexplained in the authors data related to the aged regenerative phenotype. They first observe an increased proliferation in aged blastemas and increased expression of metabolic pathways. Postulating that cells are compensating for a metabolic deficit, they add an OxPhos metabolite OAA. in vitro, this metabolite increases proliferation and oxidative phosphorylation. It is not well explained what is being achieved through the rescue experiment relative to the baseline aged phenotype other than an increased mineralization. Is it because these assays were done with the MC3T3 cell line and not primary digit explants? This is not explained sufficiently, and the in vitro assays using cell lines may not be an adequate proxy for aged tissue cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewers. To help explain, we have included language to support our choice of OAA, including its participation in the malate-aspartate shuttle and its ability to directly generate NADH in the mitochondria, hypothesizing that OAA would help meet the unmet bioenergetic need of the aged blastema. We have also included the data that drove this choice, showing that administration of OAA reduced the maximal respiration of aged blastemas (D10) (Figure 6A). Our additional spatial transcriptomics data analyzing newly formed bone in aged mice treated with OAA show that OAA in fact increases bioenergetics and proliferation in newly regenerated bone (D21) (Figure 7). We have built in language to better illustrate that this finding does not necessarily run counter to our objectives in this study. Our metabolic approach does not seek to reverse the aged phenotype so much as to provide the building blocks that are needed to fuel the increased bioenergetics in the aged blastema. We have also included language in the discussion highlighting the critical signaling of OxPhos-mediated ROS in limb regeneration and emphasizing the possibility that increased bioenergetics may be a critical piece of limb regeneration.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that needs to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In Figure 2, the Day O, 7, 10, 12, 14, 21, 28 42 MicroCT time course is used to show changes in age related delayed bone anabolism. The reviewer and editor found it unfortunate that a OAA treated vs vehicle control aged mouse time course was not supplied to demonstrate this enhanced anabolism. Measurement of bone volume, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation, of regenerated control and OAA treated bone at a single Day 28 timepoint does not tell the scientific community where the OAA is acting between 10 and 28 DPA. If these MicroCT measurements can be added reasonably quickly and would certainly help with the interpretation of the OAA effects on partially rescuing the aged bone anabolic defect. For example, if the OAA only altered bone volume between D21- D28 or if the OAA was acting earlier to advance the start the anabolism (D12-D14). If these measures cannot be collected quickly as the samples are not in hand, please expand the discussion to address this limitation of the paper. This will need to be done quickly to ensure the timely publication of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this observation. OAA is administered to the mice between day 10 and 28. We have included microCT analysis for trabecular volume, thickness and spacing for day 21 and show that while volume and thickness appear to be increasing, this is not yet statistically significant relevant to the control group. This data fortifies our findings in spatial transcriptomics (D21) that indeed OAA acts in advance to the start of anabolism.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that must be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The Age-related defect in P3 digit tip regeneration is most apparent in the timing of anabolism onset occurring between D12-D14 post-amputation. At D21 this manifests as a significant difference in Bone Volume. The Tb. thickness and Tb. spacing differences are not significant at D21 (in figure 2) and are only significant a D28. Taking this into consideration, the OAA treatment data presented (in figure 6) show no differences in bone volume, Tb. thickness and Tb. spacing at D21 and OAA effects are only really observed in volume and thickness at D28 with no differences in spacing. This could be interpreted as the effect of OAA not affecting the onset of anabolism at all, but rather providing support for late-stage remodeling phase. The authors MUST discuss this, as this interpretation contradicts the statement given by the authors that &quot;This data fortifies our findings in spatial transcriptomics (D21) that indeed OAA acts in advance to the start of anabolism.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for misunderstanding the requested revisions in our last submission. We are in complete agreement with the editors that we cannot completely discount the role of OAA in late-stage remodeling. Since the mouse was dosed with OAA through the blastema, early bone, and late bone stages, the OAA-dependent effect could come from OAA influence at any or all of these stages. Additional work is required to determine the exact mechanism through which OAA promotes regeneration. While we cannot rule out the role of OAA on promoting osteoblast mineralization during the late-stage remodeling phase, our transcriptional changes observed at D21 prior to any significant changes in microCT parameters, suggest that OAA, at least in part, effects changes during the early stages of osteogenic differentiation. We hope we have made these considerations more clear in our discussion, while at the same time acknowledging the limitations of the studies presented.</p></body></sub-article></article>
