We identified a small cluster of cholinergic neurons in the dorsal habenula (dHb) of zebrafish, defined by their expression of the <italic>lecithin retinol acyltransferase domain containing 2</italic> a (<italic>lratd2a</italic>) gene and their efferent connections with a subregion of the ventral interpeduncular nucleus (vIPN). The <italic>lratd2a</italic>-expressing neurons in the right dHb are innervated by a subset of mitral cells from both the left and right olfactory bulb and are activated upon exposure to the odorant cadaverine that is repellent to adult zebrafish. Using an intersectional strategy to drive expression of the botulinum neurotoxin specifically in these neurons, we find that adults no longer show aversion to cadaverine. Mutants with left-isomerized dHb that lack these neurons are also less repelled by cadaverine and their behavioral response to alarm substance, a potent aversive cue, is diminished. However, mutants in which both dHb have right identity appear more reactive to alarm substance. The results implicate an asymmetric dHb-vIPN neural circuit in the processing of repulsive olfactory cues and in modulating the resultant behavioral response.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>left-right asymmetry</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>lateralization</kwd><kwd>interpeduncular nucleus</kwd><kwd>cadaverine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD078220</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halpern</surname><given-names>Marnie E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37HD091280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Halpern</surname><given-names>Marnie E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An asymmetric olfactory projection innervates a small subset of identified neurons in the right habenula, which are activated by a repulsive odorant and mediate prolonged aversive behavior, providing further evidence for lateralization of the zebrafish brain.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fish use the sense of smell to search for food, detect danger, navigate, and communicate social information by detecting chemical cues in their aquatic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshihara, 2014</xref>). As with birds and mammals, perception of olfactory cues is lateralized and influences behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Siniscalchi, 2017</xref>). In zebrafish, nine glomerular clusters in the olfactory bulb (OB) receive olfactory information from sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium and, in turn, transmit signals to four forebrain regions: the posterior zone of the dorsal telencephalon (Dp), the ventral nucleus of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), the posterior tuberculum (PT), and the dorsal habenular region (dHb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyasaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshihara, 2014</xref>). In contrast to all other target regions, which are located on both sides of the forebrain, only the right nucleus of the dHb is innervated by mitral cells that emanate from medio-dorsal (mdG) and ventro-medial (vmG) glomerular clusters in both OBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyasaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoshihara, 2014</xref>). Moreover, calcium imaging experiments suggest that the right dHb shows a preferential response to odorants compared to the left dHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dreosti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jetti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). The identity of the post-synaptic neurons within the right dHb that receive olfactory input and the purpose of this asymmetric connection are unknown.</p><p>The habenulae are highly conserved structures in the vertebrate brain and, in teleosts such as zebrafish, consist of dorsal and ventral (vHb) nuclei, which are equivalent to the medial and lateral habenulae of mammals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amo et al., 2010</xref>). The neurons of the dHb are largely glutamatergic and contain specialized subpopulations that also produce acetylcholine, substance P, or somatostatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">deCarvalho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In zebrafish, the number of neurons within each subtype differs between the left and right dHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">deCarvalho et al., 2014</xref>). The dHb have been implicated in diverse states such as reward, fear, anxiety, sleep, and addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duboué et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hikosaka, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Okamoto et al., 2012</xref>). Accordingly, the right dHb was shown to respond to bile acid and involved in food-seeking behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the left dHb was found to be activated by light and attenuate fear responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dreosti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duboué et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). However, the properties of the dHb neurons implicated in these behaviors, such as their neurotransmitter identity and precise connectivity with their unpaired target, the midbrain interpeduncular nucleus (IPN), have yet to be determined.</p><p>Here, we describe a group of cholinergic neurons defined by their expression of the <italic>lecithin retinol acyltransferase domain containing 2</italic> a (<italic>lratd2a</italic>) gene [formerly known as <italic>family with sequence similarity 84 member B</italic> (<italic>fam84b</italic>)], that are predominantly located in the right dHb where they are selectively innervated by the olfactory mitral cells that originate from both sides of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyasaka et al., 2009</xref>), and form efferent connections with a restricted subregion of the ventral IPN (vIPN). Activity of the <italic>lratd2a</italic>-expressing neurons is increased following exposure to the aversive odorant cadaverine and, when these neurons are inactivated, adult zebrafish show a diminished repulsive response. Our findings provide further evidence for functional specialization of the left and right habenular nuclei and reveal the neuronal pathway that mediates a lateralized olfactory response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>lratd2a</italic>-expressing neurons in the right dHb receive bilateral olfactory input</title><p>A subset of medio-dorsal mitral cells that are labeled by <italic>Tg(lhx2a:gap-YFP</italic>) were previously shown to project their axons bilaterally through the telencephalon and terminate in the right dHb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miyasaka et al., 2009</xref>), in the vicinity of a small population of <italic>lratd2a</italic>-expressing neurons [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">deCarvalho et al., 2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>].

Interestingly, cadaverine predominantly activated neurons in the right dHb in larvae and adults, whereas neurons responsive to alarm substance were detected in both the left and right dHb nuclei of adult zebrafish.

This subtle behavioral effect suggests that the entire population of <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons may not be effectively inactivated in all animals. The described intersectional approach to suppress neuronal activity may be incomplete, as evidenced by the observed variability in <italic>BoTxBLC-GFP</italic> labeling between individual larvae. Additionally, compensatory mechanisms occurring between the onset of Cre expression in <italic>slc5a7a</italic> neurons (at 3 dpf) and adulthood could allow for partial recovery of the response to repulsive cues. It is also possible that the <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons are a heterogeneous population, with different subsets controlling the magnitude of the aversive response or the duration. More finely tuned techniques for temporal or spatial regulation of neuronal inactivation would help resolve these issues.</p><p>Despite both being aversive cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathuru et al., 2012</xref>), cadaverine and alarm substance elicit different behavioral responses by adult zebrafish. Control fish show active repulsion to cadaverine for the first to 2–4 min of a 5 min testing period, whereas alarm substance triggers immediate erratic behavior such as rapid swimming and darting that is typically followed by prolonged freezing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mathuru et al., 2012</xref>).

In contrast to juveniles or adults with <italic>BoTxBLC</italic> inactivated neurons that displayed a similar response to alarm substance as controls, <italic>tcf7l2<sup>zf55</sup></italic> mutants, showed no difference in their swimming behavior before and after its addition. One explanation is that many regions throughout the brain are likely involved in directing the complex repertoire of behaviors elicited by alarm substance and inactivation of <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons in the habenular region alone is insufficient to weaken the overall response. Furthermore, the <italic>tcf7l2<sup>zf55</sup></italic> mutation could disrupt other brain regions that regulate behaviors elicited by alarm substance since the <italic>tfc7l2</italic> gene is expressed in neurons throughout the brain, including the anterior tectum, dorsal thalamus and the hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Young et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Similar to <italic>tcf7l2<sup>zf55</sup></italic>, the <italic>bsx<sup>m1376</sup></italic> mutation is pleiotropic resulting in right-isomerization of the dHb due to the absence of the parapineal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schredelseker and Driever, 2018</xref>), and also the loss of the terminal tuberal hypothalamus, mammillary hypothalamic regions and secondary prosencephalon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schredelseker et al., 2020</xref>).

However, although homozygous mutants did show a hyperactive response to alarm substance, we cannot discount the involvement of other affected brain regions. Albeit technically challenging in adults, a more selective test such as optogenetic activation of only the <italic>lratd2a</italic> dHb neurons in wild-type and mutant zebrafish could help resolve their contribution to the alarm response.</p><p>The identification of a subset of neurons in the right dHb that receive olfactory input and terminate their axons at a defined subregion of the ventral IPN lays the groundwork for tracing an entire pathway from olfactory receptors to the neurons directing the appropriate behavioral response.

Transcriptional profiling of the IPN should yield useful information on its diverse neuronal populations and likely lead to the identification of the relevant post-synaptic targets in the ventral IPN and their efferent connections. Elaboration of this pathway may also help explain the advantage of lateralization in the processing of aversive information. It has been argued, for instance, that the antennal specialization to aversive odors in bees is correlated with directed turning away from the stimulus and escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rogers and Vallortigara, 2019</xref>). Directional turning has also been observed in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Horstick et al., 2020</xref>), but whether it is correlated with laterality of the Hb-IPN pathway is unclear. Beyond olfaction, left-right asymmetry appears to be a more general feature of stress-inducing, aversive responses as demonstrated for the rat ventral hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sakaguchi and Sakurai, 2017</xref>) and human pre-frontal cortex, where heightened anxiety also activates more neurons on the right than on the left (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avram

In brief, larvae and dissected brains were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (P6148, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 X PBS (phosphate-buffered saline) at 4 °C overnight. To synthesize RNA probes, the following restriction enzymes and RNA polymerases were used: <italic>lratd2a</italic> (<italic>Bam</italic>HI/T7), <italic>fos</italic> (<italic>Not</italic>I/SP6), <italic>slc5a7a</italic> (<italic>Not</italic>I/SP6), <italic>kctd12.1</italic> (<italic>Eco</italic>RI/T7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">deCarvalho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong et al., 2013</xref>).

Hybridized probes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies (Anti-Digoxigenin-AP, #11093274910, and Anti-Fluorescein-AP, #11426338910, Sigma-Aldrich) and visualized by staining with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT, #11383213001, Roche), 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate (BCIP, #11383221001, Roche) and 2-(4-Iodophenyl)–3-(4-nitrophenyl)–5-phenyltetrazolium Chloride (INT, #I00671G, Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Preparation of odorants</title><p>Alarm substance was freshly prepared on the day of testing. Adult zebrafish (6 female and six male) were anesthetized in 0.02% tricaine (E10521, Ethyl 3-aminobenzoate methanesulfonate; Sigma-Aldrich). Shallow lesions were made on the skin (10 on each side) using a fresh razor blade and single fish were consecutively immersed in a beaker containing distilled water (25 ml for <italic>fos</italic> experiment and 50 ml for behavioral analyses) for 30 s at 4 °C.

The cadaverine (#33211, final concentration 100 μM) and chondroitin sulfate (#c4384, 100 μg/ml) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and stock solutions prepared in distilled water.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Calcium imaging in larval zebrafish</title><p>To monitor activity within the same population of <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons in response to odorants or to a vehicle control, calcium signaling was performed on seven dpf <italic>Tg(lratd2a:QF2)<sup>c644</sup>; Tg(QUAS:GCaMP6f)<sup>c587</sup></italic> larvae. Larvae were paralyzed by immersion in α-bungarotoxin (20 µl of 1 mg/ml solution in system water, B1601, ThermoFisher Scientific) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duboué et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Severi et al., 2014</xref> followed by washing in fresh system water. Individuals were embedded in 1.5% low melting agarose (SeaPlaque Agarose, Lonza) in a petri dish (60 mm) with a custom-designed mold. After solidification, the agarose around the nostrils was carefully removed with forceps for access to odorants, and the individual immersed in fresh system water. The dish was placed under a 20 X (NA = 0.5) water immersion objective on a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope. Images were acquired in <italic>XYT</italic> acquisition mode with 512 × 200 pixel resolution at a rate of 2 Hz and digitized eight bit from single focal planes. The vehicle control (deionized water) followed by the odorant solution (0.2 ml) was slowly expelled through plastic tubing (Tygon R-3606; 0.8 mm ID, 2.4 mm OD) attached to a 1 ml syringe (BD 309659) and with the other end positioned in front of an individual’s face. Two sequential applications of each were spaced by 1 min intervals. To calculate fluorescence intensity, regions of interest (ROI) were manually drawn around each cell in the average focal plane with the polygon tool and ROI <italic>manage</italic> in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To normalize calcium activity for each neuron to baseline fluorescence, the fractional change in fluorescence (ΔF/F) was calculated before the application of odorants (average of 320 frames from each neuron), according to the formula F = (F<sub>i</sub>-F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>i</sub> is the fluorescence intensity at a single time point and F<sub>0</sub> is the baseline fluorescence. All data and images were analyzed using custom programs in MATLAB (MathWorks, version 7.3), Excel software and GraphPad Prism9.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Assay of <italic>Fos</italic> expression in adult zebrafish</title><p>Individual adult zebrafish (7–9 months old) were placed in a tank with 1 L system water and acclimated for at least 1 hr prior to odorant exposure. Each odorant solution (1 ml) was gently pipetted into the tank water and the fish was kept there as the odorant diffused. After 30 min, the fish was sacrificed in an ice water slurry, and the brain dissected out and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 X PBS overnight at 4 °C. Fixed brains were embedded in 4% low melting agarose in 1 X PBS and sectioned at 50 μm (for juvenile brains) or 70 μm (for adult brains) using a vibratome (VT1000S, Leica Biosystems, Inc). For more precise counting of <italic>fos</italic> expressing cells in adult brains, habenular sections were 35 μm thick. Sections were covered in 50% glycerol in 1 X PBS under coverslips. Bright-field images were captured with a Zeiss AxioCam HRc camera mounted on a Zeiss Axioskop. A Leica SP5 confocal microscope was used for fluorescent images.

Individual adults were placed in a 1.5 L test tank (Aquatic Habitats) in 1 L of system water and allowed to acclimate for at least 1 hr. For experiments with juveniles, individuals were acclimated to the behavior room for 1 hr, gently netted into the test tank (20 × 9 x 8.3 cm, 1.5 L mating cage) containing 0.6 L system water and maintained there for 5 min prior to testing. Swimming activity was recorded for 5 min (4 min for juveniles) before and after the application of odorants. Odorants (2 ml for adults, 1 ml for juveniles) were slowly expelled through plastic tubing (Tygon R-3606; 0.8 mm ID, 2.4 mm OD) attached on one end to a 3 ml syringe (BD 309657) and on the other positioned at one end of the test tank. A preference index was calculated using the formula: Preference to odorant = [(Total time spent in the half of the tank where odorant was delivered) − (Total time spent in the other half of the tank)]/Total time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Koide et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wakisaka et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The three reviewers have appreciated the novelty and originality of the study, but note that improved visualization, quantifications and statistical analyses will be necessary to fully support the conclusions of the manuscript. Without performing these quantifications and statistical tests for all figures as detailed below, the magnitude and significance of reported effects are not clear, nor do they take into account the variability of the measures and the dependence of some of the measures.</p><p>1. Anatomy (Figure 1):</p><p>The authors should verify the specificity of the novel transgenic lines generated in the study to target lratd2a+ neurons in the right dHb (some left dHb expression is seen in Figure 1C-E). In addition, improving the quantification of c-fos and lratd2a overlap is necessary.</p><p>2. Calcium imaging and response to chemical stimuli (Figure 2):</p><p>The effects of the aversive chemical stimuli on the calcium activity of the lratd2a+ cells in the dorsal habenula are not clear in the traces presented nor quantified for all cells in all fish recorded. As a matter of fact, the traces of single examples show responses to water alone and not a very clear effect of the olfactory cues. The statistics are lacking to compare the response to water, cadaverine and chondroitin sulfate. The authors should determine whether the olfactory stimulus used induced a larger response than water in the same cells. They should assess the variability across fish, and the reliability of the effects. We advise to use linear mixed models which are suited to take into account the variability of cells within the same fish, as well as the effect of clutch or day of the experiment. In order to to take into account the effect of time and pairing within the same cell that receives the water stimuli before the olfactory ones, we recommend using a linear mixed model with a fixed effect of time (measuring the average or max DFF before, during and after the chemical stimulation) and treatment (olfactory cue added), pairing values within the same cell and same fish.</p><p>3. Behavior (Figures 3 and 4):</p><p>The effects of genetic manipulations on the response to cadaverine and chondroitin sulfate should be quantified and compared across genotypes using a proper statistical tests. In the submitted manuscript, the authors only quantified an effect of the drug <italic>within</italic> each group using t-tests using only the last point before the drug was applied, instead of comparing <italic>between</italic> the groups the effects of different genotypes on the preference index at all time points (before and after the application of the olfactory cue). This is an issue for both figures, note that in Figure 4 the preference index during baseline might differ between the wild type and mutant group. The authors should use a two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), or Kruskal-Wallis test for non-parametric data, to assess differences between treatment groups over time for validation studies, and test the effect of the drug over time <italic>within</italic> each group and <italic>between</italic> conditions before and after. By doing so, the authors will determine whether there is an effect of time, whether there is an effect of genotype and if there is an effect of time, measure the effect of an interaction. Note that if the authors opt for the ANOVA, they should perform post hoc comparison tests using either the Tukey method (commonly used to make pairwise comparisons) by correcting for multiple testing or t-tests with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison. By doing so, the authors will determine whether there is an effect of time, whether there is an effect of genotype and measure the effect of a possible interaction.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Figure 1: Anatomy</p><p>To show that lratd2a+ neurons receive inputs from the olfactory bulb, the authors rely on gross low scale overlap of YFP+ axons on the soma of mApple-CAAX in the triple transgenic line lratd2a:QF2; QUAS:mApple-CAAX; lhx2a:YFP,</p><p>– A: First thing, add a quantification of (a) the number of neurons that are expressing lratd2a in the wild type fish at 7, 14, 21dpf and adult stage and (b) the number of neurons labeled in the lratd2a:QF2 transgenic line and the left and right side as it is central to the study – in the C panel, there seems to be expression of the transgene obtained by KI in the lratd2a locus (lratd2a:QF2)c601 in the left side.</p><p>– Next, add histological examinations or higher fluorescent images for panels D-D&quot;.</p><p>– Finally, can you specify if the overlap has been observed at the level of single planes or projections as it should be to suggest direct connectivity? If so, add a quantification to illustrate the overlap based on single planes from optical sections obtained on confocal with high mag and resolution and close up.</p><p>Figure 2: Calcium Imaging</p><p>– A: in order to understand whether the response of lratd2a+ neurons is specific to aversive cues: can you show the response to (a) water (as illustrated in B), (b) one other aversive cue as well as (c) one non aversive cues?</p><p>– A: for 14 dpf and response to chondroitin sulfate, please add the number of neurons missing.</p><p>– A: for 21 dpf and response to chondroitin sulfate, how come there are only 16 neurons measured instead of ~&gt;35 ? Does it mean that the line is variegated and numbers can vary from 15 to 40 in the right habenula?</p><p>– B: since spontaneous activity is large and we cannot conclude for single examples, panels need to show the variability across cells and not only single trace : (a) use mean and ste to show the intrinsic variability of the response across cells and (b) quantify the response by calculating the peak and subtracting the baseline averaged over a similar time window before stimulation.</p><p>– C: the response to cadaverine measured with cfos is not clearly overlapping with expression of lratd2a: the authors should perform double fluorescent in situ labeling to demonstrate the overlap at the cellular level.</p><p>Figure 3: Behavior of adult zebrafish expressing botulinum toxin in a subset of neurons in the right dorsal habenula.</p><p>– A-E: the authors should validate that the intersectional genetics combining a KI line, the QF2/QUAS and Cre under the scl5a7a promoter is effective to target the lratd2a neurons only and which proportion of them. On these images, it appears that the KI line has expression on the left Habenula as well.</p><p>– G-J: The effect of the expression of the botulinum toxin is not clear at all (for the preference index: T-test a single time points on a subset of them can be misleading) statistics need to be improved : if the data is quantified and plotted every minute, we would expect to compare the conditions before baseline and establish that there is no difference in preference index before addition of cadaverine, and that a difference is observed after the addition and quantify for how long.</p><p>For the alarm substance, the data is not represented the same as for cadaverine: in the single measure of before/after, there is no difference across genotypes in speed, onset time of the fast swim, or time between fast swimming and freezing. But would there be a difference for cadaverine using the same single measure of before/after ? Probably not.</p><p>The statistics and choice of parameters needs to be sorted out and represented fully and fairly with consistency across compounds and figures.</p><p>Figure 4: Behavior of left-isomerized adult zebrafish.</p><p>– Expression of lratd2a is affected in the dorsal right and ventral right and left habenula so the mutant does not reveal only the role of lratd2a+ neurons in the dorsal right locus.</p><p>– Same issue here for the behavior: the pre-condition appears possibly different for the homozygous mutant and control sibling. The authors should test whether there are any difference of preference index in the two groups before drug application, and after drug application.</p><p>– Why are again different parameters plotted in H-G for the alarm substance compared to cadaverine? In addition instead of time onset and interval between fast and freeze, duration in the top of the tank is quantified. This choice looks arbitrary and all parameters should be chosen and kept the same for comparing the effects of cadaverine and alarm substance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. If calcium imaging experiments were to be repeated, water and odorant cues should be alternated so a direct comparison can be made for individual neurons. Also, both sides of the habenula could be simultaneously imaged, with lratd2a neurons labeled with another (e.g. RFP) marker, to allow for comparison between left and right habenular responses.</p><p>2. Can c-fos experiments be performed on the lratd2a transgenic background in adults to facilitate quantification?</p><p>3. While not necessary for this paper, chemogenetic approaches (e.g. TRPV1 from Prober lab) could be useful to activate the population</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors of this work describe how cholinergic neurons expressing the lratd2a gene of the right dHb increase their activity to aversive odorant guiding aversive behaviors. The design of the study is very elegant, especially exciting is the combination of genetic tools that allow to label, as well as manipulate synaptic function. The authors present elegantly their data, and my impression is that this work deserves publication. The author may want to consider the following points:</p><p>1. The concepts of aversion and avoidance are confusing. Avoidance implies a form of learning (see reviews from J LeDoux) after an individual learns to anticipate an upcoming aversive stimulus. If I correctly interpreted the authors use a on-line reading of escape/aversive behaviour after inclusion of cadaverine. This should be probably better defined throughout the text.</p><p>2. At one point in the results the authors make use of a genetic approach allowing to control synaptic function with Botulinun neurotoxin. They state that &quot;Axons labeled by BoTxBLC-GFP terminated at the vIPN.…. suggesting that botulinum neurotoxin inhibits synaptic transmission within this restricted region of the vIPN&quot;. I understand the technology is used in published data, yet it would be elegant to show along with the behavioural results an assessment of collapsed synaptic function.</p><p>3. The authors use a labeling strategy that allows claiming that the cholinergic neurons innervate a precise area of the IPN, supporting previous data in literature. In their data set the authors however study the functional responses to cadaverine only in somata of these neurons. It would be extremely relevat in my opinion to show that calcium transients are also detectable in the Cholinergic axons in the IPN. This would corroborate the functional integration of aversive signal within this neuronal circuit, and not only within the right habenula.</p><p>4. The authors may want to consider referring to the following reviews when citing habenula work in rats, mice, and humans in the context of physiology and disease: Hailan Hu et al., 2020; Lecca et al., 2014; Proulx et al., 2014.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Specialized neurons in the right habenula mediate response to aversive olfactory cues&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor, and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The authors show an interesting role of a subpopulation of habenular neurons in the avoidance response to aversive olfactory cues. We thank the authors for improving the manuscript, particularly for repeating the calcium imaging experiments and for improving the data presentation. There are however some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Overall the behavioral differences to cadaverine shown in Figure 3G (Cre- vs Cre+) are relatively mild, especially as the aversion indices are significantly different from baseline in both Cre- and Cre+ condition (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B). Given that this is a key experiment in the paper, a discussion regarding whether this is a limitation of the existing tools (e.g. insufficient neurons silenced) or a reflection of underlying biology (e.g. redundancy in circuits for avoidance, different circuits controlling duration vs magnitude of aversion) would be beneficial.</p><p>2) Presentation of Figure 2c-d can be improved further – the same neurons presumably are being imaged &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;, however the way the data is currently plotted makes it look like they are independent neurons.</p><p>3) It is counterintuitive that a negative aversion index means stronger aversion (perhaps call it a preference index instead, or flip the signs so more positive = more aversive).</p><p>4) In the aversion assay (3G, 4E, 5F): can the authors clarify if some form of multiple comparisons correction was done in calculating the p-values at each time bin?</p><p>5) The authors have performed ANOVA on the aversion indices shown in the supplementary figures, and report a significant effect of odor and odor x group interaction. Is there a significant effect of group alone? there is no explicit mention of the aversion index in the main text, and no interpretation in the figure legends. For clarity, the authors should elaborate how the statistical results from this 2nd analysis method ties in with / complements the statistical methods used in the main figures.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for improving on the manuscript, particularly for repeating the calcium imaging experiments and for improving the data presentation.</p><p>While significant effort has been put into improving the statistics, I have some additional questions about the analyses performed and their interpretation. Ultimately I will defer to the other reviewers regarding whether they are satisfied with the current methods.</p><p>For the main figures, I was expecting a two-way ANOVA to be performed for the time course data in the aversion assay (3G, 4E, 5F) to compare main effects of group and time and group x time interactions. I understand the authors are using a different methodology here (signed rank test) which has also been applied in other papers – however, can I clarify if some form of multiple comparisons correction was done in calculating the p-values at each time bin?</p><p>The authors have performed ANOVA on the aversion indices shown in the supplementary figures, and report a significant effect of odor and odor x group interaction.

If calcium imaging experiments were to be repeated, water and odorant cues should be alternated so a direct comparison can be made for individual neurons.

We appreciate the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors of this work describe how cholinergic neurons expressing the lratd2a gene of the right dHb increase their activity to aversive odorant guiding aversive behaviors. The design of the study is very elegant, especially exciting is the combination of genetic tools that allow to label, as well as manipulate synaptic function. The authors present elegantly their data, and my impression is that this work deserves publication. The author may want to consider the following points:</p><p>1. The concepts of aversion and avoidance are confusing. Avoidance implies a form of learning (see reviews from J LeDoux) after an individual learns to anticipate an upcoming aversive stimulus. If I correctly interpreted the authors use an on-line reading of escape/aversive behaviour after inclusion of cadaverine. This should be probably better defined throughout the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this valuable feedback. We completely agree that avoidance could be a misleading term based on learning paradigms and have changed our language throughout to reflect aversion or repulsion, which gives a more accurate description of the observed behavioral response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. At one point in the results the authors make use of a genetic approach allowing to control synaptic function with Botulinun neurotoxin. They state that &quot;Axons labeled by BoTxBLC-GFP terminated at the vIPN.…. suggesting that botulinum neurotoxin inhibits synaptic transmission within this restricted region of the vIPN&quot;. I understand the technology is used in published data, yet it would be elegant to show along with the behavioural results an assessment of collapsed synaptic function.</p></disp-quote><p>We didn’t examine neuronal activity at the axon terminals in the BoTxBLC-GFP transgenic line, however, we confirmed that expression of BoTxBLC-GFP inhibits the touch response (refer to Video 1). To measure transmission in dHb axon terminals at the vIPN effectively will require electrophysiology or more sensitive transgenic tools. We concur that this will be useful for future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors use a labeling strategy that allows claiming that the cholinergic neurons innervate a precise area of the IPN, supporting previous data in literature. In their data set the authors however study the functional responses to cadaverine only in somata of these neurons. It would be extremely relevat in my opinion to show that calcium transients are also detectable in the Cholinergic axons in the IPN. This would corroborate the functional integration of aversive signal within this neuronal circuit, and not only within the right habenula.</p></disp-quote><p>A recent study (Zaupa et al., 2021) reported that “axon terminals of cholinergic and non-cholinergic habenular neurons exhibit stereotypic patterns of spontaneous activity that are negatively correlated and localize to discrete subregions of the target IPN” which has prompted us to consider the responses to odorants at the specific region of the IPN where the axons of <italic>lratd2a</italic> expressing neurons terminate. However, these axons are a small subset of the total cholinergic population and their terminals are challenging to visualize in vivo at larval stages. Such experiments will require us to adopt the explant approach used in Zaupa et al. or to develop transgenic lines to measure the responses of IPN neurons. As with the earlier point, we envision such strategies for our future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors may want to consider referring to the following reviews when citing habenula work in rats, mice, and humans in the context of physiology and disease: Hailan Hu et al., 2020; Lecca et al., 2014; Proulx et al., 2014.</p></disp-quote><p>The cited references describe functions of lateral/ventral habenulae. Our study focuses on the dorsal habenulae of zebrafish, which are equivalent to the medial not the lateral habenulae of rodents.

Given that this is a key experiment in the paper, a discussion regarding whether this is a limitation of the existing tools (e.g. insufficient neurons silenced) or a reflection of underlying biology (e.g. redundancy in circuits for avoidance, different circuits controlling duration vs magnitude of aversion) would be beneficial.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now elaborated on these points in the Discussion (page 14, line 281) as follows:</p><p>“As a group, zebrafish in which the synaptic activity of <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons in the right dHb was inhibited by <italic>BoTxBLC-GFP</italic> did not exhibit repulsion to cadaverine, although some individuals showed a mild aversive response that was not sustained relative to sibling controls. […] More finely tuned techniques for temporal or spatial regulation of neuronal inactivation would help resolve these issues.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Presentation of Figure 2c-d can be improved further – the same neurons presumably are being imaged &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot;, however the way the data is currently plotted makes it look like they are independent neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We now present the data in revised figures that clearly indicate the results from the same individual neurons before and after addition of odorants or vehicle control (refer to Figures 2C and 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is counterintuitive that a negative aversion index means stronger aversion (perhaps call it a preference index instead, or flip the signs so more positive = more aversive).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this feedback. We changed the aversive index to a preference index and we explain how this was measured in the Methods and in the Results (refer to revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figures 3G, 4E, Figure 4—figure supplement 1, Figure 5F and Figure 5—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the aversion assay (3G, 4E, 5F): can the authors clarify if some form of multiple comparisons correction was done in calculating the p-values at each time bin?</p></disp-quote><p>We now show new figures (3G, 4F and 5F) with the data analyzed by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's correction.

We now have analyzed all data by ANOVA followed by Bonferroni's correction and provide the results in the main figures (3G, 4F and 5F). We moved the previous graphs to supplemental figures (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A). For all experiments, we show the raw data for the response to cadaverine over time and used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare a set of matched samples (i.e., behavior before and after application of cadaverine by the same fish) within each group. We provide this information for all experimental paradigms in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and Figure 5—figure supplement 1A.</p><p>As recommended by the reviewer, we updated the following paragraphs in the Results section to describe how the results from different statistical methods tie in (page 9, line 174):</p><p>“To determine whether the <italic>lratd2a</italic> neurons in the right dHb contributed to the aversive response to cadaverine, we monitored the behavior within and between groups of adults that had or did not have the <italic>BoTxBLC-GFP</italic> transgene. Fish lacking the transgene showed a significantly reduced preference for the side of the tank where cadaverine had been applied (Figure 3G).</p><p>When the response of individual fish within each group was compared over time (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), adults with or without <italic>BoTxBLC-GFP</italic> initially avoided the side of the test tank where cadaverine had been introduced.
