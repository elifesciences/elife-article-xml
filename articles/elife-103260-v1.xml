Considerable debate remains over how mesolimbic dopamine responds to aversion and in the context of aversive conditioning. Inconsistencies may arise from the use of aversive stimuli that are transduced along different neural paths relative to reward or the conflation of responses to avoidance and aversion. Here, we made intraoral infusions of sucrose and measured how dopamine and behavioral responses varied to the changing valence of sucrose. Pairing intraoral sucrose with malaise via injection of lithium chloride (LiCl) caused the development of a conditioned taste aversion (CTA), which rendered the typically rewarding taste of sucrose aversive upon subsequent re-exposure. Following CTA formation, intraoral sucrose suppressed the activity of ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (VTA<sub>DA</sub>) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine release. This pattern of dopamine signaling after CTA is similar to intraoral infusions of innately aversive quinine and contrasts with responses to sucrose when it was novel or not paired with LiCl. Dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity to intraoral sucrose and predicted home cage sucrose preference. Further, dopamine responses scaled with the strength of the CTA, which was increased by repeated LiCl pairings and weakened through extinction. Thus, the findings demonstrate differential dopamine encoding of the same taste stimulus according to its valence, which is aligned to distinct behavioral responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ventral tegmental area</kwd><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>reward</kwd><kwd>aversion</kwd><kwd>motivation</kwd><kwd>reinforcement</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32DK128782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Maxine K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA025634</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roitman</surname><given-names>Jamie D</given-names></name><name><surname>Roitman</surname><given-names>Mitchell F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Phasic dopamine cell body activity and release in the nucleus accumbens differentially respond to the taste of sucrose in correlation with its hedonic valuation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA<sub>DA</sub>) and their release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) play key roles in the encoding of primary reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roitman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romo and Schultz, 1989</xref>), reward-related learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schultz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2017</xref>), and motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berridge and Robinson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Wise, 2004</xref>). Brief, phasic dopamine responses are evoked by primary rewarding stimuli and develop to their predictors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Konanur et al., 2024</xref>, for example). Pauses in dopamine activity are evoked by reward omission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sugam et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tobler et al., 2003</xref>). Collectively, these findings support a role for dopamine in signaling reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schultz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schultz, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Steinberg et al., 2013</xref>). This value-learning account has been more recently challenged to include the learning from, and updating of, the value of reward-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Coddington et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jeong et al., 2022</xref>). Yet there is little debate that dopamine increases to reward and reward-related cues. A role for dopamine in aversion and aversive conditioning is more controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>). Some recordings of VTA<sub>DA</sub> activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>) or dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mikhailova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wenzel et al., 2015</xref>) support increased signaling in aversion and aversive conditioning while others support decreased signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mileykovskiy and Morales, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roitman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Ungless et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Wheeler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref> for review).</p><p>The unsettled nature of dopamine signaling in aversion could be due to several factors. First, like reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berridge and Robinson, 2003</xref>), aversion is a multi-dimensional construct that ranges from involuntary responses to noxious primary stimuli to passive or active avoidance in response to predictors of aversion. Aversive stimuli have included foot/tail shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mileykovskiy and Morales, 2011</xref>), air puffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mirenowicz and Schultz, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>), painful pinches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romo and Schultz, 1989</xref>), and white noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goedhoop et al., 2022</xref>). These are transduced along different sensory pathways (i.e., pain, somatosensory, auditory) from reward (typically gustatory; e.g., sucrose). Even when administering rewarding and aversive stimuli that utilize the same sensory pathway, as with taste, rewarding sweet and aversive bitter solutions activate different taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schier and Spector, 2019</xref>). Complicating the picture further, mesolimbic dopamine responses to noxious stimuli have been assayed in anesthetized animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brischoux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Budygin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romo and Schultz, 1989</xref>) – making behavioral assessment of aversion impossible. In awake, behaving recordings, behavioral paradigms often permit the avoidance of aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>), which can ultimately be rewarding. To facilitate the sampling of aversive stimuli, water or food deprivation protocols are often used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gordon-Fennell et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hurley et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Miranda et al., 2023</xref>). However, dopamine responses are modulated by physiological state (i.e., hunger, thirst, sodium appetite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cone et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fortin and Roitman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsu et al., 2020</xref>), presenting a further confound in interpreting mesolimbic responses.</p><p>To overcome these limitations, we measured lateral VTA<sub>DA</sub> neural activity and dopamine release in the lateral shell of the NAc using fiber photometry as we varied the valence of intraoral sucrose infusions. NAc lateral shell dopamine differentially encodes cues predictive of rewarding (i.e., sipper spout with sucrose) and aversive stimuli (i.e., footshock), which is distinct from other subregions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). It is important to note that other regions of the NAc may serve as hedonic hotspots for example, dorsomedial shell; or may more closely align with the signaling of salience (e.g., ventromedial shell; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yuan et al., 2019</xref>). In Paired rats, the valence of sucrose was changed by subsequently administering lithium chloride (LiCl) – which induces visceral malaise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 1992</xref>) and reliably conditions a taste aversion (CTA; Garcia et al., 1 955; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Garcia and Kimeldorf, 1957</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Nachman and Ashe, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nolan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Swank and Bernstein, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Thiele et al., 1996</xref>). In Unpaired rats, sucrose valence was unchanged by injecting LiCl 24 hr after intraoral sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Roll, 1967</xref>). Changes in valence were strengthened through multiple pairings of sucrose and LiCl or weakened through extinction. Throughout, rats were fed and watered ad libitum to avoid physiological need as a confound. To assay the stereotypical appetitive and aversive behavioral responses to taste stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Breslin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grill and Norgren, 1978a</xref>), we used a deep-learning algorithm (DeepLabCut, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>) and home cage sucrose preference task to assess the valence of intraoral sucrose. Across testing, VTA<sub>DA</sub> activity and dopamine release in the NAc differentially responded to sucrose taste based on its affective value ascertained from behavioral reactivity and sucrose preference. Thus, we conclude that the mesolimbic dopamine system differentially encodes valence – reward versus aversion – and flexibly for the same stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NAc dopamine differentially responds to primary taste stimuli and correlates with differential behavioral reactivity</title><p>We expressed the dopamine fluorescent sensor AAV1.Syn.Flex.GRAB_DA2h (GRAB_DA2h) in the lateral shell of the NAc and recorded real-time fluorescence via an indwelling fiber optic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Specifically, intraoral infusions of appetitive taste stimuli evoke mouth movements and tongue protrusions, but the head and body are relatively still. In contrast, aversive taste stimuli cause gapes, headshakes, forelimb flails, and chin rubs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grill and Norgren, 1978a</xref>) – and, therefore, greater head and whole-body movement. We hypothesized that these responses could be well captured by measuring movement of the nose and forepaws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Here, we circumvent common obstacles to determining responses to aversive stimuli by capturing real-time dopamine responses to the same taste stimulus – sucrose – and modulating its valence through conditioning. Intraoral delivery of sucrose eliminated avoidance as a potential confound. Measurement of behavior ensured that rats were responding to the intraoral infusion, eliminating differences in stimulus salience as a contributing factor. A key aspect of our paradigms is that all rats had identical exposure to sucrose and illness with the temporal proximity of sucrose and illness being the lone difference. Ultimately, we show that dopamine responses to sucrose scale with valence across acquisition and extinction of a CTA.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Phasic dopamine activity differentially encodes the valence of primary appetitive and aversive taste stimuli</title><p>Dopamine responses to primary aversive stimuli are mixed.

With respect to taste stimuli specifically, some reports indicate decreased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roitman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Twining et al., 2015</xref>), while others report increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bassareo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>) dopamine responses to bitter quinine. Here, we used intraoral delivery of appetitive and aversive taste stimuli to circumvent confounds including active or passive avoidance, and food or water deprivation. Recordings were targeted to the lateral VTA and the corresponding approximate terminal site in the NAc lateral shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lammel et al., 2008</xref>). Subregional differences in dopamine activity likely contribute to mixed findings on dopamine and affect. For example, dopamine in the NAc lateral shell differentially encodes cues predictive of rewarding sucrose and aversive footshock, which is distinct from NAc medial shell dopamine responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">de Jong et al., 2019</xref>). Our findings are similar to prior work from our group targeting recordings of the NAc dorsomedial shell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hsu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McCutcheon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roitman et al., 2008</xref>): there, intraoral sucrose increased NAc dopamine release while the response in the same rats to quinine was significantly lower. Neuroanatomical data support projections to the VTA from relatively early nodes of the gustatory pathway (e.g., parabrachial nucleus; PBN) and specifically sucrose and quinine-responsive neurons in the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boughter et al., 2019</xref>). It remains to be determined if sucrose- and quinine-responsive PBN neurons synapse onto different VTA cell types (e.g., dopamine neurons for the former and GABA neurons for the latter). Regardless, it is important to recognize that affective coding of stimuli may differ across VTA and NAc subregions and in response to different classes of stimuli (e.g., pain, taste).</p><p>Differences in stimulus salience could contribute to the dopamine responses observed here. Indeed, recent work has supported dopamine alignment with the encoding of stimulus salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen and Bruchas, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kutlu et al., 2021</xref>) to contribute to prioritizing attentional processes toward stimuli of high intensity. Further, human VTA activation is greater for novel, more highly salient stimuli than to familiar stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bunzeck and Düzel, 2006</xref>). Here, behavioral responses to quinine were greater than those for sucrose supporting quinine as a highly salient stimulus. Nonetheless, the strong inverse relationship between behavioral reactivity and dopamine release observed here, and particularly the lack of a dopamine response to quinine refutes the idea that phasic dopamine encodes the salience of the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Phasic dopamine activity differentially encodes appetitive versus aversive sucrose</title><p>The differential dopamine response to appetitive and aversive tastes supports affective encoding by the mesolimbic system. However, sucrose and quinine act on different taste receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schier and Spector, 2019</xref>) and may access the VTA via parallel pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boughter et al., 2019</xref>). We therefore employed a CTA paradigm to measure dopamine responses to the same stimulus when the stimulus was appetitive versus aversive. While dopamine responses were identical across groups on CD (when rats were initially naive to intraoral sucrose), pairing intraoral sucrose infusions with LiCl injection caused changed, suppressed dopamine responses to intraoral sucrose when it was next administered (TD). Importantly, the temporal relationship between illness and initial sucrose exposure, as in seminal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Smith and Roll, 1967</xref>), determined both the formation of a CTA (as evidence in behavioral reactivity measures) and suppressed dopamine activity and release. Indeed, LiCl injection administered 24 hr after intraoral sucrose (Unpaired) failed to modulate dopamine signaling. Recent work has suggested that dopamine release from terminals within the NAc could result from intra-NAc processes that are independent of cell body activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cachope and Cheer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mohebi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Threlfell et al., 2012</xref>). However, we found similar modulation of dopamine responses in Paired rats when recordings captured NAc dopamine release or VTA<sub>DA</sub> cell body activity. Our data are more consistent with the good agreement between dopamine cell body activity, release, and post-synaptic signaling reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Local GABA neurons innervate and suppress VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons through neurotransmission at GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which can pause VTA<sub>DA</sub> activity and downstream dopamine release in the NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mathon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">van Zessen et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding local GABA dynamics will be an intriguing direction to identify mechanisms for suppression of dopamine signaling to innately aversive tastes as well as those that have acquired aversion through conditioning.</p><p>Throughout our studies, we found an inverse relationship between dopamine release/activity and behavioral reactivity to intraoral infusions. Decreases in dopamine activity can lead to an uncoupling of dopamine and high-affinity dopamine D2-like receptors expressed on medium spiny neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dreyer et al., 2010</xref>). In turn, this could contribute to the different patterns of NAc activity reported for rewarding versus aversive primary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Roitman et al., 2005</xref>) and conditioned tastes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Roitman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wheeler et al., 2008</xref>). As manipulations of NAc activity can influence taste reactivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Morales and Berridge, 2020</xref>), differential dopamine responses to sucrose in rats with versus without CTA likely applies a critical filter for NAc processing in the service of oromotor output.</p><p>In our purely classical conditioning CTA paradigm, taste (i.e., intraoral sucrose) served as a conditioned stimulus for visceral malaise. Other aversive conditioning paradigms have shown development of decreased dopamine responses to cues predictive of primary aversive stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goedhoop et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref>). There are unique aspects of CTA worth emphasizing. As we’ve shown here, CTA can form with just one taste–illness pairing. In addition, CTA tolerates relatively long delays between the conditioned (taste) and unconditioned stimulus (LiCl). While LiCl was injected immediately after the conditioning session, this interval exceeded 30 min from the initial taste exposure. Moreover, indices of the malaise induced by LiCl do not emerge for many minutes, for example, ~5 min for lying on belly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>), ~20 min for pica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilar-Rivera et al., 2020</xref>), and ~20 min for decrease in core body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Guimaraes et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, taste and illness memory traces must be integrated over many minutes. The PBN is essential for CTA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Spector et al., 1992</xref>) and contains neurons that process gustatory and illness information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter et al., 2015</xref>). The amygdala is also critical for CTA acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Inui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Morris et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">St. Andre and Reilly, 2007</xref>). The same neurons within the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala are responsive to both novel taste and LiCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barot et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Zimmerman et al., 2024</xref>). The rostral tegmental nucleus (RMTg) is a robust source of GABAergic input onto VTA<sub>DA</sub> neurons and suppresses their firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balcita-Pedicino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourdy et al., 2014</xref>). Primary aversive stimuli, including LiCl, increase RMTg neuronal firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Further, re-exposure to LiCl-paired saccharin increases cFos expression in the RMTg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glover et al., 2016</xref>). Likewise, LiCl injections suppress electrically evoked NAc dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fortin et al., 2016</xref>). How taste and illness traces and their integration ultimately modulate the mesolimbic system is an important ongoing direction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Suppression of dopamine signaling scales with CTA expression and extinction</title><p>Multiple conditioning trials caused greater suppression in dopamine activity evoked by the sucrose CS. This has been previously reported for audiovisual cues that predict discrete, noxious stimuli (e.g., air puff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Zhuo et al., 2024</xref> and foot shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Wilkinson et al., 1998</xref>). Here, greater suppression occurred with each taste–illness pairing over just three conditioning trials spaced days apart. Taste, relative to other sensory stimuli, serves as a uniquely strong predictor for illness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Garcia and Koelling, 1966</xref>). After establishing CTA, repeated re-exposure to the conditioned stimulus without subsequent malaise drives CTA extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cantora et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mickley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Nolan et al., 1997</xref>), allowing for new, contextual knowledge to conflict with the original association between the taste and negative post-ingestive outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bouton and Bolles, 1979</xref>). We found that the suppressed dopamine response to sucrose gradually returned to conditioning day levels after repeated extinction sessions. The number of extinction sessions needed for the restoration of dopamine signaling scaled with the number of conditioning sessions (i.e., two extinction sessions for one pairing and five extinction sessions for three pairings). The return of dopamine responses to conditioning day levels was not simply due to the passage of time but rather required CS re-exposure. As with all experiments herein, dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioral reactivity across acquisition and extinction. Importantly, dopamine responses to intraoral sucrose were also predictive of home cage sucrose preference across extinction. The infralimbic (IL) cortex plays a role in extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Quirk et al., 2006</xref>). Stimulation of the IL suppresses aversive taste reactivity to sucrose after it had been paired with LiCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hurley and Carelli, 2020</xref>). Thus, while initial taste–LiCl associations may be due to subcortical (e.g., PBN, RMTg, amygdala) influences on sucrose-evoked VTA<sub>DA</sub> activity and NAc dopamine release, extinction of the suppressed dopamine response to sucrose may well engage top–down cortical processes.</p><p>Our studies support a role for dopamine in differentially encoding taste valence. It is important to recognize that there is considerable heterogeneity among dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Phillips et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, VTA neurons that release both glutamate and dopamine are important for aversion, and it is the dopamine signal from these neurons that is critical for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Warlow et al., 2024</xref>). The technical approaches used here to measure VTA<sub>DA</sub> activity and dopamine release in the NAc average responses across an unknown number of neurons. Thus, while our results suggest that most lateral VTA dopamine neurons decrease their activity and release of dopamine in the NAc lateral shell is lower to primary and conditioned aversive taste, subpopulations likely play different and critical roles in appetitive and aversive responses. Combining molecular markers and defining input/output relationships for VTA dopamine neurons will be critical for further advancing an understanding of dopamine and aversion. A range of clinically used drugs – from anti-obesity treatments to chemotherapeutics – induce malaise and can lead to the development of CTAs and a reduction in motivation. Thus, further understanding of how these associative processes influence dopamine signaling is important to yield therapeutic approaches with greater efficacy and improved adherence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Male and female (intact, naturally cycling) Long Evans rats (&gt;250 g) were bred from females heterozygous for expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the tyrosine hydroxylase promoter (TH:Cre) (Rat Research Resource Center, RRRC No. 659; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Witten et al., 2011</xref>) and male wildtype rats (Charles River Laboratories).

Custom MATLAB scripts are available in the public repository, Github (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/maxineloh/loh-elife-2024">https://github.com/maxineloh/loh-elife-2024</ext-link>, copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loh, 2025</xref>; GNU General Public License v3.0).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Intraoral infusion protocols</title><p>Before each session, intraoral catheters were flushed with distilled water to ensure patency. All training and experimental sessions took place in standard chambers (ENV-009A-CT, Med Associates Inc) or custom-made cylindrical chambers for behavioral reactivity recordings. At the start of a session, a fluid line from a syringe containing a test solution was gravity-fed into a two-way solenoid valve (The Lee Company) and the fluid line exiting the solenoid was connected to the intraoral catheter. A TTL from Med Associates software and hardware triggered the opening and closing of the solenoid valve. Rats were habituated to receive 30 brief (5 s, 200 µl) intraoral infusions of water repeated at varying intertrial intervals (35–55 s) for 2 days. Intraoral delivery ensured that rats tasted the stimulus but were not obligated to consume it. This session structure was used throughout all experimental conditions detailed below.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Primary taste</title><p>Rats received intraoral infusions of either 0.3 M sucrose or 0.001 M quinine and received the other solution the following day with solution order counterbalanced across rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Single-pairing CTA</title><p>After habituation, all rats underwent a 3-day training cycle. The first day was CD, where rats received intraoral infusions of 0.3 M sucrose and were randomly assigned to either the Paired or Unpaired group. Immediately after the CD session, rats were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.; 20 ml/kg) with either 0.15 M LiCl for Paired rats or 0.15 M NaCl for Unpaired rats. On the second day, rats did not receive intraoral infusions. Instead, they were injected with the counterbalanced treatment and returned to the home cage. On the third day, rats were left undisturbed in their home cage. This 3-day CTA training cycle was followed by the TD, in which rats received a session of intraoral infusions of sucrose with no subsequent injections.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Single-pairing CTA with extinction</title><p>Treatment of Paired and Unpaired animals was the same as Single-pairing CTA above except that TD served as the first (E1) of five extinction sessions (E1–E5). For each extinction day, a session of intraoral infusions was administered as on TD. Extinction sessions were administered on consecutive days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Delayed-test CTA</title><p>The same procedure as the Single-pairing CTA paradigm was used. However, TD was not performed until 7 days after CD, to match the interval from CD to E5 from the Single-pairing CTA with Extinction condition.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Repeated-pairing CTA with extinction</title><p>Paired and Unpaired animals underwent three conditioning cycles (C1–C3) of the procedure described in Single-pairing CTA. Following the conclusion of the third cycle, extinctions sessions were administered for 8 consecutive days (E1–E8).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Two-Bottle Preference test</title><p>After each Extinction session, rats were returned to the home cage and given 2 hr access to two sipper bottles, one containing 0.3 M sucrose and the other water. Bottle locations were switched after 1 hr to avoid a side bias. Change in bottle weight from before to after 2 hr access was used to calculate sucrose preference as sucrose consumed (g)/total fluid consumed (g).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Behavioral recordings</title><p>Behavior in all sessions was video captured at 10 fps for later analysis. In the Primary taste and Single-pairing CTA conditions, rats were recorded in a cylindrical chamber with a clear floor using an adjacent video camera (Teledyne FLIR, Model: BFS-U3-13Y3M-C) that captured behavioral reactivity via the reflection from an angled mirror positioned under the chamber (below view, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Grill and Norgren, 1978a</xref>). In the studies of Single- and Repeated-pairing CTA with Extinction and Delayed-test CTA, rats were recorded in standard Med Associates chambers with a camera (Wo-We Webcam 720P) positioned above the chamber (above view). Video was monitored using recording software (below view: Teledyne FLIR, Spinnaker SDK; above view: Synapse, Tucker Davis Technologies) and stored for off-line analysis. A custom Med Associates program, linked to the camera’s operation, sent TTLs to time stamp the onset and offset of the video recordings on the fiber photometry software (Synapse, Tucker Davis Technologies) to later sync video to photometry recordings.</p><p>Behavioral reactivity was calculated as the change in movement from the 5-s pre-infusion period to the 5-s intraoral infusion. Positional coordinates for body parts of the rat were obtained using the open-source deep-neural network toolbox, DeepLabCut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mathis et al., 2018</xref>). A custom DeepLabCut model was developed and implemented to track the nose, forepaws, and chamber legs (for scale) in the below view recordings. For above view recordings, a different DeepLabCut model was developed to track the ears and chamber corners. Custom MATLAB codes were employed to calculate the midpoint between the ears (reported as head position) and track distance moved during specified time points, using the coordinates from stationary landmarks (i.e., chamber legs and corners) to normalize distances from pixels to metric units. Any coordinates with model likelihood estimates below 95% were excluded (≤9% of timepoints) and replaced with the linear interpolation of coordinates at neighboring high-confidence timepoints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Following completion of experiments, rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl followed by 10% buffered formalin solution (HT501320, Sigma-Aldrich). Brains were removed and stored in formalin and switched to 20% sucrose the following morning. All brains were sectioned at 40 μm on a freezing stage microtome (SM2010R, Leica Biosystems). Sections were collected and processed to fluorescently tag GFP (as an indicator of GCaMP6f or GRAB_DA2h expression) and/or TH via immunohistochemistry. Primary antibodies were incubated at 4°C (washes and other steps at room temperature). Tissues were washed with 1× potassium phosphate-buffered saline (KPBS) six times for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 for 30 min and blocked in 2% normal donkey serum for 30 min. Sections were incubated in rabbit anti-TH (AB152, Sigma-Aldrich) and/or chicken anti-GFP (AB13907, Abcam) antibodies overnight (∼18 hr). After six 10-min 1× KPBS washes, secondary antibody (Cy3 conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and AF488 conjugated donkey anti-chicken; Jackson Immunoresearch) was applied and sections were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature followed by a single wash. Sections were then mounted onto glass slides, air dried, and coverslipped with Fluoroshield with DAPI (F6057, Sigma-Aldrich). Data from rats with GFP expression and fiber placements within the borders of the VTA or NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paxinos and Watson, 2007</xref>) were included in analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Data analyses</title><p>To quantify results from in vivo fiber photometry experiments, the mean <italic>z</italic>-score during the 5-s infusion period was measured on each trial and averaged across trials for each session. One- or two-way repeated measures ANOVA or paired <italic>t</italic>-tests were used for statistical comparisons. When group main effects were found with two or more treatments, Tukey’s (for one-way ANOVAs) and Šidák’s (for two-way ANOVAs) post hoc tests were employed. Linear regression was used to calculate p-values, <italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> goodness-of-fit, 95% confidence bands of the best-fit line, and linear equations for average dopamine response versus average behavioral reactivity or sucrose preference score. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. These statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 10.0 Software (GraphPad Software Inc).</p><p>Finally, we performed ROC analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Green and Swets, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cone et al., 2015</xref>) to quantify how discriminable neural responses were to different test conditions via R Studio using the pROC package (package version 1.18.5, RStudio Team (2020), code available on GitHub <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Robin et al., 2011</xref>). For each trial, we measured the mean <italic>z</italic>-score during the 5-s intraoral infusion period. The analysis shows the ability of an ideal observer to classify a neural response as driven by sucrose/Unpaired infusion (compared with quinine/Paired). We plotted the rate of hits as a function of false alarm rate across a range of thresholds determined as the mean of the difference between consecutive values of observed <italic>z</italic>-scores. We then computed the area under the ROC curve (AUC<sub>ROC</sub>) and used a threshold of AUC<sub>ROC</sub> &gt;0.7 to indicate that an ideal observer could reliably discriminate between conditions.

Using an elegant approach, they show that sucrose, which normally evokes strong dopamine neuron activity and release in the nucleus accumbens, is made aversive via conditioned taste aversion, the same sucrose stimulus later evokes much less dopamine neuron activity and release. Thus, dopamine activity can dynamically track the changing valence of an unconditioned stimulus. These results are important for helping clarify valence and value related questions that are the matter of ongoing debate regarding dopamine functions in the field.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is an elegant way to ask this question, the within subject's design and the continuity of the stimulus is a strong way to remove a lot of the common confounds that make it difficult to interpret valence-related questions. I think these are valuable studies that help tie up questions in the field while also setting up a number of interesting future directions. There are number of control experiments and tweaks to the design that help eliminate a number of competing hypotheses regarding the results. The data are clearly presented and contextualized.</p><p>Weaknesses for consideration:</p><p>The focus on one relatively understudied region of the rat striatum for dopamine recordings could potentially limit generalization of the findings. While this can be determined in future studies, the implications should be further discussed in the current manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103260.2.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>Koh et al. report an interesting manuscript studying dopamine binding in the lateral accumbens shell of rats across the course of conditioned taste aversion. The question being asked here is how does the dopamine system respond to aversion? The authors take advantage of unique properties of taste aversion learning (notably, within-subjects remapping of valence to the same physical stimulus) to address this.</p><p>They combine a well controlled behavioural design (including key, unpaired controls) with fibre photometry of dopamine binding via GrabDA and of dopamine neuron activity by gCaMP, careful analyses of behaviour (e.g., head movements; home cage ingestion), the authors show that, (1) conditioned taste aversion of sucrose suppresses the activity of VTA dopamine neurons and lateral shell dopamine binding to subsequent presentations of the sucrose tastant; (2) this pattern of activity was similar to the innately aversive tastant quinine; (3) dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioural (inferred taste reactivity) reactivity; and (4) dopamine responses tracked the contingency of between sucrose and illness because these responses recovered across extinction of the conditioned taste aversion.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are important strengths here. The use of a well-controlled design, the measurement of both dopamine binding and VTA dopamine neuron activity, the inclusion of an extinction manipulation; and the thorough reporting of the data. I was not especially surprised by these results, but these data are a potentially important piece of the dopamine puzzle (e.g., as the authors note, salience-based argument struggles to explain these data).</p><p>Weaknesses for consideration:</p><p>(1) The focus here is on the lateral shell. This is a poorly investigated region in the context of the questions being asked here. Indeed, I suspect many readers might expect a focus on the medial shell. So, I think this focus is important. But, I think it does warrant greater attention in both the introduction and discussion. We do know from past work that there can be extensive compartmentalisation of dopamine responses to appetitive and aversive events and many of the inconsistent findings in the literature can be reconciled by careful examination of where dopamine is assessed. I do think readers would benefit from acknowledgement this - for example it is entirely reasonable to suppose that the findings here may be specific to the lateral shell.</p><p>(2) Relatedly, I think readers would benefit from an explicit rationale for studying the lateral shell as well as consideration of this in the discussion. We know that there are anatomical (PMID: 17574681), functional (PMID: 10357457), and cellular (PMID: 7906426) differences between the lateral shell and the rest of the ventral striatum. Critically, we know that profiles of dopamine binding during ingestive behaviours there can be highly dissimilar to the rest of ventral striatum (PMID: 32669355). I do think these points are worth considering.</p><p>(3) I found the data to be very thoughtfully analysed. But in places I was somewhat unsure:</p><p>(a) Please indicate clearly in the text when photometry data show averages across trials versus when they show averages across animals.</p><p>(b) I did struggle with the correlation analyses, for two reasons.</p><p>(i) First, the key finding here is that the dopamine response to intraoral sucrose is suppressed by taste aversion. So, this will significantly restrict the range of dopamine transients, making interpretation of the correlations difficult.</p><p>(ii) Second, the authors report correlations by combining data across groups/conditions. I understand why the authors have done this, but it does risk obscuring differences between the groups. So, my question is: what happens to this trend when the correlations are computed separately for each group? I suspect other readers will share the same question. I think reporting these separate correlations would be very helpful for the field - regardless of the outcome.</p><p>(4) Figure 1A is not as helpful as it might be. I do think readers would expect a more precise reporting of GCaMP expression in TH+ and TH- neurons. I also note that many of the nuances in terms of compartmentalisation of dopamine signalling discussed above apply to ventral tegmental area dopamine neurons (e.g. medial v lateral) and this is worth acknowledging when interpreting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103260.2.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study helps to clarify the mixed literature on dopamine responses to aversive stimuli. While it is well accepted that dopamine in the ventral striatum increases in response to various rewarding and appetitive stimuli, aversive stimuli have been shown to evoke phasic increases or decreasing depending on the exact aversive stimuli, behavioral paradigm, and/or dopamine recording method and location examined. Here the authors use a well-designed set of experiments to show differential responses to an appetitive primary reward (sucrose) that later becomes a conditioned aversive stimulus (sucrose previously paired with lithium chloride in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm). The results are interesting and add valuable data to the question of how the mesolimbic dopamine system encodes aversive stimuli, however, the conclusions are strongly stated given that the current data do not necessarily align with prior conflicting data in terms of recording location, and it is not clear exactly how to interpret the generally biphasic dopamine response to the CTA-sucrose which also evolves over exposures within a single session.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The authors nicely demonstrate that their two aversive stimuli examined, quinine and sucrose following CTA, evoked aversive facial expressions and paw movements that differed from those following rewarding sucrose to support that the stimuli experienced by the rats differ in valence.</p><p>• Examined dopamine responses to the exact same sensory stimuli conditioned to have opposing valences, avoiding standard confounds of appetitive and aversive stimuli being sensed by different sensory modalities (i.e., sweet taste vs. electric shock).</p><p>• The authors examined multiple measurements of dopamine activity - cell body calcium (GCaMP6f) in midbrain and release in NAc (Grab-DA2h), which is useful as the prior mixed literature on aversive dopamine responses comes from a variety of recording methods.</p><p>• Correlations between sucrose preference and dopamine signals demonstrate behavioral relevance of the differential dopamine signals.</p><p>• The delayed testing experiment in Figure 7 nicely controls for the effect of time to demonstrate that the &quot;rewarding&quot; dopamine response to sucrose only recovers after multiple extinction sucrose exposures to extinguish the CTA.</p><p>Weaknesses for consideration:</p><p>• Regional differences in dopamine signaling to aversive stimuli are mentioned in the introduction and discussion. For instance, the idea that dopamine encodes salience is strongly argued against in the discussion, but the paper cited as arguing for that (Kutlu et al. 2021) is recording from the medial core in mice. Given other papers cited in the text about the regional differences in dopamine signaling in the NAc and from different populations of dopamine neurons in midbrain, it's important to mention this distinction wrt to salience signaling. Relatedly, the text says that the lateral NAc shell was targeted for accumbens recordings, but the histology figure looks like the majority of fibers were in the anterior lateral core of NAc. For the current paper to be a convincing last word on the issue, it would be extremely helpful to have similar recordings done in other parts of the NAc to do a more thorough comparison against other studies.</p><p>• Dopamine release in the NAc never dips below baseline for the conditioned sucrose. Is it possible to really consider this as a signal for valence per se, as opposed to it being a weaker response relative to the original sucrose response?</p><p>• Related to this, the main measure of the dopamine signal here, &quot;mean z-score,&quot; obscures the temporal dynamics of the aversive dopamine response across a trial. This measure is used to claim that sucrose after CTA is &quot;suppressing&quot; dopamine neuron activity and release, which is true relative to the positive valence sucrose response. However, both GRAB-DA and cell-body GCaMP measurements show clear increases after onset of sucrose infusion before dipping back to baseline or slightly below in the average of all example experiments displayed. One could point to these data to argue either that aversive stimuli cause phasic increases in dopamine (due to the initial increase) or decreases (due to the delayed dip below baseline) depending on the measurement window. Some discussion of the dynamics of the response and how it relates to the prior literature would be useful.</p><p>- Would this delayed below-baseline dip be visible with a shorter infusion time?</p><p>- Does the max of the increase or the dip of the decrease better correlate with the behavioral measures of aversion (orofacial, paw movements) or sucrose preference than &quot;mean z-score&quot; measure used here?</p><p>- The authors argue strongly in the discussion against the idea that dopamine is encoding &quot;salience.&quot; Could this initial peak (also seen in the first few trials of quinine delivery, fig 1c color plot) be a &quot;salience&quot; response?</p><p>• Related to this, the color plots showing individual trials show a reduction in the increases to positive valence sucrose across conditioning day trials and a flip from infusion-onset increase to delayed increases across test day trials. This evolution across days makes it appear that the last few conditioning day trials would be impossible to discriminate from the first few test day trials in the CTA-paired. Presumably, from strength of CTA as a paradigm, the sucrose is already aversive to the animals at the first trial of test day. Why do the authors think the response evolves across this session?</p><p>• Given that most of the work is using a conditioned aversive stimulus, the comparison to a primary aversive tastant quinine is useful. However, the authors saw basically no dopamine response to a primary aversive tastant quinine (measured only with GRAB-DA) and saw less noticeable decreases following CTA for NAc recordings with GRAB-DA2h than with cell body GCaMP. Given that they are using the high-affinity version of the GRAB sensor, this calls into question whether this is a true difference in release vs. soma activity or issue of high affinity release sensor making decreases in dopamine levels more difficult to observe.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.103260.2.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Loh</surname><given-names>Maxine K</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hurh</surname><given-names>Samantha J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bazzino</surname><given-names>Paula</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Donka</surname><given-names>Rachel M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keinath</surname><given-names>Alexandra T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roitman</surname><given-names>Jamie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roitman</surname><given-names>Mitchell F</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02mpq6x41</institution-id><institution>University of Illinois at Chicago</institution></institution-wrap><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chicago</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Loh and colleagues investigate valence encoding in the mesolimbic dopamine system.

Our findings are similar to prior work from our group targeting recordings to the NAc dorsomedial shell (Hsu et al., 2020; McCutcheon et al., 2012; Roitman et al., 2008): there, intraoral sucrose increased NAc dopamine release while the response in the same rats to quinine was significantly lower.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Koh et al. report an interesting manuscript studying dopamine binding in the lateral accumbens shell of rats across the course of conditioned taste aversion. The question being asked here is how does the dopamine system respond to aversion? The authors take advantage of unique properties of taste aversion learning (notably, within-subjects remapping of valence to the same physical stimulus) to address this.</p></disp-quote><p>They combine a well controlled behavioural design (including key, unpaired controls) with fibre photometry of dopamine binding via GrabDA and of dopamine neuron activity by gCaMP, careful analyses of behaviour (e.g., head movements; home cage ingestion), the authors show that, (1) conditioned taste aversion of sucrose suppresses the activity of VTA dopamine neurons and lateral shell dopamine binding to subsequent presentations of the sucrose tastant; (2) this pattern of activity was similar to the innately aversive tastant quinine; (3) dopamine responses were negatively correlated with behavioural (inferred taste reactivity) reactivity; and (4) dopamine responses tracked the contingency of between sucrose and illness because these responses recovered across extinction of the conditioned taste aversion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>There are important strengths here. The use of a well-controlled design, the measurement of both dopamine binding and VTA dopamine neuron activity, the inclusion of an extinction manipulation; and the thorough reporting of the data. I was not especially surprised by these results, but these data are a potentially important piece of the dopamine puzzle (e.g., as the authors note, salience-based argument struggles to explain these data).</p><p>Weaknesses for consideration:</p><p>(1) The focus here is on the lateral shell. This is a poorly investigated region in the context of the questions being asked here. Indeed, I suspect many readers might expect a focus on the medial shell. So, I think this focus is important. But, I think it does warrant greater attention in both the introduction and discussion. We do know from past work that there can be extensive compartmentalisation of dopamine responses to appetitive and aversive events and many of the inconsistent findings in the literature can be reconciled by careful examination of where dopamine is assessed. I do think readers would benefit from acknowledgement this - for example it is entirely reasonable to suppose that the findings here may be specific to the lateral shell.</p></disp-quote><p>As with our response to Reviewer 1, we agree that we should provide further rationale for focusing our recordings on the lateral shell and acknowledge potential differences in dopamine dynamics across NAc subregions. In addition to the changes in the Discussion detailed in our response to Reviewer 1, we have made the following additions to the Introduction:</p><p>Added to the Introduction: “NAc lateral shell dopamine differentially encodes cues predictive of rewarding (i.e., sipper spout with sucrose) and aversive stimuli (i.e., footshock), which is distinct from other subregions (de Jong et al., 2019). It is important to note that other regions of the NAc may serve as hedonic hotspots e.g. dorsomedial shell; or may more closely align with the signaling of salience (e.g. ventromedial shell; (Yuan et al., 2021)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Relatedly, I think readers would benefit from an explicit rationale for studying the lateral shell as well as consideration of this in the discussion. We know that there are anatomical (PMID: 17574681), functional (PMID: 10357457), and cellular (PMID: 7906426) differences between the lateral shell and the rest of the ventral striatum. Critically, we know that profiles of dopamine binding during ingestive behaviours there can be highly dissimilar to the rest of ventral striatum (PMID: 32669355). I do think these points are worth considering.</p></disp-quote><p>There are several reasons why dopamine dynamics were recorded in the NAc lateral shell:</p><p>(1) Dopamine neurons in more medial aspects of the VTA preferentially target the NAc medial shell and core whereas dopamine neurons in the lateral VTA – our target for VTA DA recordings – project to the lateral shell of the NAc (Lammel et al., 2008). Thus, our goal was to sample NAc release dynamics in areas that receive projections from our cell body recording sites.</p><p>(2) Cues predictive of reward availability (i.e., sipper spout with sucrose) and aversive stimuli (i.e., footshock) are differentially encoded by NAc lateral shell dopamine, which is distinct from NAc ventromedial shell dopamine responses (de Jong et al., 2019). These findings suggest a role for NAc lateral shell dopamine in the encoding of a stimulus’s valence, which made the subregion an area of interest for further examination.</p><p>(3) With respect to the medial NAc shell specifically, extensive literature had already shown it to be a ‘hedonic hotspot’ (Morales and Berridge, 2020; Yuan et al., 2021) whereas the ventral portion is more mixed with respect to valence (Yuan et al., 2021). We had previously shown that intraoral infusions of primary taste stimuli of opposing valence (i.e., sucrose and quinine) evoke differential responses in dopamine release within the NAc dorsomedial shell (Roitman et al., 2008). We more recently replicated differential dopamine responses from dopamine cell bodies in the lateral VTA (Hsu et al., 2020) and thus endeavored to the possibility of changing dopamine responses in the lateral VTA to the same stimulus as its valence changes. As a result of these choices, measuring dopamine release in the lateral shell was a logical choice. The field would greatly benefit from continued future work surveying the entirety of the VTA DA projection terminus.</p><p>We have included these points of justification in the Introduction and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) I found the data to be very thoughtfully analysed. But in places I was somewhat unsure:</p><p>(a) Please indicate clearly in the text when photometry data show averages across trials versus when they show averages across animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now explicitly indicated in the figure legends of Figures 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8:</p><p>(1) In heat maps, each row represents the averaged (across rats) response on that trial.</p><p>(2) Traces below heat maps represent the response to infusion averaged first across trials for each rat and then across all rats.</p><p>(3) Insets represent the average z-score across the infusion period averaged first across all trials for each rat and then across all rats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) I did struggle with the correlation analyses, for two reasons.</p><p>(i) First, the key finding here is that the dopamine response to intraoral sucrose is suppressed by taste aversion. So, this will significantly restrict the range of dopamine transients, making interpretation of the correlations difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>The overall hypothesis is that the dopamine response would correlate with the valence of a taste stimulus – even and especially when the stimulus remained constant but its valence changed. We inferred valence from the behavioral reactivity to the stimulus – reasoning that an appetitive taste will evoke minimal movement of the nose and paws (presumably because the animals are primarily engaging in small mouth movements associated with ingestion as shown by the seminal work of Grill and Norgren (1978) and the many studies published by the K.C. Berridge group) whereas an aversive taste will evoke significantly more movement as the rats engage in rejection responses (e.g. forelimb flails, chin rubs, etc.). When we conducted our regression analyses we endeavored to be as transparent as possible and labeled each symbol based on group (Unpaired vs Paired) and day (Conditioning vs Test). Both behavioral reactivity and dopamine responses change – but only for the Paired rats across days. In this sense, we believe the interpretation is clear. However, the Reviewer raises an important criticism that there would essentially be a floor effect with dopamine responses. We believe this is mitigated by data acquired across extinction and especially in Figure 9B. Here, the observations that dopamine responses fall to near zero but return to pre-conditioning levels in the Paired group with strong correlation between dopamine and behavioral reactivity throughout would hopefully partially allay the Reviewer’s concerns. See Part ii below for further support.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(ii) Second, the authors report correlations by combining data across groups/conditions. I understand why the authors have done this, but it does risk obscuring differences between the groups. So, my question is: what happens to this trend when the correlations are computed separately for each group? I suspect other readers will share the same question. I think reporting these separate correlations would be very helpful for the field -</p></disp-quote><p>regardless of the outcome.</p><p>To address this concern, we performed separate regression analyses for Paired and Unpaired rats and provide the table below to detail results where data were combined across groups or separated. Expectedly, all analyses in Paired rats indicated a significant inverse relationship between dopamine and behavioral reactivity. Afterall, it is only in this group where behavioral reactivity to the taste stimulus changes as function of conditioning. Perhaps even more striking is that in almost all comparisons, even when restricting the regression analysis to Unpaired rats, we still observed a significant inverse relationship between dopamine and behavioral reactivity in most experiments.

While it is well accepted that dopamine in the ventral striatum increases in response to various rewarding and appetitive stimuli, aversive stimuli have been shown to evoke phasic increases or decreasing depending on the exact aversive stimuli, behavioral paradigm, and/or dopamine recording method and location examined. Here the authors use a well-designed set of experiments to show differential responses to an appetitive primary reward (sucrose) that later becomes a conditioned aversive stimulus (sucrose previously paired with lithium chloride in a conditioned taste aversion paradigm). The results are interesting and add valuable data to the question of how the mesolimbic dopamine system encodes aversive stimuli, however, the conclusions are strongly stated given that the current data do not necessarily align with prior conflicting data in terms of recording location, and it is not clear exactly how to interpret the generally biphasic dopamine response to the CTA-sucrose which also evolves over exposures within a single session.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>• The authors nicely demonstrate that their two aversive stimuli examined, quinine and sucrose following CTA, evoked aversive facial expressions and paw movements that differed from those following rewarding sucrose to support that the stimuli experienced by the rats differ in valence.</p><p>• Examined dopamine responses to the exact same sensory stimuli conditioned to have opposing valences, avoiding standard confounds of appetitive and aversive stimuli being sensed by different sensory modalities (i.e., sweet taste vs. electric shock)</p><p>• The authors examined multiple measurements of dopamine activity - cell body calcium (GCaMP6f) in midbrain and release in NAc (Grab-DA2h), which is useful as the prior mixed literature on aversive dopamine responses comes from a variety of recording methods.</p><p>• Correlations between sucrose preference and dopamine signals demonstrate behavioral relevance of the differential dopamine signals.</p><p>• The delayed testing experiment in Figure 7 nicely controls for the effect of time to demonstrate that the &quot;rewarding&quot; dopamine response to sucrose only recovers after multiple extinction sucrose exposures to extinguish the CTA.</p><p>Weaknesses for consideration:</p><p>(1) Regional differences in dopamine signaling to aversive stimuli are mentioned in the introduction and discussion. For instance, the idea that dopamine encodes salience is strongly argued against in the discussion, but the paper cited as arguing for that (Kutlu et al. 2021) is recording from the medial core in mice. Given other papers cited in the text about the regional differences in dopamine signaling in the NAc and from different populations of dopamine neurons in midbrain, it's important to mention this distinction wrt to salience signaling. Relatedly, the text says that the lateral NAc shell was targeted for accumbens recordings, but the histology figure looks like the majority of fibers were in the anterior lateral core of NAc. For the current paper to be a convincing last word on the issue, it would be extremely helpful to have similar recordings done in other parts of the NAc to do a more thorough comparison against other studies.</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer notes, NAc dopamine recordings were aimed at the lateral NAc shell. It is possible that some dopamine neurons lying within the anterior lateral core were recorded. Fiber photometry and the size of the fiber optics cannot definitively identify the precise location and number of dopamine neurons from which we recorded. Still, recording sites did not systematically differ between groups. Further, the within-subjects design helps to mitigate any potential biases for one subregion over another. The results presented in the manuscript strongly support a valence code. It is difficult to be the ‘last word’ on this topic and we suspect debate will continue. We used taste stimuli for appetitive and aversive stimuli – whereas many in the field will continue to use other noxious stimuli (e.g. foot shock) that likely recruit different circuits en route to the VTA. And there may very well be a different regional profile for dopamine signaling with different noxious stimuli. Moreover, we used intraoral infusion to avoid confounds of stimulus avoidance and competing motivations (e.g. food or fluid deprivation). We believe that this is one of the most important and unique features of our report. Recent work supports a role for phasic increases in dopamine in avoidance of noxious stimuli (Jung et al., 2024) and it will be critical for the field to reflect on the differences between avoidance and aversion. Moreover, in ongoing studies we aspire to fully survey dopamine signaling in conditioned taste aversion across the medial-lateral and dorsal-ventral axes of the VTA and NAc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Dopamine release in the NAc never dips below baseline for the conditioned sucrose. Is it possible to really consider this as a signal for valence per se, as opposed to it being a weaker response relative to the original sucrose response?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, NAc dopamine release to intraoral quinine nor aversive sucrose doesn’t dip below baseline but rather dopamine binding doesn’t change from pre-infusion baseline levels. It should be noted that VTA dopamine cell body activity does indeed dip below baseline in response to aversive sucrose. Moreover, using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, we showed that dopamine release dips below baseline in the NAc dorsomedial shell in response to intraoral quinine (Roitman et al., 2008). The differences across recording sites may reflect regional differences but they may also reflect differences in recording approaches. GrabDA2h, used here, has relatively slow kinetics that may obscure dips below baseline (see response Weakness# 8 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Related to this, the main measure of the dopamine signal here, &quot;mean z-score,&quot; obscures the temporal dynamics of the aversive dopamine response across a trial. This measure is used to claim that sucrose after CTA is &quot;suppressing&quot; dopamine neuron activity and release, which is true relative to the positive valence sucrose response. However, both GRAB-DA and cell-body GCaMP measurements show clear increases after onset of sucrose infusion before dipping back to baseline or slightly below in the average of all example experiments displayed. One could point to these data to argue either that aversive stimuli cause phasic increases in dopamine (due to the initial increase) or decreases (due to the delayed dip below baseline) depending on the measurement window. Some discussion of the dynamics of the response and how it relates to the prior literature would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used mean z-score to do much of our quantitative analyses but the Reviewer raises the intriguing possibility that we are masking an initial increase in dopamine release and VTA DA activity evoked by aversive taste by doing so. We included the heat maps in the manuscript to be as transparent as possible about the time course of dopamine responses – both within a trial and across trials. The Reviewer’s point prompted us to reflect further on the heat maps and recognize that trials early in the session often showed a brief increase in dopamine for aversive sucrose but this response dissipated (NAc dopamine release) or flipped (VTA DA cell body activity) over trials. We now quantitatively characterize this feature by looking at the timecourse of dopamine responses in each third of the trials (1-10, 11-20, 21-30; see Author response images 1,2 and 3). As we infer the valence of the stimulus from nose and paw movements (behavioral reactivity), it is especially striking that we a similar timecourse for changes in behavior. Collectively, the data may reflect an updating process that is relatively slow and requires experience of the stimulus in a new (aversive) state – that is, a model-free process. While our experiments were not designed to test the updating of dopamine responses and discern their participation in model-based versus model-free learning processes – another debate in the dopamine field (Cone et al., 2016; Deserno et al., 2021)– the data reflect a model-free process. This is further supported in the experiment involving multiple conditioning sessions, where dopamine ‘dips’ are observed in trials 1-10 on Conditioning Day 3 and Extinction Day 1 when the new value of sucrose has been established. Finally, the relatively slow updating of the value of sucrose is reflected in older literature using a continuous intraoral infusion. Using this approach, rats began rejecting the saccharin infusion only after ~2min rather than immediately (Schafe et al., 1998; Schafe and Bernstein, 1996; Wilkins and Bernstein, 2006).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103260-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103260-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103260-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Would this delayed below-baseline dip be visible with a shorter infusion time?</p></disp-quote><p>While our experiments did not explore this parameter, it would be interesting to parametrically vary infusion duration times and examine differences in dopamine responses. However, we believe the most parsimonious explanation is that the ‘dip’ in VTA cell body activity develops as a function of the slow updating of the value of sucrose reflective of a model-free process. We recognize that this is mere speculation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Does the max of the increase or the dip of the decrease better correlate with the behavioral measures of aversion (orofacial, paw movements) or sucrose preference than &quot;mean z-score&quot; measure used here?</p></disp-quote><p>It seems plausible that finding the most extreme value from baseline could better correlate to behavioral measures. Time courses to max increase and max decrease are different. Moreover, with appetitive sucrose, there are often multiple transients that occur throughout a single intraoral infusion. Coupled with a noisy time course for individual components of behavioral reactivity, we determined that averaging data across the whole infusion period (i.e. mean z-score) was the most objective way we could analyze the dopamine and behavioral responses to taste stimuli.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors argue strongly in the discussion against the idea that dopamine is encoding &quot;salience.&quot; Could this initial peak (also seen in the first few trials of quinine delivery, fig 1c color plot) be a &quot;salience&quot; response?</p></disp-quote><p>Our response above to the potential for ‘mixed’ dopamine responses to aversive sucrose led to additional analyses that support a slow updating of both behavior and dopamine to the new, aversive value of sucrose. Quinine is innately aversive and thus the Reviewer rightly points out that even here we observe an increase in dopamine release evoked by quinine on the first few trials (as observed in the heat map). We’d like to note, though, that the order of stimulus exposure was counterbalanced across rats. In those rats first receiving a sucrose session, quinine initially caused a modest increase in dopamine release during the first 10 trials (which is more pronounced in the first 2 trials). In the subsequent 2 blocks of 10 trials, no such increase was observed. Interestingly, in rats for which quinine was their first stimulus, we did not see an increase in dopamine release on the first few trials (see Author response image 4). We speculate that the initial sucrose session required the value of intraoral infusions to be updated when quinine was delivered to these rats and that, once more, the updating process may be slow and akin to a model-free process. This analysis, at present, is underpowered but will direct future attention in follow-up work.</p><fig id="sa4fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-103260-sa4-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Related to this, the color plots showing individual trials show a reduction in the increases to positive valence sucrose across conditioning day trials and a flip from infusion-onset increase to delayed increases across test day trials. This evolution across days makes it appear that the last few conditioning day trials would be impossible to discriminate from the first few test day trials in the CTA-paired. Presumably, from strength of CTA as a paradigm, the sucrose is already aversive to the animals at the first trial of test day. Why do the authors think the response evolves across this session?</p></disp-quote><p>As the Reviewer noted, Points 3-7 are related. We have speculated that the evolving dopamine response in Paired rats across test day trials reflects a model-free process. Importantly, as in the manuscript, our additional analyses once again show a tight relationship between behavioral reactivity and the dopamine response across the test session trials. It is important to note, though, that these experiments were not designed to test if responses reflect model-free or model-based processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Given that most of the work is using a conditioned aversive stimulus, the comparison to a primary aversive tastant quinine is useful. However, the authors saw basically no dopamine response to a primary aversive tastant quinine (measured only with GRAB-DA) and saw less noticeable decreases following CTA for NAc recordings with GRAB-DA2h than with cell body GCaMP. Given that they are using the high-affinity version of the GRAB sensor, this calls into question whether this is a true difference in release vs. soma activity or issue of high affinity release sensor making decreases in dopamine levels more difficult to observe.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the same speculation as the Reviewer. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry, albeit measuring dopamine concentration in the dorsomedial shell, we observed a clear decrease from baseline with intraoral infusions of quinine (Roitman et al., 2008). Using fiber photometry here, the Reviewer and we note that GRAB_DA2h is a high-affinity (i.e., EC50: 7nM) dopamine sensor with relatively long off-kinetics (i.e., t1/2 decay time: 7300ms) (Labouesse et al., 2020). It may therefore be much more difficult to observe decreases (below baseline) using this sensor. The publication of new dopamine sensors - with lower affinity, faster kinetics, and greater dynamic range (Zhuo et al., 2024) – introduces opportunities for comparison and the greater potential for capturing decreases below baseline. Due to the poorer kinetics associated with GRAB_DA2h, we would not assert that direct comparisons between the GCaMP- and GRAB-based signals observed here represent true differences between somatic and terminal activity.</p><p>References</p><p>Choi JY, Jang HJ, Ornelas S, Fleming WT, Fürth D, Au J, Bandi A, Engel EA, Witten IB. 2020.
