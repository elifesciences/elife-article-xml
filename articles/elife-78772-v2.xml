source of novelty. Many de novo genes have been proposed to be protein-coding, and a few have been experimentally shown to yield protein products. However, the systematic study of de novo proteins has been hampered by doubts regarding their translation without the experimental observation of protein products. Using a systematic, mass-spectrometry-first computational approach, we identify 993 unannotated open reading frames with evidence of translation (utORFs) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. To quantify the similarity of these utORFs across <italic>Drosophila</italic> and infer phylostratigraphic age, we develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach. Combining these results with reference datasets ontissue- and life stage-specific transcription and conservation, we identify different properties amongst these utORFs. Contrary to expectations, the fastest-evolving utORFs are not the youngest evolutionarily. We observed more utORFs in the brain than in the testis. Most of the identified utORFs may be of de novo origin, even accounting for the possibility of false-negative similarity detection. Finally, sequence divergence after an inferred de novo origin event remains substantial, suggesting that de novo proteins turn over frequently. Our results suggest that there is substantial unappreciated diversity in de novo protein evolution: many more may exist than previously appreciated; there may be divergent evolutionary trajectories, and they may be gained and lost frequently. All in all, there may not exist a single characteristic model of de novo protein evolution, but instead, there may be diverse evolutionary trajectories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>utORFs</kwd><kwd>mass spectrometry</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>turnover</kwd><kwd>latent class analysis</kwd><kwd>de novo protein</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM133780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Eric B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013961</institution-id><institution>Robertson Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rita Allen Foundation Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007204</institution-id><institution>Vallee Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vallee Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011331</institution-id><institution>Monique Weill-Caulier Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Li</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

The dominant mechanism is duplication and divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohno, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Long et al., 2003</xref>), but the early years of the genomic era revealed a seeming paradox of species-specific âorphan genes.â These genes lacked homologs even in closely related species, which made it necessary to invoke nonstandard duplication and divergence mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>). Advances in both the sequencing of genomes and in comparative genomics soon led to an explosion of work on the origins of orphan genes, generally identified through lineage specificity.</p><p>Lineage-specific orphan genes can originate from a variety of mechanisms, ranging from extreme, rapid divergence after duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Domazet-Loso and Tautz, 2003</xref>) to horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verster et al., 2019</xref>) to de novo gene birth. In the latter mechanism, a previously nongenic genomic sequence acquires genic function, thus yielding a de novo gene that is characterized by its lineage specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLysaght and Hurst, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">SchlÃ¶tterer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>). De novo genes are identified from diverse taxa from fruit flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2006</xref>) to yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2008</xref>) and even humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knowles and McLysaght, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xie et al., 2012</xref>). While it would seem unlikely for such de novo genes to gain viable function from presumably unoptimized sequence, empirical and population genetics studies have demonstrated that they have important functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lange et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reinhardt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). However, exactly what proportion of lineage-specific genes are contributed through de novo gene birth remains actively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tautz and Domazet-LoÅ¡o, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLysaght and Guerzoni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Despite significant interest, the study of evolutionarily young genes is surprisingly conceptually difficult. While an empirical investigation of biological effect is ideal, designing such experiments for a specific evolutionarily young gene can be challenging due to the likely lack of homology to previously studied genes. Even identifying a given candidate genetic locus as an evolutionarily young gene can be fraught with challenges: evolutionary youth is functionally equivalent to concluding lineage specificity, but methods like phylostratigraphy via BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Domazet-Loso et al., 2007</xref>), while useful and intuitive, can be vulnerable to false-negative detections, especially for short genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyers and Zhang, 2016</xref>). Moreover, while researchers generally agree that a gene should be functional, exactly how this should be defined and assessed can vary substantially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>). As an example, whether evolutionarily young genes function as RNAs or as proteins is often an area of debate. One of the earliest recognized young genes is an RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2002</xref>); other studies also had similar conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cridland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, in several cases, even de novo genes have been empirically shown to yield protein products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bungard et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Knowles and McLysaght, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). While defining a gene as one that can code for a translated protein is convenient and intuitive, evidence for the translation into polypeptides of lineage-specific genes and, in particular, de novo genes as a class is often lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Van Oss and Carvunis, 2019</xref>). As a result, much effort remains needed for systematic approaches to studying evolutionarily young genes and proteins.</p><p>Proteomics approaches like shotgun mass spectrometry (MS) can be a powerful tool for the rapid identification of translational evidence for many potential proteins at once and would be a good fit for such a systematic study. However, standard shotgun MS analysis approaches require a priori assumptions about the sequences of the proteins to be detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sinitcyn et al., 2018</xref>). In the case of discovering possible lineage-specific proteins, this a priori requirement can be confounding, as lineage-specific proteins may be systematically under-annotated due to their lack of homology.</p><p>Here, we employ a systematic, open reading frame (ORF)-focused MS-first computational approach, to identify unannotated ORFs with evidence of translation (utORFs) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We further develop a synteny-based protein similarity approach to quantify the comparative genomic similarity of these utORFs across <italic>Drosophila</italic> to estimate their phylostratigraphic age and finally to infer possible de novo origin for the vast majority of these utORFs. Combined with reference datasets on tissue- and life stage-specific transcription and conservation, this data suggests differences amongst these utORFs with respect to their evolutionary and functional properties. Finally, we independently support a subset of these utORFs via additional MS empirical data and ribosome profiling data.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A comprehensive database of all possible ORFs in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome</title><p>As a first step toward the systematic discovery of unannotated proteins in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we generated a comprehensive database of all possible ORFs in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome. This comprehensive database is the result of translating the entire annotated genome in all six frames; we also included the annotated transcriptome to enable discovery of noncanonical translation phenomena such as alternate-frame ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Klerk and ât Hoen, 2015</xref>). In this database, each potential ORF is defined as a contiguous span of amino acid (aa)-coding codons; so, these potential ORFs do not necessarily begin with or contain a canonical start codon. This is necessary in order to account for unannotated splicing events, as a six-frame translation of the genome cannot correctly associate the exons of a gene. Since no coding exon within the coding sequence of a gene can contain a stop codon, the set of all codon spans between stop codons is a superset of the set of all exons in the genome. In addition to annotated ORFs (FlyBase r6.15 release), this comprehensive potential ORF database contains 4,582,998 unique potential ORFs that are not otherwise annotated. Of these additional potential ORFs, the median length is 32 aa, and the 95th percentile is 96 aa. Considering solely the 2,597,794 potential ORFs that contain a canonical start codon, the median length following the start codon remains 32 aa, and the 95th percentile is 112 aa. In total, this suggests that the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome has substantial latent potential for generating new protein-coding genes. Of course, the overwhelming majority of these potential ORFs are neither transcribed nor translated and are thus not functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durand et al., 2019</xref>), but considering these will allow us to scan the potential proteomic diversity in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Two-round MS search improves discovery of unannotated ORFs without compromising false discovery rate</title><p>A comprehensive proteome of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> was recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casas-Vila et al., 2017</xref>), including data from 15 stages of the whole lifecycle of the fruit fly (ranging from 0 to 2 hr embryos to adults, including larval and pupal stages), as well as sharper time-resolution data covering 14 stages of embryogenesis (hourly timepoints from 0 to 6 hr; bihourly timepoints from 6 to 20 hr). We analyzed the Casas-Vila et al. data by searching for the complete potential ORF database described above to discover evidence of translation of unannotated ORFs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Because the number of potential ORFs is several orders of magnitude greater than the number of annotated proteins, the search space is enormously expanded, and thus a traditional one-round search is likely to miss a very large number of identifications at a given false discovery rate (FDR). Accordingly, to improve total sensitivity while maintaining an acceptable FDR, we used two rounds of analysis (Methods). We identify dramatically more novel unannotated protein groups with statistical significance in this two-round approach than in a traditional single-round search, while the number of false-positive identifications is comparable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). The substantial enrichment (around 10-fold) of unannotated ORFs relative to either the observed number of false positives or the desired FDR strongly supports the validity of the two-round approach.</p><p>In total, after additional filtering (see Methods), our two-round search identified 3123 unannotated unique peptides that underlie 993 unannotated ORFs without homology to annotated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata2">Figure 1âsource data 2</xref>), which we hereafter refer to as unannotated ORFs with evidence of translation (utORFs). utORFs range in length from 14 aa to over 100 aa, with the longest being 1748 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The median length of a utORF is 37 aa, and the mean is 48.6 aa. Among these utORFs, 331 proteins have canonical start codons with 1027 peptides that originate from sequence after the canonical start codon, implying that on average each protein has three supporting peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs). The mean and median lengths of a utORF starting with a canonical start codon are 53.5 aa and 37 aa, respectively, which is very similar to utORFs overall. Unless specifically mentioned, we analyze henceforth the set of 993 utORFs and not only the 331 with canonical start codons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Identification of unannotated translated open reading frames (utORFs) and their properties.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) We detected utORFs by searching via a two-round approach through a comprehensive database of potential open reading frames (ORFs) that was generated from a six-frame translation of the transcriptome and genome (see Methods).

The aa composition for those utORFs with start codons is also highly similar. However, some hydrophobic and positively charged aa, such as leucine, arginine, and tryptophan, are overrepresented in utORFs relative to annotated proteins, while negatively charged aa, such as aspartate and glutamate, are underrepresented. Overall, the distribution of positively charged to negatively charged aa is significantly different among utORFs vs. annotated <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> protein sequences (Chi-squared test with Yatesâs correction, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>=1463.55, df = 1, and p&lt;machine epsilon). In addition, the distribution of hydrophobic aa vs. polar aa is also highly significantly different (same test, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>=44.96, df = 1, and p&lt;1Eâ10). Since the hydrophobicity and charge of an aa determines its biochemical properties, utORFs may thus differ biochemically from annotated proteins, ranging from differences in secondary structure to propensity and selectivity for protein-protein interactions. These differences in aa composition may be explained by the aa composition of potential ORFs, as the implied aa composition of all potential ORFs is more similar to utORFs than annotated proteins (Spearman rank-order correlation of aa frequencies, potential ORFs to utORFs: 0.970, p=1.71Eâ12; potential ORFs to annotated proteome: 0.785, p=4.15Eâ5). This suggests that utORFs have not accumulated many substitutions toward the composition of annotated proteins (e.g. substituting over-represented positively charged aa for underrepresented negatively charged aa). This could be due to either their evolutionary youth or a lack of selective pressure for such changes.</p><p>All 993 utORFs have unique genomic locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1âsource data 3</xref>). utORFs reside in a range of genomic locations, including intergenic, intronic, or untranslated regions (UTRs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). About one-third of utORFs are located intergenically; of these, about one-third again are longer than 50 aa and contain a canonical start codon. We propose that these may be single-exon unannotated proteins. A considerable number of utORFs overlap with annotated genes, with an even distribution between sense and antisense directions relative to the annotation. Of the former, several are located either upstream or downstream of the canonical coding sequence (CDS); these may be instances of utORFs or translation read-through, which have been previously described as having important biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews and Rothnagel, 2014</xref>). Notably, with the exception of a modest reduction in the relative proportion of sense utORFs, the distribution of locations is not different for those utORFs with a canonical start codon. The genomic sequences that make up utORFs on average have greater GC content compared to that of the overall <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (X and autosomes; mean utORF GC content 43.4% vs. X and autosome GC content 42.15%; one-sample two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&lt;1Eâ4), but they have wide variety, with some with as much as 62% GC content and others as few as 21% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Intriguingly, the GC content of annotated genes (42.9%) is between that of the genome and utORFs, and utORFs do not have significantly different GC content compared to annotated genes (one-sample two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test, p&gt;0.05). This suggests either that a selective pressure may act toward increasing the GC content in utORFs or that utORFs may be more likely to originate from regions with higher GC content.</p><p>Approximately, half of utORFs (566 of 993; 57.0%) have a majority coiled-coil secondary structure, with the remainder a mixture of beta sheets and alpha helices. Notably, this remains true even when normalizing for length, as the weighted proportion of sequence in a predicted coiled-coil structure is on average about half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Predictions of structural disorder of utORFs suggest that while they are rather disordered, most retain a substantial proportion that is ordered. The median proportion of disordered utORFs is 24.5%. Compared to an empirical null distribution of length-matched potential ORFs without supporting MS evidence, the proportion of coiled-coil of utORFs is statistically significantly lower (Fisherâs combined p<italic>-</italic>value 0.0182); conversely, the overall proportion of disorder is not significantly different (Fisherâs combined p-value 0.682).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Novel peptides identified are not artifacts caused by polymorphism in conserved genes</title><p>It is possible that polymorphisms within a population can yield unique peptides due to aa substitutions, thus resulting in inaccurate attribution of such peptides to utORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faridi et al., 2018</xref>). However, such polymorphisms can contribute at most a small fraction of the peptides that support the identified utORFs. To quantify this, using a trie data structure for efficient search, we calculated the minimum distance between the peptides that uniquely support utORFs and the expected set of peptides from the reference proteome (see Methods for further details). Of the 3123 tryptic peptides that are uniquely identified from utORFs, only one could possibly result from a single aa substitution of a tryptic peptide from an annotated protein; none could result from a single aa insertion or deletion. A simultaneous double aa substitution could explain an additional five peptides; 24 more peptides could result from a double insertion or deletion. Thus, single or double aa substitutions can explain at most 30 of 3123 unique tryptic peptides (&lt;1%). As a result, it is exceedingly likely that the peptides detected here are the product of utORFs rather than polymorphisms at annotated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Inferring ages of utORFs</title><p>In order to compare the conservation of utORFs across species, it is necessary to find the orthologous sequence with near base-pair-level resolution. Due to the algorithmic compromises necessary for whole-genome searches, BLAST homology searches do not guarantee that they will return optimum results, especially for short sequences that may be highly diverged.

Importantly, while binning continuous variables is necessary for conducting LCA, comparisons between classes can be done on the original continuous variables, removing binning as a potential source of bias, and additional variables not originally used for assigning classes can be used as well. The posterior probabilities of class membership for each utORF suggest generally clean partitioning between classes, as each utORF generally has a high posterior probability of belonging to only a single class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The exceptions are utORFs with membership in either class 4 (unannotated ORFs) or class 5 (alternative-frame ORFs). However, allowing an additional sixth class leads to overfitting (see Methods).

Alternative-frame utORFs are very well conserved due to the additional constraints imposed by their overlapping annotated genes.

Interestingly, <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific utORFs are not significantly shorter (same test, p=0.11), despite prior reports that younger genes tend to be shorter. With regards to maximum observed transcription, alternative-frame utORFs tend to be significantly better-transcribed than all other utORFs (one-sided Brunner-Munzel nonparametric test of log-transformed TPMs vs. all other utORFs, p&lt;&lt;0.001). This is likely due to active transcription of the overlapping pre-existing loci. In contrast, fast-evolving utORFs are significantly less well transcribed (same test, p&lt;0.001), while differences in <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific and utORFs are statistically insignificant. Consistent with these trends, alternative-frame utORFs are less tissue- and developmentally specific (one-sided Brunner-Munzel test of tau across FlyAtlas2 tissues, p&lt;0.001; same test of tau across modENCODE developmental stages, p&lt;0.001), while fast-evolving utORFs are more specifically expressed (tau across FlyAtlas2 tissues, p=0.0039; tau across modENCODE developmental stages, p&lt;0.001). Unusually, many of the fast-evolving utORFs (33 of 96, 34.4%) have their highest expression in adult fly tissues in the brain, with the next most common location the testis (10 of 96, 10.4%). Moreover, while transcription of annotated genes is high in both the brain and testis, fast-evolving utORFs are dramatically less-transcribed in the testis than in the brain (75th percentile log<sub>10</sub> of TPM in brain, fast-evolving utORFs: 0.172; vs. annotated genes: 1.320; in testis, fast-evolving utORFs: â0.662; vs. annotated genes 1.177; delta log<sub>10</sub> of TPM in testis vs. in brain, fast-evolving utORFs vs. annotated genes: one-sided Mann-Whitney U test p=7.5Eâ6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Five latent classes remain the best fit, as allowing a sixth class has unfavorable Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) effects. Class assignments can proceed with similar logic; however, utORFs with start codons are longer overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>), so some class interpretations change somewhat.

This protects against an erroneous de novo inference due to a homology detection failure rather than true functional changes, which has been extensively described as a potential source of erroneous identifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyers and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Moyers and Zhang, 2018</xref>). Many of our utORFs have such stringent evidence consistent with a de novo origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), with at least two supporting outgroups originating from different phyla. Between 40 and 75% of identified loci across all inferred classes may be de novo, with the greatest proportion in the fast-evolving, <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific, and unannotated ORFs. These differences between classes are statistically significant (Pearsonâs Chi-squared test, 4 degrees of freedom, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>=31.941, and p=1.97Eâ6). For all utORFs with potential de novo origin, 394 (67.8%) have three or more such supporting outgroup species. The number of such supporting outgroup species appears to be more affected by the availability of such than by genomic divergence, as the youngest classes (<italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific and fast-evolving) have more supporting outgroup species than the comparatively older alternative-frame class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Many unannotated translated open reading frames (utORFs) have evidence consistent with a de novo origin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proportion of utORFs by inferred class with genomic conservation consistent with de novo origin.

One method that has been proposed to evaluate PSMs is to use the retention time of identified peptides on the liquid chromatography system upstream of the mass spectrometer; retention time should vary as a function of the peptideâs sequence. While calculating retention time of a given peptide a priori remains an unsolved problem, substantial progress has been made on predicting retention times of sets of peptides a posteriori. To evaluate the validity of PSMs of utORFs, we used AutoRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) to predict retention times of peptides supporting annotated FlyBase proteins as well as utORFs. While some peptides supporting utORFs have drastically larger differences from the predicted retention times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>), a sizeable number have observed retention times that are similar to peptides from annotated FlyBase proteins. Specifically, 385 of 3123 peptides (12.3%) supporting utORFs have at least one PSM with a delta retention time that is smaller than the 95th percentile of the delta retention times of all PSMs that support annotated FlyBase proteins; within this subset, the difference between predicted and observed retention times is modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We collected targeted MS data from mixed 0 to 24 hr <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> embryos (RAL517 strain), targeting a manually curated set of 15 target utORFs chosen both for suitability for targeted MS (e.g. few missed cleavages; no post-translational modifications) as well as expression in embryo from modENCODE data. Of these 15 targeted utORFs, we were able to detect supporting evidence for one through the observation of three transitions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). We also collected shotgun MS data from mixed 0 to 24 hr embryos; we were able to detect supporting evidence for additional utORFs from the shotgun MS data at a FDR of 1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7âsource data 1</xref>); this shotgun dataset was fairly shallow, as we identified 1963 annotated proteins compared to the approximately 8000 protein groups reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Casas-Vila et al., 2017</xref>. Given the low sensitivity of MS, having evidence for utORFs from independent datasets likely supports a substantial translation level for at least a subset of the utORFs. Furthermore, we reanalyzed published ribosome profiling data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patraquim et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and identified supporting evidence from an additional 243 utORFs. Of these, alternate-frame ORFs are unsurprisingly the most frequently supported, perhaps due to translation of the canonical ORF, but the other classes are well represented with the exception of the putatively nonfunctional utORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The biases across classes are statistically significant (Pearsonâs Chi-squared test, 4 degrees of freedom, <italic>X</italic><sup>2</sup>=41.569, and p&lt;&lt;0.001), and they are consistent with our proposed interpretation of the classes. Finally, we specifically looked for evidence of framing in ribosome profiling data by implementing the binomial statistical test used for the first report of framing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patraquim et al., 2020</xref>). Of 81 utORFs with more than 2 unique footprints, 17 utORFs (21.0%) have statistically significant biases toward the observed frame in at least one stage of embryogenesis, supporting the notion of active translation (alpha 0.05; 11 utORFs at alpha 0.001).</p><p>Together, this evidence supports our identification of the pool of utORFs overall. We accordingly integrated all data that we analyzed with respect to additional lines of evidence supporting our utORFs and factors of interest in order to identify utORFs of highest priority for downstream functional analyses; we used a combination of high transcription from RNAseq atlases, supporting validation from either our MS experiments or framed ribosome profiling reads and conservation metrics. By calculating ranks across each of these factors and averaging ranks per utORF, we generated a priority list for our utORFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7âsource data 2</xref>). Of the top 50 utORFs, 24 are alternate-frame ORFs, 14 unannotated ORFs, 7 melanogaster-specific ORFs, and 4 fast-evolving ORFs. This is similar to the overall proportion of class assignments, except alternate-frame ORFs are somewhat over-represented due a higher incidence of framed ribosome profiling reads. These utORFs may be the most promising candidates for future experimental work.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Identification of hundreds of potential protein products of de novo origin</title><p>In this work, we identify almost 1000 possible utORFs from a systematic, ORF-focused MS-first computational approach. These utORFs are unlikely to be annotation failures due to the lack of sequence homology to annotated proteins. Instead, like many similar âorphan genes,â these may be of de novo origin: the vast majority have a syntenic sequence conservation pattern that is consistent with de novo origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AB</xref>). The total number of identifications is larger than previous studies of de novo genes within a relatively short timescale in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Begun et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>) and is consistent with the identification of thousands of possible de novo polypeptides from systematic studies in other biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz-Orera et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durand et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, while evidence of translation of proposed de novo genes is generally lacking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLysaght and Hurst, 2016</xref>), in this case, the method of identification allows a stronger inference of translation.</p><p>Calling de novo origin for a given gene is challenging, as the call is almost wholly dependent on negative results in the outgroup lineages. For example, in small phylogenies with a single outgroup, it is possible for a single false-negative call to lead to an incorrect inference of de novo origin. Recent studies have demonstrated that false negatives may be alarmingly likely, especially when using simple BLAST-based phylostratigraphy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moyers and Zhang, 2016</xref>). Here, our method of calling de novo origin employs proposed best practices of incorporating syntenic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arendsee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vakirlis and McLysaght, 2019</xref>) and is robust to individual sequence homology calls, improving our confidence in our inferences. Importantly, our inferences of gene age and potential de novo origin do not rely at all on the absence of sequence from the MSA, which would be analogous to the lack of a significant BLAST hit. Instead, our inferences of de novo origin rely on protein similarity scores below our threshold of significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which ensures that these inferences are not simply due to extensive genomic divergence beyond the limit of detection. If anything, our formulation of the protein similarity score may be vulnerable to calling spurious similarity due to shared genomic ancestry between closely related species. However, such errors would cause us to infer systematically older de novo origin dates for each gene; given that we still conclude that many utORFs are of potential de novo origin, the impact of such possible errors is low.</p><p>Other mechanisms beyond de novo origin could potentially produce âorphanâ/lineage-specific genes. For example, horizontal gene transfer from microorganisms like viruses has been reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Verster et al., 2019</xref>), and much attention has been focused on sequence divergence (e.g. after pseudogenization) as an alternative explanation for lineage-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moyers and Zhang, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weisman et al., 2020</xref>). When, as is often the case for our utORFs, there are many supporting outgroups, and multiple pseudogenization events are necessary by parsimony to produce the observed pattern; while this seems unlikely, we cannot exclude the possibility of repeated substantial divergence. However, work explicitly focusing on the possibility that sequence divergence is responsible for lineage-specific genes recently concluded that extensive divergence was not likely the dominant mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vakirlis et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Our confidence in our identifications of utORFs is supported by our confirmatory results from MS and published ribosome profiling, including the observation of statistically significant framing from ribosome-profiling data. While the absolute number of recapitulated utORF detections is relatively low, MS has notoriously low power, even in well-studied proteomes like humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2017</xref>). Of note, our validation data was collected from embryos of mixed ages ranging from 0 to 24 hr, while the original identification data was collected from multiple narrowly staged embryonic development timepoints. Thus, it is not particularly surprising that we were unable to recapitulate most utORFs in a relatively heterogenous sample, as we expect utORFs to be of low abundance and potentially only expressed under specific time- and tissue-limited conditions. Unlike sequencing approaches, the empirical readout of MS is not directly mappable to information (i.e. the underlying nucleotide sequence), so false identifications of PSMs are a notorious problem in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nesvizhskii and Aebersold, 2005</xref>). However, the peptides underlying our identification of utORFs are not artifacts caused by polymorphism in conserved genes. Moreover, our results suggest that the reverse-decoy approach for controlling the number of false-positive identifications remains valid for our two-round method; the power for the identification of annotated <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes is nearly the same between a standard MS approach and our two-round approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Further functional investigation of utORF products would be a potential extension of this work (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata2">Figure 7âsource data 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Class inference reveals heterogenous evolutionary dynamics</title><p>In contrast to previous work, our approach of applying LCA allows additional refinement beyond that achievable by simple per-variable analyses. For example, previous studies have described an association between gene age and length: namely, that younger genes tend to be shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neme and Tautz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we find that the youngest class of utORFs (the <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific class) is not significantly shorter; instead, the fast-evolving and the nonfunctional classes are the shortest overall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Importantly, while length is an input into the LCA, it is neither the most obvious differentiator between the classes nor is it the primary basis upon which we interpreted the classes. Since the fast-evolving class is still quite young, it is possible that previous reports of an association between gene age and length are related to a conflation of fast evolution with gene age. Importantly, our analysis is not able to evaluate whether there is a direction in the historical evolutionary trajectory of the length of a given utORF. Thus, we cannot distinguish definitively between possible causes and effects for a relationship between fast evolution and length. For example, it is possible that shorter utORFs are faster evolving (e.g. due to fewer epistatic constraints) or that faster evolving ORFs tend toward a shorter length (e.g. by avoiding the processes that contribute to increasing gene length over time). This question merits further examination in future.</p><p>Previous studies, including our own, have suggested that evolutionarily young genes tend to be expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Soumillon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luis Villanueva-CaÃ±as et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Witt et al., 2019</xref>), though other tissues, like the brain, can also give rise to evolutionarily young genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, the utORFs identified here are expressed more in the brain than in the testis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>) in each inferred class. Moreover, while most annotated genes are highly expressed in the testis, most utORFs are not expressed at all in the testis, yet they are expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Considering that most previously reported de novo genes also tend to be expressed in the testis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Begun et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luis Villanueva-CaÃ±as et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Witt et al., 2019</xref>), our results may suggest that the proportion of protein-coding de novo genes might be higher in the brain than in the testis or that our MS-first approach allows the detection of otherwise-missed protein-coding de novo genes. Furthermore, these utORFs may have biologically significant effects in the brain. For example, the maximum observed expression of many of the relatively short, fast-evolving ORFs is in the brain, suggesting that some could act as neuropeptides.</p><p>Despite the success of our LCA approach in elucidating distinct evolutionary trajectories, half of our identified utORFs of interest remain consolidated in a single class. However, additional classes cannot be safely supported due to overfitting. Additional approaches may be necessary in order to further characterize these utORFs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Turnover in utORFs may be frequent</title><p>While de novo gene birth has been increasingly well studied over recent years, de novo gene death has been examined less closely. It is obvious that de novo gene death must be relatively frequent, as otherwise the net size of proteomes would be unrealistically large relative to the annotation. Consistent with this intuition, we observe that most de novo genes diverge by enough to be indistinguishable from random sequences in at least part of the clade descended from the last common ancestor after the de novo gene birth event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Since we consider conservation of the protein-coding sequence to be approximately equivalent to the function of the locus, we consider such sequence divergence as evidence of gene death. Other studies of young genes, including in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, have similarly concluded that gene death among young genes is frequent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmieri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>An implication of most models of de novo gene origins is that de novo gene birth is rare at the individual gene level and thus occurs only once in evolutionary history. However, the very large number of gene death events suggests a second possibility. It is possible that the rates of gene birth and death may be more balanced, i.e, instead of being born once and recurrently lost, a subset of de novo genes may be born, die, and subsequently reborn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schmitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Durand et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, some de novo gene evolution may not proceed unidirectionally but rather like a random walk along a continuum. This is consistent with the proto-gene model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvunis et al., 2012</xref>) or the pre-adaptation model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wilson et al., 2017</xref>). Under the proto-gene model, the frequent deaths of our utORFs would imply that they are proto-genes and not genes. However, with the exception of the <italic>melanogaster</italic>-specific utORFs, our utORFs are often conserved across species with significant divergence times, which implies that some utORFs may have evolutionary constraints and may, in fact, be functional genes. It is difficult to make strong conclusions here without getting trapped in the philosophical quagmire of the nature of âgene-ness;â nevertheless, it is possible that no single âgrand unified theoryâ of de novo gene origination can describe all phenomena.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Outlook</title><p>Together, our results show that evolution of young proteins may progress along different, distinct trajectories in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, as illustrated by the differences between classes described above. Whether similarly distinct properties and trajectories, e.g., with respect to length, age, turnover, and speed of evolution, are apparent in other model species such as yeast or mammals remains to be seen. Of note, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a taxon of multicellular organisms with a large effective population size, so selective processes are more efficient; mammals â especially primates and <italic>Homo</italic> â are evolutionarily young and have a smaller effective population size, while yeasts are unicellular.

In the case of <italic>Homo</italic>, all these factors may be more favorable to the fixation of new de novo proteins, and the availability of broad and varied omics data is unparalleled. It would therefore be an obvious extension to employ a similar approach to investigate possible utORFs and de novo proteins in humans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Comprehensive <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ORFeome</title><p>To generate the comprehensive database of potential ORFs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we translated the repeat-masked genome (UCSC August 2014 BDGP Release 6+ISO1 MT/dm6) and transcriptome (FlyBase, r6.15).

We reformatted the output to a GTF and made certain manual corrections; this file, containing the final locations, is appended as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata3">Figure 1âsource data 3</xref>. We excluded those loci whose genomic location could not be determined from genomic analyses. For those loci where multiple genomic locations were possible, we used the first location identified by BLAT.</p><p>We subsequently classified the genomic locations of these utORF sequences using custom scripts relying on the Bioconductor libraries in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huber et al., 2015</xref>). Specifically, we classified a location as sense or antisense if any part of the location overlapped with an annotated gene in the appropriate direction. We used the FlyBase r6.15 annotations. We classified a location as intergenic if and only if it was neither sense nor antisense as defined above.</p><p>We computed conservation scores by using the 27-way phastCons and phyloP bigWig tracks provided by the UCSC Genome Browser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hinrichs et al., 2006</xref>). For a given genomic location, we calculated the conservation score by averaging the score through the relevant interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Published sequencing data</title><p>We used a number of published sequencing datasets to characterize utORFs. To evaluate developmental stage- and tissue-specific transcription levels, we used modENCODE (modENCODE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roy et al., 2010</xref>) and FlyAtlas2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leader et al., 2018</xref>) data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Gene age inference</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>MSA and genomic similarity scoring</title><p>We used BioPython v. 1.69 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cock et al., 2009</xref>) to subset the UCSC 27-way insect MSA to a smaller MSA that corresponded to the location in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome of each utORF plus the flanking 9 bp on each side. In a pairwise fashion for each species against <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, we extracted genomic sequences from the MSA, dropped gaps in the sequences, and calculated identity scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-2"><title>Modified Smith-Waterman protein similarity scoring</title><p>We calculated protein similarity scores using the Smith-Waterman algorithm with the BLOSUM62 matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992</xref>), no gap or extension penalties, and we normalized by the length of the ORF in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. To ensure score stability with respect to minor indels, we calculated protein similarity scores in all three reading frames, keeping only the frame that scored best. In doing so, we considered the entirety of the syntenic block irrespective of the formal boundaries of ORFs in the related species; this allows us to capture the locally optimal (within the block) similarity and tolerate recent acquisition of nonsense or frameshift mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8-3"><title>Phylostratigraphy</title><p>Using the reference phylogeny corresponding to the UCSC 27-way insect MSA, we inferred approximate gene emergence dates from the pattern of modified Smith-Waterman protein similarity scores. We defined significance as a score greater than 2.5 points. In turn, we estimated the inferred age of a given ORF as the age of the last common ancestor between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the most distant insect species for which a significantly modified Smith-Waterman protein similarity score was calculated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Latent class analysis</title><p>We performed LCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Lanza, 2009</xref>) using the <italic>poLCA</italic> R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Linzer and Lewis, 2011</xref>). Specifically, we used 100 iterations of a latent class model with no covariates and with factors as follows: inferred gene age; monophyly; genomic location (classified as solely intergenic, antisense, sense, or any combination); phastCons score (binned as [0, 0.2], [0.2, 0.8], and [0.8, 1.0]); length (binned as [0, 20], [20, 50], and [50, infinity]); transcription (binned as TPM &gt;0.1 or â¤0.1 from maximum per-sample TPM); tissue specificity (binned as <italic>tau</italic> &gt;0.8 or â¤0.8 from FlyAtlas tissues); developmental specificity (binned as <italic>tau</italic> &gt;0.8 or â¤0.8 from modENCODE developmental stages). We excluded loci with missing values from LCA. We chose the number of classes (five) based on a combination of minimizing the BIC and AIC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D and E</xref>) as well as model interpretation similar to recommended procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Collins and Lanza, 2009</xref>). For the analysis of all utORFs, models with six classes did not converge on a single maximum-likelihood solution, suggesting potential under-identification, and were thus not considered.</p><p>We subsequently used the resulting five-class latent class model to predict the posterior class membership probabilities for each classified candidate locus. We used the modal probability to assign class membership. We also performed a parallel analysis of utORFs with canonical start codons, which led to similar conclusions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Validation of utORFs</title><sec id="s4-10-1"><title>Retention time validation</title><p>We used AutoRT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wen et al., 2020</xref>) to predict retention times of identified peptides from both annotated FlyBase proteins and utORFs. To train the model, we conducted transfer learning per each source run using the published AutoRT model (originally trained on PXD006109) with 40 epochs on either an NVIDIA K80 GPU or an NVIDIA V100 GPU; the training set consisted of only those annotated FlyBase peptides with posterior error probabilities of 0.01 or smaller as estimated by MaxQuant. We then used the per-run trained models with default parameters to predict the retention times of the peptides resulting from either the annotated FlyBase proteins or utORFs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10-2"><title>Empirical validation</title><p>We collected protein samples from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> 0â24 hr embryos (RAL517 strain) for validation of utORFs via MS. In brief, we homogenized dechorionated embryos with a mortar and pestle in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5; 137 mM NaCl; 0.25% NP-40; Roche cOmplete protease inhibitors) before centrifugation at 18,000 rpm at 4Â°C and filtration through a 0.45 micron PVDF membrane.</p><p>Purified protein was acetone-precipitated, reduced, and alkylated before digestion with LysC and trypsin, acidified, and solid-phase extraction. The resulting peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (120 min gradient, 25 cm EasySprayer column in high res./high mass accuracy mode) on a ThermoFisher Lumos instrument. In addition, the embryo sample was analyzed on the same instrument by PRM-MS, targeting a set of 16 tryptic peptides. We manually chose these targeted peptides based on the suitability of the peptide for targeting (i.e. few/no missed cleavages or modifications) the expression of the utORF in embryos and the strength of the prior detection from the Casas-Vila datasets.</p><p>We analyzed the shotgun data using ProteomeDiscoverer 1.4 and searched via Mascot against the Uniprot <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> database concatenated with common contaminants and our set of utORFs with a 1% peptide FDR. We analyzed the targeted data using SkylineMS (v. 21.2.0.369 [2efacf038]). We deposited the raw data in PRIDE under accession PXD032197.</p><p>We additionally reanalyzed published ribosome profiling data downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) project PRJNA306373 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>) and project SRP254283 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patraquim et al., 2020</xref>). For the Zhang dataset, we downloaded raw reads from the above SRA accessions, aligned them to the genome using hisat2 v.2.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), and calculated TPM using stringtie v.1.3.4d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pertea et al., 2016</xref>). We handled the Patraquim dataset similarly, except that we additionally trimmed the raw reads using trimmomatic 0.38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>) and filtered out reads aligning to annotated RNAs using bowtie2 v. 2.3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>) before alignment. For each utORF, we calculated the maximum TPM observed across either dataset and called the utORF as supported if the TPM was greater than 0.2.</p><p>To identify utORFs with statistically significant framing of ribosome-profiling reads, we used a binomial test as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Patraquim et al., 2020</xref>. We aligned the trimmed, filtered reads to the set of sequences corresponding to our utORFs, plus an additional 30 bp up- and downstream, using bowtie v. 1.3.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) with options â tryhard â suppress 1, 6, 7, and 8. We analyzed the resulting aligned footprints using the R package riboSeqR v 1.20.0. For each utORF with at least two unique footprints, we calculated the binomial probability of observing the number of footprints in the utORFâs frame vs. the other two frames at an uncorrected alpha of 0.05. We pooled footprints across replicates and across read lengths for a given utORF in each sample.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-78772-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables 1Aâ1E.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-78772-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>Raw MS data are deposited in PRIDE under accession number PXD032197.

annotating the currently nameless stretches of genomic sequence that actually code for proteins. The hundreds of fruit fly protein-coding genes described here offer new inroads for studying some of the very youngest functional elements in genomes, particularly those that have recently emerged from non-coding DNA sequences.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Molly Przeworski as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The question of the biological significance of genes identified here should be clearly articulated in a single, streamlined section. The authors should offer a list of genes that, based on their criteria (e.g., age, lack of presence/absence polymorphism in population datasets, retention time compared to annotated ORFs), are likely to be biologically significant. The authors should offer the reader a clear path to select genes for downstream functional analysis.</p><p>2) Related: the section on independent validation requires modification. This section leaves the reader wondering if only a tiny fraction of the genes described here are biologically significant.

The authors should offer a list of genes that, based on their criteria (e.g., age, lack of presence/absence polymorphism in population datasets, retention time compared to annotated ORFs), are likely to be biologically significant. The authors should offer the reader a clear path to select genes for downstream functional analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions. We have added new text at the end of the independent validation section of the results (see Lines 374-384). We use the combination of high transcription from published RNAseq atlases, either MS re-validation or framed ribosome profiling re-validation, and conservation metrics to define our priority for functional studies. In Figure 7 â Source Data File 2, we report these results, including a column that indicates priority for future work.</p><p>We have also revised the independent validation section of the results as well as the discussion to clarify our views on the overall biological significance of utORFs (See responses to items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 12, 15, and 17 for individual details.) In brief, we are confident in our identified utORFs, but we believe that when planning downstream functional analysis, it is best to target those with a combination of both strong experimental support and interesting conservation (both high and low conservation) in a tissue/developmental stage that robust experimental assays such as a fitness assay can be reasonably defined.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Related: the section on independent validation requires modification. This section leaves the reader wondering if only a tiny fraction of the genes described here are biologically significant. If expression heterogeneity accounts for the low rate of validation, then only utORFs expressed at the same developmental stage of the MS experiment should have been selected. Otherwise, this section should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion about the MS experiments: we did indeed target only utORFs expressed in the embryo, and we used a sample of embryos of mixed ages from 0-24 hours for both the targeted and the shotgun MS experiment. We have revised the text to directly state this without referencing the methods section (Lines 353-355; 357-359). We also realized that the word âheterogeneityâ can be confusing, so we have eliminated it from the manuscript.</p><p>We also have added a new framing re-analysis of the Patraquim data (see item 3) that further supports our utORFs. Given that MS methods in particular have notoriously low coverage even for canonical genes in humans, which is the best-studied organism for MS (Baker et al., Nat. Comm. 2016; PMID: 20411723), we believe that our validation rate is a conservative lower bound for the biological relevance of our utORFs. We have additionally revised our discussion to clarify this (Lines 428-437).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The study's significance is not sufficiently clear from the text.

Our hits actually have no overlaps with those reported in the supplementary information from Patraquim et al., 2020 (PMID: 32471506, which contains the data from PMID: 25144939). However, we note that they began with FlyBase-annotated CDSs and focused on the longest ORF per CDS with a canonical start codon. Our work begins with a six-frame translation of the genome, so it contains both the ORFs considered by Patraquim et al., and a far greater number of additional putative ORFs, most of which were not included in the Patraquim et al., analytical pipeline. We further improved our analysis by using the raw data from Patraquim et al., and implementing their binomial probability test for statistically significant framing (Lines 369-373; methods in Lines 639-646), which yields support for another 17 utORFs of 81 with footprints in the embryo. Note that Patraquim et al., amplified sequences from polysomes, so there will not be a hit if the transcript of a utORF is occupied by monosomes; since many of our utORFs are very short, it is possible they are preferentially translated by monosomes instead of polysomes (see also Heyer &amp; Moore 2016, PMID: 26871635, or in certain tissue, see Biever et al., PMID: 32001627). We believe that this both supports our proposed MS-first approach and highlights its potential for uncovering otherwise-missed genic loci.</p><p>The reviewers very accurately pointed out that the data from the two referenced papers about ribosome profiling contain periodicity (see also item 12). However, several other ribosome profiling datasets in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have a greater depth in terms of developmental stages and amount of data, but their data does not have periodicity information because they used a different enzyme. While we agree with reviewers that using ribosome profiling data with periodicity is ideal, we also believe that the other high-quality data without periodicity information remain very useful for this work. We thus kept those analyses while adding the analyses suggested by the reviewers to use periodicity data. As suggested, we have also edited the manuscript to highlight the significance of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The choice to proceed with the 993 utORFs needs more justification.

One main reason for the inclusion of utORFs with non-canonical start codons is that hits with non-canonical start codons are understudied, which has obvious relevance in the context of unrevealed protein evolutionary innovation. In the revised version, we have added a parallel analysis to the latent class analysis (Figures 4 and 5) that uses exclusively utORFs with canonical start codons. The results are qualitatively similar, with the major exception that short utORFs (which are often in the fast-evolving class) tend to not have canonical start codons. As a result, certain trends that we report with regards to that class are affected by considering only utORFs with canonical start codons. We report all of these in the revised LCA Results section (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2, Figure 4âfigure supplement 3, Figure 5âfigure supplement 2; and Lines 290-309).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The abstract and introduction open with the problem of de novo gene evolution.

It is possible that non-coding sequences may also be protected by ribosomes, in which case ribosome profiling alone would not be sufficient to prove the translation of an ORF. However, since we are studying sequences that have evidence of translation from MS, we believe that the issue here is less critical. Another practical reason is that several high-quality ribosome profiling datasets from <italic>Drosophila</italic> do not have periodicity, but it would be a pity to ignore them. We do strongly agree with the reviewers that periodicity is important, and as the reviewers mentioned, two papers from one group contain data from a few samples.
