Human exogenous retroviruses reverse-transcribe their RNA genome, insert it into the host chromatin, and use host factors to minimise the viral protein production to evade the immune response and persist in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bangham et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, influenza A virus infects the respiratory tract and produces thousands of viral progenitors in a single round of infection to spread in the surrounding epithelial cells by transcribing and replicating its RNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Einav et al., 2020</xref>). Influenza A virus genome is segmented into eight single-stranded RNAs, and expression of each gene is essential for productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dou et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike the human exogenous retroviruses, influenza A virus does not seem to have a sophisticated mechanism of controlling the viral gene expression at the transcription level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker and Fodor, 2019</xref>), such as transcription factor binding or epigenetic modifications. However, it has been known for decades that hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), the two influenza viral antigens targeted by the host immune response, are produced late during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lamb and Choppin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shapiro et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>), a mechanism of which remains currently unclear.</p><p>The eight viral RNA segments are transcribed by the same set of molecular machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>); thus, the mechanism of influenza viral transcription does not seem to explain the temporal protein expression. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza A virus, comprising polymerase basic 1 (PB1), polymerase basic 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic (PA) subunits, is responsible for viral transcription. These subunits are associated with the partially hybridised 5′ and 3′ joint end of a viral genomic RNA segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fodor et al., 1995</xref>). The oligomeric viral nucleoprotein (NP) binds to the rest of the intramolecular loop of the viral genomic RNA to form a viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arranz et al., 2012</xref>). The vRNPs are released into the host cytoplasm upon infection and migrate into the host nucleus for viral transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakadamyali et al., 2003</xref>). The vRNP initiates the viral transcription in the nucleus by deriving a 5′-capped short RNA fragment from the host nascent RNA on the stalled RNA polymerase II (Pol II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walker and Fodor, 2019</xref>). At the end of transcription, the viral polymerase adds a poly-A tail to the viral mRNA by stuttering on a short uridine repeat in the viral RNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Poon et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, eight viral segments sharing the common mechanism of viral transcription with no additional layers of transcriptional controls (e.g. binding of transcription factors), the transcription of eight influenza viral genes is likely to occur at the same rate across the segments that is determined by the collision of the vRNP and the stalled host Pol II.</p><p>Another possible factor that would determine the rate of transcription is the length of viral RNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Enami et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phan et al., 2021</xref>), given that the duration of transcription is rate-limiting. However, this does not agree with the order of protein expression in the influenza virus infection: PB2 (2.4 kb), PB1 (2.3 kb), and PA (2.2 kb), the three longest viral genes, and NP (1.8 kb) are expressed first, followed by the expression of three segments HA (1.8 kb), NA (1.5 kb), and M (1.0 kb) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lamb and Choppin, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hatada et al., 1989</xref>).</p><p>A third possibility is the nuclear retention of viral mRNAs. Nuclear retention of mRNAs has gained an attention as a point of control on the protein expression in the context of transcription burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</xref>). Previous studies reported the accumulation of M mRNAs in the nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mor et al., 2016</xref>), NXF1-dependent nuclear export of HA, NA, and M mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Read and Digard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>), and the nuclear export inhibition by the host factor hnRNPAB for M, HA, NP, and NS mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). It is becoming clear that the influenza viral segments show differential dependencies on the nuclear export factors, and this dependency is not accounted for by the RNA structure (i.e. whether they are intron-less, unspliced, or spliced). Because an incomplete set of viral segments was studied in each of these studies, the influenza viral mRNA transport remains elusive.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework for systematically quantifying the nuclear transport across all the eight viral segments. We localised eight viral mRNAs simultaneously in single cells <italic>in situ</italic>. Intracellular distribution of viral mRNAs indicated that the nuclear export rate of viral transcripts varied according to the segments. A statistical model, exploiting cell-to-cell variation in the abundance of transcripts due to the stochastic nature of multiple virological processes prior to the onset of viral transcription, allowed for the estimation of nuclear export rate from the intracellular distribution of mRNAs observed at a single time point. With this model, we revealed the variation of the nuclear export rate in the eight viral segments. Notably, we show that HA and NA mRNAs were the slowest in exiting the nucleus, suggesting the possibility that influenza A virus uses nuclear retention of mRNAs to delay the production of antigenic molecules in the course of viral infection. This study demonstrates that the nuclear export rate of nascent transcripts can be estimated from a snapshot of mRNAs localised in single cells. Our finding using this model serves as a reference for the nuclear export rate of influenza viral transcripts across the segments, shedding light on the comprehensive understanding on the nuclear export of viral transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Diffraction-limited, single-colour imaging of viral mRNAs</title><p>First, we used single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH) to study the viral transcription of PB1, HA, NP, and NS.

The median number of mRNAs per cell was 145, 231, 310, and 303 molecules for PB1 (2.3 kb), HA (1.8 kb), NP (1.8 kb), and NS (1.0 kb), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in line with the theoretical prediction that the rate of mRNA production is partly determined by the gene length.</p><p>What came intriguingly was the intracellular distribution of mRNAs of the four segments. The intracellular distribution of mRNAs projected on the XY plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) indicated that the HA mRNAs were more abundant in the nucleus compared with the other three segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>We wished to quantify the nuclear ratio of mRNAs in each cell. The mRNA count within the 2D nuclear projection is considered to be a good approximation for the number of mRNAs contained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miura et al., 2019</xref>). We validated this approximation for the lung epithelial A549 cells used in this study by looking at the intracellular Z positions of mRNAs: The mRNAs within the nuclear projection are expected to have higher Z positions over those of other mRNAs in the cell periphery, considering that the nucleus has the height of several microns, much thicker than the cytoplasm in the cell periphery. To this end, mRNAs were segmented into three regions in the 2D projection, i.e., nuclear, perinuclear, and peripheral, depending on the distance from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast to the perinuclear (orange) and peripheral (green) mRNAs, mRNAs within the nuclear projection (blue) were distributed around the nuclear focal plane Z=0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>); about 80% of mRNAs in the nuclear projection (blue) were above the baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), defined by the median of the Z distribution of peripheral NP mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, red dashed line). Thus, in this paper, we consider the spots within the nuclear 2D projection to be the nuclear fraction for the sake of simplicity.</p><p>With this approximation, about 30% of the PB1, NP, and NS mRNAs were nuclear, while ~70% of HA mRNAs were in the nuclear fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), confirming the visual inspection that the HA mRNAs are more abundant in the nucleus at the early time point of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This result indicates that the rate of viral mRNA export from the nucleus varies according to the viral segments. Note that our fluorescent probes could also detect complementary RNA (cRNA), an intermediate RNA that is produced for the viral genome replication, as it has the same polarity as viral mRNA. However, the fluorescent signals detected at 2 hr post-infection are deemed to be from the mRNAs because cRNA production occurs much later than the mRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawakami et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mapping eight viral mRNAs in single cells by multiplex RNA FISH</title><p>Next, we wish to simultaneously quantify all the eight viral segments <italic>in situ</italic>. To this end, we applied multiplex error-robust RNA FISH (MERFISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moffitt et al., 2016</xref>), an imaging-based transcriptome assay in which multiple rounds of probe hybridisation and imaging are performed to identify hundreds to thousands of mRNA species <italic>in situ</italic> by decoding binary fluorescent signals. For example, hundreds of distinct mRNAs can be encoded in 16-bit binary signals, in which case eight rounds of hybridisation and imaging would be required to read out the signals with two fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moffitt et al., 2016</xref>). In our case of detecting eight influenza A virus segments, 6 bits were sufficient to accommodate all the eight mRNAs, with each code being separated by two or more binary flips from others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Thus, only three rounds of hybridisation and two-colour imaging were required. We sought for an economical way of performing sequential rounds of hybridisation and imaging, instead of setting up a custom-built, automated liquid pumping system used elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moffitt et al., 2016</xref>). Inspired by an <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution assay of molecular motors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Miura et al., 2010</xref>), we assembled a flow cell on a slide glass, comprising two stripes of double-sided tape and the coverslip, with cells on the coverslip facing inwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Liquids were introduced from the right open side and wicked from the left. During image acquisition, the two open sides were sealed with rubber cement. This easy implementation of flow cell allowed us to comfortably perform three rounds of hybridisation and two-colour imaging to read out the 6-bit binary tags; and by decoding the 6-bit encodings, the eight viral segments were identified in each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). On average, about 100–200 molecules of each segment were contained per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, top row). The difference in the total number of spots from the result presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> is likely due to the batch effect (experimental variation).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Viral mRNA detection using multiplex RNA FISH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An overview of the assay. The viral mRNAs were hybridised with the encoding probes, and then the amplification probes were annealed (not shown in the diagram for simplicity).

This reiterates the idea that the rate of viral mRNA export from the nucleus varies according to the viral segments.

To this end, we conceived a statistical model using the cell-to-cell variation in the abundance of viral transcripts of each segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In this model, influenza viral particles are added to the cell population at time 0 hr and are allowed to undergo viral attachment to the cell surface, membrane fusion, and vRNP migration to the nucleus. The waiting time for these processes vary in each infection due to the stochastic nature of biochemical events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakadamyali et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heldt et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heldt et al., 2012</xref>), and therefore, the onset of viral transcription varies from cell to cell in the population. In other words, each cell will have a varying duration for viral transcription by the time the observation is made at time 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, top). As a result, the population contains ‘front runners’ in which the viral transcription was initiated early, and therefore, abundant viral transcripts are carried; ‘slow starters’ in which the transcription began late, containing fewer transcripts; and many other cells that lie along the spectrum between the two. The cell population at the single point in time, therefore, forms a trajectory of the time development of viral transcription and subsequent nuclear export on the scale of nuclear fraction against the abundance of transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom): In a spontaneous transcription burst, the nascent transcripts emerge in the nucleus at the early stage of the burst, and they are exported to the cytoplasm as more transcripts are being synthesised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Cell-to-cell heterogeneity for time-course inference.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A theoretical diagram of how viral mRNAs emerge in single cells in the population.

We gave the reason that the NP mRNAs were exported so rapidly that, in the time-course study, the nuclear ratio had already started to approach its lowest by the first time point following the baloxavir treatment, leading to the underestimation of the mRNA export rate. Using only the first two time points for the decay-constant fit (indicated with the orange line) did not make a significant difference (estimated rate 0.972 hr<sup>–1</sup> for the NP segment, the mean of three replicates).

This was achieved by <italic>in situ</italic> localisation of eight influenza A virus segments simultaneously, coupled with the statistical model that allowed for estimating the nuclear export rate from the intracellular distribution of mRNAs at a single time point. This is based on the concept that the cells in the population are at various stages of transcription at the time the observation is made, due to the multiple stochastic processes the virus needs to overcome before it begins transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakadamyali et al., 2003</xref>). We propose that the initiation of each viral transcription is concurrent in the eight viral segments; it is instead the nuclear export rate that controls the temporal protein expression at the initial phase of infection. The early production of the polymerase subunits (PB2, PB1, and PA) and NP would facilitate the formation of vRNP, and hence the viral transcription and genome replication. On the other hand, pushing back the peak of protein expression of viral antigens HA and NA on the cellular surface might be beneficial for the virus to delay the Fcγ-receptor-mediated, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">DiLillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ko et al., 2021</xref>) against the infected cells in which the virus is being replicated.</p><p>Instead of time-series measurements, the estimation of mRNA export rate was made from a snapshot of <italic>in situ</italic> RNA localisation data taken at a single time point. We anticipate that the statistical framework for quantifying the nuclear export rate proposed in our study has broad applications beyond the influenza virus infection. This benefits the research area on the regulation of gene expression, especially since nuclear retention has been recognised as a point of control against the transcription burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bahar Halpern et al., 2015</xref>). For example, it is applicable for the cell population in which <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of mRNAs occurs concurrently, such as a stimuli-induced activation of immediate-early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Miura et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kulkarni et al., 2018</xref>). In our use case for the influenza virus infection, synchronised infection was not necessary, such as incubating cells with the virus at 4°C to facilitate attachment and subsequently shifting to 37°C to allow viral entry. The inherent heterogeneity in vRNP migration to the nucleus still remains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakadamyali et al., 2003</xref>). This randomness does not compromise our model; rather, our model exploits this random arrival of each vRNP in each cell in the system. This variation, in turn, generates cells carrying varying amounts of transcripts, enabling the estimation of nuclear export rate. Importantly, more variation ensures the broader distribution of transcript levels, allowing for more precise parameter fitting in our model. It is also important to note that our model does not require the correlation between segments. Our model estimates the export rate of each mRNA species individually. On the contrary, this approach is not appropriate for scenarios in which transcription bursts occur repeatedly and randomly in each individual cell within the population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kiik et al., 2022</xref>); cells at the late stage of transcription burst, having residual amount of transcripts in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Billman et al., 2017</xref>), would obscure the time-course trajectory of the nuclear export.</p><p>The experiment in this study was conducted at the early stage of infection (up to 200 min post-infection). This conferred two advantages over investigating influenza viral mRNA export at the late stage of infection (e.g. 6–12 hr post-infection). First, our study allowed for the absolute quantification of viral transcripts at the single-molecule level in each cell and, thereby, enabled us to formulate the model and fit the equation to the numerical data points. Otherwise at the late stage of infection, accurate quantification of mRNAs by the imaging-based single-molecule detection would not be feasible due to the high density of mRNAs. Second, at the late stage of infection, NS1 protein would be expressed in the cytoplasm. NS1 protein would then migrate into the nucleus and alter the nuclear export of viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pereira et al., 2017</xref>), obscuring the inherent nature of nuclear export of each viral segment. Thus, minimising the impact of NS1 protein in our study, we elucidated the quantitative measure for the influenza viral mRNA nuclear export that is intrinsic to each viral segment.</p><p>Host factors that relay the influenza viral mRNAs to the nuclear pore remain elusive. NXF1 and CRM are two major cellular mRNA export pathways for the 5′-capped mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palazzo and Lee, 2018</xref>). Of these two pathways, influenza A virus mRNAs, also carrying 5′-cap structure derived from the host nascent mRNA and the poly-A tail as a result of viral polymerase stuttering the uridine repeat, are dependent on the NXF1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Read and Digard, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>). However, the eight viral segments show differential dependencies on this export pathway. The segments HA, M, and NS are exported by NXF1 and UAP56, whereas PB2, PB1, and PA appear to be independent of the NXF1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen et al., 2014</xref>). The nuclear export rate derived in our study does not agree with the dependencies on NXF1. According to the previous study, both HA and NS are dependent on NXF1 and UAP56 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Read and Digard, 2010</xref>); however, in our study, HA and NS had significantly different nuclear export rate.</p><p>Two viral segments M and NS are subject to splicing, yielding unspliced and spliced transcripts. Our current system lacks the ability of discriminating between the unspliced and spliced forms of these segments; although we infer that the majority of NS segments that we detected in this study were in the unspliced form because we obtained similar result with probes exclusively detecting the unspliced form of NS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). An observation that the unspliced form of M and NS dominates throughout the infection supports this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Phan et al., 2021</xref>). In either case, the RNA structure (whether spliced or unspliced) does not appear to accord with the NXF1 dependency, nor the nuclear export rate, either.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Exclusive detection of unspliced NS transcripts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Probe-binding sites on the NS segment.

It is tempting to speculate that the host factors (e.g. hnRNPAB) have differential binding affinities to each segment, thus determining the rate of nuclear export (or the degree of nuclear export inhibition). It remains currently unknown what factors bind to the early genes such as PB2, PB1, and PA. Further studies will be required to identify the host factors that bind to these transcripts for the nuclear export.</p><p>We suggest that the nuclear export of influenza viral transcripts is intrinsic to the nucleotide sequence of each segment. A recent study revealed the internal sequence in the influenza virus HA mRNA that determined its susceptibility to the nuclear export via TREX-2 at the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhat et al., 2023</xref>). This finding offers promising insights into the intrinsic sequences encoded in influenza viral transcripts. Our study serves as a reference for the nuclear export rate of each segment and, thus, sheds light to comprehensive understanding on the nuclear export of viral segments. By revealing the nuclear retention of influenza viral transcripts at the unprecedented resolution, this study opens up a new research direction on how the nuclear retention is regulated across the segments and its implication in viral pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (influenza virus)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">WSN</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10430945">10430945</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Influenza A virus <break/>(A/WSN/1933(H1N1))</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A549</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-185</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wash Buffer A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stellaris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SMF-WA1-60</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wash Buffer B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stellaris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SMF-WB1-20</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hybridization Buffer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stellaris</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SMF-HB1-10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Baloxavir acid</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Shionogi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SH-02</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Coverslip</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Matsunami Glass</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C0180HT</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.17±0.005 mm thickness</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells and virus preparation</title><p>The human lung carcinoma cell line A549 was maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) (Sigma, D5796) supplemented with 10% FBS (Nichirei Biosciences, 175012), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Gibco, 15140-122) at 37°C in 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

They set an experimental approach consisting of a 2-hour-long infection at a multiplicity of infection of 2 with the viral strain WSN. They used cells from the lung carcinoma cell line A549.

This model suggests that the influenza virus may control gene expression at the RNA export level, namely, the retention of certain transcripts in the nucleus for longer times, allows the generation of other viral encoded proteins that are exported regularly, and only later on do certain mRNAs get exported. These encode proteins that alert the cell to the presence of viral molecules, hence keeping their emergence to very end, might help the virus to avoid detection as late as possible in the infection cycle.</p><p>The study is of limited scope. The notion that some mRNAs are retained in the nucleus after transcription is concluded early on from the FISH data. The model does not contribute much to the understanding and is mostly confirming the FISH data. The export rate is an ambiguous number and this part is not elaborated upon. One is left with more questions since no mechanistic knowledge emerges, and no additional experimentation is attempted to try drive to a deeper understanding.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors have implemented the comments that required textual rewriting, which does make the paper clearer. On the experimental side, very little was done. It is fine to answer that the suggested experiments are not relevant or feasible for one reason or another, but one would expect to see some effort in providing other experimental sets to address key comments, and not only to modify a sentence in the text. So in my mind this round of revision feels more like some kind of intellectual discussion, which is fine, but I would have expected more, particularly after so much time has passed. I am still not satisfied with the way the analysis is presented in Fig. 2B, and writing a line about what is not analyzed in the legend, does not seem clear enough.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88468.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miura</surname><given-names>Michi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Kawasaki Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kurashiki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kiuchi</surname><given-names>Naho</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kurashiki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lau</surname><given-names>Siu-Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">HongKong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mok</surname><given-names>Bobo Wing-Yee</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">HongKong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ushirogawa</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kurashiki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Naito</surname><given-names>Tadasuke</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kurashiki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Honglin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>State Key Laboratory for Emerging Infectious Diseases, Department of Microbiology, The University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">HongKong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saito</surname><given-names>Mineki</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Microbiology, Kawasaki Medical School</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Kurashiki</named-content></addr-line><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>We thank the editors and reviewers for the comments and suggestions on our manuscript. The main point that we wished to convey in this paper was the concept and the kinetic model that enabled the estimation of nuclear export rate from an image of single mRNAs localised in single cells. By studying the influenza viral transcripts with this model, we report the variation in the mRNA nuclear export rate of the eight viral segments. Of note, the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase mRNAs were the slowest among the eight segments in exiting the nucleus. We agree that the potential mechanism and the biological impact of this observation require further validation, as the reviewers pointed out. We revised our manuscript to describe these points separately (Lines 21-25, Abstract; Lines 86-91, Introduction; Lines 316-320, Results; Lines 372-381, Discussion). We also highlight below, the revisions that we made to address the specific points raised by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Influenza viral transcription</p><p>The authors used specific settings for their virology experiments and several assumptions regarding their mathematical modelling, so it's extremely important that the reader has the viral life cycle clearly understood before immersing themselves in the results. Thus, a detailed explanation of the viral life cycle, including the kinetics of each step, would be extremely helpful if included in the introduction section. Reviewer #1</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the molecular composition of influenza vRNP and the mechanism of viral transcription in the revised manuscript (Lines 46-53).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 45: &quot;Eight viral RNA segments are transcribed by the same set of molecular machinery&quot; (Ref. 7). What's known about the arrival of the viral RNA segments in the nucleus? Is it synchronized? The authors will understand that my concern is related to the fact that a differential arrival would indeed impact the transcription and export processes. Reviewer #1</p></disp-quote><p>The arrival of eight vRNPs in the nucleus is not synchronised, with each of the eight vRNPs arriving independently (Chou et al. PLOS Pathogens 2013) (Lakadamyali et al, PNAS 2003). This does not compromise our model, as our model estimates the export rate of each mRNA species individually (also please see our response in Model assumption below). This is included in the second paragraph of the Discussion section (Lines 390-400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Model assumption</p><p>Even though I do not have the expertise to assess the authors' mathematical model, I do not doubt its robustness. Even so, I find some virological concerns related to the set-up of their experiments. According to what I understand, the authors performed non-synchronized 2 h-long infections with the WSN strain of influenza A virus. They did this to avoid cRNA production (and cross-reaction of the probes), which they claim to occur &quot;much later than mRNA synthesis&quot;. Then they omit the degradation of the mRNAs for their model without giving an explanation for having done so. So, taking all these into account, it seems to me that too many assumptions are made without a strong argument. I understand that they are made in order to simplify their model, but I strongly consider that the model would gain strength if some of these events were experimentally considered. Thus, would it be possible to perform synchronized infections? Would it be possible to empirically demonstrate that cRNA production does not occur within the first 2 hours of infection and/or separate transcription and replication? Would it be possible to incorporate a degradation inhibitor of the mRNAs into their infections? If all these could be achieved, then the results coming out of the mathematical model would be enormously reinforced. Reviewer #1</p><p>* The study lacks experimental data that would help support the conclusions. For instance, perturbations are many times used to prove a point related to gene expression. An example for Fig. 2 for such an experiment could be to treat the cells with transcription inhibitors (e.g. DRB, 5,6-dichloro1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole). Preventing transcription leaves only mature RNAs in the nucleus, and then using this system one can compare the export rate of different RNAs. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed that the primary concern in our model was the assumption that the mRNA degradation could be omitted. Synchronised infection is not necessary; in fact, non-synchronised infection is preferred, as we explain later in our response. Additionally, the dominance of mRNA production over the cRNA production has been documented elsewhere. To address mRNA degradation and validate our model estimation, we performed a time-course measurement using baloxavir. Baloxavir efficiently blocks the viral transcription by inhibiting the nuclease activity in PA. DRB, suggested by the reviewer, allows influenza viral transcription and causes viral transcripts to accumulate in the nucleus for unknown mechanisms (Amorim et al. Traffic 2007 and our observation using smFISH, not shown). The additional experiment, now presented in Fig. 5 in the revised manuscript, indicated that the mRNA degradation is minimal, and the export rate estimated in our model and the time-course experiment agreed well for the HA segment. The experiment raised the possibility that the time-course measurement underestimates the export rate of transcripts that exit the nucleus rapidly, such as NP. A real-time imaging of single transcripts would be necessary to directly measure the true nuclear export rate; however, this is beyond the scope of our paper. The new result is now presented in Fig. 5, Supplementary figures 3 and 4, and in the main text (Lines 322-360). An alteration was also made in Line 286 to guide to Fig. 5. The Materials and Methods section was updated (Lines 478-482).</p><p>We note that our model does not require synchronised infection. Even under synchronised infection, such as incubating cells with the virus at 4°C to facilitate attachment and subsequently shifting to 37°C to allow viral entry, the inherent heterogeneity in vRNP migration to the nucleus still remains. This randomness does not compromise our model; rather, our model exploits this random arrival of each vRNP in each cell in the system. This variation, in turn, generates cells carrying varying amounts of transcripts, enabling the estimation of nuclear export rate. Importantly, more variation ensures the broader distribution of transcript levels, enabling more precise parameter fitting in our model. It is also important to note that our model does not require the correlation between segments. Our model estimates the export rate of each mRNA species individually. These important points were explained in the Discussion section (Lines 390-400).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* There is no concrete value given for the export rates and what they might mean biologically (e.g. time present/stuck in the nucleus) - Fig. 4D. This leaves the reader in the dark. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>The export rate lambda (previously denoted as <italic>k</italic>) in our model (Fig. 4) and the decay constant <italic>k</italic> in the time-course measurement (Fig. 5) represent the proportion of mRNAs exported from the nucleus in an infinitesimal time, defining the nuclear export rate. This has been clarified in the revised manuscript (Lines 314-316), with some alterations to make the parameter use more comprehensive.</p><p>- The Greek letter <italic>k</italic> previously used in Fig. 4 and the associated equations was consistently replaced with lambda to avoid the confusion with the parameter <italic>k</italic> that is subsequently used for the exponent decay in Fig. 5 in the revised manuscript.</p><p>- The Greek letter epsilon (previously used to represent <italic>export</italic>) was replaced with mu, slightly more common for representing the rate of transport.</p><p>- The term “velocity” was consistently replaced with “rate” in the context of the nuclear export (Lines 163, 215, 320, 441).</p><p>- The phrase “molar concentrations of mRNAs” was corrected for “molecules of mRNAs” (Line 282).</p><p>Also, we have now described our model in two sections: “Conceiving the model” and “Implementing a kinetic model to estimate the nuclear export rate” in the Result. The first section outlines the conceptual framework of the model, and the second focuses on its implementation and the parameter extraction (Lines 227 and 277).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Applicability of the model</p><p>Lines 27-29. &quot;Our framework presented in this study can be widely used for investigating the nuclear retention of nascent transcripts produced in a transcription burst.&quot; In my opinion, this is the strongest point of the manuscript: developing a mathematical model to analyze nuclear export retention as a mechanism of protein expression control, which could lay the foundation for further biological processes. The authors revisit this idea in the Discussion section. However, which would be those processes for which the model could be helpful? I consider that a more conspicuous discussion on this topic would broaden the readers scope, a crucial point under the eLife scope. Reviewer #1</p><p>* Could this framework be used to quantify the nuclear export rate of cellular RNAs? According to the explanation in the Discussion, it would seem that this approach is limited to quantifying the export rate of influenza RNAs. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>Our model is not limited to the influenza virus infection. Our model is applicable for systems where transcription is initiated concurrently, such as when stimuli trigger the activation of a certain set of genes for transcription. Therefore, this makes it particularly valuable for quantifying the nuclear retention of mRNAs in a transcription burst. This point is reiterated in Line 383-390.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Potential mechanisms for differential nuclear export rate of viral segments</p><p>* There is no mechanistic insight in the study. The idea driven by this study is that gene expression is regulated by the RNA export rate. But how is that explained? Is there any molecular pathway or explanation for this model? If the transcripts are ready for export, why do the mRNAs stay inside the nucleus? One option to consider are the export factors. Viral RNAs are exported by different pathways as mentioned (line 362), or by TREX2 (Bhat P et al Nat Comm 2023). The data shows that there is no difference observed in the export rate of different pathways. How about knocking down an important export factor to show how this affects the export rates. Or the opposite, overexpress a certain factor, would this change the nucleus/cytoplasm distribution of the retained RNAs. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>As we discussed in the paper, we are beginning to consider that each viral segment has an intrinsic sequence that determines its nuclear export rate, because previous studies on the export factors does not fully explain the variation in the nuclear export rate observed in our study. As the reviewer suggested, a recent study (Bhat et al. Nature Communications 2023) exactly pointed out the internal sequence in the HA segment, aligning with our working hypothesis. This point is discussed and their work (Bhat et al. 2023) has been cited in the Discussion section in the revised manuscript (Lines 446-449).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Biological impact of the nuclear retention</p><p>The authors mention several times throughout the manuscript that the virus might use the nuclear retention of mRNA for HA and NA to postpone the expression of these antigenic molecules. At this point, I need to admit that a great question mark appeared in my mind, maybe related to the fact that some knowledge is lacking in my analysis. Lines 328-330: &quot;On the other hand, pushing back the expression of viral antigens HA and NA would be beneficial for the virus to delay the host immune response against the infected cells in which the virus is being replicated.&quot; As I tend to understand, the host immune response recognizes HA and NA within the viral particle, if so and independently of the time that HA and Na arrive at the virus assembly step, the progeny' viral particles that are complete and extruded from the cells would be those awakening the host immunity response. If this is right, how would the delayed export of those proteins from the nucleus (and their late expression) be beneficial for delaying the immune response? I would appreciate an explanation for this point, and if I am wrong, then there could exist a relationship between nuclear export rate and the pathogenicity of different strains of influenza A virus. If so, could the authors challenge their model with additional viral strains showing a differential immune response pattern? A deeper analysis in this direction would greatly strengthen the message in their manuscript. Reviewer #1</p><p>* Is the timing of viral protein appearance in accordance with the time the mRNA is exported to the cytoplasm. It is logical that the first mRNA to go to the cytoplasm would be the first to become a protein. Can the authors show that nuclear retention of mRNA would push back the expression of the viral antigens HA and NA. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>Three types of immune reactions are being studied extensively. The first is the humoral immune response, where antibodies target the viral antigens HA and NA on the viral envelope, coating and inactivating the viral particles. The second is the cytotoxic T cell response. There is growing evidence that cytotoxic T cells react against NP, eliciting cross-reaction to broader range of influenza viral strains. This reaction is not specific to HA and NA, and antigens are processed in the cytoplasm and presented on the MHC. The third is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), where antibodies recognise the viral proteins on the cellular surface (HA and NA) of infected cells, facilitating their elimination by the NK cells. Although protein translation may begin as soon as the first mRNA exits the nucleus, the virus may delay the peak of the antigen production and therefore, postpone the NK-mediated ADCC. This specific point, along with references to ADCC in influenza virus infection, has been clarified in the Discussion section (Lines 377-381).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Data analysis and presentation</p><p>Lines 99-101. &quot;Viral mRNAs were detected as single diffraction-limited spots in the three-dimensional image stacks, allowing for absolute mRNA quantification (Fig. 1B)&quot;. What do the authors mean to say by &quot;absolute mRNA quantification&quot;? Do they refer to the total spots or the total mRNAs? Is it assumed that one spot corresponds to a single mRNA transcript? This is not clear at all for this reviewer, which could be the situation for a potential reader. Since it's the beginning of the story, this should be clearly stated in the manuscript. Reviewer #1</p></disp-quote><p>Each spot of fluorescent signal corresponds to a single molecule of viral mRNA. We quantified the absolute number of transcripts in each cell. This is clarified in the revised manuscript (Lines 104-106).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* Line 151: does the baseline change according to the RNA in question? The authors say that the &quot;baseline is defined by the median of the Z distribution of peripheral mRNAs&quot; - it seems that the number 0.731 refers only to one type of RNA (which is not mentioned at all not in the text and not in the legend). Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>The baseline was set using the NP mRNAs in the cytoplasm because the NP mRNA showed the widest distribution across the cytoplasm (Line 157).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>* Also, what is all the signal that is seen outside the marked cells in Fig. 2B? There seems to be significant background in the field, does this mean much false-positive in the multiplex FISH? If so, then how do the authors know that the staining inside the cells isn't to some degree non-specific? It would be necessary to back this up with some other type of quantitative assay like qRT-PCR. Reviewer #2</p></disp-quote><p>The cells were removed from the analysis if the cytoplasmic boundary touched any edge of the field-of-view, while the signals were recovered across the entire field-of-view.
