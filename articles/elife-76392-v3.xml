autolysins to induce cell lysis. Despite the clinical importance of this phenomenon, little is known about the factors that control autolysins and how penicillins subvert this regulation to kill cells. In the pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>), LytA is the major autolysin responsible for penicillin-induced bacteriolysis. We recently discovered that penicillin treatment of <italic>Sp</italic> causes a dramatic shift in surface polymer biogenesis in which cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs) increase in abundance at the expense of lipid-linked teichoic acids (LTAs). Because LytA binds to both species of teichoic acids, this change recruits the enzyme to its substrate where it cleaves the cell wall and elicits lysis. In this report, we identify WhyD (SPD_0880) as a new factor that controls the level of WTAs in <italic>Sp</italic> cells to prevent LytA misactivation and lysis during exponential growth . We show that WhyD is a WTA hydrolase that restricts the WTA content of the wall to areas adjacent to active peptidoglycan (PG) synthesis. Our results support a model in which the WTA tailoring activity of WhyD during exponential growth directs PG remodeling activity required for proper cell elongation in addition to preventing autolysis by LytA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>penicillin</kwd><kwd>lysis</kwd><kwd>cell wall hydrolase</kwd><kwd>teichoic acids</kwd><kwd>wall teichoic acid</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Streptococcus pneumoniae</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32AI36431</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Flores-Kim</surname><given-names>Josué</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI083365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127399</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM086466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI139083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bernhardt</surname><given-names>Thomas G</given-names></name><name><surname>Rudner</surname><given-names>David Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI132120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dobihal</surname><given-names>Genevieve S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Selective removal of Wall Teichoic Acids from the envelope of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> prevents bacteriolysis and directs zonal cell wall synthesis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most bacterial cells are surrounded by a cell wall matrix composed of peptidoglycan (PG). This exoskeletal layer fortifies the cell membrane against internal osmotic pressure and is essential for cell integrity. The PG consists of glycan polymers with a repeating disaccharide unit of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Attached to the MurNAc sugar is a short peptide that is used to form crosslinks between adjacent glycan polymers, generating an interconnected PG matrix. Synthesis of the PG heteropolymer is mediated by the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), some of which possess both glycosyltransferase and transpeptidase activity needed to polymerize and crosslink the glycan strands of PG, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goffin and Ghuysen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauvage et al., 2008</xref>). The glycans are also polymerized by SEDS (shape, elongation, division and sporulation)-family proteins that work in unison with monofunctional PBPs possessing crosslinking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Meeske et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rohs et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sjodt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Because PBPs are the targets of penicillin and related β-lactam drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strominger and Tipper, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tipper and Strominger, 1965</xref>), much of the research focus in the field of cell wall biology has been on the regulation of cell wall synthesis by these enzymes and their inhibition by cell wall targeting antibiotics.</p><p>Since the PG layer is a continuous matrix, cell wall biogenesis also requires the activity of enzymes that cut bonds in the network called PG hydrolases or autolysins. These space-making factors are important for breaking bonds in the matrix to allow for its expansion and the insertion of new material into the pre-existing meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballido-López et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobihal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dörr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson and Garner, 2021</xref>). They also play important roles in cleaving shared cell wall material connecting daughter cells during cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hashimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson and Garner, 2021</xref>). Given their potential to induce cell wall damage, it has long been appreciated that bacteria must employ robust mechanisms to prevent aberrant PG cleavage and lysis by autolysins. Notably, β-lactams and related antibiotics have long been known to kill bacteria by corrupting the activity of PG hydrolases to damage the cell wall and cause catastrophic lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salamaga et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>). Despite the relevance of this phenomenon for antibiotic development, surprisingly little is known about the regulatory mechanisms governing when and where autolysins are activated during normal growth and how antibiotics disrupt these processes to induce lysis. Identifying the factors involved would address an outstanding question in microbiology and reveal attractive new vulnerabilities in bacterial cells to target for the discovery of novel lysis-inducing drugs.</p><p>One of the main challenges in elucidating mechanisms controling PG hydrolase activity has been the genetic redundancy of these enzymes. Mutants defective in one or even several PG hydrolases rarely display a phenotype that can be exploited for genetic analysis of their regulation. To circumvent this difficulty, we used the gram-positive pathogen <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<italic>Sp</italic>) because it only requires a single autolysin, LytA, to trigger its characteristic growth-phase-dependent and antibiotic-induced lysis phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomasz and Waks, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tomasz et al., 1970</xref>). This reliance on a single enzyme for lysis induction allowed us to design a transposon sequencing (Tn-Seq) screen for factors that control LytA activity based on the identification of essential genes that become dispensable when LytA is inactivated. The screen revealed that LytA regulation is intimately linked to the biogenesis of surface glycopolymers called teichoic acids (TAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>TAs are major constituents of the gram-positive cell envelope and include both lipoteichoic acids (LTAs), which are membrane anchored, and wall teichoic acids (WTAs), which are covalently attached to the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Sp</italic> cells, both types of TAs are made from a common precursor linked to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate (Und-P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heß et al., 2017</xref>). They are also decorated with choline moieties, which serve as binding sites for LytA and other <italic>Sp</italic> enzymes with choline-binding domains (CBDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heß et al., 2017</xref>). We previously found that during exponential growth, LTAs predominate and sequester LytA at the membrane thereby preventing cell wall damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). However, upon antibiotic treatment or upon prolonged periods in stationary phase, the membrane protease FtsH degrades the LTA synthase TacL, causing a dramatic decrease in LTA levels, and an increase in WTAs. This switch in TA polymer abundance leads to the relocalization of LytA from the membrane to the cell wall where its cleavage activity compromises wall integrity, inducing lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we characterized another essential <italic>Sp</italic> gene, <italic>spd_0880</italic>, that becomes dispensable in cells lacking LytA. We have renamed this gene <italic>whyD</italic> (<underline>W</underline>TA <underline>hyd</underline>rolase) based on our results showing that it encodes a membrane-anchored enzyme that removes WTAs from the <italic>Sp</italic> cell wall. Cells inactivated for WhyD accumulate high levels of WTAs in their cell wall during growth when these polymers are normally low in abundance relative to LTAs. Thus, LytA is constitutively recruited to the wall in <italic>whyD</italic> mutant cells where its PG cleavage activity elicits lysis. Notably, we found that WhyD is not only needed to control the abundance of WTAs but is also required to restrict their localization in the wall to areas of cell elongation. We further show that the activity of choline-binding PG hydrolases that associate with WTAs is important for the normal elongation of <italic>Sp</italic> cells. Taken together, our results support a model in which the tailoring of WTAs by WhyD helps direct the activity of space maker PG hydrolases to locations of cell wall expansion in addition to preventing LytA-induced autolysis during exponential growth .</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of WhyD</title><p>To identify regulators of autolysis, we previously performed a Tn-Seq screen for essential <italic>Sp</italic> genes that become dispensable in a Δ<italic>lytA</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In addition to <italic>tacL</italic> described in our original report, we found that the <italic>whyD</italic> (<italic>spd_0880</italic>) gene also displayed a pattern of essentiality/non-essentiality expected for a LytA regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In wild-type (WT) cells, relatively few transposon insertions were mapped in <italic>whyD</italic>, consistent with previous genomic studies that reported it to be an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van Opijnen and Camilli, 2012</xref>). By contrast, in cells lacking LytA, insertions in <italic>whyD</italic> were readily detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To validate the Tn-seq results, we constructed a LytA-depletion strain in which the sole copy of <italic>lytA</italic> was under the control of a zinc-regulated promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eberhardt et al., 2009</xref>). When LytA was absent (no inducer), cells were viable in the presence or absence of <italic>whyD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, when LytA was expressed (+Zn), viability was severely compromised only in cells deleted for <italic>whyD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Furthermore, LytA production in cells lacking WhyD during growth in liquid medium caused premature lysis in late exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/44912#fig2">Figure 1C</ext-link></xref>). Finally, the sensitivity of the Δ<italic>whyD</italic> strain to LytA activity could be recapitulated by the addition of purified recombinant LytA (rLytA) to cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Addition of rLytA to a Δ<italic>lytA</italic> mutant during exponential growth restored the stationary phase autolysis phenotype exhibited by WT cells whereas its addition to a Δ<italic>lytA</italic> Δ<italic>whyD</italic> double mutant resulted in lysis almost immediately after exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, <italic>whyD</italic> has the properties expected for a gene encoding a factor that restrains LytA activity at the cell surface.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>WhyD</italic> essentiality is <italic>lytA</italic>-dependent.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transposon insertion profiles in wild-type (WT) and the ∆<italic>lytA</italic> mutant.

Together with the findings presented above, we hypothesized that WhyD hydrolyzes and releases WTAs from the cell wall during exponential growth to prevent LytA recruitment to the wall and the subsequent destruction of the PG layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test this possibility and to facilitate purification, we expressed and purified the soluble C-terminal GlpQ domain of WhyD (WhyD<sup>CT</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), and monitored its ability to release WTAs from purified sacculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

To follow nascent PG and recently synthesized wall material that had moved away from midcell during cell elongation, we first pulse-labeled cells with HADA and 5 min later added the compatibly labeled FDAA sBADA. We then washed the cells with medium containing 1% choline to remove native choline-binding proteins from the WTAs to ensure that the choline moieties were fully accessible to rLytA*-Alexa. Cells were then incubated with rLytA*-Alexa for 30 s, washed to remove unbound probe and imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Elongating cells displayed a weak rLytA*-Alexa signal at midcell that co-localized with sBADA. The sBADA signal at midcell was flanked by two prominent fluorescent bands of rLytA*-Alexa that co-localized with HADA-labeled peripheral PG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and C</xref>). Consistent with WhyD hydrolyzing WTAs at midcell, co-localization analysis of GFP-WhyD and WTAs showed an anti-correlation between GFP-WhyD enrichment at midcell and WTA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4</xref>). In cells nearing the completion of cell division, the pattern changed with rLytA*-Alexa and HADA co-localizing within the deep cell constrictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s6">6</xref>). Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and image deconvolution analyses revealed similar localization patterns with rLytA*-Alexa localizing in regions offset from midcell in elongating cells and at deep constrictions in cells that have nearly completed division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">Figure 7—figure supplement 5C</xref>). In support of the idea that WhyD is responsible for promoting the observed WTA localization, rLytA*-Alexa was present throughout the PG matrix in cells lacking WhyD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Altogether, these results support a model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) in which WhyD removes most, but not all, WTAs from nascent PG at midcell, resulting in low levels of WTAs being incorporated in the peripheral PG that brackets the septum. This localization of WTAs likely allows the recruitment of PG hydrolases to the peripheral region to promote the zonal expansion of the cell wall for elongation. Similarly, the change in WTA localization to deep constrictions in late-divisional cells is consistent with the role for the polymers in recruitment of LytB and other choline-binding PG hydrolases to catalyze the last stage of cell separation. Thus, localized pruning of WTAs from nascent PG by WhyD provides a mechanism by which <italic>Sp</italic> can direct the activity of its PG hydrolases to facilitate growth and division of the PG matrix (see Discussion).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>WhyD tailors wall teichoic acids (WTAs) to direct cell elongation.</title><p>Schematic model of WhyD function. WhyD releases the majority WTAs attached to the cell wall during nascent PG synthesis at midcell. A subset of the WTAs remain intact and as the cell elongates these polymers recruit PG hydrolases with choline-binding domains (yellow, orange, red Pac-Men) to the zone of peripheral PG synthesis, promoting expansion of the cell wall meshwork and cell elongation. At a late stage of cell constriction, WTAs accumulate at midcell (yellow) where they recruit PG hydrolases that promote cell separation. At this stage, WhyD might not be localized at midcell or its activity could be inhibited. Upon entry into stationary phase or exposure to cell wall targeting antibiotics (autolysis), WhyD is unable to keep pace with the increase in WTA synthesis and/or is actively inhibited, leading to an increase in WTAs throughout the sacculus.

However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which WTAs are localized and how they might participate in the spatio-temporal regulation of PG hydrolase activity have remained unclear for some time. Here, we show that WTA tailoring by the WhyD hydrolase plays an important role in this control process by promoting the localized accumulation of WTA polymers at sites adjacent to active areas of PG synthesis in <italic>Sp</italic> cells. This pruning of WTAs prevents the excessive recruitment of the LytA PG hydrolase to the cell wall to avoid autolysis during exponential growth. Additionally, our results suggest that the localization of WTAs promoted by WhyD also functions to guide the activity of WTA-binding PG hydrolases to specific subcellular sites where they can promote the remodeling of the wall necessary for proper cell elongation and division.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>WTA turnover and localization in <italic>Sp</italic> cells</title><p>In our previous study, we found that inactivation of the LTA synthase TacL resulted in the dramatic accumulation of WTAs in the cell wall of <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Because LTAs and WTAs are made from the same precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heß et al., 2017</xref>), this observation suggested that LTAs predominate in the envelope in exponentially growing cells due to TacL outcompeting the WTA ligases (LCP proteins) for their common substrate. However, the discovery that WhyD inactivation also causes a dramatic increase in WTA accumulation in exponentially growing cells without affecting LTA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) indicates that instead of substrate competition, it is likely that the continuous degradation of WTAs maintains their low levels in the cell wall of actively growing cells.</p><p>In addition to reducing the total WTA content attached to the PG matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), the WTA cleavage activity of WhyD also results in the localized accumulation of these polymers at sites adjacent to areas of active wall growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Determining how this localization is achieved will require further investigation, but this phenomenon is likely to arise from the enrichment of WhyD at midcell where most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), if not all, of the nascent PG synthesis takes place in <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boersma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trouve et al., 2021</xref>). Biochemical studies suggest that WTAs are most efficiently attached to nascent PG before the newly synthesized glycans are crosslinked into the pre-existing meshwork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rausch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schaefer et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, the balance between WTA addition and cleavage at midcell could explain the observed pattern of WTA localization. In this scenario, the enrichment of WhyD in the septal region is likely to result in the removal of most but not all WTAs added to nascent PG. Zonal PG synthesis would then be expected to push the WTA-decorated PG material away from the cell center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). If processing of WTAs from this older material were less efficient due to the lower concentration of WhyD outside midcell and/or the reduced accessibility of WTAs attached to more mature PG, the expected result would be a gradient of WTA accumulation centered at positions adjacent to midcell, as observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Re-localization of WhyD to the future daughter cell septa to prepare for the next cell cycle could then be responsible for the midcell accumulation of WTAs displayed by cells in the final stages of division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible role of WTAs in directing the activity of space-making PG hydrolases</title><p>However, WTA localization is achieved, PG hydrolases and other proteins with choline-binding domains are expected to be concentrated where the choline-containing polymers accumulate. As observed in other gram-positive bacteria, including <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>, the concentration of WTAs at late-stage septa is likely to promote the midcell recruitment of hydrolases to facilitate daughter cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zamakhaeva et al., 2021</xref>). The finding that Δ<italic>lytABC</italic> cells lacking three major WTA-binding PG hydrolases have a short cell phenotype that resembles that of cells overproducing WhyD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), which reduces their WTA content, suggests an additional role for WTA-guided PG hydrolases during cell elongation. In many bacteria, such space-making PG cleavage activity is essential for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bisicchia et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carballido-López et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobihal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dörr et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meisner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Singh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sycuro et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>). Although WTA biogenesis is essential in <italic>Sp</italic> cells in accordance with such a role in cell elongation, the Δ<italic>lytABC</italic> mutant lacking all the known WTA-binding PG hydrolases produced during normal exponential growth is viable. Thus, either there are other WTA-binding PG hydrolases with a space-making function yet to be identified in <italic>Sp</italic> cells or WTAs have an essential function other than promoting cell wall expansion. In either case, the viability of the Δ<italic>lytABC</italic> mutant suggests that there are additional space-making PG hydrolases in <italic>Sp</italic> cells. Whether they are also directed by WTAs or are membrane-associated factors regulated by potential parallel pathways like PcsB and/or MltG (MpgA) remains to be determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perez et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sham et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Taguchi et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Trouve et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>WTA cleavage activity of WhyD</title><p>WhyD has seven predicted N-terminal transmembrane segments in addition to a C-terminal GlpQ-like domain (WhyD<sup>CT</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). GlpQ-containing proteins from other gram-positive bacteria like <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> have been shown to function as WTA hydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walter et al., 2020</xref>). Unlike WhyD, which is membrane-anchored and essential for normal growth, the previously characterized GlpQ-containing proteins are secreted and function to promote growth during phosphate-limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walter et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>B. subtilis</italic> (strain 168), LTAs and WTAs are both glycerolphosphate polymers, and <italic>B. subtilis</italic> GlpQ (<sup>Bs</sup>GlpQ) has been shown to act as an exolytic enzyme that specifically degrades WTAs based on their distinct enantiomeric configuration relative to LTAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorge et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walter et al., 2020</xref>). Our biochemical results indicate that WhyD is also specific for WTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, because WTAs and LTAs in <italic>Sp</italic> cells are built from a common undecaprenyl-linked precursor and have an identical polymeric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>), WhyD is unlikely to cleave within the polymer itself. Consistent with this idea, in contrast to <sup>Bs</sup>GlpQ, which completely hydrolyzes its WTA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Walter et al., 2020</xref>), WhyD releases polymers from the wall with a length distribution that mirrors that of the LTAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given that the only major difference between WTAs in <italic>Sp</italic> cells relative to the precursor or the LTAs is its linkage to the PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Denapaite et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fischer et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gisch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heß et al., 2017</xref>), we favor a model in which WhyD works as an endoenzyme, specifically cleaving the phosphate linkage between the WTA polymer and PG. In support of this idea, WhyD<sup>CT</sup> is unable to release TA polymers from membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that it is unable to hydrolyze LTAs or the Und-P linked TA precursor.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Are WTAs recycled by WhyD?</title><p>A mechanism for controling the WTA content of the wall and its localization by cleaving a significant portion of the polymers that are made seems wasteful and inefficient. However, such a scenario is not that different from the synthesis of the cell wall itself, which has been reported to involve the turnover of up to 50% of the PG layer per generation in other bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Borisova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Johnson et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that WTAs may be recycled in <italic>Sp</italic> cells in a manner similar to how PG turnover products are recycled in many bacterial species. A WTA recycling activity seems especially important for <italic>Sp</italic> given that it is auxotrophic for the choline moieties that decorate its teichoic acids. Notably, the N-terminal multi-pass transmembrane domain of WhyD shares remote homology with a family of plasma-membrane choline transporters (PF04515), raising the intriguing possibility that this domain might function to import the WTA polymers cleaved by WhyD<sup>CT</sup> to recycle choline and other components of the polymers.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>WhyD activity and autolysis</title><p>We discovered WhyD based on its essential function in preventing LytA-induced autolysis of <italic>Sp</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Inactivation of choline-binding hydrolase other than LytA were unable to suppress <italic>whyD</italic> essentiality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating that the misactivation of other hydrolases does not play a major role in the lethal phenotype of the ∆<italic>whyD</italic> mutant. Like mutants lacking the LTA synthase TacL, cells inactivated for WhyD accumulate high levels of WTAs in their walls during normal exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). These levels of WTAs are comparable to those observed in cells treated with penicillin where the excess recruitment of LytA to the PG layer results in damage to the wall and lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our previous work found that the accumulation of WTAs in penicillin-treated cells requires the FtsH-mediated degradation of TacL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). This process presumably also requires the release of LTAs from the membrane to prevent them from sequestering LytA away from the WTAs and PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flores-Kim et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, WhyD appears to be stable under autolytic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whether its activity must also be inhibited for autolytic induction and whether other mechanisms involved in controling autolysis exist remains unknown and requires further investigation. Nevertheless, our results clearly show that inhibition of WhyD during exponential phase has the potential to trigger cell lysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, <italic>B. subtilis</italic> mutants inactivated for GlpQ are hypersensitive to several β-lactam antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Myers et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that WTA remodeling is generally important for controling autolysis in gram-positive bacteria. Thus, WhyD and other related GlpQ family members represent attractive targets for the development of new classes of lysis-inducing antibiotics and/or potentiators of existing β-lactam drugs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;WhyD tailors surface polymers to prevent bacteriolysis and direct cell elongation in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. We apologize for the delay it has taken in making a decision. Your article has now been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Alexandre W Bisson Filho (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The proposed model appropriately explains the regulation of autolysis in exponentially grown cells. However, cells still undergo autolysis in late stationary phase which does not appear to be WhyD-dependent. It would be good to make sure that the narrative clearly acknowledges this puzzling observation; the title seems a bit misleading and the discussion should clearly indicate this current gap in our knowledge.</p><p>2) The authors model suggest that the activity of WhyD would reduce the activity of any cell wall hydrolase that also bind choline. In other words, can lethality of whyD mutations be also reverted in genetic mutants other than lytA, for example cbpD? Does whyD deletion lead to second site suppressors that affect other hydrolases?</p><p>3) The microscopy data needs better quantitation and visualization. For example, it's not clear whether there were replicates, the sample size (informing that at least 300 cells were used is not enough information to inform on sample size effects). Sub-panels where no signal is apparently detected (e.g. Figure 7 and supplements) should be clarified and the background should be displayed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The proposed model to explain the control of autolysis in exponentially growing cells (and during early stationary phase) is convincing and the data presented nicely support it. As (briefly) stated in the text, cells still undergo autolysis in late stationary phase despite the production of WhyD, indicating that (an)other mechanism(s) exist(s) to control peptidoglycan hydrolysis. It would be good to make sure that the narrative clearly acknowledges this puzzling observation; the title seems a bit misleading and the discussion should clearly indicate this current gap in our knowledge.</p><p>The data show that despite the production of WhyD during autolysis, WTAs are detected, suggesting that the enzyme is inactive (or present in insufficient amounts). Looking at the Western Blots in figure 2 —figure supplement 1, it is difficult to know what panel A is showing (no molecular weights are shown). What does the cropped image show? Is this the full length protein? (why are the 2 bands recognized by the anti-WhyD serum in Figure 6B not seen in Figure 2 Supp 1?).</p><p>Several mechanisms could account for the lack of WhyD activity, including a proteolytic cleavage, releasing the catalytic domain away from nascent peptidoglycan or the lack of a co-factor. I certainly agree that WhyD is present throughout growth, but it is possible that the amount of protein decreases in autolytic phase. The authors should be more cautious and/or quantify the relative amount of WhyD throughout growth (using densitometry). &quot;WhyD levels remain constant throughout growth and under autolytic conditions&quot; is a bit assertive given the experimental evidence shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I really like the paper and I think there should not be much work to be done to get it ready for publication. I have my comments and suggestion in order as it shows in the manuscript:</p><p>Line 7: &quot;Penicillin and related antibiotics disrupt cell wall synthesis in bacteria and induce lysis by misactivating cell wall hydrolases called autolysins&quot;</p><p>This sentence should be re-written. As it is, it misleads non-experts to think that Penicillin stops cell wall synthesis BY directly activating hydrolases, resulting in lysis. That's not the broad mechanism of Penicillin. The central problem with the sentence might be &quot;misactivating&quot;. I understand that the conclusion of the paper solidifies the idea that, in the absence of proper cell wall synthesis, hydrolase misactivation results in lysis and this is important in the context of some antibiotics. But again, you should be careful not to confuse the general public target of this journal. This also re-appears in line 97.</p><p>Line 51: &quot;We recently discovered that penicillin treatment of Sp causes a dramatic shift in surface polymer biogenesis in which cell wall-anchored teichoic acids (WTAs) increase in abundance at the expense of lipid-linked lipoteichoic acids&quot;.</p><p>You can simplify &quot;lipid-linked lipoteichoic acids&quot; by &quot;lipoteichoic acids&quot; as &quot;lipo&quot; already implies &quot;lipid-linked&quot;. For consistency, you can ass &quot;(LTA)&quot; at the end to make the contrast with &quot;WTA&quot;.</p><p>Line 54: &quot;Because LytA binds to these polymers,…&quot;</p><p>What polymer? PG? WTA? LTA? Please be specific.</p><p>Line 93: &quot;They also play important roles in cleaving shared cell wall material connecting daughter cells during cytokinesis (Vollmer et al., 2008)&quot;.</p><p>I suggest adding this interesting and important paper as well: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29458657/</p><p>Also, as far as I know, the most comprehensive work on the global deletion of all hydrolases in Bacillus and how the majority of them play a role in daughter cell separation. This same reference can be used in lines 107-110: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.18.431929v1</p><p>I also like the following: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12399477/</p><p>Line 161: &quot;Furthermore, LytA production in cells lacking WhyD during growth in liquid medium caused premature lysis in late exponential phase (Figure 1C).&quot;</p><p>Why would this happen only in the late exponential/stationary phase? Or this is only detected in bulk growth at this stage but it's consistently happening throughout all phases?</p><p>Figure 1D: why the concentration of purified WhyD needs to be so high (1mg/ml)? If a titration was done, could be interesting to include the data and a sentence.</p><p>Line 204: &quot;To test this possibility, we purified the C- terminal GlpQ domain of WhyD (WhyDCT) and monitored its ability to release WTAs from purified sacculi (Figure 3B)&quot;.</p><p>Make sure to clarify that the reason to purify the GlpQ sub-domain alone is because of the difficulty to purify it together with the transmembrane region.</p><p>Figures 4 and 5: I fail to understand what the GFP, HADA, and sBADA are doing there. And why sometimes do you use one or another probe? There is nothing about it in the text. Also, I strongly recommend including sample N in every plot. If possible, please change distributions to superplots where we can visualize the distributions of each biological replicate.</p><p>Figure 4: I noticed from the images that the major difference between different genetic backgrounds may come from cells in duplets/short chains compared to long chains. It would be interesting to point out if that's true (cell wall, WTA, and LTA composition may vary with cell-cell association). It should be easy to perform this analysis and correlate chain length and cell length/area/width. This could bring new insights on whether the effect seen in the previous experiments could come majorly from short chains (enriched in late exponential and stationary phases). Also, do short chains grow faster / slower / the same as long chains? Are they more sensitive to antibiotics?</p><p>Figure 5: if authors want to imply cells are smaller due to elongation defects, wouldn't be much easier to simply perform single-cell tracking from time-lapses instead of indirectly staining the cell wall?</p><p>Figure 6: Even though the rLytA-Alexa data is very compeling, I am not convinced GFP-WhyD is recruited to midcell. It could be simply that cells have double the membrane at midcell. Authors could make their point stronger by staining membranes and quantitating membrane:GFP-WhyD ratios to prove there is indeed accumulation of WhyD compared to the cell body.</p><p>Figure 7-Sup1-2-3: Please, make sure to show another panel with the background signal when LytA does not bind cells. It's very surprising that there is no signal at all. Even inespecific signal.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I have no major objection and only some suggestions that could improve the manuscript.</p><p>– Page 6, line 153 : WhyD is assumed to be essential but some deletions can be obtained in WT cells. Does suppressive mutations occurs only in lytA or other genes encoding hydrolases? Whole genome sequencing of some strains would help to strengthen authors hypothesis that WhyD modulates WTA localization and thus localization of hydrolases involved in cell elongation and final separation.</p><p>– To construct the ∆whyD∆lytA, I guess the author deleted whyD in the ∆lytA background? Was transformation efficiency similar to WT cells transformed with a control DNA? If not, it could be worth identifying the additional suppressive mutations to establish a genetic link with other hydrolases or factors promoting cell elongation.</p><p>– To be consistent with their previous binding, does whyD overexpression suppress at least the essentially of tacL (that requires a mutation in cozE)?</p><p>– Regarding the link between lytA and whyD. Did the author try to evaluate the essentiality of whyD in other hydrolases mutant that also bind choline? For instance, the hydrolase CbpD, that is expressed during competence in the early exponential phase, also possesses choline-binding domain. Are the same observations made in a ∆cbpD mutant?</p><p>– Page 8, lines 206-208: WhyD clearly releases WTA from PG sacculi, but a significant amount remains linked. Did the authors try to make longer incubation with more WhyD? it is possible that a fraction is resistant to WhyD hydrolysis? If yes, can the author comment on that? It could be due other modifications of PG (acetylation) or WTA (A-alanylation). It could make sense with the suppressive mutation detected upon deletion of whyD in WT cells (see my two first comments).</p><p>– Page 11 and Figure 6 : From the phase contrast image, it seems that cells chain. Does quantification confirm this visual impression? If yes, it would mean that the lower ectopic expression of GFP-WhyD (compared to whyD expression in WT cells (Fig6-Sup1B)) would also impact the activity of LytB? Does addition of purified recombinant LytB (as described in Rico-Lastress et al., Sci. Rep., 2015) abolish cell chaining? If yes, it would provide a direct link between WhyD and LytB.</p><p>– I would be great to analyze the dynamic of WhyD localization in the course of the cell cycle. Maybe the fluorescence signal is not compatible with time-lapse microscopy but sorting and plotting cells as a function of the different cell division stages may help to address this point and notably if WhyD localizes early or late at the division septum?</p><p>– Page 12, line 309: there is actually no rLytA* signal co-localizing with BADA in elongating cells in the Figure!</p><p>– Figure 7B: White head arrow could be colored in blue to be consistent with the color code of Figure 7A.</p><p>– Page 13, line 322: Figure 7D instead of Fig7C</p><p>– Figure 2-FigSup1 and others: What is the protein detected as the LC?</p><p>– Figure 3: an amino acid sequence alignment would be helpful to appreciate the homology with GlpQ phosphodiesterase domain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76392.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The proposed model appropriately explains the regulation of autolysis in exponentially grown cells.

To address this, we have modified the Title, Abstract, and Discussion to reflect this current gap in our knowledge and to stress the importance of WhyD activity during exponential phase.</p><p>The Title has been modified &quot;WhyD tailors surface polymers to prevent premature bacteriolysis and direct cell elongation in Streptococcus&quot;</p><p>The Abstract was modified to emphasize the importance of WhyD during exponential phase as follows:</p><p>Line 57-58 now reads: In this report, we identify WhyD (SPD_0880) as a new factor that controls the level of WTAs in Sp cells to prevent LytA misactivation during exponential growth and premature lysis.</p><p>Line 60-62 now reads: Our results support a model in which the WTA tailoring activity of WhyD during exponential growth directs PG remodeling activity required for proper cell elongation in addition to preventing autolysis by LytA.</p><p>The relevant changes to the Discussion are:</p><p>Line 343-344 now reads: This pruning of WTAs prevents the excessive recruitment of the LytA PG hydrolase to the cell wall to avoid autolysis during exponential growth.</p><p>We have also added Lines 454-459 to clearly indicate that other mechanisms contribute to autolysis regulation during exponential and stationary phases, which require further investigation. These lines read:</p><p>“This process presumably also requires the release of LTAs from the membrane to prevent them from sequestering LytA away from the WTAs and PG (Flores-Kim et al., 2019). By contrast, WhyD appears to be stable under autolytic conditions (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1). Whether its activity must also be inhibited for autolytic induction and whether other mechanisms involved in controling autolysis exist remains unknown and requires further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors model suggest that the activity of WhyD would reduce the activity of any cell wall hydrolase that also bind choline. In other words, can lethality of whyD mutations be also reverted in genetic mutants other than lytA, for example cbpD? Does whyD deletion lead to second site suppressors that affect other hydrolases?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this interesting point. To test the contribution of other choline-binding hydrolases, we attempted to inactivate whyD in strains lacking one or several choline-binding hydrolases (single mutants: ∆lytB, ∆lytC, ∆cbpD; or the triple mutant lacking all three hydrolases). In all cases, transformations to introduce the ∆whyD mutant into these strains yielded &gt;500-fold fewer transformants compared to transformations into a ∆lytA strain. Thus, additional suppressor mutations are likely needed to introduce the a DwhyD::spec allele into strains lacking choline-binding PG hydrolases other than LytA. We think this result shows that the lethality of WhyD inactivation principally arises through the misactivation of LytA.

As (briefly) stated in the text, cells still undergo autolysis in late stationary phase despite the production of WhyD, indicating that (an)other mechanism(s) exist(s) to control peptidoglycan hydrolysis. It would be good to make sure that the narrative clearly acknowledges this puzzling observation; the title seems a bit misleading and the discussion should clearly indicate this current gap in our knowledge.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point.</p><p>In our previous study we showed that in late stationary phase (or after antibiotic exposure), the LTA synthase is degraded. This has two consequences. (1) TA precursors that were previously used to synthesize LTAs become available for transfer to the PG resulting in an increase in WTA production. (2) Because LytA binds to the choline moieties on LTA and WTA, the reduction in LTAs enables LytA to bind WTA, causing autolysis. The data in this manuscript indicates that WhyD levels remain unchanged in late stationary phase. At present, we do not know whether WhyD activity is regulated and specifically reduced in late stationary phase or whether WhyD continues to remove WTAs but fails to keep pace with an increased level of production. We favor the former model as the latter seems wasteful.</p><p>We have elaborated on these points in the Abstract and Discussion. Please see our response to Essential Revision #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data show that despite the production of WhyD during autolysis, WTAs are detected, suggesting that the enzyme is inactive (or present in insufficient amounts). Looking at the Western Blots in figure 2 —figure supplement 1, it is difficult to know what panel A is showing (no molecular weights are shown). What does the cropped image show? Is this the full length protein? (why are the 2 bands recognized by the anti-WhyD serum in Figure 6B not seen in Figure 2 Supp 1?).</p><p>Several mechanisms could account for the lack of WhyD activity, including a proteolytic cleavage, releasing the catalytic domain away from nascent peptidoglycan or the lack of a co-factor. I certainly agree that WhyD is present throughout growth, but it is possible that the amount of protein decreases in autolytic phase. The authors should be more cautious and/or quantify the relative amount of WhyD throughout growth (using densitometry). &quot;WhyD levels remain constant throughout growth and under autolytic conditions&quot; is a bit assertive given the experimental evidence shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that WhyD activity is likely to be (somehow) reduced during autolytic conditions. The molecular basis for this reduction in activity remains unclear and is an active area of investigation. We now discuss possible mechanisms in the Discussion. We have also added molecular weight markers to the anti-WhyD immunoblots to provide better clarity.</p><p>Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 shows full-length WhyD protein levels throughout growth.

We think that the difference in the non-specific bands between</p><p>Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 and Figure 6 —figure supplement 1 is likely due to the use of different transfer methods. We had problems with variability when blotting for GFP-WhyD using our standard semi-dry transfer technique that we used for detecting untagged WhyD in Figure 2 —figure supplement 1. We therefore used wet transfer for immunoblots to detect GFP-WhyD. We suspect the change in transfer method results in differences in the non-specific proteins detected, perhaps due to differing efficiencies of transfer between methods. We now indicate in the methods when we used each transfer technique to provide clarity for the reader.</p><p>Finally, Figure 2- supplement 1 shows that the steady-state levels of full-length WhyD protein levels remain unchanged during growth and autolysis, strongly suggesting that the protein is not subjected to enhanced proteolysis during autolysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I really like the paper and I think there should not be much work to be done to get it ready for publication.

As it is, it misleads non-experts to think that Penicillin stops cell wall synthesis BY directly activating hydrolases, resulting in lysis. That's not the broad mechanism of Penicillin. The central problem with the sentence might be &quot;misactivating&quot;. I understand that the conclusion of the paper solidifies the idea that, in the absence of proper cell wall synthesis, hydrolase misactivation results in lysis and this is important in the context of some antibiotics. But again, you should be careful not to confuse the general public target of this journal.

It not only requires an increase in WTAs but also a reduction in LTAs that sequester LytA away from the cell wall. The reduction in LTAs is mediated by degradation of the LTA synthase TacL in early stationary phase. Upon its degradation, LTA levels go down due to their shedding into the medium.

It would be interesting to point out if that's true (cell wall, WTA, and LTA composition may vary with cell-cell association). It should be easy to perform this analysis and correlate chain length and cell length/area/width.

When we started this project, we were also interested in investigating whether deletion of other choline-binding hydrolases (in addition to LytA) would suppress the lethality of <italic>whyD</italic> inactivation.
