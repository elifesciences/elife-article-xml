replication. Many of its virulence factors function as ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinases (DUBs). Here, we identify Lem27 as a DUB that displays a preference for diubiquitin formed by K6, K11, or K48. Lem27 is associated with the LCV where it regulates Rab10 ubiquitination in concert with SidC and SdcA, two bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases. Structural analysis of the complex formed by an active fragment of Lem27 and the substrate-based suicide inhibitor ubiquitin-propargylamide (PA) reveals that it harbors a fold resembling those in the OTU1 DUB subfamily with a Cys-His catalytic dyad and that it recognizes ubiquitin via extensive hydrogen bonding at six contact sites. Our results establish Lem27 as a DUB that functions to regulate protein ubiquitination on <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> phagosomes by counteracting the activity of bacterial ubiquitin E3 ligases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Legionella pneumophila</kwd><kwd>type iv secretion</kwd><kwd>bacterial virulence</kwd><kwd>otu deubiquitinase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31570875</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The First Hospital of Jilin University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Shuxin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chinese government program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Thousand Young Talent</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004032</institution-id><institution>Jilin University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Jiazhang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fujian Province(FJHJF-L-2020–2)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marine Economic Development Special Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010651</institution-id><institution>Fujian Normal University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>(Z0210509)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>Songying</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel bacterial deubiquitinase with multiple chain types specificity regulates the association of ubiquitinated proteins on the phagosome of Legionella pneumophila.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Gram negative bacterium <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen ubiquitously found in natural and man-made water systems, often by association with amoebae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fields et al., 2002</xref>). Infection of humans by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> occurs when susceptible individuals inhale contaminated aerosols, which introduce the bacteria to the lungs where alveolar macrophages engulf them by phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Newton et al., 2010</xref>). The bacterial phagosome called the Legionella-containing vacuole (LCV) initiates a trafficking route that bypasses the endocytic maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu and Luo, 2013</xref>). Instead, it appears to intercept vesicles originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is eventually converted into a compartment whose membranes resemble those of the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Swanson and Isberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tilney et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>The conversion of the plasma membranes from nascent phagosomes into the LCV with ER properties largely is mediated by virulence factors delivered into host cells via the Dot/Icm type IV secretion system of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Isberg et al., 2009</xref>). These virulence factors, also called effectors, interfere with such diverse cellular processes as membrane trafficking, autophagy, protein translation and immunity by diverse mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu and Luo, 2017a</xref>). The modulation of these processes is mediated by targeting key regulatory proteins via effector-induced post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haenssler and Isberg, 2011</xref>), methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rolando et al., 2013</xref>), phosphorylcholination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mukherjee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2011</xref>), AMPylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hardiman and Roy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan and Luo, 2011</xref>), and ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu and Luo, 2017b</xref>) or by subverting the metabolism of lipids key in cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Swart and Hilbi, 2020</xref>), including the production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P) on the LCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2012</xref>) and the removal of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate from distinct organelles by phospholipase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gaspar and Machner, 2014</xref>) or PI phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Toulabi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Modulation of the ubiquitin network has emerged as an important theme in interactions between <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> and its hosts. More than 10 Dot/Icm effectors have been found to function as ubiquitin E3 ligases via various mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu and Luo, 2017b</xref>). Some of these proteins possess structural domains such as F-box and U-box found in components of mammalian E3 ligase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ensminger and Isberg, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Habyarimana et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kubori et al., 2010</xref>), whereas others harbor cryptic motifs that catalyze the ubiquitin ligation reaction by unique mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). Most unexpectedly, members of the SidE effector family catalyze phosphoribosyl ubiquitination on serine residues of several small Rab small GTPases and of the ER protein Rtn4 by a NAD-dependent mechanism that bypasses the host E1 and E2 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotewicz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the activity of these unique ubiquitin ligases is regulated by bacterial enzymes that function either to reverse the ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2019</xref>) or to directly block the ubiquitin activation step of the catalysis by calmodulin-dependent glutamylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Black et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gan et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sulpizio et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitination can be reversed by specific deubiquitinases (DUBs), which are a large group of proteases functioning to cleave ubiquitin moieties from modified substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komander and Rape, 2012</xref>). The activity of DUBs restores ubiquitinated proteins back to their original forms thereby reversing the effects caused by ubiquitination. Coordinated activity of E3 ubiquitin ligases and DUBs thus controls the fate of modified substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Popovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu and Luo, 2017b</xref>). According to their structures and mechanisms of action, DUBs are classified into several subfamilies, including ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs), ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), ovarian tumor proteases (OTUs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balakirev et al., 2003</xref>), Machado-Joseph disease protein domain proteases (MJDS), JAMM/MPN domain-associated metallopeptidases(JAMMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ronau et al., 2016</xref>) and the more recently identified MINDY and ZFUSP family of DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul Rehman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hermanns et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition to ubiquitin ligases, pathogens also employ DUBs to hijack host cellular processes for their benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilkinson, 2009</xref>) and a number of DUBs have been found in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kitao et al., 2020</xref>). Among these, members of the SidE effector family harbor DUB activity in a domain that encompasses their first 200 residues, which appears to exhibit preference for K63-linked ubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheedlo et al., 2015</xref>). LotA is a DUB with two distinct catalytic domains, one of which functions to cleave K6-linked polyubiquitins specifically and the other displaying general DUB activity toward polyubiquitins regardless of their structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>). More recently, we have identified Ceg23 as a DUB that exclusively cleaves K63-linked polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). This emerging list of DUBs likely reflect an expansive interplay of <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> with the host ubiquitin system mediated by its extensive suite of ubiquitin ligases; there are likely more DUBs in its effector repertoire for a controlled interference with the host ubiquitin system. Driven by the hypothesis that additional DUBs may contribute to the modulation of the ubiquitin network by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, we performed bioinformatic analyses of Dot/Icm substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) to identify proteins of potential DUB activity. This exercise led to the identification of Lem27 (Lpg2529) which harbors a motif distantly similar to members of the OTU superfamily of DUBs. Our results demonstrate that Lem27 displays a broader activity toward ubiquitin chain types with a distinct preference for K6-, K11- and K48-type polyubiquitin chains. Structural analysis reveals that Lem27 harbors an OTU1 fold and that it recognizes ubiquitin via interactions mediated by at least six contact sites. We also provide evidence to show that Lem27 coordinates with the SidC family E3 ligases to regulate protein ubiquitination on the surface of bacterial phagosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Lem27 as a DUB</title><p>To identify additional effectors that potentially harbor DUB activity, we analyzed Dot/Icm substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhu et al., 2011</xref>) with HHpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Soding et al., 2005</xref>) and found that Lem27 contains a motif remotely resembling active sites associated with the OTU superfamily of DUBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Balakirev et al., 2003</xref>).

In agreement with the DUB activity observed in the cotransfection experiments, purified His<sub>6</sub>-Lem27 but not its inactive mutant His<sub>6</sub>-Lem27<sub>C24A</sub> effectively removed ubiquitin from proteins ubiquitinated by Flag-Ub that were isolated from cells by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

The two DUB modules of Lem27<sub>1-417</sub> molecules in an ASU are almost identical with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.249 Å over Cα atoms of 407 residues (residues 1–417), except that there is an approximate 35<sup>o</sup> rotation of a domain consisting of a bundle of four α-helices (α-bundles) formed by α13-α16 spanning residues 315–417 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

The DUB module with a bilobal architecture assumes the shape of the right hand with one of the lobes giving the appearance of the thumb and forefinger and the other lobe as palm plus the three other fingers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>).

Such an insertion domain, although considerably shorter, is present in Ceg23 (6KS5, residues 123-201aa), a K63-type specific OTU DUB from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> identified in our earlier study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Of note, the insertion domains between Lem27 and Ceg23 lack any similarity in their structures, which may account for their differences in substrate specificity.</p><p>Inspection of the Lem27<sub>1-417</sub>-Ub-PA complex reveals that the DUB domain makes extensive contacts with the distal ubiquitin moiety in the S1 site of Lem27 by multiple pairs of hydrogen bonds with a total buried conserved surface area of approximately 1900 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). A total of six distinct interaction sites can be identified in the interface between Lem27<sub>1-417</sub> and Ub (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). PDBsum analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laskowski et al., 2018</xref>) reveals that the interactions include 30 hydrogen bonds, five salt bridges and 288 Van der Waals forces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Site-1 is the catalytic pocket which recognizes the carboxyl-terminal tail of ubiquitin via several pairs of hydrogen bonds, including those formed between Lem27<sub>E244</sub> and Ub<sub>L71</sub>, Lem27<sub>S116,D148</sub> and Ub<sub>R72</sub>, Lem27<sub>E151,D148</sub> and Ub<sub>R42</sub>, Lem27<sub>E244</sub> and Ub<sub>L73</sub>, Lem27<sub>N302,N299</sub> and Ub<sub>R74</sub>, Lem27<sub>V303</sub> and Ub<sub>G75</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a</xref>). These interactions appear to stabilize the carboxyl tail of ubiquitin in an extended conformation so that the scissile peptide bond is placed next to the catalytic Cys. Site-2 is centered by Lem27<sub>Y149</sub>, which forms multiple hydrogen bonds with side chains of residues in ubiquitin, including Ub<sub>F45</sub> and Ub<sub>K48</sub>. In addition, intramolecular hydrogen bonds are formed between the side chain of Ser115 of Lem27 and those of Phe45 and Ala46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Tyr149 is engaged in stacking interaction with the Ile44 of ubiquitin. The interactions in this patch are equivalent to the widely observed recognition of eukaryotic DUBs of the Ile44-patch of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Reyes-Turcu et al., 2009</xref>). Site-3 features hydrogen bonds between Lem27<sub>D209</sub> and Ub<sub>K48</sub>, and those among Lem27<sub>D209</sub>,<sub>R213,N210</sub> and Ub<sub>N60</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Site-4 includes a pair of hydrogen bonds between Lem27<sub>D110</sub> and Ub<sub>H68</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>).

As expected, simultaneous mutations in two independent sites, Tyr149 and Ser243 led to further loss of the activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). Thus, Lem27 recognizes its substrate by recognizing multiple sites of the ubiquitin moiety and these sites function in concert to ensure proper recognition of its substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Lem27 and the SidC family of E3 ubiquitin ligases function in concert to regulate protein ubiquitination on bacterial phagosomes</title><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> is known to interfere with the function host proteins by effectors of opposite biochemical activity to impose temporal or spatial regulation of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qiu and Luo, 2017a</xref>). Among the many ubiquitin E3 ligases coded for by <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, SidC and SdcA anchor on the LCV by binding to PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weber et al., 2006</xref>). A recent study revealed that the small GTPase Rab10 is important for maximal <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> intracellular replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, Rab10 is ubiquitinated and recruited to the LCV by the SidC family of E3 ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>). Because SidC and its paralog SdcA are known to catalyze the synthesis of several polyubiquitin chains, including K11-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>), which is one of the chain types preferentially cleaved by Lem27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we examined the potential interplay between the SidC family E3 ligases and Lem27 in the regulation of protein ubiquitination on the LCV. In biochemical reactions, SidC appeared to mostly induce monoubiquitination of Rab10 and such modification can be effectively reversed by Lem27; this DUB also removed ubiquitin added to the E3 ligase itself by self-ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>). Consistent with results from the earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>), SidC induced ubiquitination of Rab10 by the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain <italic>∆sidC∆sdcA</italic>(pSidC), which expresses the E3 ligase from a multi-copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> upper panel). Importantly, infection with strain <italic>∆sidC∆sdcA</italic>(pSidC+pLem27), which coexpresses Lem27 led to a clear reduction in ubiquitinated Rab10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> upper panel, lanes 3 and 4). The amounts of SidC translocated into host cells among these samples are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> lower panel), indicating that such reduction is caused by Lem27. Interestingly, when LotA, another DUB from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>) was co-expressed with SidC in strain <italic>∆sidC∆sdcA</italic>(pSidC), reduction in Rab10 ubiquitination did not occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref> lower panel, lane 5). These results suggest that Lem27 but not LotA can counteract the activity of SidC during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. To further analyze the potential interplay between Lem27 and the SidC family E3 ligases during bacterial infection, we established a macrophage cell line that stably expresses mCherry-Rab10. Whereas the Rab1-mCherry signal was comparable in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–e</xref>), we observed that approximately 60% of vacuoles containing wild-type bacteria recruited mCherry-Rab10 and such recruitment did not occur for vacuoles harboring a mutant defective for the Dot/Icm transporter or lacking <italic>sidC</italic> and <italic>sdcA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c–e</xref>), which is in agreement with an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jeng et al., 2019</xref>). Introduction of a plasmid expressing SidC into strain ∆<italic>sidC</italic>∆<italic>sdcA</italic> not only restored the association of mCherry-Rab10 with the LCV but also significantly increased the intensity of the fluorescence signals on bacterial phagosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c,e–f</xref>, strain V). Importantly, although not able to eliminate mCherry-Rab10 from the LCV, coexpression of Lem27 in this bacterial strain significantly reduced the percentage of Rab10-positive vacuoles and the intensity of mCherry signals on LCVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–f</xref>, strain VI). Similar to the results of ubiquitinated Rab10 in infected cells probed by immunoblotting, co-expression of LotA with SidC did not significantly reduce the rate Rab10-positive vacuoles or the intensity of Rab10 signals on the vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e–f</xref>, strain VII). Taken together, these results suggest that deubiquitination of Rab10 by Lem27 decreased its association with the LCV and that this DUB specifically regulates the activity of SidC and SdcA during <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Lem27 regulates Rab10 ubiquitination and its recruitment to the LCV induced by the SidC family of E3 ubiquitin ligases.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SidC-induced Flag-Rab10 ubiquitination was reversed by Lem27.

Although the primary sequence of Lem27 does not share homology with established DUBs detectable by algorithms such as BLAST, analysis by predicted protein structures provided the hints for biochemical experiments that provided evidence for DUB activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Lem27 represents a new category of DUB found in <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>, it appears to selectively cleave ubiquitin chains linked by K6, K33 and K48, which differs from DUBs in members of the SidE family that prefer K48 and K63-type polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheedlo et al., 2015</xref>), and Ceg23, which specifically cleaves K63-type polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, to some extent, its substrate preference overlaps with LotA, another DUB from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> that cleaves K6-linked polyubiquitin chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>). Both LotA and Lem27 are associated with the LCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), suggesting that multiple DUBs may coordinate to edit protein ubiquitination on the bacterial phagosome. Alternatively, DUBs with similar substrate preference may function at distinct compartments of infected cells. In addition to LotA, results reported herein underscore the importance of K6-linked polyubiquitin chains in cellular defense against <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> infection. The fact that both LotA and Lem27 are localized on the LCV suggests that K6-linked ubiquitination on the LCV is detrimental to the biogenesis and development of the vacuole.</p><p>Although Lem27 and Ceg23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) both belong to the OTU family of DUBs originally found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wilkinson, 2009</xref>), these proteins share little similarity in their structures except for the configuration of the catalytic center involved in isopeptide bond cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such differences may account for their distinct preference in polyubiquitin chains. Interestingly, the structure of Lem27 exhibits higher similarity to OTUB1 (PDB: 4DDG) of humans than to any other bacterial DUBs of the same family, including those from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic>. Given that both Lem27 and LotA, which is also an OTU family DUB, display selectivity for K6-linked ubiquitin chains, these DUBs may share some structural homology in regions involved in substrate recognition. One feature unique to Lem27 is its extensive contact with ubiquitin in the Lem27<sub>1-417</sub>-Ub-PA complex, which is not seen in other DUBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reyes-Turcu and Wilkinson, 2009</xref>). Although such information is useful in determining how this DUB contacts the ubiquitin moiety of the Ub-PA inhibitor, elucidation of its substrate recognition mechanism and basis of selectivity will require structural study of the complexes formed by Lem27 and one or more diubiquitin as described in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mevissen et al., 2013</xref>). Our structure reveals that both Lem27<sub>1-417</sub> and Ceg23 contain an insertion domain not found in OTU DUBs from mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such domains may be involved in substrate recognition, akin to the recently described transglutaminase MvcA that catalyzes deubiquitination of the E2 conjugation enzyme UBE2N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2020</xref>), and polyubiquitin linkage specificity by contributing to binding of additional ubiquitin groups aside from the S1 binding site observed here.</p><p><italic>L. pneumophila</italic> codes for a large cohort of ubiquitin ligases that utilize distinct mechanisms to modify proteins by cooperating with host E1 and E2 enzymes, including U-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lomma et al., 2010</xref>), F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ensminger and Isberg, 2010</xref>) and several that use novel mechanisms not found in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2018</xref>). It also codes for enzymes that catalyze ubiquitination via noncanonical mechanisms, including the E1-, E2-indepdent, NAD-powered reactions induced by members of the SidE family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhogaraju et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Qiu et al., 2016</xref>) and a cross-link reaction mediated by transglutamination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gan et al., 2019a</xref>). Ubiquitination catalyzed by both of these mechanisms is reversed by specific enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Our observation that Lem27 and members of the SidC family regulate Rab10 ubiquitination indicates that the net outcome of protein modification by the classic mechanism is a result of the interplay between ligases and DUBs. In broth grown bacteria, the expression pattern of Lem27 and SidC is similar, both are induced at the post-exponential phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luo and Isberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that the dynamic ubiquitination of Rab10 on the LCV occurs from the beginning of the infection. Because DUBs exhibit low substrate selectivity in biochemical reactions using purified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheedlo et al., 2015</xref>), a DUB likely participates in the reversal of ubiquitination installed by multiple classic E3 ligases. Yet, it is of interest to note that although LotA share some preferred substrate preference with Lem27, it does not seem to interfere with Rab10 ubiquitination induced by SidC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), suggesting that these DUBs possess considerable substrate specificity under physiological conditions. Indeed, the reversal of ubiquitination induced by noncanonical mechanisms, which in all known cases, is catalyzed by specific enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2019</xref>). Of note, the genes coding for Lem27(<italic>lpg2529</italic>) and the SidC family (<italic>sidC, lpg2511; sdcA, lpg2510</italic>) are relatively close on the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> chromosome, separated by only 18 open reading frames, which is similar to the physical proximity of genes coding for enzyme pairs that function together to temporally or spatially regulate the function of host proteins by counteracting biochemical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tan and Luo, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The identification of additional DUBs from <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> clearly has added to our understanding of the role ubiquitination plays in its virulence and the co-option of host function. Deletion of a single DUB gene caused detectable defects in intracellular growth in laboratory infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheedlo et al., 2015</xref>), further study aiming to identify DUBs with similar substrate specificity may shed light on the potential functional redundancy of these effectors.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.

We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper describes an analysis of Lem27, a distant related OTU-like DUB encoded by legionella. The authors demonstrate that Lem27 cleaves multiple ubiquitin chain linkage types but prefers K6, K11, and K48. They also solve the structure of Lem27-Ub, revealing both a distantly related OTU fold as well as unique features. The identify residues important for Ub binding and show that some of these affect cleavage rates. Lem27 was found to associate with the Legionelle vacuole in cells and to remove ubiquitin from this structure. The further linked this to Rab10 ubiquitylation, which is linked with SidC activity in cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt that 2 aspects of the paper need to be addressed in detail.</p><p>First, In the experiment in Figure 4C, an HA-tagged single lys ubiquitin mutant was expressed in cells and the enriched materials from HA-IP was treated with recombinant Lem27. The authors claimed that Lem27 prefers to cleave K6, K11, and K48 chains based on the disappearance of poly-ub signal. However, there is a major caveat in the design of the experiment and the interpretation of the results. Ub mutants carrying a single lys do not necessarily form one type of Ub linkage with their remaining single lys residue; instead these Ub mutants can be present in any type of ub chains since they can be attached to endogenously wild-type Ub as a donor ub. Thus the interpretation of the results from Figure 4C is not valid. This may also explain why Lem27 cleaves ubiquitin chains from samples prepared from Ub<sub>K27</sub> (subsection “Lem27 preferentially cleaves diubiquitin linked by K6, K11 or K48”).</p><p>Also, SidC has been previously shown to catalyze both K11, K33, and K63 ub chains and to a less extend K48 chains. In Figure 7A (left panel), the ubiquitinated flag-Rab10-ub is likely just mono-ubiquitination, this experiment does not justify that Lem27 prefers cleave K11 linkage. The way it is written in the text, (subsection “Lem27 and the SidC family of E3 ubiquitin ligases function in concert to regulate protein ubiquitination on bacterial phagosomes”) sounds like SidC/SdcA only catalyze K11 chain and Lem27 specifically cleave K11 chain.</p><p>So both of these aspects need to be addressed in the text. We also suggest that Figure 4C be moved to the supplement.</p><p>Second, there are a number of issues with the functional assays in cells, which will need to be address through new experiments.</p><p>i) The localisation of Lem27 is shown at only one timepoint (Figure 3). What happens to the localisation of Lem27 over a time course of infection, say up to 18 h? This could indicate that Lem27 has other roles/targets in the cell.</p><p>ii) Is Lem27 also associated with the LCV in amoebae and is the mutant attenuated in amoebae?</p><p>iii) You state that &quot;similar results were obtained in three independent experiments&quot;. All these independent experiments should be combined and statistical analysis done on the pooled data, not on a single experiment encompassing 100 vacuoles. Importantly, vacuole counting of samples must be performed in a blinded manner.</p><p>iv) Figure 7B should also show counting of vacuoles that are positive for Rab10 for each strain (again done in a blinded manner).</p><p>v) It is understood that SidC/Rab10 was used as a proof in principle that Lem27 can reverse K11 ubiquitination. Still it would be good to know how often Lem27 localisation overlaps with SidC and Rab10 (and to compare localisation of native Lem27 and the catalytic mutant). Again, this points to the possibility of other targets if Lem27 is not always/often associated with SidC/Rab10.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58114.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers felt that 2 aspects of the paper need to be addressed in detail.</p><p>First, In the experiment in Figure 4C, an HA-tagged single lys ubiquitin mutant was expressed in cells and the enriched materials from HA-IP was treated with recombinant Lem27.

This may also explain why Lem27 cleaves ubiquitin chains from samples prepared from Ub<sub>K27</sub> (subsection “Lem27 preferentially cleaves diubiquitin linked by K6, K11 or K48”).</p></disp-quote><p>We’d like to thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. We agree that the polyubiquitin chains produced in cells overexpressing the Ub mutants are not necessarily uniformly linked via the single K remaining in the mutants due to the presence of endogenous ubiquitin. We have followed the suggestion to remove Figure 4C from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, SidC has been previously shown to catalyze both K11, K33, and K63 ub chains and to a less extend K48 chains. In Figure 7A (left panel), the ubiquitinated flag-Rab10-ub is likely just mono-ubiquitination, this experiment does not justify that Lem27 prefers cleave K11 linkage. The way it is written in the text, (subsection “Lem27 and the SidC family of E3 ubiquitin ligases function in concert to regulate protein ubiquitination on bacterial phagosomes”) sounds like SidC/SdcA only catalyze K11 chain and Lem27 specifically cleave K11 chain.</p><p>So both of these aspects need to be addressed in the text. We also suggest that Figure 4C be moved to the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with this criticism and have revised the text accordingly. Please see the subsection “Lem27 preferentially cleaves diubiquitin linked by K6, K11 or K48”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, there are a number of issues with the functional assays in cells, which will need to be address through new experiments.</p><p>i) The localisation of Lem27 is shown at only one timepoint (Figure 3). What happens to the localisation of Lem27 over a time course of infection, say up to 18 h? This could indicate that Lem27 has other roles/targets in the cell.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the importance of knowing the cellular localization of an effector at different phases of infection. Please note that here the association of Lem27 with the LCV was determined by using a Flag-specific antibody to stain 4xFlag-Lem27 expressed from a plasmid. Because the association with the LCV by a given effector is controlled by its abundancy, time of expression during infection and other factors, which are affected by factors such as protein stability and expression in response to specific cues, meaningful data on the kinetics of LCV association should be determined with antibodies specific for the effectors itself (i.e. determination of the kinetics of the association of Lem27 with the LCV by ectopically protein may not reflect the kinetics of endogenous protein).</p><p>Unfortunately, the polyclonal antibodies against Lem27 we prepared are not suitable for immunostaining. The antibodies nonspecifically recognize unknown proteins in fixed cells, leading to high background and making the signals for Lem27 undiscernible.</p><p>We have attempted to circumvent the problem by introducing 1xFlag-<italic>lem27</italic> into the <italic>lem27</italic> locus on the <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> chromosome by a knock-in procedure using strain Lp02∆<italic>lem27</italic> as the recipient. Although the knock-in experiment worked and we successfully obtained a <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain (we called it Lp02(cFlag-Lem27)) that expresses 1xFlag-Lem27 from its cognate promoter on the chromosome, the protein can be detected by the Lem-27-specific antibodies but not the Flag antibody. As a result, we were unable to detect the association of 1xFlag-Lem27 with the LCV by immunostaining using the Flag antibody in infections using strain Lp02(cFlag-Lem27).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Flag-tagged Lem27 expressed from a knockin <italic>L. pneumophila</italic> strain can be detected by Lem27 antibodies but not by Flag antibody.</title><p>A construct harboring Flag-<italic>lem27</italic> on a suicide plasmid was used to introduce tagged <italic>lem27</italic> into the ∆<italic>lem27</italic> strain make the knockin strain in which Flag-Lem27 will be expressed from its cognate promoter.

The kinetics of LCV association and the potential existence of additional cellular targets of Lem27 will be addressed at least in part by the development of better antibodies and effective methods in the identification of DUB substrates, which is a focus of ongoing study in our laboratory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Is Lem27 also associated with the LCV in amoebae and is the mutant attenuated in amoebae?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed infections with the amoebae host <italic>Dictyostelium discoideum</italic> with the bacterial strains used in BMDMs. Our results indicate that Lem27 is associated with the LCV in a way similar to what we observed in experiments using mammalian cells. We have included these results in Figure 3—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We have also examined the ∆<italic>lem27</italic> mutant for intracellular replication in <italic>D. discoideum</italic> and found that this mutant did not display detectable defects in this host (Figure 3—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) You state that &quot;similar results were obtained in three independent experiments&quot;. All these independent experiments should be combined and statistical analysis done on the pooled data, not on a single experiment encompassing 100 vacuoles. Importantly, vacuole counting of samples must be performed in a blinded manner.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed with this suggestion and have revised the results by using data from three independent experiments. Also, these experiments were performed in blind (the bacterial strains used were coded by lab member and the experiments (infection, staining and counting) were performed by another member without knowing the identity of these strains used for the experiments). When applicable, the revised figure now reflects pooled data from three independent experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) Figure 7B should also show counting of vacuoles that are positive for Rab10 for each strain (again done in a blinded manner).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the results of Rab10-positive vacuoles for each strains done in blind (Figure 7E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) It is understood that SidC/Rab10 was used as a proof in principle that Lem27 can reverse K11 ubiquitination. Still it would be good to know how often Lem27 localisation overlaps with SidC and Rab10 (and to compare localisation of native Lem27 and the catalytic mutant). Again, this points to the possibility of other targets if Lem27 is not always/often associated with SidC/Rab10.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is nice to have this piece of information. Yet, limited by the number of fluorescence colors that can be used in the same samples for immunostaining, we were unable to distinctly label SidC, Lem27 and Rab10 in the same infected cells.</p><p>Instead, we have stained the vacuoles for Rab10 and SidC and for Lem27 and SidC, respectively. Our results show that at 2 h post infection, about 70% of the vacuoles are positive for both SidC and Rab10, and approximately 34% of the vacuoles are positive for both SidC and Lem27. These results do not argue against the notion that Lem27 targets other proteins in infected cells, a module we actually support. Yet, we are restrained from over interpreting these staining data because Lem27 was expressed from a multi-copy plasmid. The existence of other ubiquitinated proteins as targets of Lem27 is a topic of our investigation, which we wish to present in future publications in conjunction with other Legionella DUBs that share substrate preference with Lem27 in in vitro biochemical assays.</p></body></sub-article></article>
