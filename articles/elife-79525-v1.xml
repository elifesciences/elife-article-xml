Here, we describe a genetic screen in yeast that enables systematic characterization of how protein abundance regulation is encoded in the genome. The screen combines a CRISPR/Cas9 base editor to introduce point mutations with fluorescent tagging of endogenous proteins to facilitate a flow-cytometric readout. We first benchmarked base editor performance in yeast with individual gRNAs as well as in positive and negative selection screens. We then examined the effects of 16,452 genetic perturbations on the abundance of eleven proteins representing a variety of cellular functions. We uncovered hundreds of regulatory relationships, including a novel link between the GAPDH isoenzymes Tdh1/2/3 and the Ras/PKA pathway. Many of the identified regulators are specific to one of the eleven proteins, but we also found genes that, upon perturbation, affected the abundance of most of the tested proteins. While the more specific regulators usually act transcriptionally, broad regulators often have roles in protein translation. Overall, our novel screening approach provides unprecedented insights into the components, scale and connectedness of the protein regulatory network.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein regulation</kwd><kwd>CRISPR screen</kwd><kwd>base editor</kwd><kwd>gene regulatory network</kwd><kwd>GAPDH isoenzymes</kwd><kwd>ras/PKA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004412</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000737/2016-L</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>Olga T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P2EZP3_165280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schubert</surname><given-names>Olga T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102308</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruglyak</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruglyak</surname><given-names>Leonid</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A CRISPR/Cas9 base editor screen allows probing interactions between large numbers of known mutations and the abundance of specific proteins to study the protein regulatory network in yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>CRISPR-based genetic screens using Cas9 or modified versions thereof, such as the CRISPR base editor or CRISPRi, provide an unprecedented opportunity to study the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on gene expression in a pooled format (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cuella-Martin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Datlinger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Després et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dixit et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gasperini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jaitin et al., 2016</xref>). The identity of genetic perturbations with phenotypic effects can be directly determined by sequencing guide RNAs, thereby eliminating the need for genome sequencing to identify causal mutations. To date, such studies have focused on the effects of genetic perturbations on mRNA expression, while the effects on protein expression remain unexplored.</p><p>Proteins are gene products that play many key roles in cells, serving as essential structural components, enzymes, and constituents of signaling networks, from receptors to transcription factors. Their abundance is extensively regulated both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally. For practical reasons, mRNA abundance is often studied as a proxy for protein abundance, but the correspondence between the two is less strong than is usually implicitly assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buccitelli and Selbach, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). Therefore, it is important to study regulation of protein abundance directly.</p><p>Here, we developed a novel CRISPR base editor screen to study how tens of thousands of individual mutations affect the abundance of selected proteins in yeast. Using this approach, we tested the effects of 16,452 coding mutations on the abundance of eleven yeast proteins selected to represent a variety of molecular and cellular functions. We identified hundreds of novel regulatory relationships, including both specific and broad regulators of protein abundance. The results demonstrate that base editor screens can be used to gain general insights into how protein abundance is encoded in the genome and altered by changes in DNA sequence.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Base editing in yeast is efficient and predictable</title><p>To introduce genetic perturbations across the yeast genome in a targeted fashion, we used the CRISPR base editor version 3 (BE3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Komor et al., 2016</xref>). This system consists of an engineered fusion of Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase that does not introduce DNA double-strand breaks but instead converts cytosine to uracil, thereby effecting a C-to-T substitution at a target site defined by the guide RNA (gRNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Komor et al., 2016</xref>). To adapt the base editor for use in yeast, we created a plasmid which contains the base editor under a galactose-inducible promoter, as well as a plasmid optimized for cloning of both gRNAs individually and gRNA libraries in bulk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These plasmids were transformed into yeast cultures, and base editor expression was induced with galactose. First, we assessed base-editing efficiency and the target window in yeast by amplicon-sequencing the genomic target loci of eight individual gRNAs after base editor expression was induced for 44 hr. We found that the target window and mutagenesis pattern are very similar to those described in human cells: 95% of edits are C-to-T transitions, and 89% of these occurred in a five-nucleotide window 13–17 base pairs upstream of the PAM sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Komor et al., 2016</xref>).

Loss-of-function mutations in <italic>CAN1</italic> render yeast resistant to the toxic arginine analog canavanine. We exposed base-edited yeast cultures to canavanine for 24 and 48 hr and observed a strong enrichment of reads from gRNAs predicted to introduce premature stop codons (p&lt;2.2e-16, χ<sup>2</sup>=1737, df=1, chi-squared test), as well as a depletion of reads from gRNAs predicted to introduce synonymous mutations in <italic>CAN1</italic> (p&lt;2.2e-16, χ<sup>2</sup>=1637, df=1, chi-squared test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). Eleven of the 65 gRNAs predicted to introduce missense mutations resulted in an enrichment similar to that of the stop codons.

We evaluated the effects of these gRNAs on yeast survival over 48 hr. As expected, cells transformed with control gRNAs remained in the culture at stable levels, whereas cells transformed with gRNAs introducing stop codons into essential genes tended to drop out over time (59% displayed log<sub>2</sub> fold change &lt;–0.5 and false-discovery rate (FDR) for depletion &lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). Despite the observed heterogeneity of editing outcomes across individual gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), in these pooled positive and negative selection screens we see clear signals for gRNAs predicted to introduce stop codons into the <italic>CAN1</italic> gene and into essential genes (effect for 67% and 59% of gRNAs, respectively).</p><p>We next asked whether DNA sequence context in the targeted region could explain which gRNAs introduced stop codons with high efficiency. To address this, we built a lasso regression model with over 8000 sequence features per gRNA and found that it could explain 37% of the observed variance in gRNA depletion in the screen of essential genes (Pearson’s R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, p&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In particular, the base preceding the target C has a strong effect—a T or another C produces much higher editing rates than a G. These findings in yeast are in line with recent reports in human cell lines and can help guide the design of future gRNA libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arbab et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Song et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we developed a set of experimental resources for pooled base editor screens in yeast, including a plasmid system suitable for large-scale gRNA library cloning. We also demonstrated that these resources can be used to carry out base editor screens that are able to identify functionally important mutations in yeast using both positive selection (canavanine resistance screen) and negative selection (fitness screen).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A base editor screen to identify genetic effects on protein abundances</title><p>We next set out to develop a genome-wide base editor screen that would allow us to study genetic loci that affect the abundance of selected proteins. To this end, we compiled a library of 16,452 gRNAs predicted to introduce three classes of mutations: stop codons in nonessential genes, as well as missense mutations at highly conserved positions in essential genes and in nonessential genes (Methods and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We expect most genetic perturbations introduced by these gRNAs to have deleterious effects on the target genes. We introduced this gRNA library and the galactose-inducible base editor into yeast strains in which one protein of interest is chromosomally tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Howson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). The GFP fluorescence level in these strains reports the abundance of the tagged protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Newman et al., 2006</xref>). We selected eleven strains with GFP-tagged proteins that cover a range of cellular functions. The target proteins include the Hsp70 chaperone Ssa1, which is involved in protein folding, nuclear transport and ubiquitin-dependent degradation of short-lived proteins and is a marker for heat shock; as well as the flavohemoglobin Yhb1, which is involved in oxidative and nitrosative stress responses and is a marker for oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Soste et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we included the ribonucleotide reductase subunit Rnr2, which is involved in dNTP synthesis, the ribosomal protein Rpl9A, the histone Htb2, and several proteins involved in metabolism, including the fatty acid synthases Fas1 and Fas2, the enolase Eno2, which acts in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and the three glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) isoenzymes Tdh1, Tdh2, and Tdh3. Tdh3 is among the most highly expressed proteins in yeast and the main GAPDH enzyme, whereas the exact functional roles and regulation of Tdh1 and Tdh2 are less well understood.</p><p>After performing base editing in each of the eleven GFP strains, we isolated cells with very high and very low GFP intensity by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We next sequenced gRNA plasmids extracted from the sorted cells; the gRNAs enriched or depleted in these populations correspond to genetic perturbations that increase or decrease abundance of the protein of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We identified 1020 gRNAs with a significant effect on the abundance of at least one of the eleven proteins (FDR&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Effects of gRNAs in replicate experiments showed significant correlation (Pearson’s R<sup>2</sup>=0.37, p&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To further assess the reproducibility of the screen, we included gRNA pairs that were predicted to introduce the same mutation into the genome. For 78 of these gRNA pairs, at least one gRNA had a significant effect (FDR&lt;0.05) on at least one of the eleven proteins; their effects were well correlated (Pearson’s R<sup>2</sup>=0.43, p&lt;2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

These findings show that the significant gRNA effects that we identify have a low false positive rate, but they also suggest that many real gRNA effects are not detected in the screen due to limitations in statistical power. The effects of genetic perturbations on protein abundances correlate well with the effects on mRNA abundances measured in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kemmeren et al., 2014</xref>) when considering only effects that are significant in both studies (Pearson’s R<sup>2</sup>=0.62, p&lt;5.3e-15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>A CRISPR base editor screen for protein abundance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview of the screen.

Of these gene-protein relationships, an average of 53 (34%) are specific (defined here as gene perturbations that affect only one or two of the eleven target proteins) whereas 103 (66%) are nonspecific (the gene perturbation affects three or more of the eleven proteins). Furthermore, we found that, on average, protein abundance decreases more frequently than it increases in response to the gene perturbations tested (106 vs 50, p=8.6e-6, binomial test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). However, this trend is strongly dependent on the functional role of the protein. Abundance of proteins involved in core cellular functions mostly decreases, whereas abundance of stress-related proteins is just as likely to increase as it is to decrease (p=2.9e-12 and p=0.8, respectively, binomial test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>); this trend is independent of the absolute abundance of a protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>The predominance of decreases in protein abundance in response to gene perturbations is driven by perturbations in essential genes, which on average decrease protein abundance in 80% of cases, whereas perturbations in nonessential genes do so in only 49% of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

For example, the abundance of the stress-responsive flavohemoglobin/oxidoreductase Yhb1 is reduced by perturbation of one of its prime transcriptional activators, heme activator protein Hap1, as well as perturbations of a heme transporter and six genes involved in heme biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cassanova et al., 2005</xref>). This is in accordance with Yhb1 being a heme protein itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu and Riggs, 1992</xref>). A novel regulator of Yhb1 identified in our screen is the three-subunit Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5 (SPS) amino acid sensor. We find that perturbation of each of the three subunits, as well as of one of its two downstream effectors, the transcription factor Stp1, results in reduced Yhb1 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We independently confirmed the new regulatory relationship between Yhb1 and SPS by liquid-chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) proteomics analysis of one of the SPS mutants identified in our screen, <italic>SSY5</italic> G638Q (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). Furthermore, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of differentially expressed proteins in this mutant revealed that SPS perturbation leads not only to reduced Yhb1 abundance but also to reduced abundance of other mitochondrial proteins, including components of the mitochondrial ribosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and ATP metabolism (FDR=4.5e-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, amino acid metabolic processes are broadly induced in the mutant (FDR=6.6e-9, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that SPS signaling not just activates expression of amino acid transporters but also represses amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Forsberg et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, the presence of extracellular amino acids has been found to induce Yhb1 expression in the distantly related yeast <italic>Candida albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Danhof et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Williams and Lorenz, 2020</xref>). Our observations extend this link between amino acids and increased nitrosative and oxidative stress resistance to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and suggest that it is mediated by the SPS amino acid sensor. We propose that SPS senses the presence of external amino acids and activates the transcription factor Stp1, which in turn induces Yhb1 expression, resulting in increased nitrosative and oxidative stress resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the relatively specific regulators described above, we identified two key complexes that modulate the transcriptional machinery, mediator and SAGA, as regulators of protein abundance. We find particularly large effects on three proteins (Htb2, Tdh1, and Tdh2) upon perturbation of two subunits of the Cdk8 kinase module of mediator, Ssn3 and Srb8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Moreover, we see large effects on the same proteins for perturbations of the two subunits forming the hook structure on mediator, Nut2 and Rox3, which supports recent reports that this domain is critical for the interaction between the core mediator complex and the Cdk8 kinase module (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). The observation that perturbations of the Cdk8 module increase protein abundance is in accordance with the suggested repressor role of this transiently associating regulatory module of mediator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elmlund et al., 2006</xref>). We also find that classical post-transcriptional regulators contribute strongly to protein abundance. For example, Ssa1 and Yhb1 are significantly induced upon perturbation of a number of genes involved in proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Gene perturbations with broad effects on protein abundance often affect protein biosynthetic processes</title><p>About half of the 710 gene perturbations with significant effects on protein abundance affect at least two proteins, and some of these alter the abundance of a large fraction of the eleven proteins studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

In contrast, perturbations that affect the abundance of only one or two of the eleven proteins mostly occur in genes with roles in transcription (e.g., GO:0006351, FDR&lt;1.3e-5). Protein biosynthesis entails both transcription and translation, and these results suggest that perturbations of translational machinery alter protein abundance broadly, while perturbations of transcriptional machinery can tune the abundance of individual proteins.

Consistent with this finding, these perturbations were also more likely to be in essential genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Because essential genes are often involved in maintaining general cellular physiology, their perturbation is expected to have more widespread effects on protein abundance than perturbation of nonessential genes that may function in niche processes. This is also in line with earlier observations that essential genes are more interconnected in protein-protein interaction networks (network hubs), and that there is a negative correlation between the connectivity of a gene product and the change in cellular growth rate upon gene deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Batada et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jeong et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our results suggest that most genetic perturbations with very broad effects on protein abundances are involved in protein biosynthetic functions, as exemplified by <italic>POP1</italic>. However, we also see that perturbation of genes such as <italic>SIT4</italic> and <italic>SAP155</italic> can lead to widespread proteomic changes, in this case via cell physiological adaptations involving carbon metabolism and aerobic respiration. Irrespective of the precise mechanisms, genetic perturbations with broad effects typically involve essential genes and almost always reduce cellular fitness.</p><p>Several of the gene perturbations that affect multiple proteins overlap previously identified hotspots of gene expression and protein quantitative trait loci (eQTLs and pQTLs) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014</xref>).

GAPDH is a highly conserved enzyme best known for its central role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, but it has also been implicated in many non-metabolic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kosova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ringel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">White and Garcin, 2017</xref>).

However, despite the key role of GAPDH in metabolism and other cellular processes, the specific functional roles and regulatory mechanisms of the three isoenzymes are still largely unknown.</p><p>Our base editor screen revealed that abundance of Tdh1, Tdh2 and Tdh3 responds similarly to the perturbation of many genes, including those involved in central carbon metabolism and biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids (Aro1/2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). However, some gene perturbations have distinct effects on the three isoenzymes. For example, perturbation of genes encoding two members of the Mediator Cdk8 module, Ssn3 and Srb8, affect abundance of Tdh1 and Tdh2 but not Tdh3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>). Ssn3 and Srb8 have been implicated in carbon catabolite repression, a mechanism to repress genes involved in the use of alternate carbon sources when a preferred carbon source such as glucose is available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kayikci and Nielsen, 2015</xref>). Because Tdh3 is thought to be the main enzyme responsible for glycolytic flux under high-glucose conditions, it is plausible that the alternative enzymes Tdh1 and Tdh2 are under carbon catabolite repression and play a role when glucose is unavailable. This hypothesis is consistent with strong induction of Tdh1 in the absence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Casanovas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Regulators of the three GAPDH isoenzymes Tdh1, Thd2, and Tdh3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pairwise comparison of effects of gene perturbations on Tdh1, Tdh2, and Tdh3 protein abundances.

The most striking differences occur in response to perturbation of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway, a key driver of cell growth and proliferation in response to glucose availability and an integrator of stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conrad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dechant and Peter, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Perturbations of activating components of this pathway (Gpr1, Ras2, Cyr1, Cdc25) increase abundance of Tdh1 but decrease abundance of Tdh2 (and, to a lesser extent, Tdh3). Perturbation of the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthetase Erg20 had the same effects. Erg20 is an essential enzyme involved in protein farnesylation. It has been shown that Ras2 farnesylation is critical for PKA activation, suggesting that the signal we see for Erg20 is also the result of a perturbed Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharya et al., 1995</xref>). Conversely, perturbations of inhibiting components of this pathway (Ira1/2, Bcy1, Mck1) decrease abundance of Tdh1 while increasing abundance of Tdh2 and Tdh3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We used LC-MS proteomics to confirm these findings in strains carrying engineered loss-of-function mutations in an inhibitor (<italic>IRA2</italic>) and an activator (<italic>RAS2</italic>) of the pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>).

We observed that these gRNAs had discordant effects on protein abundance. Ras2 Q272* increased abundance of Tdh1 and decreased abundance of Tdh2, while Ras2 S46L had the opposite effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). The effect of the Ras2 S46L mutation on Tdh1 and Tdh2 was similar to that of a loss-of-function mutation of Ira2, a direct antagonist of Ras2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Our observation that the S46L mutation activates Ras2 is consistent with the results of saturation mutagenesis of the highly conserved human K-Ras gene, which showed increased activity upon mutation of the homologous serine residue (S39 in human K-Ras) to leucine or valine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bandaru et al., 2017</xref>). Human Ras genes are important oncogenes, with activating point mutations found in as many as 20% of all human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Downward, 2003</xref>). Mutations of this specific serine residue have been found in cervical cancers (COSMIC database, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tate et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, base editor screens in yeast can recover both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in genes that are relevant to human diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Systems genetics is concerned with how genetic information is integrated, coordinated, and ultimately transmitted through molecular, cellular, and physiological networks to enable the higher order functions of biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nadeau and Dudley, 2011</xref>). Proteins are the key molecular players functionally linking genotype and phenotype of a cell. Therefore, systematically studying regulators of protein abundance is crucial to reaching a more complete, system-level understanding of molecular cell physiology. We developed a high-resolution CRISPR/Cas9 base editor screen and used it to investigate how the abundance of a variety of selected yeast proteins is affected by each of tens of thousands of genetic perturbations. Thereby, we gained insights into the extensive regulatory network underlying a cell’s proteome, in which the abundance of any given protein is affected by a large number of genetic loci. We found that among the eleven proteins studied here, those involved in core cellular functions respond differently to genetic perturbations than those involved in stress responses. Furthermore, proteins were generally more likely to be affected by perturbations of essential genes than of nonessential genes. Genes affecting the abundance of many of the eleven proteins simultaneously (i.e., hubs of the protein regulatory network) were often involved in post-transcriptional protein biosynthetic processes. In contrast, perturbations that affected only specific proteins were enriched in transcriptional regulation. In addition, we discovered numerous new regulatory relationships, including a new link between the Ras/PKA pathway and the GAPDH isoenzymes that suggests functional diversification of these homologs which enables cells to adapt to different metabolic states.</p><p>Earlier large-scale studies on the effects of genetic perturbations on gene expression mostly focused on mRNA levels as a readout. For example, a study by Kemmeren and colleagues examined the effects of 1484 gene deletions on the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kemmeren et al., 2014</xref>). The effects of gene perturbations on mRNA levels in that study and on protein levels in our study agree well when only effects that reach statistical significance in both studies are considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Gene perturbations with detected effects on mRNA but not protein levels are enriched in genes with a role in “chromatin organization” (FDR=0.01), suggesting that perturbations of such genes tend to affect mRNA levels, but are then buffered and do not lead to altered protein levels. It is difficult to draw further conclusions from the comparison between these two studies because the genes perturbed in the Kemmeren et al. study were selected to play a role in gene regulation. Furthermore, while there is a low false positive rate in our study, the false negative rate is likely to be high due to limited statistical power and because gRNA target residues are not always edited efficiently, and edits may not have strong effects on gene function. Statistical power in protein abundance screens can be boosted by increasing the number of cells sorted for each GFP bin, as well as by increasing sequencing depth. Studies that assess effects of gene perturbations on both mRNA and protein levels simultaneously are also becoming increasingly feasible thanks to recent developments in single-cell CRISPR-based screening and decreasing sequencing costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Przybyla and Gilbert, 2022</xref>).</p><p>This and previous studies show that CRISPR base editing outcomes are often heterogeneous and incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In genetic screens that use the CRISPR base editor, the heterogeneity of the mutant population generated by each gRNA should be kept in mind when interpreting the data. We would argue, however, that in many cases, base editing is sufficiently specific and localized to obtain insights into the effects of mutations in the targeted genomic area. For example, in our test screens for canavanine resistance and fitness, in which we used gRNAs predicted to introduce stop codons into the CAN1 gene and into essential genes, respectively, we observed the expected loss-of-function effects for a majority of gRNAs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the canavanine screen, we also observed that gRNAs predicted to introduce missense mutations at highly conserved residues were more likely to lead to a loss of function than gRNAs predicted to introduce missense mutations at less conserved residues, further highlighting that informative results that can be obtained with the base editor despite the heterogeneity in editing outcomes. However, it is imperative to confirm key findings with independently generated mutations, as we did in this study.</p><p>Another consideration with CRISPR base editor screens is the potential for off-target editing. Completely random off-target activity of the base editor is of little concern because it is not expected to generate statistically significant signals. Reproducible off-target editing by a gRNA at a site other than the intended target site would, however, be problematic. Such off-target editing can be minimized by excluding gRNAs that have similar target sequences elsewhere in the genome. In this study, we excluded gRNAs for which more than one target site in the genome matched the twelve nucleotides in the seed region (directly upstream of the PAM site) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DiCarlo et al., 2013</xref>). We observe that most off-target editing occurs just outside the target window, and it is seen at much lower frequency than on-target editing in the target window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The possibility of off-target effects is another reason to validate key findings with independently generated mutations. New base editors with improved accuracy and efficiency have the potential to improve future genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anzalone et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The CRISPR base editor, by binding its target sequences within or upstream of genes or transcripts, could interfere with transcription and translation and thereby elicit effects that are independent of the desired base edits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Qi et al., 2013</xref>). To reduce confounding signals due to such unintended interference, we placed the gene encoding the base editor under a galactose-inducible promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DiCarlo et al., 2013</xref>). After base editing in the presence of galactose, we grew the edited cultures for multiple generations in the absence of galactose. By the time the cultures are sampled for phenotyping, base editor levels are expected to be sufficiently reduced to no longer interfere with gene expression. This expectation is supported by our ability to detect opposing effects of gRNAs introducing different types of mutations into the same gene (e.g., the two mutations leading to loss-of-function and gain-of-function of RAS2); such observations would not be possible in the presence of strong gene-wide transcriptional or translational interference effects.</p><p>Future studies will be able to build on the experimental framework described here to further refine and complete our understanding of the genetic factors influencing protein abundance. Potential extensions include screening for abundance of additional proteins, examining the effects of genetic perturbations on other molecular (e.g., mRNA abundances, as discussed above) and physiological phenotypes, increasing the number of gRNAs and using alternative base editors to achieve denser sampling of mutations across coding and non-coding regions, introducing multiple gRNAs per cell to investigate interactions between genetic perturbations, and performing screens in different genetic backgrounds or under different growth or stress conditions. A dense genome-wide sampling of mutations, together with quantitative molecular and cellular phenotypic readouts across different environmental conditions and genetic backgrounds, will provide the data needed to build holistic models that bring us closer to predicting the functional consequences of altering any base pair in the genome through natural sequence variation or engineered perturbation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kinney and McCandlish, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Material availability</title><p>Important plasmids generated in this study are deposited in Addgene (Base editor plasmid (pGal-BE3): #172409; gRNA plasmid with 2 kb placeholder (pgRNA-backbone): #172517).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Resource availability</title><p>The DNA sequencing read data is deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under BioProject ID PRJNA732764 and the mass spectrometry proteomics data is deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium partner repository PRIDE with the dataset identifier PXD029363 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Perez-Riverol et al., 2018</xref>).

A second round of PCR (6 cycles) to extend the Nextera adapters was performed using the KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA/Roche KK2602) again, together with unique dual indexes (IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD Indexes, Integrated DNA Technologies). Concentrations of PCR products were determined using Qubit reagents (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific Q32851) but in 96-well format with fluorometric readings at 485/20 nm excitation and 528/20 nm emission performed on a BioTek Synergy2 plate reader using black opaque flat-bottom 96-well plates (Costar #3915). We then combined roughly equal amounts of DNA from samples of cells sorted for high or low GFP levels and double that amount for the control samples that were sorted without GFP gates. The pooled sample was run on a 2% agarose gel and gel-extracted (Zymo research D4007). The amplicon library was quantified by Qubit (dsDNA HS Assay Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific Q32851). To increase diversity, PhiX Sequencing Control v3 (Illumina #FC-110–3001) was added and the final library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 using an S1 flow cell with paired-end 100-base pair reads.</p><p>Due to underrepresentation of some of the sorted Tdh3-GFP sub-libraries in the final library mentioned above, we pooled these samples separately again, and gel-purified and quantified them as described above, followed by addition of PhiX Sequencing Control v3 (Illumina #FC-110–3001) and sequencing on an Illumina NextSeq 500 in HighOutput mode with paired-end 80- and 70-base pair reads. Read counts were then downsampled using Seqtk (version 1.3, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018927">SCR_018927</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/lh3/seqtk">https://github.com/lh3/seqtk</ext-link>) to get comparable read numbers to the other GFP strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Fitness screen analysis</title><p>Fitness screen analyses were performed with custom R scripts run in RStudio (R version 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3). For the fitness screen data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> (ES gRNA set only, two replicates), we first extracted guide sequences from sequencing reads and tallied the read counts per guide. To determine which gRNAs change in abundance during prolonged culturing of base edited yeast, we used read counts per gRNA as a quantitative measure. We normalized the read counts across samples so that the total read counts of the control gRNAs remain constant. We then calculated for each gRNA the log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log2FC) of the number of reads at each time point versus to the “pre” time point sampled before induction of the base editor with galactose. The reported log2FC values are averages across the two replicate experiments. To obtain gene-level effects, we used the largest absolute log2FC among all gRNAs targeting the same gene. The fitness screen data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref> (EP, NP, and NS gRNA sets, four replicates) was processed as described above but with normalization for total read counts across samples because not all four replicates included the control gRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Protein abundance screen analysis</title><p>Protein abundance screen analyses were performed with custom R scripts run in RStudio (R version 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3). First, for each sample, the 20-nucleotide guide and the 20-nucleotide barcode sequences were extracted from paired-end read pairs. Next, for all barcodes paired with guides perfectly matching the library, we performed error correction to account for potential sequencing errors that would otherwise lead to inflated barcode counts. For this, read counts of barcodes with a difference of less than five nucleotides were assigned the same barcode sequence. We then removed barcodes that did not have at least two reads and gRNAs that did not have at least two barcodes in at least four of the control samples per GFP strain. We also excluded replicates with very low read counts (Eno2_A, Fas1_A, Fas1_F, Fas2_A, Fas2_D, Htb2_A). To determine which gRNAs are differentially abundant among cells with high vs low GFP levels, we used the number of unique barcodes per gRNA as a quantitative measure which we normalized across samples by total unique barcode count per sample. We then applied a generalized linear model (glm) with Poisson-distributed errors and log as a link function. The glm function outputs for each gRNA the ln(‘high GFP’/ ‘low GFP’) and a p-value. We converted the ln fold change to log<sub>2</sub> fold change (log2FC). In cases where for a gRNA no barcodes were detected in any of the high or low GFP replicates, the glm function assigns an estimate of 20 or –20, respectively, which we replaced by 3 or –3, respectively. To adjust p-values for multiple testing and control the false discovery rate (FDR), we used the qvalue R package version 2.22.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Storey, 2002</xref>). Unless otherwise noted, we consider ‘significant’ a q-value (FDR) &lt;0.05.</p><p>To obtain gene-level log2FC values, we used the largest absolute fold change estimate of all gRNAs targeting a gene. For gene-level q-values, we first combined the p-values of all gRNAs targeting the same gene using Fisher’s method (R package poolr, version 0.8–2) and then corrected these gene-level p-values for multiple testing again with the qvalue R package. We compared this combined q-value to the q-value of the gRNA with the largest absolute fold change per gene and then took the lower of the two q-values as a final per-gene q-value. This approach raises the number of genes with significant effect (FDR &lt;0.05) on protein abundance from 622 to 710, compared to considering just genes targeted by significant gRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cytoscape network representations</title><p>For network visualizations we used Cytoscape (version 3.8.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shannon et al., 2003</xref>). For the network representing the overall results from the screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), the eleven proteins were defined as source nodes and the significant gene perturbations as target nodes. A diverging red-blue color gradient was chosen to reflect the log fold changes caused by the perturbation. Note that for perturbations that affect multiple proteins, the selected color depends on the order the interactions are listed in the input. The size of the target nodes correlates with the number of source nodes (proteins) it connects to.

The settings for STRING were as follows: the species was set to <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and the confidence cutoff was set to 0.4. All view defaults were unselected. The type of chart to draw was set to pie chart, with two terms to chart and an overlap cutoff of 0.5.

For the GO enrichment analysis among broad and specific regulators, the background was defined as all genes represented by our gRNA library (NS, ES, EP subsets). For the GO enrichment analysis among sets of significantly changed proteins in the proteomics data, the background was defined as the union of proteins quantified across all samples used for the enrichment analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Validation experiments (<italic>RAS2</italic>, <italic>IRA2</italic>, <italic>SSY5</italic>, <italic>POP1</italic>, <italic>SIT4</italic>)</title><p>For validation of the findings from the protein screen, we generated individual mutants based on the BY4741 strain.

These plasmids were then individually transformed into the BY4741 yeast strain previously transformed with pGal-BE3 (described in the section ‘Base editor characterization with individual gRNAs’) using the same high-efficiency lithium acetate-based protocol with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gietz and Schiestl, 2007a</xref>). From the successful transformants growing on selective plates (SC -Leu -Ura) we then inoculated an overnight preculture in selective glucose media (SC -Leu -Ura) followed by a 24 hr growth period in selective galactose media (SC/Gal -Leu -Ura) to induce base editor expression. Subsequently, cells were grown in non-selective liquid YPD media for 8 hr to promote plasmid loss, followed by growth on YPD plates for up to 5 days. Note that colonies on some plates grew very slowly because several of the targeted base edits affect cell fitness. From each plate, we analyzed 4–8 individual colonies to see whether they acquired the expected base edits. First, a small amount of each colony was transferred into a 96-well PCR plate containing 50 µl ultra-pure H<sub>2</sub>O (Invitrogen/Thermo Fisher Scientific #10977015). Of the resulting cell solution, 25 µl was transferred into a 96-deep-well plate containing 500 µl YPD. The remaining 25 µl were boiled at 99 °C for 5 min to lyse the cells. Then 2 µl of the heat-treated cells were used to set up 50 µl PCR reactions with TaKaRa Ex Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa #RR001A) and specific primer pairs designed to amplify the genomic region targeted by each gRNA. The following thermal cycling protocol was used: 1 min at 94 °C, 35 x (30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 1 min at 72 °C), 3 min at 72 °C. PCR products were sent for Sanger sequencing. Three independent mutant strains harboring the expected base edits were then selected and the corresponding cultures in YPD that were kept at room temperature were converted into cryo stocks and stored at –80 °C until use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>LC-MS proteomics data acquisition</title><p>For proteomics analyses, three independent mutant strains per mutation of interest (see above) were streaked out on YPD plates and incubated at 30 °C for several days. Overnight cultures were then inoculated from a single colony of each mutant strain in SC media. The next day, 3 ml cultures were set up at 2.5e6 cells/ml (OD<sub>600</sub>=0.05) and grown for several hours until they reached a density of 2.5e7 cells/ml (OD<sub>600</sub>=0.5). Of each culture, 2 ml were harvested by centrifugation for 1 min at 5000 g at 4 °C. Supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –80 °C. For cell lysis, 200 µl freshly prepared lysis buffer (8 M urea, 75 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8) was added to each cell pellet. The resulting solution was transferred to 2 ml screw-cap tubes containing a 100 µl volume of glass beads (500 µm, Sigma G8772). Cells were lysed by 3x5 min bead beating at 2400 rpm (40 Hz) on a BioSpec Mini-BeadBeater-96, with 1–2 min cooling on ice between cycles. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at full speed (at room temperature to avoid precipitation of urea) and cleared lysates transferred to new tubes. Protein concentrations were determined with a colorimetric bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay (Pierce / Thermo Scientific #23225). Absorbance at 562 nm was measured on a BioTek Synergy2 plate reader which indicated protein concentrations of 1–2 mg/ml.</p><p>For each sample, 25–50 µg of protein was further processed as follows. Protein disulfide bonds were reduced by the addition of 5 mM Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and incubation at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the free cysteine residues were alkylated by the addition of 10 mM iodoacetamide and incubation at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. Subsequently, samples were diluted with 100 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 to reach a urea concentration of less than 2 M. For the protein digest, 0.2 µg LysC (Wako #125–05061) and 0.8 µg trypsin (Pierce / Thermo Scientific, #90057) were added and samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The digest was quenched by adding formic acid to a final concentration of 5% (v/v). Finally, samples were desalted using C18 tips (Pierce / Thermo Scientific #87784), dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 5% formic acid (v/v).</p><p>For liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analysis, desalted peptides were fractionated online by nano-flow reversed phase liquid chromatography using a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column consisted of a 25 cm fused silica capillary with 75 μm inner diameter that was packed in-house (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jami-Alahmadi et al., 2021</xref>) with ReproSil-Pur C18 particles (particle size 1.9 μm; pore size 120 Å; Dr. Maisch). The linear 140 min water–acetonitrile gradient from 5% to 35% acetonitrile was delivered at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) run in Data-Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode and with an inclusion list containing a total of six peptides from Tdh1 and Tdh2 to ensure their consistent quantification (IDVAVDSTGVFK(2+), LISWYDNEYGYSAR(2+), VVDLIEYVAK(2+), HIIVDGHK(2+), DPANLPWASLNIDIAIDSTGVFK(2+), GVLGYTEDAVVSSDFLGDSNSSIFDAAAGIQLSPK(3+)). MS1 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 120,000 (FWHM at 400 m/z) over a range of 400–1600 m/z with a maximum injection time of 100ms. MS1 acquisition was followed by the acquisition of MS2 spectra from precursors falling into the inclusion list windows (monoisotopic m/z+/-25 ppm). Precursors were isolated with a window of 1.6 m/z and fragmentation was obtained by higher-energy C-trap dissociation (HCD) at a fixed collision energy of 35%. MS2 spectra were acquired at a resolution of 30,000, a maximum injection time of 54ms and dynamic exclusion for 5 s. The remainder of the 3 s cycle time was used to acquire MS2 spectra for other precursors at a resolution of 15,000 and an exclusion window of 25 s but otherwise identical parameters as for the inclusion list precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>LC-MS proteomics data analysis</title><p>Peptide identification and quantification was performed with MaxQuant version 1.6.17.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>).

Only fully LysC- and trypsin-digested peptides with up to one missed cleavage were allowed. LysC was specified to cleave after lysine even if followed by proline and trypsin was specified to cleave after lysine and arginine if not followed by proline. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was defined as a fixed modification and methionine oxidation and N-terminal acetylation as a variable modification. Peptide-spectrum-match (PSM) and protein-level false discovery rates (FDRs) were set to 0.01. Further analyses were performed with custom R scripts run in RStudio (R version 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3).

We considered the 20-nucleotide gRNA targeting sequence flanked on either side by an additional five nucleotides for a total of 30 nucleotides per gRNA. For each of the 5928 gRNAs, we then extracted all possible position-specific sequence features up to 4 nucleotides in length, resulting in a total of over 8000 sequence features across all gRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rahman and Rahman, 2017</xref>). The gRNAs were split into a training set of 4928 gRNAs and a test set of 1000 gRNAs. An ordinary and a logistic lasso regression model was then obtained from the training set. For the logistic lasso model, we defined gRNAs with a log<sub>2</sub> fold change &lt;–0.5 as dropping out. Evaluated on the test set, the lasso-predicted and observed effects show a Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R<sup>2</sup>) of 0.37 and 0.35 for the ordinary and the logistic model, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Comparison to eQTL and pQTL hotspots in natural yeast isolates</title><p>To date, the most comprehensive picture of genetic architecture underlying gene expression regulation in yeast has been achieved by linkage mapping in crosses of divergent yeast strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>). A remarkable finding is that a majority of genetic loci affecting mRNA and protein expression (eQTLs and pQTLs, respectively) cluster in regulatory hotspots. However, these regulatory hotspots can be large genomic regions encompassing up to dozens of genes each, making it challenging to pinpoint the causal gene and, hence, to understand their mechanism of action. We set out to use the results from the base editor screens to identify candidate causal genes that could underlie the observed eQTL and pQTL hotspots in segregants of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains BY S288C and RM11-1a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albert et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albert et al., 2014</xref>). Among the genes located in the eQTL and pQTL hotspot intervals, we identified those that affect at least three of the eleven proteins studied here. The resulting list of gene candidates was narrowed down to those that contain at least one variant between BY and RM with a predicted medium or strong effect (i.e., missense mutation, indel, or premature stop codon). We were able to identify for 24 eQTL and pQTL hotspots a total of 47 candidate causal genes, each affecting three or more of the eleven proteins and harboring at least one parental variant with a predicted medium to strong effect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>).

probing interactions between a large set of specific mutations and the abundance of specific proteins, and, more generally, investigate the spectrum of effects that (point) mutations can have on protein abundance. This novel technique complements existing strategies for measuring effects of genetic perturbations on transcript levels, which is important as for some genes mRNA and protein levels may not correlate well. The ability to measure proteins directly therefore promises to help close a gap in our understanding of the links between genotype and phenotype, and the strategy is broadly applicable beyond the current study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79525.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02bpp8r91</institution-id><institution>VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology</institution></institution-wrap><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02bpp8r91</institution-id><institution>VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology</institution></institution-wrap><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Vonesch</surname><given-names>Sibylle</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02bpp8r91</institution-id><institution>VIB-KU Leuven Center for Microbiology</institution></institution-wrap><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.09.483657">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.09.483657v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Kevin J Verstrepen as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naama Barkai as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sibylle Vonesch (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We really like the study and believe that it merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, with two main areas that can help improve it even further.</p><p>Firstly, data and explanation on the setup and control experiments (as suggested in detail by reviewers 2 and 3) should be added.</p><p>Second, and related, it would benefit the reader to choose one clear strategy to present the study (i.e., a methods paper or a paper that describes a few specific novel regulatory interactions). It seems clear to us that you intend it more as a &quot;methods&quot; paper, and we agree that this is the best way to present the results. However, in its current form, the paper still floats somewhat in between. A few textual changes (in abstract, methods and conclusions) may be sufficient to improve the flow; eg by very clearly putting the parts that really concern the development and validation of the method first in every section, and better separating these from the results that come out of the validation experiments.</p><p>We realize that the second suggestion may imply that the biological results become a bit hidden, but perhaps these can then take center stage in a follow-up study that addresses some of these biological questions (eg general vs specific regulators of protein abundance, specific novel regulatory interactions for specific proteins or processes) more exhaustively?</p><p>We include the individual reports from the three reviewers to this message to provide more details and also share the other suggestions that you might want to take into account.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Is it fair to call the effects of random mutations on the abundance of (some) proteins &quot;regulatory&quot;? To me, the concept of regulation is perhaps a bit more narrow and precise, involving a mechanism that helps organisms adapt to specific signals. In that view, the fact that a random point mutation influences the abundance of a random protein falls short of being a regulatory relationship; I see this as an &quot;interaction&quot; or &quot;relationship&quot; (as it is also often referred to in the body of the text). For example, when you perturb a heme transporter, Yhb1 might respond to compensate, but I do not think it is fair to call that a regulatory relationship without showing that the mutated proteins play a role in sensing and/or signaling. This is different for perturbations in Hap1, as that is really a (transcriptional) regulator, or for the mutations in Ssy1-Ptr3-Ssy5, which are also involved in regulation.</p><p>One of the interesting observations is that some reporter proteins, like Rpl9, are affected by a much broader set of mutations compared to others, like Tdh1. It could be interesting to speculate why that is. An obvious hypothesis would be that genes that are &quot;hubs&quot; and that interact with many other genes are influenced by a larger number of mutations. One way to check this would be to correlate the results with previous results from genome-wide interaction studies, such as the ones carried out by Charlie Boone's team, and/or by mapping the reporters on existing interaction networks and somehow quantifying the size of their immediate/neighboring network…</p><p>Results: Perhaps better to report R2 rather than R values for correlations between the screen's result and the confirmation with single gRNAs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The introduction is geared towards the point that mRNA levels are not always predictive for protein levels and therefore looking at proteins directly is relevant. But this aspect is not really much discussed further either in the introduction or in the results/discussion. For me this would be an interesting point, how much or what do we gain in knowledge by directly measuring protein that we did not know/that was different when looking at transcript levels. The introduction is in general a bit short and could be extended. It would be nice to compare results with those obtained for transcriptomes measured in KO strains (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2014.02.054), see also comment in public review.</p><p>I would have liked to see more of a comparison between the effects of the missense mutations compared to the stop codons as this really emphasizes the advantage of using a base editor (vs just screening a KO library).</p><p>Mediator/Cdk8 and protein abundance: The effect seems to be limited to Htb2 and Tdh1/2, so this should be formulated accordingly. Any speculation why it would be confined to these and not others? Does it have to do with how strongly proteins are regulated at the transcriptional vs translational level? (for example, is there a correlation with how well mRNA levels explain protein level for these proteins?)</p><p>Figure 3D: Are there any explanations for the discrepancy of Tdh1 levels measured with the reporters and MS?</p><p>It could be interesting to look at the similarity of deletions based on perturbation profiles of the eleven proteins. Are there common signatures apart from ribosome biogenesis/tRNA metabolism and transcription? For example, similar effects for complexes or pathways?

Could this point at a more global role of SDS or could it be a general consequence of cells perceiving amino acid limited conditions? Stp1 is a direct regulator of Yhb1, but has a lower effect on Yhb1 levels than the SPS complex. Is it possible that SDS also interacts directly or via another input to Yhb1?</p><p>Editing in Figure S1 (characterization of BE3 in yeast) was quite long (44h) vs shorter (24h) in the fitness and protein screen.

It could be worth including an additional figure as the new figure 1 that summarizes the validation experiments for the CRISPR base editor. This new technology alone seems like an important achievement, and I think many readers will be interested in applying the system to their own research. So, the results of these validation experiments could be of broad interest.</p><p>2. I had some trouble in the section of the paper that talks about regulation at the translational vs. transcriptional levels. Specifically, at first, I did not understand why the authors felt the following result was remarkable: &quot;Remarkably, 21 (72%) of these 29 genes have roles in protein translation-more specifically, in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA metabolism (FDR &lt; 8.0e-4, Figure 3C).&quot; I also did not understand why this was being contrasted with transcription in the subsequent sentence: &quot;In contrast, perturbations that affect the abundance of only one or two of the eleven proteins mostly occur in genes with roles in transcription (e.g., GO:0006351, 98 genes, 47 expected, FDR &lt; 1.3e-5).&quot; Upon re-reading the introduction, I remembered that the authors claim their study is one of the few that look at protein levels rather than transcript levels. So, I understood why they made the comparison. My first suggestion is that the authors should remind readers of the relevance of this comparison. But as soon as I thought I understood, I again became confused. Isn't it obvious that the genes affecting protein levels will be the genes involved in translation rather than transcription? So, I'm still confused about why this result is remarkable, rather than just expected. This problem is deeper than the use of the word, &quot;remarkable&quot; because much of the intro and discussion focus on this different in translation vs. transcription. Perhaps the authors should elaborate on why they expected more proteins involved in transcription to influence protein abundance.</p><p>3. Relatedly, this point in the discussion seems super cool: &quot;Genes affecting the abundance of many proteins simultaneously (i.e., hubs of the protein regulatory network) were often involved in post-transcriptional protein biosynthetic processes. In contrast, perturbations that affected only specific proteins were enriched in transcriptional regulation.&quot; When I first read this, I was not sure where this was covered in the paper. In fact, its discussed in the two sentences I just quoted in major comment 2. Clearly, those sentences were lost on me! Maybe consider adding more here, perhaps a figure? Or more statistical analysis? The authors describe the overrepresentation of transcriptional genes that affect 1 or 2 of the 11 targets. Is there a corresponding underrepresentation of translational genes?</p><p>4. Another thing I wondered about this comparison between studies of protein abundance vs. transcript abundance is how does the power of these types of studies compare. Here the authors focus on 11 target proteins. Is that similar to transcript studies, or do those studies have power to focus on more targets? Why have studies of protein abundance previously been limited? It seems like this base editor could be used for either type of study, so I'm not sure how it helps specifically with protein abundance studies.</p><p>5. I also wondered if the conclusions about the connectedness of the protein regulatory network differ from those about the connectedness of transcriptional networks. Is one more connected than the other?</p><p>6. I found figure 3E to be jam packed, and I also use pooled competitions to study relative fitness of many yeast strains, so if I was confused I imagine others will be totally lost. It might be good to add an additional panel showing some examples of an oligo that declines in frequency vs, one that does not? This helps with my second issue as well, which is, how do you know things in the last bin (8+ targets) didn't just start at lower frequency, so more likely to be lost due to stochastic process? I see the number of things in each bin drops off with the number of targets affected, so the 6, 7, and 8+ bins have the fewest things in them. Maybe this makes them more sensitive to stochastic effects? It would be nice to see that some of the things in the 8+ bin start out at the same frequency as some of the things in the 1 or 2 bin, and yet are still lost. You could do this in the same panel that gives the reader a better understanding of how fitness is measured. Or maybe my concern could be alleviated in a simple sentence that explains the range of starting frequencies in the 6, 7, and 8+ bin was equivalent to those in other bins. I leave this up to the authors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79525.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We really like the study and believe that it merits publication in eLife, with two main areas that can help improve it even further.</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate the positive reception of our work and the constructive comments for improvement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Firstly, data and explanation on the setup and control experiments (as suggested in detail by reviewers 2 and 3) should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We expanded the first part of the manuscript with information that was previously in the supplementary materials and added additional information as requested by the reviewers (see specific responses below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, and related, it would benefit the reader to choose one clear strategy to present the study (i.e., a methods paper or a paper that describes a few specific novel regulatory interactions).

We have compared our protein-level data to mRNA-level data from Kemmeren and colleagues (Kemmeren et al., Cell 2014), and we find very good agreement between the effects of gene perturbations on mRNA and protein levels when considering only genes with q &lt; 0.05 and Log2FC &gt; 0.5 in both studies (Pearson’s R = 0.79, p &lt; 5.3e-15).</p><p>Gene perturbations with effects detected only on mRNA but not protein levels are enriched in genes with a role in “chromatin organization” (FDR = 0.01; as a background for the analysis, only the 1098 genes covered in both studies were considered). This suggests that perturbations of genes involved in chromatin organization tend to affect mRNA levels but are then buffered and do not lead to altered protein levels. There was no enrichment of functional annotations among gene perturbations with effects on protein levels but not mRNA levels. We did not initially include these results in the manuscript because there are some limitations to the conclusions that can be drawn from these comparisons, including that our study has a relatively high number of false negatives, and that the genes perturbed in the Kemmeren et al. study were selected to play a role in gene regulation, meaning that differences in mRNA-vs-protein effects of perturbations are limited to this function, and other gene functions cannot be assessed. We now included the figure in the manuscript (Figure 3-figure supplement 2) and discuss the limitations in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would have liked to see more of a comparison between the effects of the missense mutations compared to the stop codons as this really emphasizes the advantage of using a base editor (vs just screening a KO library).</p></disp-quote><p>Our main gRNA library that was used for the fitness and protein screens contained—besides gRNAs introducing stop codons—only gRNAs targeting highly conserved amino acid residues (absolute PROVEAN score &gt; 5). The targeted missense mutations are therefore skewed towards loss-of-function phenotypes similar to the stop codons. Hence, the data from the fitness and protein screens are not well suited for such an analysis. However, for the CAN1 screen we used a gRNA library that targeted all possible missense mutations and is therefore unbiased. We added the figure below to the manuscript that shows that some missense mutations have effects as strong as the premature stop codons while others have smaller effects or no effect at all (Figure 2A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mediator/Cdk8 and protein abundance: The effect seems to be limited to Htb2 and Tdh1/2, so this should be formulated accordingly.

As mentioned in the section on the GAPDH isoenzymes, the regulatory module Cdk8 is involved in carbon catabolite repression, and Tdh1/2 are likely regulated by this system, while most of the other proteins are not. In the mRNA dataset by Kemmeren and colleagues, this regulatory pattern in response to perturbations of subunits of the Cdk8 module is not evident.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3D: Are there any explanations for the discrepancy of Tdh1 levels measured with the reporters and MS?</p></disp-quote><p>The proteomics/MS samples for the POP1 mutant were collected at slightly higher OD than the sampling for the cell sorting/GFP.

The suggested hypotheses would need to be tested in follow-up experiments beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Editing in Figure S1 (characterization of BE3 in yeast) was quite long (44h) vs shorter (24h) in the fitness and protein screen. Do the authors have any information on how that would have impacted editing efficiency and purity?</p></disp-quote><p>Experiments with individual gRNAs targeting genomically inserted GFP show that a majority of cells contains the desired edit within 24 hours of base editing, and we think the first experiment where the base editor was induced for 44 hours is therefore likely to have resulted in similar results to the 24 hours used afterwards for the screens. The purity is likely to be higher, but we do not have the data to show this. We added this information in a supplementary figure and the following sentence in the main text: “To assess base editing efficiency over time, we designed two gRNAs predicted to lead to loss-of-function mutations in GFP. We expressed the base editor and these gRNAs in yeast cells with a genomically integrated GFP gene. Depending on the gRNA, cells lost the GFP signal at different rates; however, for both gRNAs, a majority of cells had lost the GFP signal after 24 hours (Figure 1–figure supplement 3).” We also added a paragraph in the Methods section to describe this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table S7: Which proteins were the eQTLs and pQTLs originally mapped for?

The eQTLs were mapped for thousands of genes, including all our eleven proteins. We added a sentence in the legend of Supplementary File 5 (formerly Table S7) that contains this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S6: Would this plot not make more sense split by stop codon and missense?

It could be worth including an additional figure as the new figure 1 that summarizes the validation experiments for the CRISPR base editor. This new technology alone seems like an important achievement, and I think many readers will be interested in applying the system to their own research. So, the results of these validation experiments could be of broad interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We extended the first part of the manuscript and added new figures (some from the supplementary materials, others are new).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. I had some trouble in the section of the paper that talks about regulation at the translational vs. transcriptional levels. Specifically, at first, I did not understand why the authors felt the following result was remarkable: &quot;Remarkably, 21 (72%) of these 29 genes have roles in protein translation-more specifically, in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA metabolism (FDR &lt; 8.0e-4, Figure 3C).&quot; I also did not understand why this was being contrasted with transcription in the subsequent sentence: &quot;In contrast, perturbations that affect the abundance of only one or two of the eleven proteins mostly occur in genes with roles in transcription (e.g., GO:0006351, 98 genes, 47 expected, FDR &lt; 1.3e-5).&quot; Upon re-reading the introduction, I remembered that the authors claim their study is one of the few that look at protein levels rather than transcript levels. So, I understood why they made the comparison. My first suggestion is that the authors should remind readers of the relevance of this comparison. But as soon as I thought I understood, I again became confused. Isn't it obvious that the genes affecting protein levels will be the genes involved in translation rather than transcription? So, I'm still confused about why this result is remarkable, rather than just expected. This problem is deeper than the use of the word, &quot;remarkable&quot; because much of the intro and discussion focus on this different in translation vs. transcription. Perhaps the authors should elaborate on why they expected more proteins involved in transcription to influence protein abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that this paragraph requires more explanation. We expanded it as follows: “Of these 29 genes, 21 (72%) have roles in protein translation—more specifically, in ribosome biogenesis and tRNA metabolism (FDR &lt; 8.0e-4, Figure 5C). In contrast, perturbations that affect the abundance of only one or two of the eleven proteins mostly occur in genes with roles in transcription (e.g., GO:0006351, FDR &lt; 1.3e-5). Protein biosynthesis entails both transcription and translation, and these results suggest that perturbations of translational machinery alter protein abundance broadly, while perturbations of transcriptional machinery can tune the abundance of individual proteins. Thus, genes with post-transcriptional functions are more likely to appear as hubs in protein regulatory networks, whereas genes with transcriptional functions are likely to show fewer connections.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Relatedly, this point in the discussion seems super cool: &quot;Genes affecting the abundance of many proteins simultaneously (i.e., hubs of the protein regulatory network) were often involved in post-transcriptional protein biosynthetic processes. In contrast, perturbations that affected only specific proteins were enriched in transcriptional regulation.&quot; When I first read this, I was not sure where this was covered in the paper. In fact, its discussed in the two sentences I just quoted in major comment 2. Clearly, those sentences were lost on me! Maybe consider adding more here, perhaps a figure? Or more statistical analysis? The authors describe the overrepresentation of transcriptional genes that affect 1 or 2 of the 11 targets. Is there a corresponding underrepresentation of translational genes?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to Comment #2 above. We did check for underrepresentation of the respective functional classes as suggested by the reviewer but did not find any indication for this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Another thing I wondered about this comparison between studies of protein abundance vs. transcript abundance is how does the power of these types of studies compare. Here the authors focus on 11 target proteins. Is that similar to transcript studies, or do those studies have power to focus on more targets? Why have studies of protein abundance previously been limited? It seems like this base editor could be used for either type of study, so I'm not sure how it helps specifically with protein abundance studies.</p></disp-quote><p>With the protein screen described here, we can study only one selected protein at a time, but we can simultaneously test the effects of thousands of genetic perturbations on this protein. This is the opposite of what was done before in studies of genetic effects on mRNA and protein levels that start with a gene knockout and measure the responses of thousands of mRNAs or proteins (for proteins, e.g., Stefely et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2016; for mRNAs, e.g., Kemmeren et al., Cell, 2014). Since our protein screen requires a fluorescent label for the quantification of the protein (and the sorting of the cells), it cannot be easily applied to quantify mRNAs. However, with latest technology developments in single-cell CRISPR-based screening, it is an exciting prospect to do base editor screens and read out the effect of each perturbation on the entire transcriptome by single-cell RNA-sequencing (see, e.g., Przybyla and Gilbert, Nature Reviews Genetics, 2022).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. I also wondered if the conclusions about the connectedness of the protein regulatory network differ from those about the connectedness of transcriptional networks. Is one more connected than the other?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this would be interesting to compare but we unfortunately don’t have the appropriate data to directly compare this. Reviewer 1 suggested comparing the connectedness of the protein network to the genetic interaction network by the Boone lab (see Reviewer #1’s Comment #2). Our most connected protein (Rpl9A) is indeed also a hub in the genetic interaction network and our least connected protein (Tdh1) is also least connected in the genetic interaction network. A proper analysis of such trends would require large numbers of proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. I found figure 3E to be jam packed, and I also use pooled competitions to study relative fitness of many yeast strains, so if I was confused I imagine others will be totally lost. It might be good to add an additional panel showing some examples of an oligo that declines in frequency vs, one that does not?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out that Figure 3E (now 5D/E) was hard to grasp. To address this, we split the figure into two separate subfigures and made the axis labels more explicit. Figure 5E now shows for each gRNA just its fitness effect (vertical axis) and the number of proteins it affects (horizontal axis). Note that the box plot overlay just summarizes the underlying data points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This helps with my second issue as well, which is, how do you know things in the last bin (8+ targets) didn't just start at lower frequency, so more likely to be lost due to stochastic process? I see the number of things in each bin drops off with the number of targets affected, so the 6, 7, and 8+ bins have the fewest things in them. Maybe this makes them more sensitive to stochastic effects? It would be nice to see that some of the things in the 8+ bin start out at the same frequency as some of the things in the 1 or 2 bin, and yet are still lost. You could do this in the same panel that gives the reader a better understanding of how fitness is measured. Or maybe my concern could be alleviated in a simple sentence that explains the range of starting frequencies in the 6, 7, and 8+ bin was equivalent to those in other bins. I leave this up to the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>, the initial frequencies (read counts) for the gRNAs across all bins are similar. The figure shows the number of reads per gRNA across all bins at the reference time point, i.e., before base editor induction. We added a sentence to the manuscript as suggested: “Note that at the reference time point of the fitness experiment, there was no bias in read counts across the gRNAs affecting different numbers of proteins.”</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79525-sa2-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
