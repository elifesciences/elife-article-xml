characterized by selective vulnerability of distinct cell populations; however, the cause for this specificity remains elusive. Here, we show that entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) neurons are unusually vulnerable to prolonged neuronal inactivity compared with neighboring regions of the temporal lobe, and that reelin + stellate cells connecting EC with the hippocampus are preferentially susceptible within the EC2 population. We demonstrate that neuronal death after silencing can be elicited through multiple independent means of activity inhibition, and that preventing synaptic release, either alone or in combination with electrical shunting, is sufficient to elicit silencing-induced degeneration. Finally, we discovered that degeneration following synaptic silencing is governed by competition between active and inactive cells, which is a circuit refinement process traditionally thought to end early in postnatal life. Our data suggests that the developmental window for wholesale circuit plasticity may extend into adulthood for specific brain regions. We speculate that this sustained potential for remodeling by entorhinal neurons may support lifelong memory but renders them vulnerable to prolonged activity changes in disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurodegenerative conditions cause irreversible damage to the brain and have a devastating impact on quality of life. However, these diseases start gradually, meaning that the entire brain is not affected at once. For example, the initial signs of Alzheimer’s disease appear only in specific areas.</p><p>One of the first brain regions to degenerate in Alzheimer’s is the entorhinal cortex. In healthy individuals, entorhinal neurons send electrical signals to the hippocampus, a part of the brain important for memory and learning. During Alzheimer’s, hippocampal neurons also die off, leading to ‘shrinkage’ of this brain region and, ultimately, the memory problems that are a hallmark of the disease.</p><p>Many neurons in the developing brain require electrical input from other cells to survive – in other words, if they do not belong to an ‘active circuit’, they are eliminated. This is crucial for the connection between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus, where the circuit's development and maintenance require carefully controlled electrical activity. Abnormal electrical activity is also an early sign of diseases like Alzheimer’s, but how this relates to degeneration is still poorly understood.</p><p>By investigating these questions, Zhao, Grunke, Wood et al. uncovered a potential relationship between electrical activity and degeneration in the adult brain, long after the circuit between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex had matured.</p><p>Mice were genetically engineered so that their entorhinal cortex would carry a protein designed to silence electrical signaling. The communication between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus could therefore be shut off by activating the protein with an injected drug. Remarkably, within just a few days of silencing, cells from the entorhinal cortex started to die off.</p><p>Zhao, Grunke, Wood et al. went on to show that different silencing methods yielded the same results – in other words, the degeneration of cells from the entorhinal cortex was not linked to a particular method. This vulnerability to electrical inactivity was also unique to the entorhinal cortex: when neighboring parts of the brain were silenced, the nerve cells in these areas did not die as readily. Interestingly, in one of their experiments, Zhao, Grunke, Wood et al. found that electrical activity of neighboring nerve cells participated in killing the silenced neurons, suggesting that nerve cells in these brain areas might compete to survive.</p><p>Overall, this work highlights a direct link between electrical activity and nerve cell degeneration in a part of the brain severely affected by Alzheimer’s. In the future, Zhao, Grunke, Wood et al. hope that these results will pave the way to a better understanding of the biological mechanisms underpinning such neurodegenerative diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>selective vulnerability</kwd><kwd>entorhinal cortex</kwd><kwd>chemogenetic silencing</kwd><kwd>activity-dependent competition</kwd><kwd>circuit plasticity</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG058188</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowsky</surname><given-names>Joanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1 AG058188-01S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowsky</surname><given-names>Joanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS092615</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowsky</surname><given-names>Joanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GT13620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jankowsky</surname><given-names>Joanna L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 AG067676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wood</surname><given-names>Caleb A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000957</institution-id><institution>Alzheimer's Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AARF-17-533487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grunke</surname><given-names>Stacy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006312</institution-id><institution>BrightFocus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A2015016F</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grunke</surname><given-names>Stacy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chemogenetic silencing reveals that entorhinal neurons require ongoing activity for survival, suggesting that their normal physiology may render them vulnerable to pathologies that impair transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Each neurodegenerative disease is characterized by selective loss of a specific neuronal population. Current research efforts have focused heavily on the molecular features of these neurons that render them susceptible to disease pathology. Modern transcriptomic techniques have revealed distinct gene signatures of vulnerable neuronal populations, but this approach takes a static view of circuits that remain active throughout life. Neuronal activity plays a key role in circuit refinement during development up to and including cell death, raising the possibility that developmental mechanisms could be aberrantly reactivated in the context of disease. During CNS development, some regions eliminate up to 50% of immature neurons through activity-dependent programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murase et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong and Marín, 2019</xref>). Still more complex and varied processes drive axonal refinement in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm and Freeman, 2014</xref>). Despite being one of the strongest factors in developmental circuit refinement, neuronal activity has not been well studied as a potential contributor to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang and Holtzman, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Changes in neuronal activity are an early hallmark of several degenerative disorders, and it is increasingly clear that network dysfunction can drive pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harris et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yamamoto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yuan and Grutzendler, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). In Parkinson’s disease, vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons has been attributed to the high-energy demand of maintaining persistent low-frequency firing across a vast axonal arbor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gonzalez-Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). The normal function of nigral neurons may render them preferentially vulnerable to degeneration. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid formation can lead to hypersynchronous activity, which is thought to accelerate cognitive decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vossel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palop and Mucke, 2016</xref>). Increased neuronal activity promotes further amyloid release, creating a vicious cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cirrito et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Styr and Slutsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frere and Slutsky, 2018</xref>). In both of these settings, neuronal activity promotes pathogenesis. We were therefore surprised to uncover evidence that neuronal inactivity contributes to neurodegeneration in a model of AD. While modeling the circuit-level consequences of neurodegeneration in the entorhinal cortex (EC), we uncovered evidence that this area is highly susceptible to activity disruption well into adulthood. Using multiple chemogenetic systems, we show that electrically silencing entorhinal neurons elicits a pattern of degeneration beginning with axon damage, followed by neuroinflammation and overt cell death. Inhibiting synaptic vesicle release without altering electrical activity is sufficient to drive entorhinal death, but triggers a distinct pattern of axon degeneration. Finally, we found that axonal degeneration following synaptic inhibition is governed by classic interneuronal competition and can be prevented by broadly silencing all entorhinal neurons. Together, our studies indicate that neuronal activity plays an ongoing role in the survival of EC neurons and raise the possibility that perturbations in activity may partner with molecular pathology to drive degeneration of this region.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Unexpected loss of EC2 neurons following chloride-based neuronal silencing</title><p>In previous work, we described a chemogenetic model for studying neuronal dysfunction in the adult EC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). This model used an engineered chloride channel to allow ligand-activated disruption of action potential initiation in a subset of EC layer 2 neurons (EC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynagh and Lynch, 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lynagh and Lynch, 2012</xref>). The modified channel (GlyCl) was expressed in EC2 neurons using a tetracycline-transactivator driver line that was selective for, but not exclusive to, EC2 cells (Nop-tTA; TRE-GlyCl-YFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasuda and Mayford, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yetman et al., 2015</xref>). The GlyCl channel is activated by the ligand ivermectin (IVM) and was co-expressed with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) to identify the silenced cells. Bath application of 100 nM IVM to acute brain slices suppressed neuronal firing by up to 90% in YFP+ entorhinal neurons from GlyCl transgenic mice, but had no effect on EC neurons from control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We previously demonstrated that systemic administration of IVM decreased neuronal firing in vivo for several hours after intraperitoneal injection and that the drug half-life of &gt;12 hr likely maintained this effect for a day or more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transient electrical silencing with GlyCl causes cell death in entorhinal cortex (EC) neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example traces from current-clamp recordings in brain slices from control and GlyCl-expressing mice, with and without 100 nM ivermectin (IVM).

Vehicle-injected animals displayed clear YFP labeling of neuronal cell bodies in EC2 and their axonal projections into the dentate gyrus (DG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast, animals injected with a single dose of IVM (5 mg/kg, i.p.) showed diminished DG axonal labeling within 1–2 days post injection (dpi) and labeling was nearly undetectable by 4 dpi. Alongside this change in the DG, the number of labeled cell bodies in EC2 was significantly decreased by 4 dpi and reduced by 50% at 7 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>The spatiotemporal pattern of diminished labeling suggested that the silenced cells were being eliminated from the circuit. To confirm that the silenced neurons had degenerated, we began looking for canonical markers of neuronal injury and cell death. First, we saw that many YFP-labeled EC2 axons had withdrawn from the DG into the cortex and developed pronounced swellings at their distal ends. These swellings were strongly reminiscent of retraction bulbs, which are typically observed after axonal injury or physical lesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hill et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These bulbs appeared within 1 day of IVM treatment, peaked at 2–3 dpi, and were gone over the same time course as the loss of YFP-labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Retraction bulbs began while IVM was still active in the brain, suggesting that their emergence was the result of neuronal silencing and not due to rebound activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) . Next, we found EC2 cells labeled with active caspase-3, indicative of apoptotic cell death, in the days immediately following IVM injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Caspase-labeled cells were sporadic, but only observed in EC2 of animals subjected to entorhinal silencing. Consistent with caspase activation, we observed that EC2 cells contained a caspase-cleaved actin fragment (fractin), again suggesting apoptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schulz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Fractin labeling was robust, peaked between 4 and 7 days after IVM and then abated, presumably after the dead and dying cells had been cleared. Finally, we observed hypertrophic Iba1+ microglia in both the DG and the EC. Iba1 staining increased by 2 days after IVM, peaked by 4–7 dpi, and receded by 10–13 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Collectively, our data suggests that transient neuronal silencing of EC2 neurons initiated a cascade of events beginning with axonal retraction and ending in caspase-associated cell death with a strong but focal microglial response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>EC2 cell death is observed with other means of electrical inactivation</title><p>The loss of EC2 neurons after GlyCl silencing was unexpected, and before investigating potential biological mechanisms, we wanted to rule out the possibility that we had simply generated a chemogenetic system for cell death. Although IVM had never been associated with neurodegeneration, we first confirmed that the drug by itself was not responsible for cell loss in EC. To test this, we introduced a nuclear-localized lacZ transgene into Nop-GlyCl animals that would generate two sets of mice: one with EC2 neurons co-expressing GlyCl plus lacZ, and a set of siblings that expressed only lacZ. We again found that EC2 cells were diminished in animals carrying both lacZ and GlyCl but detected no cell loss in mice expressing lacZ alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This data demonstrates that GlyCl-based neuronal silencing and not IVM exposure alone was responsible for cell death in the Nop-GlyCl mice.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether EC2 neurons were selectively sensitive to chloride flux caused by the GlyCl system or whether instead they were more broadly vulnerable to electrical silencing. We chose a mutated Kir 2.1 channel to suppress firing by potassium shunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xue et al., 2014</xref>), and stereotaxically injected AAV carrying a tTA-dependent Kir2.1 into the EC of Nop-tTA single transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Viral expression peaked at approximately 7 dpi, when field recordings of input–output responses in the perforant path demonstrated a significant reduction in transmission between EC2 and DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Co-expressed YFP again allowed us to visualize the loss of axonal labeling from the DG over the following weeks that was qualitatively similar to, but slower than, what we observed with GlyCl silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C,E</xref>). Unlike the GlyCl model, we did not see retraction bulbs in the EC of Kir2.1 mice, but did observe evidence of axon damage in the DG at later time points. Iba1 immunostaining peaked between 13 and 16 dpi in both EC and DG of Kir-expressing animals, consistent with neuronal damage in these areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,F</xref>). Control animals received tTA-dependent YFP virus without Kir and showed no loss of fluorescence nor any change in Iba1 beyond the needle track in either the DG or EC over 4 weeks post injection (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neural populations neighboring EC2 are resistant to silencing</title><p>Examining the effects of GlyCl activation on other brain regions would allow us to test whether silencing is generally toxic or whether distinctive properties of EC2 neurons confer vulnerability to silencing. The neuropsin-tTA driver line used to express GlyCl in EC2 is also active in connected regions of the presubiculum and parasubiculum, which allowed us to test whether electrical silencing elicited cell death outside of EC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yetman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). We first confirmed that GlyCl expression was sufficient to suppress neuronal firing in pre- and parasubiculum using whole-cell recordings in acute brain slices. Action potential firing was significantly reduced in YFP+ neurons in both regions upon bath application of 100 nM IVM to the same level as EC2 at this dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We counted YFP+ cells in each brain area before and after systemic IVM treatment at 5 mg/kg (1× IVM). As before, a single dose of IVM significantly reduced the number of labeled EC2 cells in GlyCl+ mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). In contrast, IVM caused no loss of pre- or parasubiculum neurons at this dose, suggesting that these neighboring regions may not share EC2’s vulnerability to activity disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We next tested whether cell loss in either of these regions would be unmasked at a higher dose of IVM. We posited that higher doses of IVM allow for increased GlyCl activation and more effective electrical silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lerchner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynagh and Lynch, 2010</xref>). We treated an independent set of mice with a single injection of 10 mg/kg IVM (2× IVM). This dose caused significantly more cell loss in the EC2 than 1× IVM (70% at 2× vs. 50% at 1×, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also found that parasubiculum neurons that had been resistant to 1× IVM now showed mild cell loss at 2× IVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Nevertheless, the proportion of neurons lost in parasubiculum at 2× IVM (30%) was considerably smaller than in EC2 at 1× IVM (50%). Remarkably, neuron counts in presubiculum were not altered at either dose. The simplest explanation for these differences in vulnerability would be differences in GlyCl expression level between the three areas. We therefore measured GlyCl levels in individual cells from each region using immunofluorescence to detect transgenic human glycine receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). We found that the presubiculum expressed relatively low levels of GlyCl receptor, and therefore we could not exclude the possibility that its resilience was a result of low transgene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). In contrast, GlyCl expression was practically identical in EC2 and parasubiculum, despite their distinct patterns of cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). We were surprised to discover this decoupling of silencing, GlyCl expression, and cell loss. While activity in all three brain regions was efficiently silenced by IVM, EC2 and parasubiculum expressed higher levels of GlyCl protein, and EC2 alone saw substantial cell loss. These findings suggest that EC2 neurons are especially sensitive to activity perturbation, and considerably more vulnerable to electrical inactivation than cells in neighboring pre- and parasubiculum.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>EC2 is more vulnerable to electrical inactivation than neighboring regions.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) The Nop-tTA line drives expression of transgenic GlyCl in neural populations beyond the entorhinal cortex (EC), including the pre- and parasubiculum.

EC2 contains multiple neuronal subtypes distinguished by their molecular markers, firing properties, morphology, and connectivity. Axons from stellate cells in the medial EC and fan cells in the lateral EC connect with DG through the perforant pathway, and we predicted this population would be preferentially lost in our Nop-Gly mice given the disappearance of axon terminals from the DG following EC2 silencing. The three main cell types within EC2 can be distinguished by expression of specific protein markers: excitatory stellate and fan cells are characterized by reelin expression, excitatory pyramidal neurons by Wfs1, and inhibitory neurons by GABAergic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kitamura et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kitamura et al., 2015</xref>). We found that the Nop-tTA driver line is active in both reelin-positive stellate cells and Wfs1-positive pyramidal neurons, but completely absent from inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and data not shown). Consistent with past work, we found YFP labeled roughly half of the reelin- and Wfs1-expressing EC2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasuda and Mayford, 2006</xref>). We harvested Nop-GlyCl mice 7 days after a single dose of vehicle or IVM (5 mg/kg) and co-immunostained for YFP, reelin, and Wfs1.

This data suggests that reelin + stellate cells are preferentially vulnerable to cell death after silencing. This conclusion coincides with the fact that the parasubiculum, comprised predominantly of Wfs1+ cells, was resistant to neuronal silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref>), and with recent work suggesting that expression of Wfs1 is protective in the EC during AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Electrical silencing preferentially kills reelin-positive stellate cells in EC2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-immunostaining of Nop-GlyCl mice for YFP, reelin, and Wfs1 revealed that the transgene was expressed in both EC2 reelin+ stellate cells and Wfs1+ pyramidal neurons.

We next wanted to tease apart whether one or both effects were required for cell loss. To do this, we used virally expressed tetanus toxin (TeTX) to suppress neurotransmitter release from EC2 neurons in adult Nop-tTA mice without affecting electrical activity. Co-expressed YFP was used to visualize the silenced neurons and YFP alone was injected as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Field recording in acute slices from virally injected mice confirmed that TeTX expression significantly reduced electrical transmission between EC2 and DG and that the extent of suppression was consistent with the percentage of neurons expressing the virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Expression of TeTX-YFP initially labeled both EC2 neuronal cell bodies and their axon terminals in the DG, similar to the pattern in YFP-injected control mice. Viral expression peaked at 7 dpi and shortly afterward YFP intensity began to fade in the DG of TeTX mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Loss of perforant path labeling progressed over the next 2 weeks until nearly undetectable. Animals injected with YFP alone showed no change in labeling over the same time period. Loss of axonal labeling in TeTX mice was accompanied by the emergence of fractin staining in the EC that was specific to mice expressing TeTX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Fractin-positive cells first appeared at 10 dpi, became more prominent at 13 dpi, and largely abated by 19 dpi. As with GlyCl-based silencing, we observed reactive microglia in the DG and EC as an early marker of impending cell loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and found sporadic cells labeled with active caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). This cascade of events leading from impaired neurotransmission to cell death was comparable across the various silencing methods we tested, suggesting that EC2 neurons are broadly susceptible to inactivity, and that inhibiting synaptic release alone is sufficient to cause EC2 cell loss.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Entorhinal cell death is also elicited by synaptic silencing with tetanus toxin (TeTX).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) AAV was used to express either YFP or YFP plus TeTX in entorhinal neurons.

GlyCl silencing was characterized by the appearance of retraction bulbs in deep layers of EC, suggesting neuronal loss followed intact axonal withdraw.

The Nop-tTA driver line used to express GlyCl, Kir2.1, and TeTX is active in approximately 40% of EC2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yasuda and Mayford, 2006</xref>). The remaining EC2 neurons were unaffected by our genetic and viral manipulations. As a result of this incomplete penetrance, our experiments created a situation whereby some neurons continued to fire normally while adjacent cells were inactivated. During postnatal development, competition between active and inactive neurons is used to refine the perforant path (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>). TeTX silencing of the same neuronal subset caused axonal loss in the developing brain that was qualitatively similar to what we saw in the adult. Yasuda et al. further showed that axonal loss could be prevented by eliminating the competition between active and inactive cells with tetrodotoxin (TTX). This led us to wonder whether competition might account for neuronal loss upon silencing in the adult EC.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we infused TTX or saline just dorsal to the right EC starting 3 days after Nop-tTA mice were injected with TRE-TeTX-YFP virus. TTX infusion was continued until harvest 7 days later (10 dpi after viral injection). By injecting slightly dorsal, TTX reached the EC and DG but these areas were spared from damage. The spread of TTX and efficacy of EC silencing were verified by the loss of c-fos labeling following chemically induced seizures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we would have liked to test extended time points in the degenerative process initiated by TeTX, TTX treatment beyond 7 days caused locomotor impairment as it diffused beyond the target site. Consistent with our initial experiments, control mice injected with TeTX virus but infused with saline showed pronounced axonal disintegration visible as bright YFP puncta in the DG at 10 dpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, axonal labeling remained robust and intact in mice infused with TTX. Preservation of axonal innervation was limited to the infused hemisphere; degeneration on the contralateral side was identical to that seen in animals infused with saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These differences were reflected in both the width of YFP labeling and the intensity of YFP fluorescence measured at the crest of the DG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C and D</xref>). Consistent with the axon preservation, the extent of microglial activation normally observed in the DG of TeTX mice was also abated by TTX infusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and E</xref>). In conclusion, TTX infusion preserved axonal innervation and maintained microglial homeostasis in mice expressing TeTX, suggesting that degeneration due to synaptic silencing may be governed by ongoing competition between active and inactive contacts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activity-dependent competition governs entorhinal cortex (EC) axonal disintegration due to tetanus toxin (TeTX) silencing.</title><p>Mice expressing TeTX + YFP in EC neurons were treated by local infusion of tetrodotoxin (TTX) or saline.

We began TTX infusion 12 hr before injecting IVM to ensure TTX had reached the EC at the time of GlyCl activation. TTX infusion was continued for another 2.5 dpi after IVM injection to suppress neuronal firing throughout the period when GlyCl might remain active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>). Animals were euthanized 7 days after IVM to examine whether widespread inactivity caused by TTX would prevent cell death in the subset of EC2 neurons that were silenced with GlyCl. Contrary to our results with TeTX, infusion of TTX had no effect on neuronal survival in the GlyCl model. We found no difference in the area of YFP fluorescence within EC2 between mice infused with TTX and saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Both IVM-treated groups lost ~66–75% of the YFP+ area compared to vehicle-injected mice, similar in magnitude to EC2 cell counts in IVM-treated GlyCl mice without cannulation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). TTX infusion also had no effect on fractin expression or microglial activation evoked by IVM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B and C</xref>). Importantly, TTX infusion caused no cell loss in control mice injected with vehicle instead of IVM, indicating that TTX infusion by itself does not cause cell death. Given this negative outcome, we tested two modifications of the infusion procedure to rule out the possibility of incorrect TTX targeting or insufficient TTX duration. Neither 3 days of TTX infusion targeting the DG nor 7 days of infusion targeting dorsal EC changed the outcome (data not shown). These findings indicate that cell death in the GlyCl model cannot be explained by competition between the silenced cells and their active neighbors, and that separate mechanisms govern neuronal death following electrical versus synaptic silencing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our efforts to model entorhinal dysfunction due to AD led us to three novel discoveries about this circuit. First, we demonstrate that mature EC2 neurons require ongoing activity for survival long beyond the postnatal critical period. This activity dependence distinguishes EC from neighboring pre- and parasubiculum, which are largely resilient to activity changes. Second, we demonstrate that electrical versus synaptic silencing can elicit distinct forms of axonal damage prior to cell death. Finally, we show that axonal disintegration due to synaptic silencing is governed by competition between active and inactive neurons, suggesting that this circuit may maintain an activity-dependent critical period well into adulthood.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Activity-dependent neuronal survival persists in the adult cortex</title><p>We show that both electrical silencing due to chloride or potassium flux and synaptic silencing due to arrest of neurotransmitter release are each sufficient to cause axonal damage of EC2 neurons followed by cell body demise. Such wholesale changes in activity-dependent circuit patterning are traditionally thought to be limited to a brief window during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murase, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong and Marín, 2019</xref>). We suspect that our discovery arises at least in part from three fortuitous aspects of our experimental system: (1) the prolonged suppression provided by the manipulations we chose compared with the shorter duration tools used in earlier work, (2) the decision to look at time points well after silencing had subsided, and (3) our focus on the EC-DG connection where circuit architecture, a layer-specific driver line, and a co-expressed cytosolic YFP label allowed clear visualization of axonal degeneration and cell loss.</p><p>Numerous studies have used chemical, chemogenetic, or optogenetic tools to silence entorhinal input to the DG without observing signs of axonal damage or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rueckemann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ormond and McNaughton, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rowland et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Robinson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van Wijngaarden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heys et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). Nearly all of these studies tested the electrophysiological consequences of entorhinal dysfunction on spatial coding and spatial navigation behaviors. Changes in place cell properties were detected immediately after entorhinal inactivation and animals were generally harvested upon completion of the task. We delayed harvesting the initial Nop-GlyCl mice until many days after IVM injection to map the pharmacodynamics of extended silencing with the GlyCl system. Further, optogenetic or DREADD chemogenetic tools display temporal precision on the scale of milliseconds to minutes, but silencing with GlyCl and TeTX is slow and sustained. The half-life for IVM in the brain is over 13 hr and behavioral impairments persist for several days after IVM administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lerchner et al., 2007</xref> and data not shown). The effect of TeTX is even more protracted, in theory silencing transmission as long as expression continues. While neither the GlyCl or TeTX would be ideal for experiments requiring restoration of physiology or behavior after silencing, both were well suited to our initial purpose of modeling circuit impairments due to neurodegenerative disease.</p><p>A fundamental question raised by our findings is the threshold beyond which cell death pathways are engaged by prolonged or complete silencing. We identified one previous study that tested prolonged EC inactivation using hM4Di DREADD with chronic CNO infusion over 6 weeks of study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rodriguez et al., 2020</xref>). This paper is most similar to our experiments in its sustained manipulation of EC activity, but focused on downstream tau and amyloid pathology in the hippocampus rather than cell survival or axonal morphology in the EC. Immunostaining suggested that many DREADD-expressing neurons survived 6 weeks of CNO exposure. The divergent outcomes between chronic partial suppression with DREADDs and shorter but complete silencing with GlyCl or TeTX supports the possibility of a threshold dividing survival and death.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Preferential resilience of Wfs1 cells within EC2</title><p>Our transgenic driver line fortuitously allowed us to silence a portion of both major excitatory cell types within EC2. This arrangement provided a direct test of vulnerability between the reelin+ stellate cells that project to DG and the Wfs1+ pyramidal neurons that project to CA1 and contralateral EC. Of the two populations, we found that pyramidal neurons were relatively resilient to activity perturbation, while stellate cells were preferentially vulnerable. This outcome is consistent with recent work showing that Wfs1 expression protects EC2 neurons from tauopathy and degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). Tau tangles appear in dense patches within human EC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Braak and Braak, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Hoesen et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Hoesen et al., 1991</xref>), where, in contrast to the mouse EC, islands are composed of reelin+ stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Witter et al., 2017</xref>). Both Wfs1+ and reelin+ cells are lost from EC2 during AD; however, the loss of reelin appears to be much more profound while more than half of Wfs1+ cells survive late into the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Delpech et al., 2021</xref>). Synaptic markers are also lost early in AD from the terminal field of EC2 neurons in DG, lending further support to the preferential vulnerability of hippocampal-projecting stellate and fan cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hamos et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scheff et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scheff et al., 2006</xref>). The factors contributing to differential vulnerability between stellate and pyramidal neurons are only just being elucidated, but the distinct patterns of cell loss we found within EC2 suggest that molecular signatures may be just one piece of this puzzle. Our data suggest that connectivity and function within the hippocampal-EC circuit may be equally important in governing differential neuronal vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Different modes of silencing elicited distinct patterns of axonal damage</title><p>We unexpectedly discovered that the same population of hippocampal-projecting EC2 neurons could adopt different patterns of axonal degeneration prior to cell death. Axons silenced by GlyCl displayed evidence of simple axonal retraction beginning within 1–2 days of silencing onset. These axons remained intact, although displaced from the DG, with bulb-like structures at their tips. This pattern was strikingly different from the overt axonal disintegration observed after TeTX silencing. Atrophy in TeTX-expressing axons was reminiscent of Wallerian degeneration, which is characterized by axon blebbing and fragmentation. Both patterns of axon elimination are found in the developing CNS, although rarely in the same cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm and Freeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Riccomagno and Kolodkin, 2015</xref>). The developing thalamocortical projection stands out in displaying both retraction and disintegration, with the choice seeming to depend on the length of axon segment being remodeled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neukomm and Freeman, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Portera-Cailliau et al., 2005</xref>). Axon length did not differ in our model as the same projections underwent degeneration under each form of silencing. Instead, our models differed by the method used to prevent neurotransmission. GlyCl suppresses electrical activity by membrane hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lerchner et al., 2007</xref>) or reduced membrane conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weir et al., 2017</xref>), either of which would dampen evoked neurotransmitter release onto postsynaptic DG targets while having no effect on spontaneous release. In contrast, TeTX has no direct effect on electrical activity, but can potently inhibit both evoked and spontaneous neurotransmitter release by preventing vesicle fusion at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiavo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Humeau et al., 2000</xref>). We hope that future studies will identify the distinct signaling pathways activated by these different means of neuronal silencing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Neuronal competition regulates axon degeneration due to TeTX but not cell loss due to GlyCl</title><p>Competition determining which cells live or die has been well-studied during the development of sensory circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Blakemore, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao and Reed, 2001</xref>). The same competitive pressure was recently discovered during axonal refinement of the developing perforant pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yasuda et al., 2011</xref>). Yasuda et al. found that infusing TTX into the EC during development prevented the loss of axons silenced by TeTX. This elegant experiment suggested that competition between active and inactive axons drove developmental refinement of the perforant path. We used a similar approach to determine whether competition might also drive axonal degeneration and cell death in the adult EC. The divergent outcome of this manipulation in TeTX and GlyCl models surprised us, but supported the idea that synaptic silencing and electrical suppression evoke distinct mechanisms of cell death in the adult EC. Local infusion of TTX preserved axonal integrity in neurons expressing TeTX but had no effect on cell loss in neurons silenced by GlyCl. Electrical silencing by GlyCl appears to kill EC2 neurons by a noncompetitive, possibly cell-intrinsic mechanism, but axonal disintegration due to synaptic silencing by TeTX appears to be influenced by activity in neighboring neurons. This competitive mechanism – and the experiments used to demonstrate it – is consistent with the process used during developmental refinement of the perforant path; however, we cannot rule out the alternative explanation that TTX may act directly on the TeTX-expressing cells rather than through their neighbors. Our experiments also stop short of demonstrating that axonal preservation in TeTX-expressing mice is sufficient to protect the cell body due to the limited duration of TTX infusion. Nevertheless, this discovery raises the possibility that the critical window for EC circuit refinement – potentially including wholesale neuron elimination – remains open long into adulthood. This discovery also raises the question of whether increasing synaptic activity might be neuroprotective for EC neurons. Several groups have tested EC activation in the adult brain using chemo- or optogenetic tools; however, most evoked only short bursts of activity that may not be sufficient to induce a survival imbalance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kanter et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Limitations of our experimental models</title><p>We also must address limitations of our model systems that raise important caveats to several of our conclusions. First and foremost, our studies focused almost exclusively on EC2. We do not know whether our chemogenetic tools would evoke axonal damage and cell death in other areas of the brain. We sought to address this concern by measuring cell loss in neural populations outside EC that were also silenced in the Nop-GlyCl model. We found no evidence of cell loss in pre- or parasubiculum at IVM doses sufficient to kill ~50% of silenced EC2 neurons. Even at higher doses of IVM, these areas remained relatively preserved compared with EC2. This data suggests that EC2 is particularly vulnerable to activity changes, but our comparison did not look beyond these three areas.</p><p>We also appreciate that the inter-animal variability in viral transduction prevented us from performing meaningful cell counts to assess cell loss after silencing with Kir or TeTX. Our conclusions instead relied on loss of DG innervation and the appearance of damage markers such as Iba1 and fractin. In addition, stereotaxic viral injections likely reached a smaller fraction of EC neurons than transgenic expression of GlyCl, which would alter the proportion of active vs. silenced cells in each system. This could influence the level of competition within each system, which could alter the degenerative phenotype we observed. Nevertheless, TeTX expression always produced axon disintegration rather than retraction, regardless of transduction efficiency. We recognize that the proportion of silenced cells might also have affected the potential for rescue by broad TTX silencing. Similarly, axonal disintegration in TeTX mice was consistently rescued by TTX, independent of the number of cells transduced. Because of this, we conclude that the differences in degenerative phenotypes between GlyCl and TeTX are most likely intrinsic to the silencing system, but appreciate the need for additional studies using matched viral or transgenic expression systems.</p><p>We also note that other teams have used TeTX silencing in the mossy fiber and Schaffer collateral pathways for up to 6 months with no evidence of lasting axonal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakashiba et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nakashiba et al., 2008</xref>). Of course, our experiments placed TeTX in EC2 neurons, while the Tonegawa studies expressed TeTX in DG and CA3 neurons. We do not know whether DG and CA3 are more resilient than EC2; however, our studies of pre- and parasubiculum suggest that EC2 may be more vulnerable to activity disruption than other nearby parts of the hippocampal-entorhinal circuit.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Vulnerability of the EC-hippocampal circuit may derive from its function</title><p>Unlike the primary sensory cortices that precisely map their input during a defined critical period, the EC remains highly plastic throughout life and is constantly modified during memory formation. While both EC and neighboring parasubiculum support spatial awareness and navigation, EC integrates that information to support long-term memory, whereas parasubiculum primarily updates the internal spatial model without contributing to spatial memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). This need to remain continuously plastic may render the EC more vulnerable than nearby regions to insults that cause an activity imbalance between neurons, extending and offering a specific target for the idea that homeostatic collapse may be a driving force in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Styr and Slutsky, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Frere and Slutsky, 2018</xref>). Consistent with this idea, EC cells that degenerate early in AD are characterized by expression of axonal remodeling and excitability genes, suggestive of heightened plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Leng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roussarie et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we experimentally impaired transmission between the EC and hippocampus, but several naturally occurring insults may have similar consequences. For example, pathological tau accumulation in EC neurons might impair the initiation or propagation of action potentials in affected cells while neighboring neurons remain normally active. EC2 is particularly prone to tangle pathology, where these lesions mark the earliest stages of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hyman et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Van Hoesen et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Van Hoesen et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braak and Braak, 1991</xref>). Alternatively, the formation of amyloid plaques in the DG could physically disrupt the communication between pre- and postsynaptic cells. Plaques are prominent in the molecular layer of the dentate, precisely where the presynaptic terminals of the perforant path connect with postsynaptic dendrites of granule cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crain and Burger, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Geddes et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hyman et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Braak and Braak, 1991</xref>). Importantly, in the early stages of pathology formation, these communication deficits would be localized to individual neurons with tangles or their axons terminating near plaques. The altered microenvironment of these affected neurons could establish a competitive situation in which those neurons would be disadvantaged relative to their neighbors, perhaps leading to their demise. This theory offers a new model by which the pathologies of AD may underlie the early vulnerability of EC neurons. Moreover, these studies raise the possibility that lifelong plasticity needed for episodic memory may be a disadvantage in disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>Animals were housed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were 3–6 months of age at the time of treatment.

Each hemisphere was injected with 300 nl virus (6.9 × 10<sup>8</sup> genome copies total for YFP and TeTX, empirically equivalent to 5.7 × 10<sup>8</sup> gc for Kir2.1) at a rate of 50 nl/min.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optimizing TTX dosage, targeting, and spread</title><p>TTX (Abcam, Cambridge, MA, ab120054) or 0.9% saline containing 0.04% Trypan blue for visual confirmation of catheter flow was preloaded into a micro-osmotic pump (#1003D, Alzet, Cupertino, CA) and primed by immersion in sterile 0.9% saline overnight at 37°C. Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane, and an indwelling 30-gauge cannula (#0008851, Alzet) cemented to the skull (Kerr, Orange, CA, 34417) at AP –4.5, ML +3.0, and DV –2.5 mm that targeted immediately above the right EC or at AP –3.1, ML +3.0, and DV –2.65 to target the dorsal DG. Immediately following cannula placement, the primed micro-osmotic pump was positioned subcutaneously through a mid-scapular incision and the catheter routed subcutaneously to connect with the cannula. The pump flow rate of 1 μl/hr was chosen to deliver 24 µl/day TTX. To measure the spread and efficacy of TTX, mice were injected with the convulsant drug pentylenetetrazol (PTZ, 25 mg/kg) 90 min prior to harvest and killed at 6–48 hr after implantation to examine the spread of dye and the extent of c-fos labeling induced by PTZ. TTX fully suppressed neuronal activity caused by PTZ at 12 hr after the start of infusion, and this timing was used for IVM injection during competition experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>TTX administration</title><p>TTX (2.3 uM) or 0.9% saline containing 0.04% Trypan blue was prepared and infused as described above to target right dorsal EC.

From these, 3–4 plane-matched sections spanning the medial EC were chosen for analysis. Each image was converted to 8-bit and three ROIs were manually outlined: superficial EC covering layers 2–3, molecular layer of the DG including both blades, and the medial zone of stratum radiatum in CA1.

After converting to 16-bit and processing the image using the ‘subtract background’ function, a threshold was applied within each of the region-specific ROIs using the Otsu algorithm. A selection was created based off the binary image to create a mask of the GlyCl signal in each region. The GlyCl mask area was then applied to the original 16-bit image and integrated density was measured for each ROI to return the total intensity across the entire region. To normalize the integrated density per cell, original images were again converted to 16-bit, background subtracted, then a Gaussian blur filter was applied to generalize the shape of the cells. For analyzing presubiculum neurons, no blur was applied. The Otsu threshold was then applied using the ECII, pre- and parasubiculum ROIs drawn earlier. The watershed function was applied to separate joined cells. To count cells, particles were analyzed within each ROI. Integrated density was then divided by the total number of particles per region and divided by the EC2 measurement to generate an EC2 normalized intensity per cell.

Our data suggests that retraction bulbs form within the first 24 hours after IVM injection, which is within the window that IVM remains in the brain (the half-life for IVM in brain = 13.3 hr, see Zhao et al., Cell Rep. 2016, PMID 27373150, Figure 3B). Although unpublished, we have preliminary behavioral data suggesting that the suppressive effect of a single IVM injection endures for at least 2 days, well after retraction bulbs first appear. We appreciate the apparent paradox this data presents in demonstrating that an entorhinal-dependent cognitive function could recover just as neuronal silencing evokes cell death in the entorhinal circuit. We believe this paradox is resolved by the difference between the relatively larger number of cells that are silenced by IVM due to the wider limbic expression of the tTA driver line (including EC plus presubiculum, parasubiculum, and retrosplenial cortex) and the considerably smaller number of EC-specific neurons that are lost in the aftermath.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Acquisition of conditioned fear takes several days to recover from entorhinal silencing.</title><p>Contextual fear conditioning was performed in 3 month old animals trained at varying times following a single injection of IVM. Recall for the trained chamber was measured 24 hours after conditioning as % time immobile during a 5 min test session. IVM treatment had no effect at any time on control animals lacking GlyCl expression (white bars), while associative memory was significantly impaired in animals with entorhinal GlyCl trained 3 hours or 2 days after IVM injection, and finally recovered to control levels by 3 days after IVM dosing.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-83813-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>We have modified the first section of Results entitled &quot;<italic>Unexpected loss of EC2 neurons following chloride-based neuronal silencing</italic>&quot; with the following addition:</p><p>“Retraction bulbs began while IVM was still active in the brain, suggesting their emergence was the result of neuronal silencing and not due to rebound activity (R.

Could the effect seen in supplementary Figure 2 B be due to the onset of axon loss?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point that we simply hadn't considered before. In retrospect, we do not have a logical response; we were simply in the mindset of conducting field recordings for virally-injected mice due to prior use of TeTX for silencing, which could not have been tested by whole-cell recordings. We chose 7 dpi for slice recordings in virally-injected animals as a time point that balanced the known delay between injection and viral expression against the goal of measuring transmission before axon loss occurred. We settled on 7 dpi based on histological data from TeTX and Kir animals showing robust YFP expression in the DG at that time point, followed by the first signs of axon disintegration in the TeTX mice shortly after. The reviewer is correct that we cannot rule out the possibility that initial axon loss contributed to the observed transmission deficit, but we believe the time point we chose was the best compromise for the experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– I might have missed it in the main text, but I am wondering if the observation about the absence of axon retraction bulbs in the legend of Suppl. 2 should not be in the main text.

We have revised the Results section <italic>EC2 cell death is observed with other means of electrical inactivation</italic> based on this recommendation:</p><p>“Unlike the GlyCl model, we did not see retraction bulbs in the EC of Kir2.1 mice, but did observe evidence of axon damage in the DG at later time points.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be great to show the c-fos stainings post TTX infusion and seizure induction.

This data is now provided as Figure 6 – Supplementary Figure 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– When thinking of the differences between the TeTx and GlyCl, I was wondering if you could maybe give a sense of the proportion of mECII cells that were targeted by the stereotaxic injection? Is it the entirety of mECII that is transduced? Do you see any difference in the density/thickness of the MML between the GlyCl YFP and the TeTx-YFP before and after degeneration and at different dorso-ventral levels? I do not think that this is essential data, but since you are making the comparison between inhibition of degeneration by TTX in both paradigms, these might represent at least a discussion point that could explain some discrepancies. i.e. more or less competition in one case vs. the other?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree that potential differences in the proportion of EC cells expressing GlyCl vs TeTX is an important caveat when interpreting the results of these two experiments. Due to the nature of stereotaxic viral targeting in a transgenic driver line (for TeTX) compared with using a germline transgenic responder (for GlyCl), we know that the proportion of EC cells silenced by TeTX was generally smaller than for GlyCl. The expression of TeTX was also more variable between animals than for GlyCl, and along the dorso-ventral axis within individual mice, for the same reason. We cannot rule out the possibility that these differences affected the degenerative phenotype observed in each system. However, in all cases of TeTX delivery, regardless of EC transduction density or dorso-ventral location, we saw disintegration without retraction bulbs. This suggests that the degenerative phenotype was a result of the silencing mechanism and not the efficacy of viral delivery. With regard to the TTX experiments, we again agree that differences in the proportion of EC cells silenced by GlyCl vs TeTX could well have contributed to the rescue from degeneration observed in one case and not the other. However, TeTX expressing animals responded to TTX regardless of transduction efficiency, which suggests to us that the difference from GlyCl is intrinsic to the silencing system. Nevertheless, this is an important point to consider and as suggested, we have added this discussion to the Discussion section <italic>Limitations of our experimental models.</italic></p><p>“In addition, stereotaxic viral injections likely reached a smaller fraction of EC neurons than transgenic expression of GlyCl, which would alter the proportion of active vs silenced cells in each system. This could influence the level of competition within each system, which could alter the degenerative phenotype we observed. Nevertheless, TeTX expression always produced axon disintegration rather than retraction, regardless of transduction efficiency. We recognize that the proportion of silenced cells might also have affected the potential for rescue by broad TTX silencing. Similarly, axonal disintegration in TeTX mice was consistently rescued by TTX, independent of the number of cells transduced. Because of this, we conclude that the differences in degenerative phenotypes between GlyCl and TeTX are most likely intrinsic to the silencing system, but appreciate the need for additional studies using matched viral or transgenic expression systems.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the part &quot;Preferential resilience of Wfs1 cells within EC2&quot; in the discussion, I am not sure I understand &quot;but the changeable pattern of cell loss we found between neighboring regions and within EC2 suggests that molecular signatures must be just one part of a complex balance&quot;: do you imply that these neighboring cells are pretty close in terms of molecular signatures, and so that molecular signatures are not the only determinant of vulnerability? Pyramidal and stellate cells of mECII do have a number of molecular differences that could account for their differential vulnerability including Wfs1 expression as you mention. But maybe I misunderstood the sentence.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this sentence is not as clear on paper as it was in our heads. We had intended to convey that two important distinctions between the two cell types are their connectivity and function within the hippocampal circuit, but do not mean to argue that the molecular signatures of stellate and pyramidal cells are similar or irrelevant in their differential vulnerability. We have modified the Discussion section <italic>Preferential resilience of Wfs1 cells within EC2</italic> in an effort to make this point more clearly:</p><p>“The factors contributing to differential vulnerability between stellate and pyramidal neurons are only just being elucidated, but the distinct patterns of cell loss we found within EC2 suggest that molecular signatures may be just one piece of this puzzle. Our data suggest that connectivity and function within the hippocampal-EC circuit may be equally important in governing differential neuronal vulnerability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the last section of the discussion, the authors say &quot;For example, formation of neurofibrillary tangles in EC neurons might impair…&quot;.
