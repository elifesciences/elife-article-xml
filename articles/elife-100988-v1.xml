Cortico-striatal projections are an essential part of the brain’s attention–motor interface. Glutamate-sensing microelectrode arrays were used to measure glutamate transients in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) of male and female rats walking a treadmill and executing cued turns and stops. Prelimbic–DMS projections were chemogenetically inhibited to determine their behavioral necessity and the cortico-striatal origin of cue-evoked glutamate transients. Furthermore, we investigated rats exhibiting preferably goal-directed (goal trackers, GTs) versus cue-driven attention (sign-trackers, STs), to determine the impact of such cognitive-motivational biases on cortico-striatal control. GTs executed more cued turns and initiated such turns more slowly than STs. During turns, but not missed turns or cued stops, cue-evoked glutamate concentrations were higher in GTs than in STs. In STs, turn cue-locked glutamate concentrations frequently peaked twice or three times, contrasting with predominately single peaks in GTs. In GTs, but not STs, inhibition of prelimbic–DMS projections attenuated turn rates and turn cue-evoked glutamate concentrations and increased the number of turn cue-locked glutamate peaks. These findings indicate that turn cue-evoked glutamate release in GTs is tightly controlled by cortico-striatal neuronal activity. In contrast, in STs, glutamate release from DMS glutamatergic terminals may be regulated by other striatal circuitry, preferably mediating cued suppression of action and reward tracking. As cortico-striatal dysfunction has been hypothesized to contribute to a wide range of disorders, including complex movement control deficits in Parkinson’s disease and compulsive drug taking, the demonstration of phenotypic contrasts in cortico-striatal control implies the presence of individual vulnerabilities for such disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>glutamate</kwd><kwd>prelimbic cortex</kwd><kwd>electrochemistry</kwd><kwd>cued movements</kwd><kwd>sign-trackers</kwd><kwd>goal-trackers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA045063</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarter</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50NS091856</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarter</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electrochemical recordings of cortico-striatal glutamatergic signaling, and chemogenetic inhibition of such signaling, revealed an essential role of cortico-striatal input for cued action selection, but not for cued stopping.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cue-triggered selection of action, or suppression of action, are essential components of adaptive behavior. Fronto-striatal projections have been thought to play an essential role in the integration of information about attended cues into striatal circuitry, to prioritize cue-linked action and facilitate modification of action selection in response to changing action outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">van Schouwenburg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chatham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hart et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hart et al., 2018b</xref>). Deficient or biased cortico-striatal functions has been postulated to cause neuropsychiatric symptoms ranging from complex movement control deficits in Parkinson’s disease (PD) to compulsive addictive drug use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Volkow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohnen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ersche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Marshall and Ostlund, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Rasooli et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarter et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The cortical control of striatal action selection has been extensively supported by studies investigating the effects of manipulation of the excitability of fronto-striatal neurons in non-human animals (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Sharpe et al., 2019</xref>) and fronto-cortical functional connectivity in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Postuma and Dagher, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Shepherd, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Devignes et al., 2022</xref>). The present experiments were designed to directly determine the fronto-striatal representation of action-initiating and action-suppressing movement cues. Focusing on the prelimbic projections to dorsomedial striatum (DMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>), that previously were demonstrated to be necessary for learning goal-directed actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hart et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choi et al., 2023</xref>), we measured real-time, cue- and reward-locked glutamate concentrations in the DMS using amperometry and glutamate-sensing electrodes. Furthermore, we inhibited prelimbic–DMS projections to attribute such release to activity in this pathway and assess the necessity of cortico-striatal glutamate release for cue-evoked movement and suppression of movement.</p><p>Glutamate transients were recorded in rats performing visual and auditory cue-triggered turns and stops while walking a treadmill. Following a turn cue, the treadmill stopped and restarted in reverse direction while, following a stop cue, it restarted in the same direction. The development of this Cued-Triggered Turning Task (CTTT; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila et al., 2020</xref>) was inspired by evidence showing that people with PD who experience a propensity for falls exhibit deficient turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stack and Ashburn, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). In people with PD, such an elevated risk for falls has been attributed to loss of cholinergic neurons innervating cortical regions and the resulting failure to attend to, and thus select and evaluate, movement cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohnen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Yarnall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Rochester et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bohnen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). In conjunction with the disease-defining striatal dopamine losses, degraded information about movement cues in the striatum is thought to further slow and disrupt the cue-guided selection and sequencing of movements. Moreover, in interaction with striatal dopamine losses, impaired cortico-striatal processing of movement cues would be expected to enhance the detrimental impact of attentional distractors on movement sequences, as indicated by the capacity of such distractors to evoke freezing of gait (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Cowie et al., 2012</xref>) and movement errors and falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kucinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albin et al., 2022</xref>). We previously demonstrated the usefulness of the CTTT for modeling clinically relevant, attentional-motor deficiencies by showing that rats with combined cortical cholinergic and striatal dopaminergic losses and a propensity for falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kucinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Kucinski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kucinski and Sarter, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarter et al., 2021</xref>) exhibit deficits in cued turning, but not cued stopping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The present experiments also sought to demonstrate that variations in the individual capacity for voluntary, or top–down, attentional control influence the efficacy of cortico-striatal control of action selection. Successfully performing well-practiced, visual or auditory cued turns and stops requires sustaining attention to cue sources, the continued selection of cues as signified by the behavior evoked by cues, monitoring the state of the treadmill and action outcome, and maintaining cue modality-linked response rules in working memory. To reveal the impact of variations in such attentional capacities, we investigated rats that exhibit, as traits, opponent attentional biases. These rats are selected from outbred populations using a Pavlovian Conditioned Approach (PCA) test. Goal-trackers (GTs) orient to a Pavlovian reward cue, that is, they learn its predictive significance, but they do not approach and contact such a cue. In contrast, sign-trackers (STs) approach and contact such a cue, which has been interpreted as assigning incentive salience to a Pavlovian cue and attributed to cue-evoked mesolimbic dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Flagel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Flagel and Robinson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Iglesias et al., 2023</xref>). The relatively greater vulnerability of STs for addictive drug taking and relapse in the presence of Pavlovian drug cues has been extensively documented (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Saunders and Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Yager and Robinson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Yager and Robinson, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Goal- and sign-tracking index the presence of broader, opponent cognitive-motivational styles that are dominated by a bias toward deploying top–down (or goal-directed) and bottom–up (or stimulus-driven) processing of action cues, respectively (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sarter and Phillips, 2018</xref>; for evidence of the presence of these traits in humans see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Schad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Colaizzi et al., 2023</xref>). As such biases of GTs and STs were previously shown to be mediated in part via contrasting cholinergic capacities for the detection of cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Paolone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Koshy Cherian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pitchers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pitchers et al., 2017b</xref>), we hypothesized that contrasts in the cortico-striatal processing of movement cues contribute to the expression of these opponent biases. The main results from the present experiments indicate that GTs utilize turn cues more efficiently than STs and that in GTs, but not STs, cued turning is tightly controlled by prelimbic–DMS glutamate signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phenotype screening and distribution by sex and vendor</title><p>PCA-based screening generated five behavioral measures indicating the speed and frequency of contacting the lever (Pavlovian conditioned stimulus [CS]) versus the speed and frequency of head entries into the food port.

Because of the absence of significant effects of sex, and of interactions involving sex as a factor, in the analysis of baseline CTTT performance, subsequent statistical analyses, using linear-mixed effect models (LMMs) to account for effects of animals and variable numbers of transients recorded from each animal, did not further involve sex as a statistical variable.

For example, for maximum peak concentrations ≥4 µM, GTs were 1.24 times as likely as STs to turn. (2) Top curve, rhombi: the presence of a single turn cue-locked peak strongly increased the relative probability for GTs to turn (see Results). In conjunction with increasing amplitudes of these peaks (‘1 peak only ∪ ≥<italic>x</italic>’), these probabilities did further increase, reaching, for example, 1.73 for glutamate concentrations ≥4 µM. (3) Bottom curve, triangles: the presence of two or three turn cue-evoked peaks (no more than three turn cue-locked peaks were observed) significantly lowered the relative probability for a turn in GTs below 1 or, conversely, indicated that STs were more likely to turn as GTs. However, in conjunction with rising max amplitude threshold levels (‘2 and 3 peaks ∪ max peaks ≥<italic>x</italic>’), the relative probabilities of GTs to turn increased, so that at maximum peak concentrations of ≥6 µM glutamate, the proportions of turns and misses no longer differed significantly between the phenotypes.

This observation was substantiated by the finding that the slopes of the linear regressions of both curves (top and bottom curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>) were different from zero (both p &lt; 0.0001).</p><p>Together, these analyses of glutamate trace characteristics indicated that increasing maximum peak glutamate concentrations and the presence of a single, cue-evoked glutamate peak strongly increased the relative probability of GTs to execute a cued turn. Moreover, the combination of these two properties yielded significantly even higher relative turn probabilities in GTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In contrast, the presence of multiple glutamate peaks, GTs were significantly less likely than STs to turn although, when combined with higher (&lt;4 µM) maximum peak concentrations, turn proportions of the two phenotypes no longer differed significantly. These findings suggest fundamentally different turn cue-evoked glutamate release dynamics in GTs versus STs, perhaps involving separate afferent circuitry influencing the excitability of cortico-striatal glutamatergic terminals. Therefore, we predicted that inhibition of the cortico-striatal neurons affects turning rates and cued turn-evoked glutamate peaks primarily in GTs, consistent with prior evidence indicating their relative reliance on top–down, cortico-fugal systems to execute cued responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Inhibition of fronto-striatal projection disrupts cued turning and turn cue-evoked glutamate in GTs, but not STs</title><p>As described above, in GTs, cued turning was associated with tightly orchestrated single glutamate release events that were closely locked to the turn cue, comparable with attended cue-evoked cholinergic transients in cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Parikh et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Gritton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Howe et al., 2017</xref>), and therefore hypothesized to reflect cortico-striatal activation (see also Introduction). In contrast, in STs, the relatively more frequent occurrence of multiple glutamate release events and the presence of greater reward delivery-locked glutamate release may reflect a greater control of glutamate release by striatal interneuronal networks and striatal afferents originating from the midbrain, including dopaminergic projections traditionally linked to the processing of reward. Indeed, ascending projections to the striatum may influence, directly and via striatal interneurons, the excitability of glutamatergic terminals of cortico-striatal projections (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Tritsch and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Dautan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Moss et al., 2021</xref>). In STs, such ascending control of glutamate release by reward circuitry may have been responsible for relatively higher reward delivery-locked glutamate levels and for the less tightly organized glutamate dynamics during cued turns.

The results from our experiments support the following main conclusions. (1) Turn cue-evoked glutamate concentrations reached higher levels in GTs compared with STs. In contrast, glutamate concentrations during missed turns, cued stops, and locked to reward delivery, reached significantly higher levels in STs. (2) Turn cue-evoked glutamate peak concentrations, in conjunction with single spikes, nearly doubled the likelihood for a turn in GTs relative to STs.

STs preferably assign motivational significance to reward cues, with the result that they perceive such cues as rewarding, worth approaching and working for. In contrast, GTs are biased toward a (top–down) analysis of the behavioral utility of a reward or drug cue. Consistent with the interpretation of goal-tracking as indicating a bias for deploying top–down approaches, GTs were shown to be able to utilize complex occasion setters predicting the availability of cocaine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Saunders et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Pitchers et al., 2017b</xref>).

These findings complement prior evidence from experiments assessing the selection of cues for extended processing and behavioral control. GTs out-performed STs in tasks taxing the attentional detection of cues, in part by deploying goal-directed attentional mechanisms to detect cues and maintain stable task performance (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Paolone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kucinski et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Phillips and Sarter, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kucinski et al., 2022</xref>).

In the DMS, single high-amplitude glutamate transients from cortical afferents may recruit multiple populations of interneurons and striatal output neurons, thereby forming, for a precise period of time, fronto-striatal cell assemblies to force cue-associated action selection (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Hart et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Hart et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Oberto et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Cortico-striatal glutamatergic terminals are also recruited, directly and indirectly, via striatal interneurons and striatal dopaminergic afferents, thereby supporting bidirectional glutamatergic–dopaminergic interactions and allowing reward expectation and action outcome to influence the glutamatergic representation of movement cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bamford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agnoli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kosillo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cai and Ford, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Moss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chantranupong et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choi et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Krok et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Holly et al., 2024</xref>). Such striatal control of cortico-striatal terminals, primarily via cholinergic and dopaminergic heteroreceptors (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Lovinger et al., 2022</xref>), may preferentially yield suppression of action in STs. This view is consistent with several current findings and considerations. (1) Peak glutamate concentrations in STs were relatively higher during stops, irrespective of the validity of stops (false stops or stop cue-evoked stops). (2) The presence of multiple cue-locked glutamate peaks in STs (a second or third peak occurred on average 1.58 ± 0.39 s (<italic>M</italic>, SD) and 1.83 ± 0.25 s following the onset of the turn cue), may reflect relatively slow, reverberating interactions between striatal interneurons, dopamine signaling, and cortico-striatal glutamate release (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Dorst et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Frost Nylén et al., 2021</xref>). In GTs, the relatively rare presence of multiple peaks during turn cue periods may have interfered with cortico-striatal cue import and therefore reduced the efficacy of cued turning. (3) Inhibition of the prelimbic–DMS pathway impacted neither turn cue-locked glutamate release in STs nor cued stops or stop cue-locked glutamate release in either phenotype. (4) Reward delivery-locked peak glutamate concentrations were higher in STs than GTs. Thus, in STs, glutamatergic transients may be speculated to primarily signal the expectation of reward, and also the heightened perceptual value of a reward predicting cue (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pitchers et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Iglesias et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bernklau et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cai et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>The present results contribute to bio-behavioral conceptualizations of the impact of individual differences in the vulnerability for compulsive drug taking (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Volkow et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Robbins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marhe et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kilts et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">George and Koob, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pitchers et al., 2018</xref>).

Consistent with the view that striatal pathology contributes little to the explanation of individual, clinical severity of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Johansson et al., 2024</xref>), our findings predict a greater vulnerability of PD patients who preferentially utilize cortico-striatal mechanisms to process movement cues, that is, GTs, for cholinergic loss-associated impairments in cued movement control and for the propensity for falls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sarter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sarter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Albin et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, STs may generally be less efficient in executing cued movements, particularly in situations featuring complex and competing movement cues (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beaulne-Séguin and Nantel, 2016</xref>).

Briefly, a treadmill, 32.51 cm wide by 153.67 cm long, was constructed by modifying a 2200 Series Flat Belt End Drive Dorner conveyor (Dorner, WI). The conveyor belt surface material was polypropylene, friction-resistant, and easily cleaned with ethanol or soap. A Dorner Variable Speed Controller (Dorner, WI), with speeds ranging from 0 to 32 cm/s or 19.2 m/min, was used to operate the conveyor. Furthermore, the conveyor was enclosed by a Faraday cage (145.10 cm long, 32.51 cm wide, and 38.1 cm tall), grounded to block out static electric fields. Copper reward ports were installed on either end of the treadmill to allow delivery of 45 mg banana pellets. A 28 V DC, 100 mA stimulus light was approximately 2.54 cm in diameter with a flat lens and mounted on both sides lengthwise on the Faraday cage (MedAssociates, Inc, St. Albans, VT). A Mallory-SonAlert audible device, mounted in the center of the Faraday cage, was used to generate the auditory cue. This device emitted a continuous tone at 68 dBA sound pressure level, which is within the acceptable range for chronic presentations, to neither elicit a fearful response nor induce hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Turner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Castelhano-Carlos and Baumans, 2009</xref>).

Cued turns and cued stops were rewarded by manually delivering a banana-flavored sucrose pellet (45 mg; Bio-Serv) into the reward port. Cued turns and cued stops were rewarded at the port located in front of the rat following completion of the turn or the stop, respectively. Rats first underwent a treadmill acclimation regimen using a procedure adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold and Salvatore, 2014</xref>.

Rats walked at a speed of 9.6 cm/s and cues were presented for 2 s. The modality of the turn and stop cues was counterbalanced across animals. Maximally two successive presentations of a cue of the same modality were allowed. The ITI was 60 ± 45 s. The total number of trials per daily session was 18, with a maximum duration of a test session of 20 min. Upon reaching the performance criterion, after 2–3 weeks of training, defined as 70% correct responses to either cue for two consecutive days, rats were tested and videotaped for four additional days. Data from these four sessions were used to determine potential phenotype and sex-based differences in baseline performance. Thereafter, rats underwent surgery for chronic MEA implantation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>CTTT performance measures</title><p>The number of cued turns, missed turns, cued stops, and false turns were extracted from offline scoring of session videos. For a cued turn to be scored, the animal must have initiated a turn, defined by a rotation of the longitudinal orientation of the body of at least 90°, before the treadmill restart, that is, within 8 s of the cue onset. A stop was defined as a cessation of forward movement. For stops occurring before the treadmill stopped, rats would typically stop while positioned at the backend of the treadmill so that following a stop, the treadmill would transport them to the front of the treadmill (within the remaining 1–3 s until the treadmill stopped), without the rat contacting the front end of the test chamber. Following the treadmill stop and during the 5 s pause, a false turn was scored if the animal (falsely) turned. The time of initiation and completion of cued turns, relative to the onset of the cue, were extracted from session videos. For the analysis of baseline CTTT performance, and because rats generated a variable number of cued turns during the four sessions used for this analysis, individual turn onset and completion times were averaged across the test sessions. Additional performance measures were extracted from training and testing sessions to explore relationships between cued turning and stopping performance, phenotype and, subsequently, glutamatergic transients (detailed in Results).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Amperometric recordings of analysis of glutamate currents</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Electrode preparation and calibration</title><p>Extracellular glutamate concentrations were measured on electrode surfaces featuring immobilized glutamate oxidase and by performing fixed-potential amperometry to determine hydrogen peroxide concentrations resulting from catalyzed oxidation of glutamate.

The configuration consisted of a ceramic backbone probe (Quanteon LLC, Nicholasville, KY, USA) housing four recording sites, each 15 × 333 μm, crafted from platinum–iridium. These recording sites were grouped into two pairs, separated by 30 μm between each member of a pair and a 100-μm vertical spacing between the pairs, so that the two pairs of electrodes were linearly arranged along the shank of the probe. MEAs were modified for in vivo recordings in behaving rats by soldering four enamel-coated magnet wires (30 ga) to the terminals on the electrode panel and the other end to gold-pin connectors. Reference electrodes were constructed by soldering Ag/AgCl reference electrodes prepared from 0.008” silver wire (A-M Systems, Carlsberg, WA) to gold-pin connectors. The pins were then inserted into a 9-pin ABS plug (GS09PLG-220, Grinder Scientific) and adhered to the microelectrode with epoxy. Custom 9-pin ABS plugs were also printed with a STUDIO G2 3D printer (BigRep, Berlin, Germany). The top pair of electrodes, termed active sites, were coated with recombinant <sc>L</sc>-glutamate oxidase (US Biological Life Sciences) solution (1 U in 1 μl DiH<sub>2</sub>O), cross-linked with a bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde mixture, by manually applying microdroplets using a 1-μl Hamilton syringe. The lower pair of electrodes, termed sentinels, were coated with only the bovine serum albumin and glutaraldehyde mixture, to record currents unrelated to glutamate concentrations. After a minimum 24-hr incubation period to ensure optimal adherence of the enzyme layer, an exclusion layer composed of <italic>meta</italic>-(1,3)-phenylenediamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mitchell, 2004</xref>) was electroplated onto each recording site’s surface by 5 min application of 0.85 V versus a silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) reference electrode (Bioanalytical Systems). This exclusion layer prevents sensing electroactive interferents such as ascorbic acid (AA) and catecholamines (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Mitchell, 2004</xref>). After another 24-hr incubation period for the electrode sites to dry, recording sites were calibrated to determine the sensitivity for glutamate, selectivity for glutamate versus interferents, stability, and limit of detection of glutamate. Calibrations were conducted using a FAST-16 electrochemical system (Quanteon). A constant voltage of 0.7 V was applied versus an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and the system was placed in a heated 40 ml bath of 0.05 M PBS. Following a 30-min baseline recording, aliquots of stock solutions of AA (20 mM), glutamate (20 mM), and dopamine (2 mM) were added to the calibration beaker such that the final concentrations were 250 μM AA, 20, 40, and 60 μM glutamate, and 2 μM dopamine (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Wassum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Malvaez et al., 2015</xref>).

Ophthalmic ointment lubricated eyes. A craniotomy and durotomy using a bent 27-gauge needle for dura removal were performed above the right DMS (AP: +0.50 mm; ML: −2.20 mm from bregma). Three stainless steel screws were threaded into the cranium. The MEA was then lowered 4.5 mm dorsoventrally from the dura into the striatum. At the same time, an Ag/AgCl reference electrode was implanted at a remote site in the contralateral hemisphere. The microelectrode assembly was anchored with methyl methacrylate dental cement, and exposed regions of the skull were filled with a translucent, medium-viscosity silicone adhesive to minimize leakage of the dental cement onto the brain. Animals rested over a 48-hr recovery period before moving to the next phase of the experiment. Amperometric recordings were collected by connecting the head stages to a FAST-16 potentiostat/data electrochemical system (Quanteon) via a shielded cable and low-impedance commutator. The hydrogen peroxide by-product of glutamate oxidase-mediated catalyzation of the oxidative deamination of glutamate was electrochemically oxidized by applying 0.7 V versus the Ag/AgCl reference electrode and digitized at a sampling rate of 5 Hz.

Intracranial infusions of a Cre-dependent Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated Only by Designer Drug (DREADD) and a retrogradely transported Cre-expressing plasmid were carried out following PCA screening and prior to CTTT acquisition training. In a subset of rats, a second surgery, carried out following the acquisition of the CTTT, was conducted to implant MEAs into the DMS. The viral vectors containing the Cre-dependent plasmid pAAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry (AddGene #44362-AAV8; titer of 2.1 × 1013 GC/ml), Cre-dependent control plasmid pAAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (AddGene #50459-AAV8; titer of 2.2 × 1013 GC/ml), or the retrogradely transported Cre-expressing plasmid pENN-rAAV-hSyn-HI-eGFP-Cre-WPRE-SV40 (AddGene #105540-AAVrg; titer of 1.9 × 1013 GC/ml) were infused into the lower layers of the prelimbic cortex (for the anatomical organization of fronto-striatal projections see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>) and the DMS, respectively.</p><p>Craniotomies and durotomies were carefully performed above four sites of the DMS using a bent 27-gauge needle for dura removal to minimize the impact on the subsequent implantation of recording electrodes and electrochemical recordings. One μl of pENN-rAAV-hSyn-HI-eGFP-Cre-WPRE-SV40 vector was infused (bolus) into the DMS at two sites per hemisphere (AP: +0.2/1.2; ML: ±2.5/2.2; DV: −4.5 mm from dura) to retrogradely transfect afferent projections. In addition, 1 μl of AAV-hSyn-DIO-hM4D(Gi)-mCherry or AAV-hSyn-DIO-mCherry (control vector) was infused (bolus) into the prelimbic cortex (AP: +3.2; ML: ±0.7; DV: −3.5 mm from dura) to allow for the selective inhibition of cortico-striatal projections. The injector was left in place for 8 min to minimize diffusion into the injector tract. Rodents recovered for 1 week before treadmill and CTTT training.</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Clozapine <italic>N</italic>-oxide</title><p>CNO was obtained from Tocris Bioscience (Bristol, United Kingdom) and dissolved 10 mg/ml in 6% DMSO in 0.9% NaCl solution. CNO (5.0 mg/ml/kg; i.p.) or vehicle was administered i.p. 50 min before the onset of CTTT testing. In rats also equipped for electrochemical recording of DMS glutamate levels, CNO was given just prior to the onset of recording the pre-task baseline (above). Rats were given vehicle and CNO on alternate days. Regarding potential off-target effects of clozapine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Gomez et al., 2017</xref>), we and others have previously consistently failed to detect effects of this dose of CNO in rats expressing the control vector, including in rats performing the CTTT, complex movement control tasks, or an operant sustained attention task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Jendryka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kucinski et al., 2022</xref>). Given effective dose ranges of clozapine in rodents performing complex behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Martinez and Sarter, 2008</xref>), and given the proposed conversion rate of CNO to clozapine, an approximately 50- to 100-fold higher dose of clozapine would be required to produce significant effects on rodent behavior (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mahler and Aston-Jones, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lawson et al., 2023</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-2"><title>Visualization and quantification of GFP/mCherry-expressing neurons</title><p>We amplified the mCherry fluorescent reporter signal of the inhibitory hM4Di DREADD vector to enhance the evaluation of the transfection efficacy and distribution of neurons co-expressing mCherry and eGFP. The eGFP fluorescent label did not necessitate signal enhancement. Sections underwent six washes for 5 min each in 0.1 m PBS, pH 7.3, and then were immersed in 0.1% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS for 15 min. After three 5 min PBS rinses, sections incubated for 60 min at room temperature in the blocking solution, 1% normal donkey serum and 1% Triton X-100 made in PBS. Sections were incubated overnight in the primary antibody (rabbit anti-mCherry, ab167453, Abcam; 1:500; diluted in blocking solution to prevent non-specific binding). The next day, and following three 5 min PBS rinses, sections were incubated for 90 min at room temperature in the secondary antibody (donkey anti-rabbit conjugated to Alexa 594, PIA32754, Invitrogen, 1:500). Following three 5 min rinses with PBS and sections were mounted, air dried, and cover-slipped with Vectashield Antifade Mounting Medium (H-1000; Vector Laboratories).</p><p>A Zeiss LM 700 confocal microscope, equipped for sequential multi-track acquisition with 488- and 561-nm excitation lines, along with specific filter sets for Alexa 488 (Zeiss filter set 38 HE) and Alexa 594 (Zeiss filter set 54 HE), was employed for visualizing and capturing images of fluorescent neurons. Images were taken at magnifications of ×10 to confirm placements of infusions in the DMS, ×20 and ×40 at five anterior–posterior levels (frontal cortex: 3.0 and 3.24 mm, striatum: 1.2, 0.5, and 0.2 mm) for verification and documentation of single- and double-labeled cells in cortex and striatum.</p><p>We employed a modification of a prior, semi-quantitative estimation of transfection efficacy and space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avila et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, GFP labeling that was centered in the striatal target region of prelimbic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mailly et al., 2013</xref>) was assigned the highest transfection score (5), whereas labeling that extended into more lateral and ventral regions and only partially covered the target region were assigned lower scores. Likewise, mCherry labeling that exclusively covered the entire prelimbic cortex was assigned the highest score. Partial expression of mCherry in this region, or labeling that extended dorsally or ventrally beyond the prelimbic cortex, were assigned lower transfection efficacy scores. Furthermore, single-and double-labeled neurons were counted in the prelimbic region, and the proportion of double-labeled neurons was computed for each rat. Counting frames were superimposed on each subregion using the ImageJ multipoint tool. Cells were counted on two sections per brain, yielding four counts per brain and subregion. Averaged counts obtained from each brain and subregion were used for further analyses. To produce images of neurons expressing mCherry and GFP, and control for potential ‘bleed-through’ (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">North, 2006</xref>), we used the split view feature within Zen Black software (ZEN 2.31 SP1 Black Edition; Zeiss) for examination of individual channels with multi-track images. Tile scanning/stitching techniques were implemented at both ×10 (3 × 2 tiles, covering an area of 3455.94 by 2370.64 μm) and ×20 magnifications (4 × 3 tiles, covering an area of 1407.88 by 1135.31 μm).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Experimental design and statistical analyses</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Behavioral data</title><p>Chi-square tests were used to determine the effects of sex and the commercial source of rats (vendor) on the distribution of PCA scores. Baseline CTTT performance was analyzed using conventional repeated measures ANOVAs; associated graphs depict individual values, means, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Conventional ANOVAs were computed using SPSS for Windows (version 28.0; SPSS) and GraphPad Prism (version 10.1.2).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Glutamate concentrations and effects of CNO</title><p>Extracellular glutamate concentrations were sentinel-corrected, normalized to dopamine (if applicable), and pre-cue baseline corrected (see above for details). From these data, peak concentrations and the number of peaks were extracted (see above for the definition peaks). Given the complexity of the experimental design (variable number of rats per phenotype, turn and stop trials, and of cue-evoked glutamatergic transients), here we first determined potential phenotype-specific differences in glutamate peaks across trial types and response categories, followed, in cases, by post hoc analyses of event-related glutamate levels within individual phenotypes. LMMs with restricted maximum likelihood estimation were computed in SPSS for Windows (version 28.0; SPSS). A key reason for using LMMs concerned the definition of sample size (number of animals vs. the number of individual traces collected from each animal). Moreover, sample sizes may vary across repeated or otherwise dependent measures (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Schielzeth et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Yu et al., 2022</xref>). Data from repeated sessions were used to compute repeated fixed effects, and phenotype was used to determine between-subjects fixed effects, with a subject identifier random intercept. Separate LMMs were computed for the analysis of glutamate levels during cue periods followed by turns, missed turns, or cued stops, and locked to reward delivery. The covariance structures with the lowest Akaike’s information criterion were selected for each model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Verbeke and Molenberghs, 2009</xref>). Main effects of phenotype were followed up using Bonferroni’s method for pairwise comparison of the means. When LMMs reported significant interactions, repeated measures ANOVAs were used to compare data from repeated sessions, with Huynh–Feldt-corrected <italic>F</italic> values and corrected degrees of freedom applied in case of violation of the sphericity assumption. Data graphs showing LMM-analyzed glutamate concentrations depict individual values, estimated marginal means, and 95% CIs. Phenotypic frequencies of traces with one, two, or three peaks during cue periods were analyzed using Chi-squared tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Contingency table analyses</title><p>Glutamate trace characteristics were extracted from 548 recordings of turn cue trials, 364 of which yielded a turn (GTs: 206, STs: 158) and 184 a miss (GTs: 112, STs: 72). Contingent on threshold maximum peak concentrations, and the presence of a single or multiple cue-evoked glutamate peaks, the proportions of turns and misses were compared using contingency table analyses (p values were computed using Fisher’s exact test; GraphPad Prism). Furthermore, the relative probability for turns in GTs, as well as the reciprocal value, were derived from these analyses (Koopman asymptotic score; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Koopman, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Motulsky, 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-4"><title>Effects of CNO on CTTT performance</title><p>The effects of CNO or its vehicle on cued turns and stops, in rats expressing the inhibitory DREADD or the empty control vector, were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA (general linear model) on the effects of phenotype and treatment day. For clarity, effects on the two behavioral measures were analyzed separately, at alpha = 0.05/2.

They used a treadmill task in which cues indicated whether rats should turn or stop to receive a reward. They collected and analyzed several behavioral measures related to task performance with a focus on turns (performance, latency, duration) for which there are more measures than for stops. First, they established that goal-trackers perform better than sign-trackers in post-criterion turn performance (cued turns completed) and turn initiation. They used glutamate sensors to measure glutamate transmission in DMS. They performed analyses on glutamate traces that suggest phasic glutamate DMS dynamics to cues were primarily associated with successful turn performance and were more characteristic of goal-trackers (ie. rats with &quot;goal-directed&quot; attentional strategy). Smaller and more frequent DMS glutamate peaks were associated with other task events, cued misses (missed turns), cued stops, and reward delivery and were more characteristic of sign-trackers (i.e. rats with &quot;cue-driven&quot; attentional strategies). Consistent with the reported glutamate findings, chemogenetic inhibition of prelimbic-DMS glutamate transmission had an effect on goal-trackers' turn performance without affecting sign-trackers' performance in the treadmill task.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The power of the sign- and goal-tracking model to account for neurobiological and behavioral variability is critically important to the field's understanding of heterogeneity of the brain in health and disease.

Representative glutamate traces (n = 5 traces (out of hundreds of recorded traces)) are used to illustrate a central finding, while more conventional trial-averaged population activity traces are not presented or analyzed. The latter would provide much-needed support for the reported findings and conclusions. Digging deeper into the methods, results, and figure legends, provides some answers to the reader, but much can be done to clarify what each data point represents and, in particular, how each rat contributes to a reported finding (ie. single trial-averaged trace per session for multiple sessions, or dozens of single traces across multiple sessions).</p><p>Representative traces should in theory be consistent with population averages within phenotype, and if not, discussion of such inconsistencies would enrich the conclusions drawn from the study. In particular, population traces of the phasic cue response in GT may resemble the representative peak examples, while smaller irregular peaks of ST may be missed in a population average (averaged prolonged elevation) and could serve as a rationale for more sophisticated analyses of peak probability presented subsequently.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added two new Tables to clarify the number of rats per phenotype and sex used for each experiment described in the paper (Table 1), and the number of glutamate traces (range, median and total number) extracted for each analysis of performance-associated glutamate levels and the impact of CNO-mediated inhibition of fronto-striatal glutamate (Table 3).</p><p>As the timing of glutamate peaks varies between individual traces and subjects, relative to turn and stop cue onset or reward delivery, subject-and trial-averaged glutamate traces would “wash-out” the essential findings of phenotype- and task event-dependent patterns of glutamate peaks. In the detailed responses to the reviewers, we illustrate the results of an analysis of averaged traces to substantiate this view. Furthermore, as detailed in the section on statistical methods, and as mentioned by the reviewer under Strengths, we used advanced statistical methods to assure that data from individual animals contribute equally to the overall result, and to minimize the possibility that an inordinate number of trials obtained from just one or a couple of rats biased the overall analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall these studies are interesting and are of general relevance to a number of research questions in neurology and psychiatry.

It is sometimes difficult to interpret the glutamate results, as presented, in the context of specific behavior, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concerns about the complexity of some of the graphics, particularly the results from the arguably innovative analysis illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6 illustrates that the likelihood of a cued turn can be predicted based on single and combined glutamate peak characteristics. The revised legend for this figure provides additional information and examples to ease the readers’ access to this figure. In addition, as already mentioned above, we have added several graphs to further illustrate our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>(Recommendations for the authors)</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The differences in behavioral phenotype according to vendor (Figure 1c) are slightly concerning, could the authors please elaborate on why they believe this difference is? Are there any other differences in these stocks- i.e. weight, appearance, other types of behaviors?</p></disp-quote><p>Differences in PCA behavior across vendors or specific breeding colonies were documented previously and may reflect the impact of environmental, developmental and genetic factors (references added in the revised manuscript). We included animals from both vendors to increase phenotypic variability and due to animal procurement constraints during COVID-related restrictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Possibly related to the above, the rats in Figure 1a and Figure 2 are different strains. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised legend of Figure 2 we clarify that the rat shown in the photographs is a Long-Evans rat that was not part of the experiments described in this paper. This rat was used to generate these photos as the black-spotted fur provided better contrast against the white treadmill belt.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 3c, the pairwise comparison showing a significant increase from Day 1 to Day 3 is hard to understand unless this is a lasting change. Is this increase preserved at Day 4? Examination of either a linear trend across days or a simple comparison of either Day 1 &amp; 2 against Day 3 &amp; 4 or, minimally Day 1 against Day 4 would communicate this message. Otherwise, there doesn't seem to be much of a case for improvement across test sessions, which would also be fine in my view.</p></disp-quote><p>As the analysis of post-criterion performance also revealed an effect of DAY, we felt compelled to report and illustrate the results of pairwise comparisons in Fig. 3c. In agreement with the reviewer’s point, we did not further comment on this finding in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 4e. I find it extremely unlikely that every included electrode was located exactly at anterior 0.5mm. Please indicate the range - most anterior and most posterior of the included electrodes in the study.</p></disp-quote><p>The schematic section shown in Fig. 4e depicted that AP level of that section and collapsed all placements onto that level. As detailed in Methods, electrode placements needed to be within the following stereotaxic space: AP: -0.3 to 0.6 mm, ML: 2 to 2.5 mm, and DV: -4.2 to -5 mm (see Methods). To clarify this issue, the text in Results and the legend was modified and the 0.5 mm label was removed from Fig. 4e.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The paper generally is quite data light and there are a lot of extra results reported that aren't shown in the figures. There are 17 instances of the phrase &quot;not shown&quot;, some are certainly justified, but a lot of results are missing…</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and added several graphs. The revised Figure 5 includes the new graph 5d that shows the number of glutamate traces with just 1, 2 or 3 peaks occurring during cue presentation period. Likewise, the revised Figure 7 includes the new graph 7h that shows the number of glutamate traces with just 1, 2 or 3 peaks following the administration of CNO or its vehicle. In both cases, we also revised the analysis of peak number data, by counting the number of cases (or traces) with just 1, 2 or 3 peaks and using Chi-squared tests to determine the impact of phenotype and, in the latter case, of CNO. In addition, the revised Figure 7 now includes a graph showing the main effects of phenotype and CNO in reward delivery-locked glutamate maximum peak concentrations (Fig. 7k). In revising these sections, we also removed the prior statement about glutamate current rise times as this isolated observation had no impact on subsequent analyses or the discussion.</p><p>Concerning the reviewer’s point 5d (<italic>DMS eGFP transfection correlations</italic> Figure 8), the manuscript clarifies that the absence of such a correlation was expected given that eGFP expression in the DMS does not accurately reproduce the prelimbic-DMS projection space that was inhibited by CNO. In contrast, the correlations between the efficacy of CNO and DREADD expression measures in prelimbic cortex were significant and are graphed (Figs. 8g and 8j).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Please clarify the exact number of animals in each experiment. The caption of Figure 3 seems to suggest there are 29 GTs and 22 STs in the initial experiment, but the caption of Figure 5b seems to suggest there are N=30 total rats being analyzed (leaving 21 un-accounted for), or is this just the number of GTs (meaning there is one extra)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Table 1 to clarify the number of animals used across different experiments and stages. Additionally, we have included a new Table 3 that identifies, for each graph showing results from the analyses of glutamate concentrations, the number of rats from which recordings were obtained and the number of traces per rat (range, median, and total).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Relatedly, in Figures 5c-f and Figures 7g-i, the data seem to be analyzed by trial rather than subject-averaged, please clarify and what is the justification for this?</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed Experimental design and statistical analyses, we employed linear mixed-effects modeling to analyze the amperometric data that generated figures 5 and 7 to minimize the risk of bias due to an excessive number of trials obtained from specific rats. LMMs were chosen to analyze these repeated (non-independent) data to address issues that may be present with subject-averaged data. For clarity, throughout the results for these figures, the numerator in the F-ratio reflects the degrees of freedom from the fixed effects (phenotype/sex) and the denominator reflects the error term influenced by the number of subjects and the within-subject variance.</p><p>Concerning the illustration and analysis of trial- or subject-averaged glutamate traces please see reviewer 2, point 1 and the graph in that section. Within a response bin, such as the 2-s period following turn cues, glutamate peaks – as defined in Methods - occur at variable times relative to cue onset. Averaging traces over a population of rats or trials would “wash-out” the phenotype- and task event-dependent patterns of glutamate concentration peaks, yielding, for example, a single, nearly 2-s long plateau for cue-locked glutamate recordings from STs (see Figure 5b versus the graph shown in response to reviewer 2, point 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Likewise on page 22, the number of animals from which these trials were taken should be stated &quot;The characteristics of glutamate traces (maximum peak concentration, number of peaks, and time to peak) were extracted from 548 recordings of turn cue trials, 364 of which yielded a turn (GTs: 206, STs: 158) and 184 a miss (GTs: 112, STs: 72).&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of animals is now included in the text and listed in Table 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) The control group for Figure 7 given the mCherry fluorophore - given the known off-target effects of CNO, this is a very important control. Minimally, this data should be shown, but it is troubling that the ST group has n=2, I don't really understand how any sort of sensible stats can be conducted with a group this size, and obviously it's too small to find any significant differences if they were there.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed on p. 14-15 in the manuscript under the section <italic>Clozapine N-Oxide</italic>, the conversion rate of CNO to clozapine suggests that approximately 50-100 times the dose of clozapine (compared to our 5.0 mg/kg CNO dosage) would be required to produce effects on rodent behavior (references on p. 14-15).</p><p>Regarding evidence from control rats expressing the empty construct, the revised manuscript clarifies that no effects of CNO on cued turns were found in 5 GTs expressing the empty control vector. Although CNO had no effects in STs expressing the DREADD, we also tested the effects of CNO in 2 STs expressing the empty control vector (individual turn rates following vehicle and CNO are reported for these 2 STs). Moreover, we extracted turn cue-locked glutamate traces (vehicle: 18 traces; 16 CNO traces) from an empty vector-expressing GT and found that administration of CNO neither reduced maximum glutamate peak concentrations nor the proportion of traces with just one peak. The absence of effects of CNO on cued turning performance and on turn-cue locked glutamate dynamics are consistent with prior studies showing no effects of 5.0 mg/kg CNO in rats not expressing the DREADD vector (references in manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 8b - the green circle indicated by 1 is definitely not the DMS, this is the DLS, and animals with virus placement in this region should be excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer of course is correct and that exactly was the point of that illustration, as such a transfection space would have received the lowest possible rating (as indicated by the “1” in the green space). Fig. 8b was intended to illustrate expression efficacy ratings and does not indicate actual viral transfection spaces. Because the results described in the manuscript did not include data from a brain with a striatal transfection space as was illustrated in green in the original Fig. 8b, we removed that illustration of an off-target transfection space.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) Figure 8j, the correlation specifically counts double-labeled PL hM4Di + eGFP neurons. Separating dual-labeled cells from all mCherry-labeled cells seems very strange given the nature of the viral approach. There seems to be an assumption that there are some neurons that express the mCherry-hM4Di that don't also have the AAV-Cre (eGFP). Obviously, if that were true this poses a huge problem for your viral approach and would mean that you're inhibiting a non-selective population of neurons. More likely, the AAV-Cre (eGFP) is present in all of your mCherry-hM4Di cells, just not at levels visible without GFP antibody amplification. Ideally, staining should be done to show that all cells with mCherry also have eGFP, but minimally this correlation should include all cells expressing mCherry with the assumption that they must also have the AAV-Cre.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted on page 15 in the Visualization and Quantification of eGFP/mCherry-Expressing Neurons section, eGFP expression in our viral approach was notably bright and did not necessitate signal enhancement. Furthermore, given the topographic organization of prelimbic-DMS projections on the on hand, and the variable transfection spaces in cortex and striatum on the other hand, the speculation that AAV-Cre may have been present in all mCherry cells is without basis. Second, there certainly are mCherry-positive cells that do not also express the retrogradely transported AAV-Cre, and that therefore were not affected by CNO. Third, the entire point of this dual vector strategy was to selectively inhibit prelimbic-striatal projections, and the strong correlation between double-labeled neuron numbers and cued turn scores substantiates the usefulness of this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Discussion, a bit more interpretation of the results would be good. Specifically - does the PL-DMS inhibition convert GTs to STs? There were several instances where the behavior and glutamate signals seemed to be pushed to look like STs but also a lot of missing data so it is hard to say. One would assume this kind of thing if, as I think is being said (please clarify), the ST phenotype is being driven by glutamatergic drive either locally or from sources other than PL cell bodies, presumably silencing the PL cell body inputs in GTs also leaves other glutamatergic inputs as the primary sources?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that one could say, perhaps somewhat colloquially, that PL-DMS inhibition turns GTs to STs, in terms of turning performance and associated glutamate peak dynamics. The newly added data graphs are consistent with this notion. However, there are of course numerous other neurobiological characteristics which differ between GTs and STs and are revealed in the context of other behavioral or physiological functions. In the Discussion, and as noted by the reviewer, we discuss alternative sources of glutamatergic control in STs and the functional implications of bottom-up mechanisms. In the revised manuscript, we have updated references and made minor revisions to improve this perspective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) I found the abstract really detailed and very dense, it is pretty hard to understand in its current form for someone who hasn't yet read the paper.

Representative glutamate traces are used to illustrate a central finding, while more conventional trial-averaged population activity traces are not presented or analyzed. For example, n = 5 traces, out of hundreds of recorded traces, with each rat contributing 1-27 traces across multiple sessions suggests ~1-2% of the data are shown as time-resolved traces. Representative traces should in theory be consistent with population averages within phenotype, and if not, discussion of such inconsistencies would enrich the conclusions drawn from the study. In particular, population traces of the phasic cue response in GT may resemble the representative peak examples, while smaller irregular peaks of ST may be missed in a population average (averaged prolonged elevation in signal) and could serve as rationale for more sophisticated analyses of peak probability presented subsequently (and relevant to opening paragraph of discussion where hypothetical data rationale is presented).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the new Table 1 to provide a complete account of the number of rats, per phenotype and sex, for each component of the experiments. In addition, the new Table 3 provides the range, median and total number of glutamate traces that were analyzed and formed the foundation of the individual data graphs depicting the results of glutamate concentration analyses.</p><p>We chose not to present trial- or subject-averaged traces, as glutamate peaks occur at variable times relative to the onset of turn and stop cues and reward delivery, and therefore averaging across a population of rats or trials would obscure phenotype- and task event-dependent patterns of glutamate peaks. The attached graph serves to illustrate this issue. The graph shows turn cue-locked glutamate concentrations (M, SD) from trials that yielded turns, averaged over all traces used for the analysis of the data shown in Fig. 5d (see also Table 3, top row). Because of the variability of peak times, trial- and subject-averaging of traces from STs yielded a nearly 2-s long elevated plateau of glutamate concentrations (red triangles), contrasting with the presence single and multiple peaks in STs as illustrated in Figs. 5b and 5e. Furthermore, averaging of traces from GTs obscured the presence of primarily single turn cue-locked peaks. Because of the relatively large variances of averaged data points, again reflecting the variability of peak times, analysis of glutamate levels during the cue period did not indicate an effect of phenotype (F(1,190)=1.65, <italic>P</italic>=0.16). Together, subject- or trial-averaged traces would not convey the glutamate dynamics that form the essence of the amperometric findings obtained from our study. We recognize, as inferred by the reviewer, that smaller irregular peaks in STs may have been missed given the definition of a glutamate peak (see Methods). It is in part for that reason that we conducted a prospective analysis of the probability for turns given a combination of peak characteristics (maximum peak concentration and peak numbers; Fig. 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2)To this latter point, the relationship between the likelihood to turn and the size of glutamate peak is focused on the GT phenotype, which limits understanding of how smaller multiple peaks relate to variables of interest in ST (missed turns, stops, reward). If it were possible to determine the likelihood for each phenotype, without a direct contrast of one phenotype relative to the other, this would be a more straightforward description of how signal frequency and amplitude relate to relevant behaviors in each group. Depending on the results, this could be done in addition to or instead of the current analysis in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We considered the reviewer’s suggestion but could not see how attempts to analyze the role of maximum glutamate concentrations and number of peaks within a single phenotype would provide any significant insights beyond the current description of results. Moreover, as stressed in the 2nd paragraph of the Discussion (see Reviewer 1, point 24), the removal of the phenotype comparison would nearly completely abolish the relationships between glutamate dynamics and behavior from the current data set.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100988-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) If Figure 6 is kept, a point made in the text is that GT is 1.002x more likely than ST to turn at a given magnitude of Glu signal. 1.002 x more likely is easily (perhaps mistakenly) interpreted as nearly identical likelihood. Looking closely at the data, perhaps what is meant is @ &gt;4uM the difference between top-line labeled {b} and bottom-line labeled {d,e} is 1.002? If not, there may be a better way to describe the difference as 1x could be interpreted as the same/similar.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the potential for misinterpretation, the original manuscript stated (key phrase marked here in red font): Comparing the relative turn probabilities at maximum peak concentrations &gt;4 µM, GTs were 1.002 times more likely (or nearly exactly twice as likely) as STs to turn if the number of cue-evoked glutamate peaks was limited to one (rhombi in Fig. 6a) when compared to the presence of 2 or 3 peaks (triangles in Fig. 6a). However, we appreciate the reviewer’s concern about the complexity of this statement and, as it merely re-emphasized a result already described, it was deleted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) For Figure 7e, the phenotype x day interaction is reported, but posthocs are looking within phenotype (GT) at treatment effects. Is there a phenotype x day x treatment, or simply phenotype x treatment (day collapsed) to justify within-group treatment posthocs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the analysis and illustration of the data shown in Figs 7e and 7f, by averaging the test scores from the two tests, per animal, of the effects of vehicle and CNO, to be able to conduct a simpler 2-way analysis of the effects of phenotype and treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Ideally, viral control is included as a factor in this analysis as well. The separate analysis for viral controls was likely done due to low n, however negative findings from an ANOVA in which an n=2 (ST) should be interpreted with extreme caution. The authors already have treatment control (veh, CNO) and may consider dropping the viral controls completely due to the lack of power to perform appropriate analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue has been clarified – see reviewer 1, point 9.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor:</p><p>(1) In the task description, it could be clearer how reward delivery relates to turns and stops. For example, does the turn cue indicate the rat will be rewarded at the port behind it? Does the stop cue indicate that the rat will be rewarded at the port in front of it? This makes logical sense, but the current text does not describe the task in this way, instead focusing on what is the correct action (seemingly but unlikely independent of reinforcement).</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the task description in Methods and the legend of Figure 2 to indicate the location of reward delivery following turns and stops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For the peak analysis, what is the bin size for determining peaks? It is indicated that the value before and after the peak is &gt;1 SD below the peak value, so it is helpful to know the temporal bin resolution for this definition.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed on p 11-12 under Amperometry Data Processing and Analysis of Glutamate Peaks, we analyzed glutamate concentrations recorded at a frequency of 5 Hz (200 ms bins) throughout the 2-second-long presentation of turn and stop cues and for a 2-second period following reward delivery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Long Evans rats are pictured in Figure 2 (presumably contrast with a white background is better here), while SD rats are pictured in Figure 1. Perhaps stating why LE rats are pictured would help clear up any ambiguity about the strains used, as a quick look gives the impression two strains are used in two different tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, see reviewer 1, point 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In Figure 7e, the ST and GT difference in turns/turn cue does not seem to replicate prior findings for tracking differences for this measure (Figure 3b). ST from the chemogenetic cohort seems to perform better than rats whose behavior was examined prior to glutamate sensor insertion. What accounts for this difference? Training and testing conditions/parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. The absence of a significant difference between vehicle-treated GTs and vehicle-treated STs in Fig. 7e reflects a relatively lower turn rate in GTs than was seen in the analysis of baseline behavior (Fig. 3b; note the different ordinates of the two figures, needed to show the impact of CNO in Fig. 7e). Notably, the data in Fig. 7e are based on fewer rats (12 versus 29 GTs and 10 versus 22 STs; Table 1) and on rats which at this point had undergone additional surgeries to infuse the DREADD construct and implant electrode arrays. We can only speculate that these surgeries had greater detrimental effects in GTs, perhaps consistent with evidence suggesting that immune challenges trigger a relatively greater activation of their innate immune system (Carmen et al., 2023). We acknowledged this issue in the revised Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The authors are encouraged to revise for grammar (are vs. is, sentence ending with a preposition, &quot;not only&quot; clause standing alone) and word choice (i.e. in introduction: insert, import, auditorily).

There is one reference to a correlation analysis on collapsed data, but otherwise, no reporting of data overall rats without phenotype as a factor. If this is a main focus, including these analyses in the results would be warranted.

I think there are issues in data presentation/analysis that make it difficult to parse what exactly is happening in the glutamate signals, and when. Overall the paper is just a bit of a difficult read. A generally standard approach for showing neural recording data of many kinds, including, for example, subject-averaged traces, peri-event histograms, heatmaps, etc summarizing and quantifying the results - would be helpful. Beyond the examples in Figure 5, I would suggest including averaged traces of the glutamate signals and quantification of those traces.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these issues in multiple ways, see the response to several points of reviewers 1 and 2, particularly reviewer 2, point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 6 (and the description in the response letter) is also very non-intuitive. It's unclear how the examples shown relate to the reported significance indicators/labels/colors etc in the figure.

Again, drawing from standard visualization approaches for neural data could be one approach.</p></disp-quote><p>See also reviewer 2 points 1 and 3.
