parasite’s ability to autoinfect and, thereby, self-replicate within its host. Here, we investigated the role of the parasite’s nuclear receptor, <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12, in governing infection. We identified Δ7-DA as the endogenous <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand and elucidated the hormone’s biosynthetic pathway. Genetic loss of function of the ligand’s rate-limiting enzyme demonstrated that Δ7-DA synthesis is necessary for parasite reproduction, whereas its absence is required for the development of infectious larvae. Availability of the ligand permits <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 to function as an on/off switch governing autoinfection, making it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. In a preclinical model of hyperinfection, pharmacologic activation of DAF-12 suppressed autoinfection and markedly reduced lethality. Moreover, when Δ7-DA was administered with ivermectin, the current but limited drug of choice for treating strongyloidiasis, the combinatorial effects of the two drugs resulted in a near cure of the disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nematode parasitism</kwd><kwd><italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic></kwd><kwd>DAF-12</kwd><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>ivermectin</kwd><kwd>gerbil</kwd><kwd>cytochrome P450</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI105856</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lok</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name><name><surname>Kliewer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM141088</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI050886</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lok</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1275</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1558</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kliewer</surname><given-names>Steven A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-2010-20190330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Tian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of a nuclear receptor signaling pathway may cure the often-lethal disease caused by the endemic parasitic roundworm, <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Strongyloidiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by the nematode parasite, <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic>. It is estimated to infect ~600 million people worldwide and is endemic in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and parts of the Caribbean, southern United States and Europe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buonfrate et al., 2020</xref>). Because of the unique nature of its lifecycle, <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> infections are often life-long and up to 2.5% of these infections will progress to a hyperinfection syndrome that has a 90% mortality rate if untreated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milder et al., 1981</xref>). Notably, such hyperinfections are often caused by administering glucocorticoids to otherwise asymptomatic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milder et al., 1981</xref>). The lifecycle of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> is atypical of most soil-transmitted helminths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krolewiecki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lok, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Page et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Infective third-stage larvae (L3i) are developmentally quiescent and reside in fecal-contaminated soil until they contact the host and penetrate the skin, a process that reactivates their development as L3+ larvae. In the host, the activated L3+ immediately begin feeding, and typically migrate to the lungs, enter the alimentary canal, and transit to the intestine where the stage four larvae (L4) mature into parasitic (P)-adult females (there are no parasitic males). The P-adult females reproduce asexually and generate rhabditiform, noninfectious stage one larvae (L1) progeny that can enter two alternate lifecycle routes, one in the external environment and one in the host. Postparasitic L1 (PP-L1) enter the external environment by leaving the host with the feces. Under conditions that mimic the host intestine (e.g., 37°C), most PP-L1 develop as females directly into infectious filariform L3i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>). However, under favorable conditions (e.g., 22 °C, high humidity) the majority of PP-L1 undergo a developmental switch and become free-living (FL) male and female larvae that eventually mature into FL-adults, which are morphologically distinct from parasitic females and feed on soil microbes. The FL-adults mate and produce post-free-living (PFL) larvae that are exclusively female and now definitively committed to become infective L3i larvae.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lifecycle of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>.</title><p>Similar to other nematodes, <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> hatch from eggs and undergo four larval (L) molts to become adults, either in the environment or in the host. The parasite has two infectious stages (highlighted in yellow), one that exists in the environment as L3i and one that exists in the mucosa of the host intestine as an autoinfective L3a. In the postparasitic (PP) environment, larvae can undergo two developmental fates. Under host-like temperature conditions, the PP-larvae arrest their development directly as infectious third-stage larvae. However, under more temperate conditions, the postparasitic L1 (PP-L1) develop through one free-living (FL) generation (green arrows), followed by a post-free-living (PFL) generation (red arrows) that invariably arrests as L3i. Pharmacologically activating the nuclear receptor DAF-12 has been shown to prevent L3i arrest in the PFL generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In this study, we characterized the role of the endogenous DAF-12 ligand at each of these developmental stages. See text for details.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-73535-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In addition to the conditions that produce L3i outside of the host, <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> has the ability to remain in the host and undergo continuous autoinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This is due to the presence of L1 larvae that develop directly into autoinfective third-stage larvae (L3a) within the intestine. Similar to their L3i counterparts, L3a infect the host, in this case by penetrating the intestinal wall and entering parenteral tissues as activated L3+ to complete the parasitic lifecycle. Autoinfection is unique to <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> and allows the parasite to persist in the host for decades as a latent, often asymptomatic infection. However, under certain host conditions such as immunosuppression by glucocorticoids, the autoinfection spirals out of control, dramatically increasing the parasite burden. The resulting hyperinfection leads to a breakdown of the intestinal mucosal barrier and dissemination of invasive larvae throughout the body accompanied by bacterial infection leading to sepsis that is responsible for the high mortality. The current treatment of choice is the nematode-selective chloride channel activator ivermectin, which is effective at controlling acute infections, but is limited by its inability to eradicate the persistent autoinfective larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krolewiecki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Repetto et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps for this reason, the efficacy of ivermectin in preventing fatality due to the hyperinfection and disseminated forms of the disease is as low as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonfrate et al., 2013</xref>), and cases of ivermectin resistance are now being reported in other nematode parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Prichard, 2007</xref>). The current increased prevalence of strongyloidiasis has stimulated efforts to include increased dosing of ivermectin through mass drug administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bisoffi et al., 2013</xref>), which in the long-term could accelerate ivermectin resistance in <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>. Of further immediate concern, the risk of hyperinfection has risen dramatically with the use of glucocorticoids to treat inflammatory diseases, particularly SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moloo, 2020</xref>). For these reasons, there is an urgent need to develop new therapeutic strategies for treating strongyloidiasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Krolewiecki et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moloo, 2020</xref>).</p><p>The lifecycle of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> has similarities to the free-living nematode, <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The developmentally arrested L3i stage of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> is analogous to the L3 dauer (d) stage of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, L3d development is governed by DAF-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antebi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antebi et al., 2000</xref>), a nematode-specific nuclear receptor that is conserved in parasitic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayoade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motola et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In favorable environments, developing larvae synthesize the endogenous <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<italic>Ce</italic>)-DAF-12 ligands called dafachronic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahanti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motola et al., 2006</xref>). The most potent and abundant of these ligands is Δ7-dafachronic acid (Δ7-DA), which induces a transcriptional program that governs metabolism and reproductive growth to mature adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bethke et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hammell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). The final and rate-limiting step of Δ7-DA synthesis is catalyzed by DAF-9, a cytochrome P450 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gerisch and Antebi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jia et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Motola et al., 2006</xref>). In unfavorable environments, Δ7-DA is not produced and unliganded <italic>Ce</italic>-DAF-12 functions as a transcriptional repressor that arrests growth as L3d larvae in a process known as dauer diapause. When favorable conditions return, Δ7-DA synthesis resumes, DAF-12 is transcriptionally active, and worms exit L3 dauer and continue reproductive development. Our previous work demonstrated a similar requirement for the transactivation of the orthologous <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (<italic>Ss</italic>)-DAF-12 receptor in governing L3i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and the essentiality of the receptor in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2021</xref>). Although the endogenous <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand was unknown, we demonstrated that pharmacologic administration of Δ7-DA to PP-L1 or PFL-L1 larvae commits them to FL reproductive development, even under conditions that would normally commit them to become L3i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), and institutes a transcriptomic profile in L3i similar to L3+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoltzfus et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, knockout of <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 prevents the formation of L3i larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2021</xref>), and in a mouse model of hyperinfection, exogenous Δ7-DA treatment lowers the worm burden in the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patton et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite these findings, an understanding of the DAF-12 signaling pathway during parasitism and importantly whether targeting the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 receptor is a viable, curative strategy for treating strongylodiasis is lacking. In this report, we identified the endogenous <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand, characterized its biosynthetic pathway, and demonstrated how its regulation governs the parasite’s lifecycle. Finally, using a relevant preclinical animal model, we show that pharmacological activation of <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 overcomes the deficiencies of ivermectin, and that when used in combination with ivermectin, provides a combinatorial therapeutic response that may be curative.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Δ7-DA is the endogenous ligand for DAF-12 in <italic>S. stercoralis</italic></title><p>Our previous work had demonstrated Δ7-DA is able to bind and activate <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). However, whether Δ7-DA or a related molecule is the endogenous <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> ligand is unknown. Indeed, the finding that the ligand binding pocket of <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 is divergent from that of <italic>Ce</italic>-DAF-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>) and the observation that <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> lacks an obvious ortholog of DAF-9 (the only known DA-synthesizing enzyme found in <italic>C. elegans</italic>) suggested that the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand would likewise be divergent. To determine the identity of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> DAF-12 ligands, we employed an unbiased, activity-based biochemical purification strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To evaluate the phenotype due to loss of <italic>Ss-</italic>CYP22a9, we assayed cGMP-induced feeding behavior in L3i, which as noted above is an early marker of the transition to reproductive development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lok, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stoltzfus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Viney and Lok, 2015</xref>). In both wild-type larvae and CRISPR-control larvae in which a gene unrelated to development (<italic>Ss_unc-22</italic>) was targeted, 8-Br-cGMP strongly induced the feeding behavior as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>Ss-cyp22a9</italic> knockout larvae, cGMP-induced feeding behavior was severely impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The residual cGMP-induced response is likely due to the presence of an incomplete penetrance of the knockout in all worms.

To confirm the enzymatic function of <italic>Ss-</italic>CYP22a9, we also analyzed the production of Δ7-DA in <italic>Ss-cyp22a9</italic> knockout L3i larvae.

However, when the host is immune suppressed and the intestinal barrier is compromised, autoinfection accelerates out of control as more and more L3a worms invade the host, leading to a lethal hyperinfection. The results above suggested that targeting the DAF-12 pathway might provide a novel therapeutic opportunity for treating this disease. This strategy is based on the idea that like their L3i counterparts in the environment, the lack of Δ7-DA is required for intestinal larvae to become infectious L3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, we postulated that pharmacological activation of DAF-12 in intestinal larvae should block autoinfection by preventing the formation of filariform L3a larvae as it does with L3i in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). We first asked whether Δ7-DA can successfully treat the uncomplicated, latent form of the disease. To that end, we employed a well-established gerbil model that mimics both uncomplicated and hyperinfective strongyloidiasis found in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kerlin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nolan et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>For the uncomplicated model, we infected gerbils with 1000 L3i and after 21 days began administering vehicle or Δ7-DA orally in their drinking water, which delivers the compound directly into the gut where the intestinal larvae reside. We then monitored the parasite burden of the intestine by counting the number of fecal larvae. Compared to vehicle, treatment with Δ7-DA for 14 days dramatically reduced fecal larval output by ~90% (312 ± 103 larvae per gram feces for vehicle vs 32 ± 6 for DA, <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, the numbers of parasitic adults, which produce intestinal larvae, were not significantly changed by Δ7-DA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Because of the time-frame of this experiment and the fact that autoinfection is minimal in the uncomplicated model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nolan et al., 1993</xref>), reinfection of the host by L3a larvae is negligible, demonstrating that these adult parasites were derived from the L3i of the initial infection. This explains why the numbers of adults (in contrast to the intestinal larvae) were not substantially reduced by Δ7-DA treatment. These results are also consistent with our observation that intestinal larvae lack Δ7-DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which is essential for L3a development, thereby supporting the hypothesis that Δ7-DA specifically targets the intestinal larval stages of the lifecycle. We conclude that Δ7-DA treatment impedes the development of intestinal larvae and thus blocks transmission in uncomplicated infections where conventional treatments are only partially effective.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Δ7-DA suppresses output of fecal larvae in latent, uncomplicated strongyloidiasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Δ7-DA treatment reduces fecal larvae by &gt;90% in gerbils infected with <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>.

For this experiment, beginning at the time of infection with L3i, gerbils were administered the glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone, on a weekly basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nolan et al., 1993</xref>). Similar to what is observed in immunocompromised humans, this results in the rapid progression of disease to a disseminated hyperinfection that is lethal to all of the animals, with &gt;90% of them dying within 40 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, black line). In contrast, when a matched group of these animals was treated with Δ7-DA starting at 10 days after the hyperinfection was initiated, there was an impressive 70% survival rate that lasted for at least 90 days at which point we arbitrarily terminated the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, blue line). Autopsies of these animals showed that hyperinfection resulted in a massive increase in the number of viable intestinal parasites (&gt;10<sup>4</sup>) in vehicle-treated gerbils, which was reduced substantially in Δ7-DA-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-D</xref>). Notably, the number of autoinfected L3+ larvae in parenteral tissues, which drive the resulting pathogenesis, was reduced by 90% (and in some cases was undetectable) in Δ7-DA-treated animals compared to vehicle-treated animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These results are consistent with what was observed in the uncomplicated infection and supports the conclusion that Δ7-DA treatment impedes the development of L3a. Compared to vehicle-treated gerbils with uncomplicated infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), we observed a &gt;10-fold increase in adult parasites in hyperinfected vehicle-treated gerbils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). However, unlike in the uncomplicated infection, there was a significant decrease in adult parasites in the Δ7-DA-treated gerbils that had a hyperinfection (50% vs. the vehicle treated, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). This difference is because in a hyperinfection the parasitic adults are largely derived from the expanding L3a population, whereas in an uncomplicated infection the number of adults that were present matured directly from the L3i larvae used for the initial infection.

However, in hyperinfected patients ivermectin treatment is only 50–60% effective at preventing death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonfrate et al., 2013</xref>). This high mortality is due in part to the relatively low efficacy of ivermectin at killing the persistent autoinfective L3a larvae. Given that Δ7-DA specifically targets the L3a population, we hypothesized that the combination of Δ7-DA and ivermectin would act cooperatively to treat a strongyloidiasis hyperinfection. To test this, we first established an ivermectin treatment model in hyperinfected gerbils that mimics the efficacy observed in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this model, 300 μg/kg ivermectin delivered i.p. acutely cleared fecal larva output in ~40% of the hyperinfected gerbils within 7 days, resulting in ~25% survival rate for at least 90 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, red line). As expected, ivermectin was as effective as Δ7-DA in removing adult parasites from animals undergoing hyperinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), but in contrast to Δ7-DA, ivermectin was ineffective at decreasing either the intestinal or L3+ larval populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>). Next, we treated hyperinfected gerbils with both Δ7-DA and ivermectin. We found that the combination of both agents improved the survival rate significantly over either agent alone (&gt;75%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and reduced the parasite burden of all life stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>).

In contrast, when treated with ivermectin or Δ7-DA alone, ≤10% were parasite-free even among those animals that survived (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

The difficulty in treating the disease arises from a persistent autoinfection in which L3a are produced and continuously reinfect the host. Consequently, the parasite burden can become uncontrollably large when the immune system is compromised, leading to frequent lethality. Our previous studies have suggested one potential target of interest is the nuclear receptor, DAF-12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), which is required for the transition into and out of the L3i stage of the parasite’s lifecycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2021</xref>). Here, we addressed two key unanswered questions: what is the nature and role of the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand, and is targeting the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 pathway a viable therapeutic strategy? In this report, we identified Δ7-DA as the endogenous ligand of <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 and showed that the regulation of its biosynthesis is a requirement for both reproductive growth and the development of infectious stage larvae. Similar to the free-living nematode, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we found the presence of Δ7-DA is a requisite feature for <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> FL and parasitic larvae to mature into reproductive adults. In contrast, we discovered Δ7-DA is absent during the formation of L3a. Thus, like the analogous development of L3i in the environment, unliganded DAF-12 appears to be required for L3a formation in hosts. Taken together, these findings revealed a vulnerability in the lifecycle of <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> and suggested two new therapeutic strategies: either blocking the synthesis of the ligand to prevent reproductive development or precociously activating DAF-12 in the intestine to prevent autoinfection.</p><p>To that end, we showed that knocking out the Δ7-DA biosynthetic enzyme prevents the initiation of reproductive development. Concomitantly, when gerbils infected with <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> were treated with Δ7-DA, the development of L3a was severely impaired, thereby suppressing the parasite’s autoinfection cycle in both uncomplicated and hyperinfection forms of strongyloidiasis. Strikingly, when Δ7-DA was combined with the front-line medication, ivermectin, there was a near complete remission of the hyperinfection that resulted in a substantial increase in survival (from 25% with ivermectin alone to 75% with the combination treatment). Notably, in all of the surviving animals receiving both Δ7-DA and ivermectin, no parasites from any stage were detected anywhere in the body, suggesting that the cotreatment resulted in a complete cure.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Advantages of DAF-12 as a therapeutic target</title><p>The synergistic response of Δ7-DA and ivermectin highlights the unique potential of targeting the DAF-12 signaling pathway and overcoming the limitations of using ivermectin alone. Mortality rates in ivermectin-treated patients with hyperinfection range as high as 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonfrate et al., 2013</xref>). As an inhibitor of muscular function, ivermectin is highly effective at killing adults and feeding larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Repetto et al., 2018</xref>), but less effective at killing the developmentally quiescent L3a larvae that continuously drive autoinfection. In contrast, Δ7-DA directly interferes with infectious L3a larval development by binding to unliganded DAF-12 and provoking an inappropriate developmental response inside the host that results in death of the larvae. In this way, the two drugs complement each other by targeting different stages of the lifecycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Targeting the ligand binding properties of DAF-12 has other distinct advantages in that this nuclear receptor is nematode specific and mutants resistant to pharmacologic ligands are unlikely to develop, since such mutants would be expected to disrupt the endogenous function of the receptor and otherwise be lethal.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The conundrum of Δ7-DA as the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand</title><p>An intriguing aspect of this study was the finding that Δ7-DA is the endogenous ligand for <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12. Although Δ7-DA was first identified as the endogenous DAF-12 ligand in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, its presence in <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> was unexpected.

The sequences of other regulatory proteins in the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 pathway also have diverged. For example, the cytochrome P450 (<italic>Ss-</italic>CYP22a9) that catalyzes the synthesis of Δ7-DA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the ligand-dependent coactivator that <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 requires for transactivation (<italic>Ss-</italic>DIP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cheong et al., 2021</xref>) are both unique to <italic>Strongyloides</italic> spp.</p><p>In spite of these differences, several lines of evidence indicate that Δ7-DA is the major, if not exclusive, DAF-12 ligand in <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>. First, no other ligand activities, including other types of dafachronic acids were detected. Second, the endogenous concentration of Δ7-DA in <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> (~200 nM) is sufficient to drive full activation of <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12, leaving other potential DAF-12 ligands redundant if they do exist. Finally, knocking out the <italic>daf-9</italic> homolog, <italic>Ss-cyp22a9</italic>, which is required to synthesize Δ7-DA, prevents DAF-12-dependent activity in vivo, and that activity is rescued completely by adding back the ligand. Interestingly, Δ7-DA has been shown to activate DAF-12 homologs in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayoade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

However, the observation that liganded DAF-12 also is required at a completely different but essential stage of the lifecycle to promote reproductive growth raises the possibility of also targeting DAF-12 with an antagonist. Given that DAF-12 has been found in all nematode species surveyed to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ayoade et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Long et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ma et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), antagonizing the receptor would be expected to prevent development of adult worms in all parasitic species, offering a unique, broad-spectrum approach for treating most, if not all, nematode parasitisms.</p><p>In addition to targeting the receptor, the identification of <italic>Ss-</italic>CYP22a9 as the Δ7-DA-synthesizing enzyme that is required for reproductive development reveals the potential of developing an enzyme inhibitor. Such an inhibitor would prevent synthesis of the endogenous ligand and thus the requisite activation of DAF-12 for reproductive growth. Indeed, the finding that the broad-spectrum CYP-inhibitor, ketoconazole, was effective at blocking Δ7-DA synthesis in the present study and was shown previously to block developmental activation of cultured L3i (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albarqi et al., 2016</xref>) supports this strategy.

Typical of most endogenous steroid receptor ligands, Δ7-DA has a short half-life and relatively poor pharmacokinetic properties in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patton et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, in our study we administered Δ7-DA continuously in the drinking water over many days. Although overcoming this limitation would be important for developing a suitable therapeutic modality, this is not an unrealistic goal. Encouragingly, in the case of all other nuclear receptors this limitation has been circumvented through the design of potent, long-lasting receptor agonists and antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Another limitation of this study is that we only tested single doses of Δ7-DA and ivermectin. However, we note that optimizing the dose regimens are likely to reveal even greater cooperative effects. Finally, we have not definitively ruled out the existence of other endogenous DAF-12 ligands. While the findings that Δ7-DA is the only ligand we detected and is present only at the times when DAF-12 would be expected to be an activator are consistent with the conclusion that Δ7-DA is the relevant ligand, it is feasible that other activities exist that were not identified in our purification scheme.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, in this work we identified the endogenous DAF-12 ligand in the human parasitic nematode <italic>S. stercoralis</italic>, characterized the ligand’s biosynthesis pathway, and demonstrated that activating DAF-12 can overcome the limitation of the front-line drug, ivermectin, and significantly improve the outcome of strongyloidiasis in a preclinical model of hyperinfection.

To obtain L3+, gerbils infected with 10,000 L3i larvae were sacrificed 3-day postinfection. After removing the intestinal tract, parenteral tissues were minced and L3+ were collected by the Baermann technique at 37°C. To collect P-adults, intestinal L1–L3, and L3a, gerbils were hyperinfected by an initial inoculation of 4000 L3i and administration of 2 mg MPA, followed by weekly injections of 2 mg MPA for 4 weeks. After sacrificing the gerbils, P-females and intestinal larval stages were collected by hanging the small and large intestines in cylinders filled with saline water supplemented with 0.5 mg/ml gentamicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at 37°C, which allows the parasites to migrate out of the tissues and settle down at bottom of the cylinders. The parasites were then collected and purified by manually removing each stage under a dissection scope. Collected parasites were then washed five times with M9 buffer containing an antibiotic cocktail containing 100 units penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA), and 50 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and stored in −80°C for lipid extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Lipid fractionation and ligand identification</title><p>Endogenous DAF-12 ligands were purified from the lipid fractions of PP-L3 as outlined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The cells were split into 384-well plates and treated with 10 nM Δ7-DA or the HPLC fractions. After 24 hr, Nanoluc and firefly luciferase activities were measured by Nano-Glo Dual-luciferase kits (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Victor V plate reader (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Relative light units (RLUs) were then calculated by normalizing the Nanoluc luciferase activity to the firefly luciferase activity.</p><p>To characterize the chemical identity of the <italic>Ss-</italic>DAF-12 ligand, isolated HPLC fractions were subjected to ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem with mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS) using a Shimadzu LC instrument (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments, Inc, Columbia, MD) in tandem with a Sciex 6500 Triple Quad mass spectrometer (AB Sciex LLC, Framingham, MA). The HPLC fractions were diluted in methanol containing 100 nM chenodeoxycholic acid-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub> (d4-CDCA, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) as an internal control of retention times (RTs) between different runs.

The substrate compounds for DAF-36, DHS-16 and CYPs were cholesterol-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>7</sub>, lathosterol-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>7</sub> (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc, Alabaster, AL), and lathosterone (Steraloids, Inc, Newport, RI), respectively. Lipids were then extracted from microsomes (for DAF-36s and DHS-16s) or Sf9 cells (for CYPs) by the Folch method and loaded onto a C18 column (Kinetex 1.3 µm C18 100 Å, LC Column 50 × 2.1 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) at a 0.4 ml/min flow rate. The mobile phase consisted of (A) water:acetonitrile (9:1) and (B) acetonitrile:water (99:1), both containing 2 mM NH4Ac. For measuring the activities of the DAF-36 and DHS-16 homologs, the following gradient was run for a total of 8 min: 80–99% (B) for 0–2 min; 99% (B) for 2–8 min. Enzyme products were detected in positive MRM mode with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> transition 374 → 109 (7-dehydrocholesterol-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>7</sub>) and 392 → 109 (lathosterone-<sup>2</sup>H<sub>7</sub>).

The F1 progenies from these matings were collected after 7-day fecal culture at 25°C with the Baermann technique. The GFP-positive L3i larvae from the F1 progenies were manually picked and treated with 0.5 mM 8-Br-cGMP or 1 μM Δ7-DA in M9 buffer at 37°C for 22 hr.

For uncomplicated strongyloidiasis, gerbils were subcutaneously injected with 1000 L3i <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> larvae. On day 21 post the infection, the gerbils were switched to drinking water containing 5% sucrose (vehicle) or 50 μM Δ7-DA in 5% sucrose. We have found that adding a small amount of sucrose does not affect infection, but ensures animals drink appropriate amounts of drug. Fecal larval numbers were monitored biweekly for the next 14 days. To establish hyperinfection, gerbils were infected similarly but MPA (2 mg/gerbil) was injected subcutaneously weekly from the time of infection. After 10-day postinfection to allow time for the hyperinfection to occur, Δ7-DA treatment was begun as noted above. Ivermectin (Merial Limited, Duluth, GA) was intraperitoneally injected at 300 µg/kg on day 21 postinfection. Since Δ7-DA is rapidly turned over in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patton et al., 2018</xref>), administering it at an earlier time point ensured an adequate amount was delivered. Animals were observed daily for irreversible hyperinfection symptoms that indicate imminent lethality, which include lethargy, hunched back, scruffy hair, lack of activity, and reduced drinking. Animals with such symptoms were sacrificed and autopsy performed to determine end-point parasite numbers as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Parasite burden analysis</title><p>Parasite numbers in gerbils were determined as described with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lok, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nolan et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stoltzfus et al., 2012</xref>). For fecal larvae outputs, infected gerbils were housed in wire bottom cages with a layer of dampened paper towel for 8 hr. Feces (15–20 droppings) were collected and macerated in 0.9% NaCl. The fecal suspension was then filtered through a layer of cheese cloth and an aliquot of the suspension was spotted on NGM plates. After drying, plates were incubated at 37°C for 10 min and living larvae, which leave traces on the plates, were counted and normalized to the feces weight as larvae per gram feces. To determine end-point parasite burden, intestines were cut longitudinally and incubated in 0.9% NaCl supplemented with an antibiotic cocktail (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml gentamicin) at 37°C for 2–3 hr. The suspension was then filtered through a layer of cheese cloth and an aliquot of the suspension was spotted on NGM plates. Following drying and 10 min incubation at 37°C, parasitic adults and intestinal L1–L3a larvae were counted. To determine parasite burden of hyperinfected L3+, parenteral tissues were dissected, minced and larvae collected by the Baermann method were counted on watch glasses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Data were plotted and analyzed by the indicated statistical tests using GraphPad Prism 8 software to obtain p values.

The experiments are insightfully and expertly conceived, designed and executed, and the data support the conclusions. This manuscript will be of general interest to parasitologists, nematode biologists, and those studying transcriptional regulatory networks governed by ligand-gated nuclear receptors.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73535.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Newmark</surname><given-names>Phillip A</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Morgridge Institute for Research</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Zamanian</surname><given-names>Mostafa</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution>University of Wisconsin</institution><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Yamamoto</surname><given-names>Keith</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.09.07.459359">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.07.459359v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

This was also already stated in the first paragraph of the Discussion (lines 342-343). In addition, we note that the present study also demonstrates this requirement by showing that the absence of the DAF-12 ligand (and thus unliganded <italic>Ss</italic>-DAF-12) is necessary for L3i formation and the presence of the ligand is necessary and sufficient for reactivation of L3i arrest and reproductive development.</p></body></sub-article></article>
