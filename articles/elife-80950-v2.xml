subunits is unknown. With 5-week-old male C57BL/6J <italic>Gria3</italic>-knockout mice (i.e., subunit GluA3<sup>KO</sup>) we determined cochlear function, synapse ultrastructure, and AMPAR molecular anatomy at ribbon synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons. GluA3<sup>KO</sup> and wild-type (GluA3<sup>WT</sup>) mice reared in ambient sound pressure level (SPL) of 55–75 dB had similar auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, wave-1 amplitudes, and latencies. Postsynaptic densities (PSDs), presynaptic ribbons, and synaptic vesicle sizes were all larger on the modiolar side of the IHCs from GluA3<sup>WT</sup>, but not GluA3<sup>KO</sup>, demonstrating GluA3 is required for modiolar–pillar synapse differentiation. Presynaptic ribbons juxtaposed with postsynaptic GluA2/4 subunits were similar in quantity, however, lone ribbons were more frequent in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> and GluA2-lacking synapses were observed only in GluA3<sup>KO</sup>. GluA2 and GluA4 immunofluorescence volumes were smaller on the pillar side than the modiolar side in GluA3<sup>KO</sup>, despite increased pillar-side PSD size. Overall, the fluorescent puncta volumes of GluA2 and GluA4 were smaller in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> than GluA3<sup>WT</sup>. However, GluA3<sup>KO</sup> contained less GluA2 and greater GluA4 immunofluorescence intensity relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup> (threefold greater mean GluA4:GluA2 ratio). Thus, GluA3 is essential in development, as germline disruption of <italic>Gria3</italic> caused anatomical synapse pathology before cochlear output became symptomatic by ABR. We propose the hearing loss in older male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice results from progressive synaptopathy evident in 5-week-old mice as decreased abundance of GluA2 subunits and an increase in GluA2-lacking, GluA4-monomeric Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd><kwd>inner hair cells</kwd><kwd>confocal imaging</kwd><kwd>3D reconstructions</kwd><kwd>qRT-PCR</kwd><kwd>immunolabeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC013048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rubio</surname><given-names>Maria Eulalia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DC14712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rutherford</surname><given-names>Mark A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ultrastructural and imaging studies of cochlear ribbon synapses demonstrate cis- and trans-synaptic molecular and structural effects in the absence of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA3 during mouse development in ambient sound levels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the cochlea and ascending central auditory system, hearing relies on fast excitatory synaptic transmission via unique α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Raman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ruel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gardner et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glowatzki and Fuchs, 2002</xref>). AMPARs are tetrameric ionotropic receptor channels comprised of GluA1–4 pore-forming subunits plus auxiliary subunits conferring distinct electrophysiological kinetics, unique molecular structures, and different pharmacological sensitivities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jackson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowie, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azumaya et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Twomey et al., 2018</xref>). In the adult brain, most AMPAR tetramers contain an RNA-edited form of the GluA2 subunit that makes the channel relatively impermeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup>, resulting in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable AMPARs (CI-AMPARs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sommer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Higuchi et al., 1993</xref>). AMPARs lacking edited GluA2 are called Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) because they have greater permeability to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and larger overall ionic conductance, carried mainly by Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hollmann et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Geiger et al., 1995</xref>). The expression of GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs is downregulated in the developing brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pickard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kumar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henley and Wilkinson, 2016</xref>). However, CP-AMPARs persist or even increase with developmental maturation in some neurons of the auditory brainstem where CP-AMPARs enriched in GluA3 and GluA4 subunits are thought to be essential for fast transmission of acoustic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Trussell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrence and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sugden et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang and Manis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Youssoufian et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lujan et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Cochlear afferent projections process fast auditory signals through innervation of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, at the endbulb of Held synapses onto bushy cells, where the AMPARs are comprised mainly of GluA3 and GluA4 subunits with high Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability and rapid desensitization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rubio et al., 2017</xref>). Mice lacking the GluA3 subunit have impaired auditory processing due to effects on synaptic transmission associated with altered ultrastructure of synapses between endbulbs and bushy cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2020</xref>). Mice lacking the GluA4 subunit have altered acoustic startle responses and impaired transmission at the next synaptic relay at the calyx of Held in the brainstem, a high-fidelity central synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García-Hernández and Rubio, 2022</xref>). The rapid processing of auditory signals in the brainstem is supported by high-fidelity initial encoding of sound at peripheral synapses between cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rutherford and Moser, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rutherford et al., 2021</xref>), however, relatively little is known about how synapse ultrastructure, molecular composition, and overall abundance of cochlear AMPARs depends on specific pore-forming subunits.</p><p>In mice, the developmental onset of hearing function begins at the end of the second postnatal week, followed by activity-dependent maturation and neuronal diversification that depends on glutamatergic transmission in the SGNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Petitpré et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Petitpré et al., 2022</xref>). Heterogeneity of the SGNs and the ribbon synapses driving them results in auditory nerve fibers with mutually diverse sound response properties correlated to differences in synapse structure and position of innervation on the IHC modiolar–pillar axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ohn et al., 2016</xref>). Each primary auditory nerve fiber (i.e., type-I SGN) is unbranched and driven to fire spikes by the release of glutamate from an individual IHC-ribbon synapse driving a single, large postsynaptic density (PSD) of approximately 850 nm in length, on average (cat: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberman, 1980</xref>; mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Payne et al., 2021</xref>). In the mature cochlea, the PSD is populated with AMPARs comprised of subunits GluA2–4 but not GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niedzielski and Wenthold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsubara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>). Afferent signaling in the auditory nerve, as well as noise-induced excitotoxicity at cochlear afferent synapses (a form of synaptopathy), depends on activation of AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the dependence of cochlear AMPAR function and pathology on specific pore-forming subunits is unclear.</p><p>Here, we examined the influence of GluA3 subunits on afferent synapse ultrastructure and on AMPAR subunit molecular anatomy in the PSD of the auditory nerve fiber in the mouse cochlea, with attention to GluA2 and GluA4 <italic>flip</italic> and <italic>flop</italic> isoforms and to positions of SGN innervation on the IHC modiolar–pillar axis. At the central auditory nerve projection in the cochlear nucleus, at the endbulb of Held synapse, GluA3 is required for both post- and presynaptic maturation of synapse structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, we also examined presynaptic ribbon morphology in relation to position on the IHC modiolar–pillar axis, which is expected to show smaller and more spherical ribbons on the side of the IHC facing the pillar cells and outer hair cells (pillar side) relative to the ribbons on the modiolar side facing the ganglion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Payne et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings in young adult male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice include dysregulation of GluA2 and GluA4 subunit relative abundance and alterations in pre- and postsynaptic ultrastructure associated with an increased vulnerability to glutamatergic synaptopathy at ambient, background levels of sound. These structural and molecular alterations at the cochlear ribbon synapses of presymptomatic 5-week-old male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice appear to be pathological, preceding the reduction in ABR wave-1 amplitudes observed at 2 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cochlear responses to sound and transcriptional splicing of <italic>Gria2</italic> and <italic>Gria4</italic> mRNA isoforms are similar in 5-week-old GluA3<sup>WT</sup> and GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice</title><p>The four AMPAR pore-forming subunits GluA1–4 are encoded by four genes, <italic>Gria1–4</italic>.

With immunolabeling, we observed GluA2 and GluA4 in the SGNs of both genotypes, and we confirmed that SGNs lacked GluA1 in GluA3<sup>WT</sup> mice, as expected. Moreover, we did not observe compensatory GluA1 expression in SGNs of GluA3<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left). We also checked immunolabeling of GluA1 on brainstem sections containing the ventral cochlear nucleus and cerebellum.

Without GluA3 the pillar-side synaptic components were enlarged in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup>, including a ~50% increase in mean PSD surface area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), but the immunofluorescent volumes of synaptic AMPARs were concomitantly reduced on the pillar side in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> relative to the modiolar side and relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). This mismatch between changes in PSD size and changes in AMPAR cluster-size suggests misregulation of AMPAR density in the PSD in the absence of GluA3. In mice, SGN fibers contact IHCs in the differentiating organ of Corti already at birth. Synaptic ribbons and synaptic membrane densities mature over the following 3–4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sobkowicz et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Payne et al., 2021</xref>). Future studies should determine if these changes in synapse ultrastrucure and molecular composition result from disrutption of embryonic or early postnatal development and/or later postnatal maturation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>GluA3 is required for appropriate AMPAR assembly at IHC-ribbon synapses</title><p>Noise-induced cochlear synaptopathy is caused by excitotoxic over-activation of AMPARs due to excessive glutamate release from the sensory IHCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Puel et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Antagonizing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable subset of AMPARs (CP-AMPARs) pharmacologically can prevent noise-induced synaptopathy while allowing hearing function to continue through activation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-impermeable AMPARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of GluA3, GluA2/4 would be the only heterodimer. Homodimers can form and homomeric tetramers may exist, but non-GluA2 subunits preferentially heterodimerize with GluA2 subunits because homodimers are less stable energetically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rossmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that GluA2/4 heterodimers should be predominant in GluA3<sup>KO</sup>. However, we find that loss of GluA3 alters GluA2 and GluA4 subunit relative abundance, increasing the GluA4:GluA2 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>), which may increase the number of GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs at cochlear ribbon synapses of the GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice by forcing GluA4 homodimerization. The increase in CP-AMPARs in the GluA3<sup>KO</sup> could make the IHC-ribbon synapses more vulnerable to excitotoxic noise trauma as the cochlea matures and ages. In support of this, male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice have reduced ABR wave-1 amplitude relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup> mice by 2 months of age and elevated ABR thresholds by 3 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>). Although young male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice have ABR and synapse numbers similar to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), we hypothesize these molecular-anatomical alterations to AMPAR subunits result in synapses with increased vulnerability to AMPAR-mediated excitotoxicity that lead to synapse loss and hearing loss as the mice age in ambient sound conditions.</p><p>It is important for future studies to determine the effects on cochlear ribbon synapses when GluA3 is removed after cochlear maturation, in comparison with the present study in which GluA3 is absent congenitally resulting in direct and indirect effects. How are the amplitude and kinetics of synaptic transmission altered under these conditions? If two synapses have the same number of AMPARs, the synapse with a greater proportion of CP-AMPARs would have increased postsynaptic current amplitude. However, the increase in GluA4 seems to be outweighed by the reduction in GluA2 and the absence of GluA3 when measuring total AMPAR volume or fluorescence per synapse, suggesting fewer AMPARs per synapse in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In the context of homeostatic synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Turrigiano, 2012</xref>), an increase in synaptic current size due to increased proportion of CP-AMPARs could be compensated by net removal of AMPARs. Thus, future studies will need to determine if these synapses suffer from postsynaptic currents that are too large, too small, or similar in size with altered single-channel conductance.</p><p>Most knowledge of AMPAR subunit composition comes from studies on neurons in the brain, where GluA1 subunits are highly expressed. For example, AMPARs of hippocampal CA1 neuronal synapses are predominantly comprised of GluA1/2 heteromers (~80%; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2009</xref>). Cochlear AMPARs are unique because mature SGNs do not express GluA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Niedzielski and Wenthold, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Matsubara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parks, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shrestha et al., 2018</xref>; this study). In the ascending auditory pathway, the presynaptic terminals of SGNs release glutamate onto neurons in the brainstem’s cochlear nucleus where, as in the cochlea, AMPARs appear to lack GluA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, right). In the cochlea and cochlear nucleus, elimination of GluA3 did not result in GluA1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, left and right). Given the influences of GluA1 subunits in AMPAR activity-dependent plasticity in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2010</xref>), and considering their absence in the mature cochlea, the rules governing AMPAR dynamics in the inner ear are largely unknown and likely to be unique.</p><p>The duration of the postsynaptic current and thus the net influx of charge is largely determined by AMPAR desensitization, which is regulated by the proportion of <italic>flip</italic> and <italic>flop</italic> splice variants of GluA subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sommer et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monyer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mosbacher et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koike et al., 2000</xref>). <italic>Flip</italic> subunits desensitize more slowly than <italic>flop</italic> subunits, resulting in slower decays of AMPAR-mediated currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Trussell and Fischbach, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lawrence and Trussell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Quirk et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pei et al., 2007</xref>). Changes in transcription and mRNA splicing of AMPAR subunits may influence excitotoxicity. For example, a decrease in GluA2 and GluA3 <italic>flop</italic> isoforms leads to elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and increased death of retina ganglion cells after glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2016</xref>). At synapses between auditory nerve fibers (endbulbs) and bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus, the lack of GluA3 results in a lower proportion of <italic>flop</italic> subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we find the absence of GluA3 did not significantly alter transcription and mRNA splicing of GluA2 and GluA4 isoforms in the cochleae of 5-week-old GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice, arguing against the possibility that such alterations underlie the pathology of IHC-ribbon synapses in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We note that our method of isoform analysis was from whole temporal bones, including outer hair cell synapses and vestibular hair cell synapses. Contamination from outer hair cell synapses is likely to be small due to low AMPAR expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Weisz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez-Monedero et al., 2016</xref>). However, the presence of the vestibular synapses and/or the mixing of synapses from the whole cochlea may have prevented us from detecting changes in isoform expression at the level of individual synapses. Overall, in the inner ear in the absence of GluA3, <italic>flop</italic> isoforms of GluA2 and GluA4 were more abundant than <italic>flip</italic> isoforms, as in WT. Future patch-clamp studies are required to test AMPAR desensitization in the absence of GluA3 at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Potential trans-synaptic role of GluA3 at IHC-ribbon synapses</title><p>Pre- and postsynaptic ultrastructural features of IHC-ribbon synapses are disrupted in the organ of Corti of GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This is reminiscent of the ultrastructure of endbulb synapses in the cochlear nucleus of GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice, which is altered due to trans-synaptic developmental effects, where the absence of GluA3 increases synaptic depression by increasing the initial probability of vesicle release, slowing vesicle replenishment, and reducing the readily releasable pool of SVs through unknown mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2020</xref>). In the cochlea, modiolar–pillar ultrastructural differences among ribbon synapses were eliminated or reversed in GluA3<sup>KO</sup>. Our ultrastructural analysis shows the absence of GluA3 resulted in loss of the modiolar–pillar difference in PSD surface area seen in GluA3<sup>WT</sup>, due to larger PSDs on the pillar side of GluA3<sup>KO</sup> relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup>. At endbuld synapses, an increase in PSD surface area or thickness, and changes in SVs size have been observed in congenitally deaf cats and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ryugo et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ryugo et al., 2005</xref>), and after conductive hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, the increase in PSD surface area and larger SVs of pillar-side synapses may represent initial pathological structural signs in the absence of GluA3.</p><p>Through development, the ribbon-shape changes from largely round to oval, droplet-like, or wedge-like shapes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). The absence of GluA3 during development resulted in ribbons with shorter long axes that were more spherical relative to GluA3<sup>WT</sup>. This finding is consistent with a developmental defect in a process of ribbon maturation, whereby modiolar-side ribbons become longer and less spherical between 2.5 and 5 weeks of age in C57BL/6 WT mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Payne et al., 2021</xref>). While GluA3<sup>KO</sup> ribbons were shorter in long axis and more rounded in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) than those from GluA3<sup>WT</sup>, they also tended to have larger volumes particularly on the pillar side, suggesting lengthening of the short ribbon axis in GluA3<sup>KO</sup>. Finally, loss of GluA3 eliminated the modiolar–pillar difference in SV size observed in WT, due to an increase in SV size on the pillar side of GluA3<sup>KO</sup>. We note that other studies of IHC-ribbon synapses have identified increased SV size as a phenotype in endophilin KO and in AP180 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kroll et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kroll et al., 2020</xref>), although modiolar and pillar comparisons were not made.</p><p>Our ultrastructural data suggest that postsynaptic GluA3 subunits at IHC-ribbon synapses may perform an organizational function beyond their traditional role as ionotropic glutamate receptors. The mechanisms are still unclear, but evidence shows that AMPARs convey a retrograde trans-synaptic signal essential for presynaptic maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tracy et al., 2011</xref>). AMPAR subunits in the cochlea may interact with the trans-synaptic adhesion factors Neuroligins and Neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Heine et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hickox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramirez et al., 2022</xref>). GluA3 is required for the functional development of the presynaptic terminal and the structural maturation of SV size in endbulb auditory nerve synapses in the cochlear nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antunes et al., 2020</xref>). Altered SV size together with a change in the number of AMPARs and their clustering at the synapse contribute to quantal size variation and altered synaptic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2015</xref>). The number of AMPARs at IHC-ribbon synapses is undetermined but with a synaptic surface area ranging 0.1–1.5 µm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liberman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Payne et al., 2021</xref>) or 0.3–0.8 µm<sup>2</sup> (current study), it is estimated several hundred to a few thousand AMPARs at each PSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Momiyama et al., 2003</xref>). In GluA3<sup>KO</sup> mice, we find that despite the decrease in GluA2 and the larger increase of GluA4, the overall intensity and volume of the AMPAR subunit immunolabeling at IHC-ribbon synapses decreases when compared to WT synapses, primarily due to loss of GluA3. An increase in relative abundance of CP-AMPARs and a decreased overall abundance of AMPARs in GluA3<sup>KO</sup> are expected to have opposing effects on the size of the synaptic current evoked by glutamate. The ABR wave-1 amplitude is unaltered in male GluA3<sup>KO</sup> at 5 weeks of age suggesting a similar hearing sensitivity to WT mice. However, ABR peak amplitudes are reduced in the male KO at 8 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Hernández et al., 2017</xref>). To strengthen and confirm the potential trans-synaptic role of GluA3 at IHC-ribbon synapses and to compare synaptic strength, further electrophysiological studies need to determine the existence of altered quantal size and quantal content in the GluA3<sup>KO</sup>.</p><p>In the cochlea, afferent synaptic contact formation on the IHC, characterized by a demarcated pre- and postsynaptic density, often precedes ribbon attachment at the presynaptic active zone (AZ) membrane. Ribbon attachment occurs around embryonic day 18 (E18) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). The presence of postsynaptic AMPARs in those embryonic IHC-ribbon synapses has not been reported. However, patches of GluA2/3 AMPAR subunit immunolabeling were observed during the first postnatal week, juxtaposed to the presynaptic ribbon marker RIBEYE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). Fusion of ribbon precursors extends after hearing onset and is a critical step in presynaptic AZ formation and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Michanski et al., 2019</xref>). This maturation of synaptic ribbons may be essential for the functional maturation of afferent synaptic transmission within the cochlea. In mice lacking synaptic ribbons, features like PSDs, presynaptic densities, voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, and bassoon seem to develop relatively independently of ribbon presence, but spike patterns in the auditory nerve fibers are altered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jean et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2018</xref>). It is possible that GluA3 plays a direct or indirect role in the recruitment and maintenance of pre- and postsynaptic proteins, for example, via its N- and C-terminus domains. Postsynaptic PDZ domain AMPAR C-terminus interacting proteins such as PSD95 are present at IHC-ribbon synapses early during postnatal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wong et al., 2014</xref>). PSD95 interacts with the cell adhesion proteins Neuroligins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Irie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeong et al., 2019</xref>). Neuroligin-3 and to a lesser extent Neuroligin-1 are essential to cochlear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramirez et al., 2022</xref>). In the CNS, alignment of postsynaptic AMPARs, PSD95, and Neuroligin-1 together with the presynaptic protein RIM form nanocolumns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tang et al., 2016</xref>) thought to represent essential elements of trans-synaptic connections. The existence of such nanocolumns at ribbon synapses, where several release sites may reside around each ribbon, is unknown, but the same proteins are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krinner et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Picher et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hickox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ramirez et al., 2022</xref>).

ABR were recorded by placing subdermal needle electrodes at the scalp’s vertex, at the right pinna’s ventral border, and the ventral edge of the left pinna. ABR were recorded in response to broadband noise clicks (0.1 ms) or tone pips of 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32 kHz (5 ms). Stimuli were presented with alternating polarity at a rate of 21 Hz, with an interstimulus interval of 47.6 ms. The intensity levels used were from 80 to 10 dB, in decreasing steps of 5 dB.

For display only, the brightness and contrast levels were adjusted linearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> for visual clarity. Image analysis was performed on unadjusted, raw data.</p><p>The numbers of hair cells and paired and unpaired pre- and postsynaptic puncta were counted and manually verified after automated identification using Imaris software (Bitplane) to calculate the mean per IHC per image. The observers were blinded to mouse genotype. For each group of images from which synapses were counted or synaptic properties were measured, grand means ( ± SD) were calculated across image means (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7E, G</xref> and, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>). Paired synapses were identified as juxtaposed puncta of presynaptic ribbons (CtBP2) and postsynaptic AMPARs (GluA2 and/or GluA4), which appear to partly overlap at confocal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rutherford, 2015</xref>). Unpaired (i.e., lone) ribbons were defined as CtBP2 puncta in the IHC but lacking appositional GluA2 or GluA4 puncta. For unpaired ribbons, we did not distinguish membrane anchored from unanchored. Ribbonless synapses consisted of GluA2 and/or GluA4 puncta located around IHC basolateral membranes but lacking CtBP2. Pixels comprising puncta of synaptic fluorescence were segmented in 3D as ‘surface’ objects in Imaris using identical settings for each image stack, including the ‘local contrast background subtraction’ algorithm for automatically calculating the threshold pixel intensity for each fluorescence channel in each image. This adaptive and automatically calculated thresholding algorithm compensated for differences in overall luminance between image stacks that would affect the volume of segmented puncta if a fixed threshold was applied across images, and avoided the potential subjective bias of setting a user-defined arbitrary threshold value separately for each image. Intensity per synaptic punctum was calculated as the summation of pixel intensities within the surface object. To associate the intensities of different GluA puncta belonging to the same synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C-D</xref>), we generated surface objects from a virtual fourth channel equal to the sum of the three channels (GluA2, 3, and 4; or CtBP2, GluA2, and GluA4) and then summated the pixel intensities within each of the three fluorescence channels comprising each synapse segmented as a punctum on the fourth channel. The average density of synaptic fluorescence per image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) was calculated as median punctum Intensity (a.u.) divided by median punctum Volume (µm<sup>3</sup>) using surface objects calculated from corresponding individual fluorescence channels. To associate the volumes of different GluA puncta belonging to the same synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), we used the virtual fourth channel to generate masks. The mask for each synapse had a unique color value. Objects belonging to the same synapse were identified based on common overlap with the unique color value assigned to each mask. Sphericity is the ratio of the surface area of a sphere to the surface area of an object of equal volume, so sphericity of 1 means the object is a perfect sphere. To differentiate synapse position, images were used in which the row of IHCs was oriented with the modiolar–pillar dimension in the microscope’s <italic>Z</italic>-axis and the organ of Corti was not sloping in the image volume, and modiolar- and pillar-side groups were split at the midpoint of the range of synapses along the modiolar–pillar dimension.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and quantitative PCR</title><p>Under isofluorane anesthesia, mice (GluA3<sup>WT</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 4; GluA<italic>3</italic><sup>KO</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 4) were euthanized via cervical dislocation and decapitation. Immediately after the following decapitation, the cranium was opened, and the inner ears were removed. Inner ears were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80°C for up to 1 month until reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In preparation for RT-PCR, both inner ears from each individual were homogenized by hand with mortar or pestle and RNA was extracted with Trizol (Ambion by Life Technology). The RNA pellet (<italic>n</italic> = 3; each pellet contained the two cochleae of one mouse, except one contained the cochleae of two mice) was resuspended and the supernatant containing RNA from each individual’s inner ears was prepared for RT-PCR using the SuperScript Strand Synthesis System kit (Invitrogen, cat. No. 11904018). The resulting cDNA was stored at −20°C for 1 week or less before real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). qPCR was performed at the Genomics Research Core at the University of Pittsburgh using EvaGreen qPCR kit (MidSci, Valley Park, MO, cat.

In a 25-µl PCR reaction mixture, 2 µl cDNA samples were amplified in a Chromo 4 detector (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). GAPDH or 18S rRNA were used as housekeeping genes. Each sample (consisting of RNA product of both cochleae from each mouse) was run in triplicate, and average cycle thresholds (CTs) were used for quantification. Relative abundances of each splice isoform for GluA3<sup>KO</sup> males compared to GluA3<sup>WT</sup> were reported as fold change, calculated using the following equation: 2Delta-CT (<sup>2−ΔΔ</sup>CT), where <sup>ΔΔ</sup>CT = (CT<sub>GluA3</sub><sup>WT</sup> − CT<sub>GAPDH</sub> or CT<sub>18S rRNA</sub>) − (CT<sub>GluA3</sub><sup>KO</sup> − CT<sub>GAPDH</sub> or CT<sub>18S rRNA</sub>), and CT represents the cycle threshold of each cDNA sample. For a more in-depth explanation of this equation see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schmittgen and Livak, 2008</xref>. Electrophoresis of 10 µl of RT-PCR products was performed using 3% agarose (SeaKem LE Agarose by Lonza) with molecular ladder gel containing 0.5 µg/ml ethidium bromide in 0.5× tris-acetate-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (TAE) buffer (pH 8.0) and run at 100 V for 60 min. The size and thickness of the agarose gel, reagents, and other conditions were kept constant. The band size and DNA concentration of each PCR amplicon were determined by comparison to the corresponding band in the molecular weight ladder (Gene Ruler 100 BP DNA ladder Thermo Scientific). The amplicon images (RT-PCR bands) in the gel were captured under ultraviolet light and documented using a Bio Rad Molecular Imager Gel Doc RX + Imaging system. All the parameters and experimental conditions used were kept constant throughout the study. The image was saved (in JPEG format) on a computer for digital image analysis using ImageJ software.

Cochleae were dissected from the temporal bones, and fixative was slowly introduced through the oval window after removing the stapes and opening a hole at the apex of the cochlea bone shell. Cochleae were postfixed overnight in the same fixative at 4°C and followed a protocol slightly modified from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2016</xref>. After decalcification in 10% EDTA for 24 hr at 4°C on a rotor, cochleae were washed in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and postfixed with 1% osmium and 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer for 1 hr at RT. Cochleae were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol gradient (ETOH; 35%, 50–70%, 80–90%) and were blocked stained with 3% uranyl acetate in 70% ETOH for 2 hr at 4°C before the 80% ETOH. The last dehydration steps performed with 100% ETOH and propylene oxide were followed by infiltration with epoxy resin (EMBed-812; Electron Microscopy Science, PA, USA). Cochleae were cut with a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, and series of 15–20 serial ultrathin sections (70–80 nm in thickness) were collected. Each serial ultrathin section was collected on numbered single slot gold-gilded grids with formvar. Ultrathin sections were observed with a JEOL-1400 transmission electron microscope (TEM; JEOL Ltd., Akishima Tokyo, Japan), and images (at ×40,000 magnification) of the mid-cochlea (~20 kHz) containing IHC-ribbon synapses of the modiolar and pillar side were captured with an Orius SC200 CCD camera (Gatan Inc, Warrendale, PA, USA). In our ultrastructural analysis, we included IHC-ribbon synapses that were clearly located on either the modiolar face or the pillar face of the IHC. We did not sample every synapse in a given IHC, so the proportions of modiolar- and pillar-side synapses analyzed do not reflect the relative abundance of the population. The experimenter was not blinded to mouse genotype during image acquisition and analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>3D reconstructions and NIH ImageJ analysis of TEM micrographs</title><p>TEM micrographs (at ×40,000 magnification) of the serial IHC-ribbon synapses were calibrated, aligned, and reconstructed using Reconstruct software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gómez-Nieto and Rubio, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clarkson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Clarkson et al., 2020</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0">https://synapseweb.clm.utexas.edu/software-0</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiala, 2005</xref>). A total of 29 (GluA3<sup>WT</sup>) and 26 (GluA3<sup>KO</sup>) IHC-ribbon synapses were reconstructed. In the 3D reconstructions, we used only the ultrathin sections of IHC-ribbon synapses containing the PSD. Sections containing the afferent dendrite without PSD were not included. In brief, two successive sections were aligned via rotation and translation such that corresponding structures like mitochondria in the two sections were superimposed. Linear transformation compensated for distortions introduced by the sectioning. Following alignment of the TEM sections, structures of interest were segmented visually into contours of separate objects. The thicknesses of all ultrathin sections in series were summed to account for differences in section thickness for 3D reconstructions. The subsequent linear interpolation between membrane contours in adjacent images resulted in polygonal outlines of cell membranes, PSD and synaptic ribbons. The 3D rendering was generated as VRML files from the stacks of all contoured sections. We calculated volumes and surface areas of the structures of interest (PSDs and ribbons) by filling these contours with tetrahedra. In addition, we used the NIH ImageJ software to determine the linear length of the PSD, the synaptic ribbon major axis, and SV size. For this analysis we used single representative TEM micrographs (at ×40,000 magnification) of each serial section series, as well as representative micrographs of other IHC-ribbon synapses that were not reconstructed because the serial section series were incomplete. A total of 43 GluA3<sup>WT</sup> and 53 GluA3<sup>KO</sup> PSDs were used to measure the linear length; 57 GluA3<sup>WT</sup> and 60 GluA3<sup>KO</sup> ribbons were used to calculate the major axes and circularity. For the SVs, we drew two perpendicular lines from the edges of the external membrane, to measure the major and minor diameters. The size of each SV was calculated as (Major diameter + Minor diameter)/2. Four to six SVs were analyzed per synapse. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, we plotted the mean SV size per synapse (GluA3<sup>WT</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 45; GluA3<sup>KO</sup> <italic>n</italic> = 47) and compared grand means for modiolar and pillar groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad Prism software (Version 9.3.1) or IGOR Pro software (Wavemetrics, Version 7.08).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Barbara Shinn-Cunningham as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chad Paul Grabner (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. We suggest a supplemental table summarizing the data and the statistical tests used for each of the analyses</p><p>2. There is more background signal in wild type than ko ihcs in Figure 2A &quot;sum&quot;. Is there an explanation for this? Please also address the GluA3 staining in the GluA3 KO (Figure 2C).</p><p>3. Revise the text to emphasize your IHC data, rather than the brainstem. Reviewers would like to read a discussion of your findings in the context of other studies of morphological/functional changes of synapses upon deletion AMPAR subunits (e.g. PMID: 19409270; PMID: 23664612; PMID: 31685637)</p><p>4. Address the concern that the PSD's territory may not be fully sampled in EM analyses. One suggestion would be for you to estimate the &quot;Major axis&quot; from the PSD in the EM reconstruction, which is how you summarized PSD size from single sections. This should help bridge the single section results with reconstructed psd data. Please also plot and report PSD surface area and ribbon volume for modiolar synapses that have only a single ribbon to be able to assess whether the increase in PSD surface area is caused by the higher frequency of synapses with multiple ribbons.</p><p>5. You should also indicate if the dendrite (sgn afferent) was sufficiently sampled. Do the boundaries of the PSD represent the last section in a series or were there additional sections that show the PSD was not present?</p><p>6. Please provide zoomed views of exemplar pre- and post-synaptic labeling on the Pillar and Modiolar sides, for wt and ko samples. This will better illustrate the primary IF data.</p><p>7. The possibility that GluA1 may compensate for the loss of GluA3 in inner hair cells needs to be discussed as this scenario cannot be excluded from the presented data given that GluA3KO IHCs exhibited a larger number of ribbons that lacked GluA2 and 4 (lone or 'orphaned' ribbons; Figure 6B).</p><p>8. Please clearly state potential exclusion criteria for the synapses that were sampled and analyzed by EM.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Points for the Intro and Discussion.</p><p>1) Intro. It needs to be stated early in the MS that older GluA3ko mice express behavioral deficits (changes in ABRs).</p><p>2) The description &quot;pre-symptomatic, but in a pathological state..&quot; is very useful, and I think the Intro and Discussion need to create more context for this idea. Though there may not be a plethora of background literature on the regulation of GluA expression at ihc-sgns to cite, the Intro does not give me a good sense of a) development, b) circuitry or c) pathology of &quot;cochlear ribbon synapses&quot;.</p><p>3) Background literature downstream from the cochlea should be scaled down in the Intro and transferred to Discussion. This will create more room to develop a context for ihc ribbon-sgn afferent synapses; i.e. the differentiation of the pillar-modiolar axis.</p><p>4) In the Discission, there is not enough speculation on how the molecular changes and morphological changes (SVs) will shape the physiology. It would be interesting to know what you would predict to see when making whole-cell recordings from afferents, or if you were to use a GluSniffer.</p><p>5) For instance, you have previously shown the majority of spontaneous ihc-bouton epscs have a simple monophasic waveform in adult/3wk old mice (Becker et al 2018, eLife. Ribeye-ko). In your current study, you show the expression of GluA4 alone at certain ihc-sgn synapses of the GluA3ko mice. How might changes in epsc amplitude and kinetics be influenced by changes to receptor composition (a transition from GluA3/GluA2/A4 rich afferents to A4 alone in some instances)?</p><p>6) Can you speculate on whether &quot;in general&quot; changes in SV size (based on EM) may be more common on the pillar than the modiolar side when ihc synapses are perturbed? If you have some examples, beyond the excellent data you offer in the current study, please share. I note recent studies on endophilin kos (EMBO J, Kroll et al. 2019) and the AP180 ko (JCS, Kroll et al 2019) that have identified increased SV size as a ko phenotype, though a distinction in the pillar and modiolar was not made. Another set of examples comes from ribeye ko mice. Deletion of ribbons appears to have no influence on SV size (Becker 2018 PNAS), or it causes an increase in the diameter of membrane-proximal SVs (Philippe et al 2019 pnas); however, again neither study distinguished between the pillar and modiolar sides. To further confound our understanding of SV size regulation is that the conventional protocol for patching ihcs is to approach from the modiolar side; thus, changes in SV size on pillar side would be missed. For example, on-cell Cm measurements of SV size from Cav1.3 ko mice (from the modiolar side) showed no change in the size of SV size (membrane capacitance) when compared to wt ihcs (Grabner and Moser 2018, PNAS), albeit the synapses were severely affected, degenerated in the ko. It is possible the pillar side would have been more interesting to record from in the Cav ko, or alternatively, changes in SV size may be under more specific regulation and less associated with the severity of a perturbation on synapse maintenance. the</p><p>7) Lastly, you refer to nano-columns in the Discussion, lines 664/665, but in the case of ihc-sgn synapses, the presynaptic release machinery seems to be corralled into the center of a ring (fence) of postsynaptic GluA's. From the modeling study of Chapochnikov et al 2014 (Neuron), based in part on actual morphological data, the position of release is central to the ring of GluA receptors. This seems to be a clever design for optimizing SV readout. However, do you think that only the ribbon is central, while more primed SVs are docked lateral away the ribbon, directly above GkuAs? Is there any data that indicates the ihc AZ is ring shaped?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to pass on a few comments/questions directly to the authors of the study.</p><p>I would be grateful if it was possible to get a more detailed account of some of the experimental procedures:</p><p>- Mouse breeding: Where were littermate C57BL6 (GluA3WT) and GluA3-knockout (GluA3KO) animals used or were the two colonies kept separately?</p><p>– Ultrastructural analyses: How were vesicle diameters measured? Was a correction performed to account for differences in section thickness for 3D reconstructions? Was the experimenter blinded for the genotype during image acquisition and analysis? How were synapses chosen for reconstruction? What was the pixel size?</p><p>With regards to statistical analyses, I would find it helpful if N- and n- numbers for the different groups and statistical tests used were listed in all Figure legends wherever relevant. It should also be clearly stated whether SD or SEM is shown in individual panels [especially if they appear to differ from what is mentioned in the text as it appears to be the case for the data shown in Figure 3 and 4 (ribbon volume)].</p><p>This may be a misunderstanding, but – as already mentioned in the public review- I would be grateful for clarification with regards to the data presented in Figure 3+4:</p><p>– p.16 l. 387: &quot;A total of 27 synapses of GluA3WT mice were analyzed in 3D using serial sections (on average, 7 ultrathin sections per PSD). Of this total, 18 were on the modiolar side and 9 on the pillar side of the IHCs (Figure 3A-B). […] Six of 18 modiolar-side synapses had 2 ribbons (33.3%), whereas all the synapses on the pillar side had only 1 ribbon.&quot; In Figure 3C left, only 13 data points are shown for the PSD surface area and 17 for the ribbon volume for the modiolar side.</p><p>– p.17 l. 391: &quot;Presynaptic ribbon volume was similar between these two groups (p = 0.525, Mann Whitney U test, U: 64; modiolar mean: 0.003 + 0.001 μm3; pillar mean: 0.002 + 0.001 μm3; Figure 3C, right&quot;). In Figure 3 right, the box indicating the modiolar mean appears to be lower than 0.003.</p><p>– p.17 l. 406: &quot;From GluA3KO, a total of 30 synapses were analyzed in 3D with serial sections (on average, 7 ultrathin sections per PSD). Of this total, 20 were on the modiolar side and 10 on the pillar side of the IHCs (Figure 4A-B). […] Six of the 20 modiolar-side synapses had 2 ribbons (30%) whereas all synapses on the pillar side had only 1 ribbon.&quot; Figure 4C left shows only 16 data points for the PSD surface area and 20 for the ribbon volume for the modiolar side.</p><p>– p.17 l. 408: &quot;Analysis showed that PSD surface area and ribbon volume were similar for modiolar- and pillar-side synapses ([…] mean ribbon volume, modiolar: 0.003 + 0.001 μm3, pillar: 0.003 + 0.001 μm3; Figure 4C).&quot; Despite the same reported mean, the height of the boxes in Figure 4C right is different (likely due to rounding). Would it be possible to present the data in a different way to take this into consideration?</p><p>Figure 3+4: What n-numbers were used for statistical testing and what do they refer to in the individual plots (number of PSDs analyzed, ribbons, vesicles)? Why did the authors choose to show the data for ribbon circularity as a Whisker plot and not the individual data points? It appears from the SV size (=diameter?) analysis, that the vesicles were pooled over all synapses analyzed for a given genotype. I would suggest comparing the mean vesicle diameter per synapse instead.</p><p>Would it be possible for the authors to also plot and report PSD surface area and ribbon volume for modiolar synapses that have only a single ribbon to be able to assess whether the increase in PSD surface area is caused by the higher frequency of synapses with multiple ribbons?</p><p>I would like to ask the authors to please show an overview of all reconstructed synapses as supplementary Figures (representative cross-section and rendering of the segmentation) similar to what has been shown in Payne et al., Front. In Synaptic Neuroscience, 2021. This would help to get a better idea about the variability in the size and morphology of the different synapses that went into the analysis.</p><p>Figure 5 A: &quot;Data&quot; instead of &quot;Datata&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80950.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We have now added an explanation of this to the Methods on p. 27-28 of the revised text. Each wt/ko pair of image panels was adjusted to the same degree, but because each original image differed somewhat in non-specific background fluorescence of the tissue, the result is as you observed. In the initial submission, we failed to check the appearance of the images closely after conversion to pdf, which changes the appearance. Because these adjustments are made for clarity, for display purposes only, we have now taken the liberty in the revised document to re-adjust the brightness and contrast to avoid this appearance. We prefer to keep the re-adjusted version in the manuscript rather than the unadjusted version, for visual clarity.</p><p>Regarding the labelling in the KO on the GluA3 channel, there is indeed a small signal presumably due to cross-reactivity of the anti-GluA3 with GluA2 subunits, because the <italic>C</italic>-terminal epitope recognized by the GluA3 polyclonal antibody is in a region of high similarity between GluA2 and GluA3 (Dong et al., 1997). This relatively small cross-reactivity was approximately 10%, as quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-80950-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The cross-reactivity in the KO is only apparent to the eye when the brightness level was over-adjusted to saturate the GluA3 signal in the WT, as in the original submission. Upon re-adjustment, the signal is not visually apparent. We also note, in the initial characterization of the GluA3 KO mice, García-Hernández et al., 2017 used southern blot and western blot to show a complete lack of Gria3 DNA or GluA3 subunit protein expression. Moreover, no labeling for GluA3 was found on auditory nerve synapses on bushy cells of GluA3KO mice using freeze-fracture immunogold labeling (Rubio et al., 2017). In both studies, we used an N-terminus antibody against GluA3. We now state this in the Methods on p. 28. Also, since approximately 10% of the signal quantified as GluA3 in the WT is putative cross-reactivity with GluA2, we now state this on p. 27-28.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Revise the text to emphasize your IHC data, rather than the brainstem. Reviewers would like to read a discussion of your findings in the context of other studies of morphological/functional changes of synapses upon deletion AMPAR subunits (e.g. PMID: 19409270; PMID: 23664612; PMID: 31685637)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The AMPAR literature includes many experimental paradigms and settings that are potentially relevant to our study. However, we prefer to keep the text about GluA subunits in the auditory brainstem because we believe this provides the most appropriate context for the current study about GluA subunits in the auditory periphery. The 3 references mentioned by the reviewer are quite interesting stories involving AMPAR subunit composition, but we don’t think they are the most relevant papers to cite in the current study: PMID 19409270 and 23664612 are about the hippocampus; PMID 31685637 is about activity-dependent plasticity in the cerebellum. We would prefer to include such comparisons to other systems in future review articles. However, we did incorporate PMID 19409270 (Lu et al., 2009) and PMID: 19906877 (Lee et al., 2010) on p. 20 in Discussion, describing the predominance of GluA1/2 heteromers on CA1 cells in the hippocampus and the dominant influence of GluA1 on AMPAR plasticity in the brain. We contrast this with the mature cochlea, where GluA1 subunits are absent (Niedzielski and Wenthold, 1995; Matsubara et al., 1996; Parks, 2000; Shrestha et al., 2018) and the rules governing receptor dynamics are largely unknown and likely to be unique. As well, in response to the specific comments below, we revised the Intro and Discussion to enhance the context as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Address the concern that the PSD's territory may not be fully sampled in EM analyses. One suggestion would be for you to estimate the &quot;Major axis&quot; from the PSD in the EM reconstruction, which is how you summarized PSD size from single sections. This should help bridge the single section results with reconstructed psd data. Please also plot and report PSD surface area and ribbon volume for modiolar synapses that have only a single ribbon to be able to assess whether the increase in PSD surface area is caused by the higher frequency of synapses with multiple ribbons.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the first concern, we have now supplemented the analysis with measurements of the linear length of the PSD (Figure 3, 4, and 5; see details in supplemental material Source data 1 for Figures 1,3,4, and 5). We have also revised all the 3D reconstructions and fixed some misalignments in some of the reconstructions. Overall, our data show a large variability of PSD sizes, especially in the synapses of the modiolar side (Figures 3, 4, and 5; see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>In response to the second concern, we have now assessed the data with synapses of double ribbons segregated from the data of synapses with single ribbons (Figures 3, 4 and 5); details in supplemental source data files: Figure 3-source data-1; Figure 4-source data-1; Figure 5-source data-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. You should also indicate if the dendrite (sgn afferent) was sufficiently sampled. Do the boundaries of the PSD represent the last section in a series or were there additional sections that show the PSD was not present?</p></disp-quote><p>We added more details of the 3D reconstructions (p.32-33). In the serial ultrathin sections, we identified and photographed each synapse, but we only reconstructed the serial ultrathin sections that show a visible PSD; the images of the dendrites without a PSD were not included. The last section in a series represents the boundaries of the PSD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Please provide zoomed views of exemplar pre- and post-synaptic labeling on the Pillar and Modiolar sides, for wt and ko samples. This will better illustrate the primary IF data.</p></disp-quote><p>Done, see new Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The possibility that GluA1 may compensate for the loss of GluA3 in inner hair cells needs to be discussed as this scenario cannot be excluded from the presented data given that GluA3KO IHCs exhibited a larger number of ribbons that lacked GluA2 and 4 (lone or 'orphaned' ribbons; Figure 6B).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would like to explain our reasoning. As can be seen from the subpanels on the right side of Figure 6B, the occurrence of ribbons paired with GluA2 or GluA4 alone is about 10x less frequent than the occurrence of lone ribbons, making it unlikely that a GluA1 alone category would account for the lone ribbons, unless a mechanism exists to specifically express GluA1 alone in the absence of GluA3. However, we think the possibility of the apparently lone ribbons actually belonging to synapses expressing GluA1 alone is very unlikely given the data presented in Figure 1B showing lack of expression of GluA1 in the SGNs of GluA3 KO.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Please clearly state potential exclusion criteria for the synapses that were sampled and analyzed by EM.</p></disp-quote><p>In our ultrastructural analysis, we only included IHC-ribbon synapses that were clearly located on the modiolar or pillar sides of the IHC. We added this statement on p. 32-33.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Points for the Intro and Discussion.</p><p>1) Intro. It needs to be stated early in the MS that older GluA3ko mice express behavioral deficits (changes in ABRs).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this in the Introduction on p. 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The description &quot;pre-symptomatic, but in a pathological state..&quot; is very useful, and I think the Intro and Discussion need to create more context for this idea. Though there may not be a plethora of background literature on the regulation of GluA expression at ihc-sgns to cite, the Intro does not give me a good sense of a) development, b) circuitry or c) pathology of &quot;cochlear ribbon synapses&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Please see revisions in the Introduction and Discussion, where we added more background about cochlear ribbon synapses with your comments in mind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Background literature downstream from the cochlea should be scaled down in the Intro and transferred to Discussion. This will create more room to develop a context for ihc ribbon-sgn afferent synapses; i.e. the differentiation of the pillar-modiolar axis.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments, but we believe that the literature of the auditory brainstem is necessary to understand the rationale of our study in the cochlea. Thus, we prefer not to scale it down, however, we have added more information about the ribbon synapse in the Introduction and Discussion. As result, the number of words in both sections has increased (Introduction from 693 to 851; Discussion from 1524 to 2,374).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Discussion, there is not enough speculation on how the molecular changes and morphological changes (SVs) will shape the physiology. It would be interesting to know what you would predict to see when making whole-cell recordings from afferents, or if you were to use a GluSniffer.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. Please see the revisions in the Discussion on p. 21-22.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For instance, you have previously shown the majority of spontaneous ihc-bouton epscs have a simple monophasic waveform in adult/3wk old mice (Becker et al 2018, eLife. Ribeye-ko). In your current study, you show the expression of GluA4 alone at certain ihc-sgn synapses of the GluA3ko mice. How might changes in epsc amplitude and kinetics be influenced by changes to receptor composition (a transition from GluA3/GluA2/A4 rich afferents to A4 alone in some instances)?</p></disp-quote><p>We intend to perform patch clamp recordings in a follow-up study, and we now include some speculation of that in Discussion on p. 19-20. The GluA4 alone synapses may be transient, representing a terminal stage of pathology. Although they would be nearly impossible to sample with certainty in patch clamp given their very low frequency, we could speculate about changes due to the lack of GluA3 based on those changes observed in the endbulb synapses of the brainstem in Antunes et al., 2020. In that study, we found the presence of GluA3 resulted in fast AMPAR desensitization kinetics. As well, we found that GluA3 is required for the normal function, structure, and development of the presynaptic terminal, where the KO leads to altered short term-depression. The presence of GluA3 reduces and slows synaptic depression by lowering the probability of vesicle release, promoting efficient vesicle replenishment, and increasing the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles. GluA3 also makes the speed of synaptic depression rate-invariant. Therefore, we have added sentences to the Discussion on p. 21.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can you speculate on whether &quot;in general&quot; changes in SV size (based on EM) may be more common on the pillar than the modiolar side when ihc synapses are perturbed? If you have some examples, beyond the excellent data you offer in the current study, please share. I note recent studies on endophilin kos (EMBO J, Kroll et al. 2019) and the AP180 ko (JCS, Kroll et al 2019) that have identified increased SV size as a ko phenotype, though a distinction in the pillar and modiolar was not made. Another set of examples comes from ribeye ko mice. Deletion of ribbons appears to have no influence on SV size (Becker 2018 PNAS), or it causes an increase in the diameter of membrane-proximal SVs (Philippe et al 2019 pnas); however, again neither study distinguished between the pillar and modiolar sides. To further confound our understanding of SV size regulation is that the conventional protocol for patching ihcs is to approach from the modiolar side; thus, changes in SV size on pillar side would be missed. For example, on-cell Cm measurements of SV size from Cav1.3 ko mice (from the modiolar side) showed no change in the size of SV size (membrane capacitance) when compared to wt ihcs (Grabner and Moser 2018, PNAS), albeit the synapses were severely affected, degenerated in the ko. It is possible the pillar side would have been more interesting to record from in the Cav ko, or alternatively, changes in SV size may be under more specific regulation and less associated with the severity of a perturbation on synapse maintenance.</p></disp-quote><p>These are interesting possibilities. We are unable to speculate as to whether or not changes in SV size may be more common on the pillar side. However, we did add the Kroll citations on p. 22 of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Lastly, you refer to nano-columns in the Discussion, lines 664/665, but in the case of ihc-sgn synapses, the presynaptic release machinery seems to be corralled into the center of a ring (fence) of postsynaptic GluA's. From the modeling study of Chapochnikov et al 2014 (Neuron), based in part on actual morphological data, the position of release is central to the ring of GluA receptors. This seems to be a clever design for optimizing SV readout. However, do you think that only the ribbon is central, while more primed SVs are docked lateral away the ribbon, directly above GkuAs? Is there any data that indicates the ihc AZ is ring shaped?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of any data indicating a ring-shape of the presynaptic AZ. Based on the positions of morphologically docked SVs at the ribbon synapses in C57BL/6 WT mice, there are potentially primed SVs docked away from the ribbons, across from the ring of AMPARs (e.g., Payne et al., 2021 and many others). We now state on p. 23-24 that the existence of nanocolumns in the ribbon synapse is unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would like to pass on a few comments/questions directly to the authors of the study.</p><p>I would be grateful if it was possible to get a more detailed account of some of the experimental procedures:</p><p>– Mouse breeding: Where were littermate C57BL6 (GluA3WT) and GluA3-knockout (GluA3KO) animals used or were the two colonies kept separately?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added to the Methods on p. 25.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Ultrastructural analyses: How were vesicle diameters measured?
