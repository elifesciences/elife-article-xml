hereditary and sporadic retinal diseases such as Stargardt disease, age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa urgently require the development of new therapeutic strategies. Additionally, a high prevalence of retinal toxicities is becoming more and more an issue of novel targeted therapeutic agents. Ophthalmologic drug development, to date, largely relies on animal models, which often do not provide results that are translatable to human patients. Hence, the establishment of sophisticated human tissue-based in vitro models is of upmost importance. The discovery of self-forming retinal organoids (ROs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) or human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) is a promising approach to model the complex stratified retinal tissue. Yet, ROs lack vascularization and cannot recapitulate the important physiological interactions of matured photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In this study, we present the retina-on-a-chip (RoC), a novel microphysiological model of the human retina integrating more than seven different essential retinal cell types derived from hiPSCs. It provides vasculature-like perfusion and enables, for the first time, the recapitulation of the interaction of mature photoreceptor segments with RPE in vitro. We show that this interaction enhances the formation of outer segment-like structures and the establishment of in vivo-like physiological processes such as outer segment phagocytosis and calcium dynamics. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of the RoC for drug testing, by reproducing the retinopathic side-effects of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and the antibiotic gentamicin. The developed hiPSC-based RoC has the potential to promote drug development and provide new insights into the underlying pathology of retinal diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal organoids</kwd><kwd>retinal pigment epithelial cell</kwd><kwd>human induced pulipotent stem cells</kwd><kwd>organ-on-a-chip</kwd><kwd>microphysiological systems</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003185</institution-id><institution>Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loskill</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schenke-Layland</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Liebau</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Loskill</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003542</institution-id><institution>Ministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Kunst Baden-Württemberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schenke-Layland</surname><given-names>Katja</given-names></name><name><surname>Loskill</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000849</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liebau</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name><name><surname>Loskill</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009052</institution-id><institution>Hector Fellow Academy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haq</surname><given-names>Wadood</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A microphysiological system (retina-on-a-chip) shows the potential to promote drug development and provide new insights into the underlying pathology of retinal diseases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retinal diseases such as Stargardt disease, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathies or retinitis pigmentosa are amongst the leading causes of vision loss in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croze et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buch et al., 2004</xref>). Unfortunate for patients suffering from those diseases, there are currently no cures available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shintani et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fine et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, the complex neuro-retinal organization and the vast blood-supply make retinal tissue susceptible for side effects of compounds delivered intravitreally or systemically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Penha et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Renouf et al., 2012</xref>). Retinal toxicities are a major issue for a wide range of therapeutic substances, especially for targeted anticancer agents since many of the targets are also expressed in ocular tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Renouf et al., 2012</xref>). Although animal models that are used to explore new therapeutic options and assess retinal toxicities resemble the human (patho-)physiology of vision in certain aspects, they fail to reflect fundamental characteristics including trichromacy or a fovea centralis, responsible for high visual acuity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In vitro cell culture assays, on the other hand, are typically based on non-physiological 2D cell cultures, which cannot reflect the complex architecture and cell-cell interactions as well as the blood perfusion. More complex approaches such as retinal explants from human donors provide a full-featured model; however, the limited availability and culturability as well as inter-donor variabilities make it unsuited for drug development and testing. The invention of physiologically relevant in vitro models capable of mimicking the human retinal biology is hence of crucial importance. Recent progress in the generation of 3-dimensional (3D) organoids derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC) (derived from both induced (hiPSC) as well as embryonic (hESC) stem cells) enabled the reflection of distinct types of tissues, such as subsystems of the central nervous system including the retina. Retinal organoids (ROs), also called ‘eyes in the dish’, resemble rudimentary optic vesicle-like structures with a retinal layering similar to in vivo conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nakano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>). These ROs contain most relevant retinal cell types in a physiological layering such as ganglion cells, amacrine cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, Müller glia as well as rods and cones. Nevertheless, hPSC-ROs are still facing a variety of drawbacks limiting predictive research on for example human retinal development, function or drug response. Some of the major hurdles are (i) the functional maturation of differentiated cells, (ii) lack of essential cell types (e.g. microglia), (iii) lack of a physiological interplay of the various retinal cell types especially of photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelia (RPE), as well as (iv) a missing vascularization (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achberger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the lack of a physiological perfusion, the delivery of compounds to ROs is uncontrolled and entirely artificial. Here, general limitations of static cell culture apply including non-physiological cell-to-media ratio, uncontrolled shear forces during media exchanges, as well as highly variable conditions between media exchanges. In recent years, the short-comings of conventional static cell culture has led to the emergence of microphysiological systems (MPS), specifically Organ-on-a-Chip (OoC) platforms. MPSs have evolved into a powerful alternative for classical cell culture and animal models by providing physiological microenvironments embedded in a vascular-like microfluidic perfusion (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wikswo, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). This new and promising technology has the potential to revolutionize drug development and usher into a new era of personalized medicine. Over the past years, a variety of MPSs have been developed, mimicking, for instance, cardiac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mathur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agarwal et al., 2013</xref>), lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huh et al., 2010</xref>), renal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wilmer et al., 2016</xref>), and hepatic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhise et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakao et al., 2011</xref>). In the context of ophthalmologic research, a variety of approaches have been introduced that represent partial layers of the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Puleo et al., 2009</xref>) or the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dodson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Su et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jeon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mishra et al., 2015</xref>). So far, however, no MPS has been able to successfully recapitulate the complex 3D architecture of the human retina.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46188.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Advantages and limitations of retinal models for drug development and mechanistic research.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46188-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In this study, we developed a physiologically relevant 3D in vitro model of the human retina by combining hiPSC-ROs with hiPSC-derived RPE in a retina-on-a-chip (RoC). This novel microphysiological platform enables enhanced inner and outer segment formation and preservation, a direct interplay between RPE and photoreceptors as well as a precisely controllable vasculature-like perfusion. In order to provide a high-content platform for basic and applied research, we established a toolbox comprising in situ analysis approaches as well as terminal endpoints enabling the monitoring of functionality as well as molecular mechanisms. To demonstrate the applicability for drug screening, the system was exposed to the drugs chloroquine and gentamicin, which are known to have retinopathic side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elman et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yusuf et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zemel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McDonald et al., 1986</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Retinal organoids show rod and cone diversity and simple inner and outer segment formation</title><p>ROs derived from hiPSCs harbor all known major retinal subtypes such as ganglion cells, bipolar cells, horizontal cells, amacrine cells, Müller glia and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using immunostaining and gene expression analysis, the presence of the retinal cell types, as well as crucial retinal morphological cues such as inner and outer photoreceptor segment formation, a tightly formed outer limiting membrane (OLM) and a correct layering, was verified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to reach a suitable maturation, ROs were differentiated for 180 days. ROs of that age harbor matured photoreceptors which have simple forms of inner and outer segments, situated on the surface of the ROs, visible in bright field microscopy or by immunostaining of respective markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–f</xref>). Immunostaining of the respective organoids demonstrates the presence of a mixed population of rods and cones, identified by specific markers (rhodopsin for rods and Arrestin-3 for cones, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In order to analyze segment formation, we used ROM1 as it has been previously shown as specific outer segment marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Datta et al., 2015</xref>) and verified the segment specificity by co-staining with the rod marker rhodopsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d,f</xref>). Further, we tested the previously described protein PNA lectin, which was delineated to specifically bind to cone photoreceptor segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanks and Johnson, 1984</xref>).

Each RoC features four identical micro-tissues connected via a microchannel and is comprised of two transparent and biocompatible polymer layers. The top layer features the compartments for the ROs and RPE, whereas the bottom layer provides a channel for a vasculature-like perfusion enabling a constant supply of nutrients and compounds. Both layers are separated by a thin porous membrane mimicking the endothelial barrier and shielding the tissues from shear forces while simultaneously enabling the exchange of nutrients and metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The tissue compartments are accessible from above for the initial seeding process and sealed during the subsequent culture process to avoid evaporation and contamination. A stable tissue comprising ROs and RPE was achieved by first seeding hiPSC-derived RPE cells at a defined density into each tissue compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) and subsequent culture for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). This step was followed by injection of ROs embedded in a hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel (representing the major component of the interphotoreceptor matrix between RPE and PRC) into the tissue compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). This led to the formation of a thin hydrogel layer, generating a defined distance between RPE cells and the outer limiting membrane of the ROs. Thereby, a direct contact and, thus, an uncontrolled outgrowth of cells from the ROs during culture was successfully avoided. ROs and RPE were cultured in the system for at least 3 days prior to further functionality assessment or experimentation. The controlled culture conditions enabled a stable culture of the RoC for at least 21 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46188.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Microfluidic RoC.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic representation of the human retinal composition and cell types in vivo.

Subsequent to the treatment, the RoCs were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to assess cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Additionally, they were co-stained with the lysosomal marker protein LAMP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) since lysosomal dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of CQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mahon et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rosenthal et al., 1978</xref>).

However, at a concentration of 80 µg/ml, cell viability was clearly impacted as shown by a significantly stronger PI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a,b</xref>) compared to controls without CQ treatment. Furthermore, after exposure to 80 µg/ml CQ, a strong LAMP2 signal was visible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>), indicating an enlargement of lysosomes where the drug is accumulating and leading to lysosomal dysfunction.

In RoCs without RPE, an increase in cell death was observed at a GM concentration of 0.5 mg/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f</xref>) and even more prominent in RoCs exposed to a 5-fold higher GM concentration (2.5 mg/ml), which was significant in comparison to the controls. In the complete RoC (RO and RPE), similar effects became apparent: The low GM concentrations led to a profound yet not significant increase in the PI signal, whereas the high concentration of 2.5 mg/ml GM led to a significant strong increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8g</xref>). Since the quantified PI signal was a combined signal from cells in RPE and RO, we investigated whether the RO was affected differently by the drug when comparing the conditions with and without RPE (RoC and RoC w/o RPE). For that purpose, we subtracted the PI signal localized in the RPE from the calculated values of the entire RoC in the 0.5 mg/ml treated chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>). Interestingly, we found an increase of PI in the condition without RPE, but an unchanged PI signal in the RoC-cultured RO. This is in contrast to the results from the RoC without RPE, where a robust increase was observed when treating the chip with 0.5 mg/ml GM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>). This could indicate a barrier or even protective function of the RPE, shielding the organoid from the drug and decreasing the toxic effects of the drug on the organoid.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Microphysiological OoC platforms have the potential to revolutionize drug development and may provide new fundamental insights into development and disease. Over the last decade, bioengineering approaches have led to the development of functionally and structurally highly advanced MPSs for a variety of organs and tissues. To study degenerative retinal diseases and investigate retinal toxicities, an MPS integrating physiologically relevant retinal tissue is of utmost importance. However, it is extremely challenging if not almost impossible to recapitulate the complex stratified (and interconnected) tissue architecture of the human retina solely using engineering approaches, commonly applied in the field. To create a 3D RoC, we addressed this challenge by combining the biological self-assembly capabilities of ROs with the precisely controllable assembly in microfabricated modules provided by engineering strategies. This combination of interdisciplinary approaches enabled us to successfully create a complex multi-layer structure that includes all cell types and layers present in the neuroretinal ROs, connected to an RPE layer. All integrated cell types were thereby derived from the same hiPSCs. For the first time, we demonstrate a retina model successfully recapitulating the precisely orchestrated interaction between photoreceptors and RPE in vitro. This interaction is one of the key characteristics of the visual cycle, and the RPE is essential for the normal function and survival of photoreceptors, for example via an active phagocytic uptake of photoreceptor outer segments (<bold>POS</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kevany and Palczewski, 2010</xref>). In addition, the microfluidic concept of the RoC adds a further important aspect, the vasculature-like perfusion. The precisely controllable perfusion enables the generation of a physiological transport (both towards and away from the tissue) of nutrients, compounds, and metabolic products, the maintenance of stable, constant conditions over long time-periods (e.g. nutrient and metabolites levels/gradients), as well as the capability to probe the secretome and metabolome in a time-resolved manner. Moreover, it makes the system amenable for the interconnection with further organ-systems enabling the study of for example systemic effects. The applicability of the RoC for compound screening and toxicological studies was demonstrated by i) the successful recapitulation of side-effects of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine and ii) the mimicry of gentamicin-induced retinopathy revealing a protective effect of the RPE barrier. Both the tight barrier function of the RPE layer as well as the melanin-binding of GM (known to be protective in ocular pigmented vs. albino animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zemel et al., 1995</xref>) could be the source of this protective effect.</p><p>In comparison to the conventionally employed retinal model system, the introduced RoC features a variety of advantages and novel potential:</p><p>Traditional monolayer cell culture assays have been of limited value in retinal research as they solely include certain cell subtypes, thereby providing a restricted physiological relevance. The more complex ROs solved this issue partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al., 2014</xref>), but were still limited due to the absence of functional interaction with the RPE. Attempts in recreating the retinal niche in the past have failed to recapitulate the precise RPE-PR arrangement, and thus, did not yield matured photoreceptors with large formations of membrane disk-containing outer segments. The RoC platform is able to mimic this particular niche and a physiological interaction of RPE and photoreceptor outer segments (POS), by embedding ROs and RPE in the hyaluronic-based hydrogel in specifically tailored microfluidic chambers. This arrangement is much more physiological and controlled than previous approaches employing an unpredictable and unorganized RPE formation during RO generation. This interphotoreceptor matrix in the RoC provides mechanical stability for the small and fragile developing POS, which would otherwise either be damaged or prevented from outgrowth as in conventional suspension cultures. In the RoC, hence, numerous outer segments facing towards the RPE were formed. The flexible and highly controlled tissue assembly paves the way for the modeling of a variety of disease states, for example by combining ROs derived from patients suffering from retinal diseases with RPE derived from the same or healthy donors.</p><p>Post-mortem human retinal explants are the onlyhuman models that are currently available and achieve a comparable level of complexity. Those ex-vivo models are, however, greatly limited in terms of supply, with respect to long-term culture, and due to inter-patient variability. Moreover, they are not applicable for studies targeting developmental aspects. The introduced RoC system is entirely based on hiPSCs that are easy to expand and to cryo-conserve. This not only avoids the problem of limited supply but also provides the capability to create a multitude of genetically identical systems and sets the foundation for a scale-up to higher throughput systems, provided an appropriate framework and an automated process landscape is established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Probst et al., 2018</xref>). The hiPSC technology further paves the way for the generation of disease-specific as well as patient-specific models opening up future applications in disease modeling and personalized medicine. Additionally, hiPSC derived ROs exhibit the ability to stay viable for more than a year in vitro. This is a crucial aspect in terms of answering developmental aspects, studying disease initialization and progression as well as assessing long-term effects or side effects of drugs.</p><p>Both current in vitro and ex vivo models share one major limitation, the lack of vascularization or vasculature-like perfusion. This aspect of the microfluidic RoC adds a further dimension of physiological relevance and advantage over the conventional models as described above.</p><p>Animal models are so far the only model systems that feature a blood circulation as well as a structural tissue complexity. Yet, besides issues of ethical concerns, results from animal models are often not translatable to humans as none of the small animals used in the field of retina research is able to fully represent the human retinal system. The human genetic background and recapitulation of human retinal tissue structure, hence, provide the potential for the RoC model to overcome those translation hurdles. Animal models, however, still possess structural elements of the visual systems, for example. optical nerve and inner blood-retinal barrier, which cannot be re-created in vitro, so far.</p><p>Taken together, the introduced RoC represents a highly advanced in vitro model, which is not hampered by many of the limitations of conventional (in vitro, ex vivo, in vivo) model systems and which can be the first step towards the reduction and replacement of animal models in the field of ophthalmology. Further development will target challenges of innervation (addition of an optical nerve), incorporation of blood-retinal barriers, the integration into multi-organ platforms, as well as the generation of disease-specific systems.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Summary</title><p>The scarce availability of physiologically relevant in vitro models of the human retina and the limited capability of animal models to recapitulate physiological human responses have i) hampered the development of potential new drugs to treat degenerative diseases such as Stargardt disease, age-related macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa and ii) prevented the detection of retinal toxicities early in the drug pipeline. By combining hiPSC-ROs and -RPE cells in a microphysiological environment, the introduced human RoC system provides a physiologically relevant model system that recapitulates key functionalities of the human retina, which are impaired in patients suffering from retinal degeneration. Due to a toolbox of in situ and ex-situ analysis options, the platform is extremely versatile and features potential applications for drug development, toxicity screening, disease modeling, and personalized medicine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

consists of two Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layers and a porous Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane in between, bonded to a thin glass slide (170 µm). First, PDMS master molds were fabricated. For the media channel mold, SU8-50 photoresist (MicroChem, USA) was spin-coated onto a previously cleaned 4″ silicon wafer to obtain a height of 100 µm. To create the desired structure, the substrate was exposed to 350 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of UV light, followed by development in SU-8 developer (Microresist Technology GmbH, Germany) for 6 min. Finally, the wafer was rinsed with isopropanol and blow-dried using nitrogen. The second wafer for RO and RPE culture was fabricated in two steps. Initially, a base layer of 25 µm for the membrane insert was fabricated by spin-coating a first layer of photoresist SU8. The exposure to UV light, in this case, was 200 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Subsequently, the wafer was developed in SU-8 developer for 4 min, rinsed in isopropanol and blow-dried with nitrogen. Next, the wafer was coated with a second layer of SU8-3025 to fabricate the tissue channels with a height of 40 µm. The wafer was exposed to UV light at 250 mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> for 10 s and developed for 4 min. Afterward, both master molds were silanized with chlorotrimethylsilane (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Subsequently, Sylgard 184 PDMS (Dow Corning, USA) was mixed at a 10:1 ratio of prepolymer to curing agent and molded by using the wafers as a negative master mold. The layer for the media supply was made by exclusion molding followed by curing overnight at 60°C. The RO/RPE culture layer was fabricated by pouring 25 g of the PDMS mixture onto the master mold and curing it overnight at 60°C. Next, the PDMS slabs were peeled off the wafers and the media-supply layers were bonded to a glass slide previously cleaned by a 30 s exposure to oxygen plasma at 50 Watts. Inlets and outlets were punched using a biopsy puncher with a diameter of 0.75 mm. To culture the cells and organoids, four chambers were punched out of the PDMS with a biopsy puncher of 2 mm diameter. Semipermeable membranes with a diameter of 20 mm, made from PET (Sabeu GmbH, Germany) with a pore diameter of 3 µm and a thickness of 10–20 µm, were functionalized using bis-[3-trimethoxysilypropyl]amine (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany). Before assembly, both PDMS layers were cleaned with isopropanol and Scotch tape to remove dust particles. Afterwards, both layers were treated with oxygen plasma at 50 W for 30 s. Then, the membrane was placed into the inlay of the RO/RPE culture layer. Finally, both layers were aligned to each other using a stereo microscope and baked overnight at 60°C to stabilize bonding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>iPSC Culture</title><p>All hiPSC cell lines were derived from healthy donors as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linta et al., 2012</xref>) and tested for stem cell markers and germ-layer differentiation potential.

For re-aggregation, the plate was centrifuged at 400 g for 4 min. On day 1, 80% of the medium was removed and replaced with N2 medium (DMEM/F12 (1:1)+Glutamax supplement (ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), 24 nM sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 16 nM progesterone (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 80 µg/ml human holotransferrin (Serologicals, USA), 20 µg/ml human recombinant insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 88 µM putrescin (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 1x minimum essential media-non essential amino acids (NEAA, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA), 1x antibiotics-antimycotics (AA, ThermoFisher Scientific, USA)).

On day 24, eye fields were detached using 10 µl tips and collected in 10 cm bacterial petri dishes (Greiner Bio One, Germany) with BRDM, adding 10 µM ROCK-Inhibitor Y-27632 for one day. After completed formation, ROs were selected and if necessary detached from non-retinal spheres using microscissors. From day 40 onwards, ROs in BRDM were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and 100 µM taurine (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). From day 70–100, BRDM with FBS and taurine was further supplemented with 1 µM retinoic acid (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), which was reduced to 0.5 µM during days 100–190 and removed afterwards.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Differentiation of retinal pigment epithelial cells</title><p>RPE cells were derived as a product from RO differentiation following (slightly adapted) procedures of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhong et al.

The pigmented areas were collected in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes (Eppendorf, Germany) and washed once with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, no calcium, no magnesium, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). To dissociate the RPE into single cells for adhesion culture, the pigmented spheres were treated with Accumax (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 90 min at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and resuspended every 30 min using a 100 µl pipette. The reaction was stopped using BRDM with 10% FBS followed by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 2 min.

Each well was coated for 2 hr with 50 µg/ml Laminin in DMEM/F12 at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. RPE cells were detached and dissociated using Accumax at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 10–40 min, depending on the adherence and passage of the cells. To remove cell agglomerates, a 70 µm cell strainer was used. As a next step, each well was seeded with RPE at a density of 27 000 cells in a volume of 4.5 µl BRDM supplemented with 10% FBS. RoC were incubated for at least 2 hr at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> to allow RPE cells to adhere to the semipermeable membrane. The medium was changed every day for 1–3 days prior ROs were loaded into the RoCs. ROs were placed onto the RPE covered membrane. Hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel HyStem-C (ESI Bio, USA) was prepared according to the manual and added to the well by pipetting. During culture, the chambers were covered by a sterile adhesive tape (optical adhesive covers, Thermo Fischer Scientific, USA) to avoid evaporation.

Afterwards, the RoCs were perfused with BRDM (5 ml) to wash out the excess dye. Ratiometric calcium-imaging recordings were performed utilizing an upright fluorescence microscope (BX50WI, Olympus, Germany) equipped with a 40x water immersion objective (LUMPlan FL, 40X/0.80W, ∞/0, Olympus), a polychromator (VisiChrome, Till Photonics, Germany) and a CCD camera (RETIGA-R1, 1360 × 1024 pixel, 16 bit). During the calcium-imaging recordings, stacks (single-plane two-channel) of the Fura-2 fluorescence at the focal plane of the ROs photoreceptors were acquired at 10 Hz (λ<sub>exc </sub>= 340 and 380 nm; Olympus U-MNU filter set, 30 milliseconds exposure time, 8-pixel binning) using the VisiView software (Till Photonics, Germany). The calcium-imaging ratio-stacks were generated by dividing the fluorescence images recorded at the excitation wavelengths of F340 and F380 (ImageJ, RatioPlus, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/">https://imagej.nih.gov/</ext-link>). To detect the calcium signals in the RoCs, fluorescent-labeled cells were manually encircled by regions of interest (ROIs) and the obtained ROIs coordinates were used to extract corresponding calcium traces from the ratio-stacks. Average frames of pre- and post-stimulus frames substituted ratio frames during the light stimulation period (using the ImageJ building function Z-projection (‘Average intensity’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Fluorescence intensity quantification</title><p>The fluorescence intensity of the propidium iodid signal was quantified using ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/">https://imagej.nih.gov/</ext-link>) before and after PI labeling using ROI selection and mean intensity pixel values.

Briefly, we created a simplified model of the RoC consisting of the media channel and the four tissue chambers, each with a diameter of 2 mm and a height of 1 mm. The porous PET membrane, between the media channel and tissue chambers, was modeled with a thickness of 10 µm. The incompressible stationary free fluid flow was modeled by the Navier-Stokes equation with the properties of water (dynamic viscosity μ = 1×10<sup>–3</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s, density ρ = 1000 kg/m<sup>3</sup>) and a flow rate of 20 µl/h. Fluid flow from the media channel through the isoporous membrane into the tissue channel was modeled using Darcy’s law (porosity = 0.056, hydraulic permeability κ = 1.45×10<sup>–14</sup> m<sup>2</sup>). The transport of diluted species was described by the time-dependent convection-diffusion with a diffusion coefficient 1 × 10<sup>–9</sup> m<sup>2</sup>/s and an initial concentration of 1 mol/m<sup>3</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>To analyze differences between samples conditions, the two-sided student’s t-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>), the one-way-ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>), the one-way-ANOVA with a Dunnet post-hoc test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b,f,g</xref>) or a two-way-ANOVA with a Bonferroni post-hoc test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8h</xref>) was used.

Despite this positive aspect, the bulk of data presented in the paper are very preliminary and fail to substantiate the main claims made by the authors. First off, one major concern is that this system is presented as a vascularized retina model, which is completely misleading. The acellular perfusion channel described in this model is not at all representative of the vasculature in the retina that is structurally and functionally integrated with other cell/tissue types in a complex 3D environment to maintain homeostasis. The configuration of the system may be used to simulate choroidal vessels but the channel used in this study is significantly divergent from choriocapillaris in vivo.</p><p>The absence of data demonstrating the functionality and benefit of the perfusion channel is another major issue. In the introduction, the lack of vascularization in existing model systems is highlighted as one of the major problems that have motivated this study, but the presented results do not show whether and how the channel structure in the bottom layer serves to make this model superior and more physiological. Control data are nowhere to be found in the manuscript that compare the outcome of cell culture in the presence or absence of flow. On a related note, another critical question that remains unanswered is, is a chip-based system really necessary for this study? As discussed by the authors, MPS and organ-chip models offer numerous novel capabilities (e.g., precise control over the soluble and ECM microenvironment, incorporation and spatial patterning of different cell types, controlled delivery and application of external factors, etc.) not achievable in traditional in vitro models. It is highly questionable whether this study leverages any of these capabilities and whether this system is advantageous over conventional Transwell-based in vitro models. It would be readily possible to establish a similar co-culture model in Transwell inserts and conduct the same assays.</p><p>The claim that this model is the first to recapitulate the interaction between photoreceptor cells and RPEs also raises significant concerns. The phagocytic activity described in the paper is an inherent property of RPEs, and commercial assays exist to measure this function in mono-culture of RPEs using isolated, fluorescently labeled POS. Reproducing this function in the presented model system does not fully support the claim that RPEs interact with the retina organoids. The method of analysis used in this study is also problematic as poor resolution of imaging makes it difficult to interpret the data. It is understandable that the configuration of the device, especially the thickness of the bottom layer, presents challenges to high-resolution imaging analysis. If this really was the case, the poor imaging data seem to suggest the limitation of this chip-based model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Loskill et al., presents a Retinal-on-a-Chip that combines hiPSC-derived retinal organoids composed of all known major retinal subtypes and a monolayer of retinal pigment epithelial in a membrane-based microfluidic device. The paper provided through characterization on both retinal organoids and the retinal epithelium. When integrated, the study clearly demonstrated the functional indigestion of segment structures by the retinal pigment epithelium, which is a functional hallmark of the visual cycle. Furthermore, the Authors demonstrated pharmaceutical testing with an anti-malaria drug and an antibiotic and indicated that the co-culture condition could provide a protective role in the pharmaceutical response. Overall, I think the work is impressive, novel, and would be of great interests to the community. The data are well-presented and the discussions are very extensive and through. My only concern is regarding the utility of perfusion in the existing model. Although the experiments were done on a microfluidic platform, it seems all the experiment could also be performed in a standard transwell to achieve the same result. One potential benefit of perfusion is to maintain paracrine gradient between the retinal organoids and the epithelium. But without the transwell control, it's not clear how significant is this benefit in these experiments. For example, in Figure 5H, where would the condition with the co-culture of organoids and epithelium in a transwell setting be? I certainly see the potential utility of this model, especially by incorporating vasculature and perfusion in the future, which the authors have mentioned. Considering the potential of this platform and the biological finding presented, I think this paper can be accepted for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46188.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this manuscript is interesting and novel enough to warrant further consideration in eLife.

The reviewers agree this issue should be addressed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the benefits of perfusion and the advantage over a transwell model, the authors would like to stress three important points:</p><p>1) To the author's knowledge, no reports of a comparable transwell model exist in scientific literature, to date. Initially, when starting to tackle the issue of a lack of physiological retina models, we considered a variety of possible approaches including a transwell model. However, there are no standard inserts fitting the size of ROs and the generation of defined spacings between ROs and RPE would have not been possible most likely. Moreover, since we did not see any advantages in a transwell style model but only disadvantages such as the missing perfusion, we decided to develop a microfluidic-based solution. In our view, it would be extremely unusual to now develop an additional entirely new system (transwell model), as a control for our introduced novel system, which we did compare to the gold standard dish cultures.</p><p>2) Perfused culture systems have the general advantage of stable and constant culture conditions. In static (transwell) dish cultures, the levels of nutrients and compounds are constantly decreasing and the levels of metabolized and secreted products are constantly increasing in-between media exchanges, leading to sawtooth-like concentration profiles and artificial periodic dynamics. In contrast, microfluidic perfusion provides a constant transport of fresh nutrients and compounds to the cells and of metabolites and secreted factors away from the tissue. This leads not only to physiological conditions (hence, “vasculature-like”) but also generates stable &amp; constant conditions.</p><p>3) Perfusion enables the possibility to generate temporally very controlled exposures to compounds as well as to sample secreted factors in a time-resolved manner. Moreover, it paves the way for future connection to multi-organ-systems that circulate media between different platforms.</p><p>To underline these points, we conducted proof of concept experiments, which we describe in subsection “Physiological secretion kinetics into the vasculature-mimicking channels” and the new Figure 5 and Figure 6—supplement figure 1 as well as Video 2 and Video 3. We monitored the kinetics of the basal VEGF secretion during the stimulation with TGF-ß1 and subsequent washout. Unlike in a static (transwell) culture, the microfluidic RoC allows the continuous sampling of substances without removing/changing medium. We also conducted simulations as well as experiments highlighting the rapid and precisely controllable change of culture conditions and vasculature-like transport processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also necessary to perform a statistical review with an experienced statistician.</p></disp-quote><p>We consulted the experienced statistician Murat Ayhan, Ph.D. (Data Science for Vision Research, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University of Tuebingen) for reviewing the statistics. Along with the reviewer’s suggestion, he suggested changing the statistical testing. It was changed to one-way-ANOVA with a Bonferroni Post-hoc Test (Figure 5H, Figure 7F,G) and a two-way-ANOVA (Figure 7H). The respective statistical paragraph in the method part was changed likewise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clarification on how long the entire structure is stable for and is there further remodelling of the structure with prolonged time in culture?</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted an additional experiment culturing the RoC for 21 days (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) to show the stability of the chip culture. In contrast to a drug-treated cell-death control (10 µg/ml Chloroquine), the tested chips showed low to no levels of Propidium Iodide positive cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The phagocytic activity described in the paper is an inherent property of RPEs, and commercial assays exist to measure this function in mono-culture of RPEs using isolated, fluorescently labeled POS. Reproducing this function in the presented model system does not fully support the claim that RPEs interact with the retina organoids.</p></disp-quote><p>We have to politely disagree with the reviewer. The fact that we observe a phagocytic activity of the RPE ingesting segments from the photoreceptors from the RO does clearly demonstrate the interaction between these two cell types. The phagocytic activity of RPE of isolated POS in mono-cultures is indeed well described. However, the here described phagocytosis of POS shed by the adjacent photoreceptor layer is a much more physiological process and an important aspect of the functionality of retinal tissue.</p><p> <italic>The acellular perfusion channel described in this model is not at all representative of the vasculature in the retina that is structurally and functionally integrated with other cell/tissue types in a complex 3D environment to maintain homeostasis.

The model, however, enables a media perfusion similar to the in vivo blood perfusion through the choroidal vessels (hence referred to as “vasculature-like perfusion”). This constitutes an important functional aspect of the choriocapillaris in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One potential benefit of perfusion is to maintain paracrine gradient between the retinal organoids and the epithelium.

However, as mentioned above, no comparable transwell-based retina model exists, which could serve as a reference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the fluorescent intensity section, the authors should write out the formulas in the proper format.</p></disp-quote><p>A proper format including a more detailed description has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fourth sentence in the Abstract might need to be reworded.</p></disp-quote><p>The sentence was rephrased.</p></body></sub-article></article>
