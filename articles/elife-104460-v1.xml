Primates exhibit particularly complex, differentiated, and multidimensional social relationships, which form interwoven social networks, reflecting both individual social tendencies and specific dyadic interactions. How the patterns of behavior that underlie these social relationships emerge from moment-to-moment patterns of social information processing remains unclear. Here, we assess social relationships among a group of four monkeys, focusing on aggression, grooming, and proximity. We show that individual differences in social attention vary with individual differences in patterns of general social tendencies and patterns of individual engagement with specific partners. Oxytocin administration altered social attention and its relationship to both social tendencies and dyadic relationships, particularly grooming and aggression. Our findings link the dynamics of visual information sampling to the dynamics of primate social networks.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social attention</kwd><kwd>social relationships</kwd><kwd>social engagement</kwd><kwd>individual engagement</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>STI2030-Major Projects</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022ZD0204800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005089</institution-id><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Z210009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070987</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31722025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Yan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Multi-dimensional social relationships dynamically shape attentional biases toward in-group and out-group conspecifics in monkeys, with oxytocin modulating these interactions to reveal neurobiological links between social networks and visual information processing.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Social relationships bear profound significance for both the development and well-being of individuals within a community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Taborsky and Oliveira, 2012</xref>) and the cohesion and long-term success of their groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Testard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Testard et al., 2024</xref>). Primates, including humans, engage in complex social relationships characterized by a wide range of interactions that are both diverse and multifaceted. Proximity serves as a cornerstone of social interaction, with individuals often seeking closeness to one another for communication, bonding, and safety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schutte and Light, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stopczynski et al., 2018</xref>). Grooming is another fundamental behavior for primates, facilitating hygiene maintenance, parasite removal, and the cultivation and maintenance of social bonds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Henazi and Barrett, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Spruijt et al., 1992</xref>). By contrast with these affiliative interactions, aggression supports resource competition and the acquisition and maintenance of dominance rank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hobson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Funkhouser et al., 2018</xref>). The interweaving of individual affiliative and agonistic interactions contributes to the formation of social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hobson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Page, 2015</xref>). Social networks within primate groups can be characterized at multiple levels or scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aureli and Schino, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinde, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grueter et al., 2012</xref>), including broader patterns of social tendencies (e.g. whether a monkey is aloof or highly interactive), as well as individual engagement with specific individuals in that group (e.g. allies, friends, or enemies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hobson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hinde, 1976</xref>). Together these affiliative and agonistic behaviors, both within specific dyads and in the aggregate, create the multi-level tapestry of social relationships in primate groups.</p><p>Primates, including humans, are highly visual animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsao et al., 2003</xref>), and actively sample their environments to acquire useful visual information to guide behavioral decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Krajbich and Rangel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deaner et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Platt, 2002</xref>). From birth, both human and nonhuman primates prioritize acquisition of visual social information, orienting preferentially to faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Deaner et al., 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heywood and Cowey, 1992</xref>), and later during development using the gaze direction of others as a cue to important information in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shepherd and Platt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rosati et al., 2016</xref>). Primates, including humans, also selectively attend to visual cues associated with social dominance and mate quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chance, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Deaner et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shepherd et al., 2006</xref>), as well as emotional states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eastwood et al., 2001</xref>). Neural circuits supporting motivation and attention are intrinsically sensitive to visual social cues to dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Watson and Platt, 2012</xref>), potential mate quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yorzinski and Platt, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Klein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 2010</xref>), and social dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2021</xref>). These observations endorse the idea that the primate brain is ‘tuned’ to support acquisition of visual information to guide adaptive social behavior.</p><p>Recent research highlights associations between social network dynamics and social attention. For example, patterns of grooming relationships predict patterns of mutual gaze in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballesta and Duhamel, 2015</xref>). Similarly, high-status monkeys selectively follow the gaze of other high-status monkeys whereas low-status monkeys follow the gaze of all monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shepherd et al., 2006</xref>). These findings suggest more complex, nuanced, and dynamic relationships between social networks and social attention in primates. A complete understanding of the dynamics of social attention, and its underlying biology, in human, or nonhuman primates, however, will require studying the visual orienting behavior of individuals living in groups whose social network dynamics have been quantitatively characterized.</p><p>In this study, we evaluated social network dynamics in a group of four laboratory macaques that were raised together for several years, based on their patterns of general social tendencies and specific dyadic relationships in proximity, grooming, and aggression. We then removed individuals from the colony to assess basic visual orienting behavior while distracted by images of monkey faces of individuals both within and outside the social group, which were displayed on a computer monitor. Here, we define ‘social engagement’ as the broader patterns of interaction through which individuals express their social tendencies, observable in their interactions with all other members within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bentzur et al., 2021</xref>). By contrast, we define ‘individual engagement’ as the interactions between specific pairs of individuals within the group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aureli and Schino, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bowler et al., 2012</xref>). We examined correlations between patterns of social attention and patterns of overall social engagement with the group, as well as individual engagement with specific partners. This approach offers a quantitative assessment of how these social network dynamics shape patterns of social attention.Overall, we found that patterns of overall social engagement, based on aggression, grooming, and proximity, strongly shaped social attention, especially towards unfamiliar individuals. Furthermore, we found that exogenous administration of the social peptide hormone oxytocin (OT) blunted the impact of social engagement on social attention. By contrast, individual engagement in aggression within specific dyads shaped attention and OT administration increased the influence of aggressive relationships on social attention. Our findings reveal complex and nuanced interactions of multidimensional social relationships with social attention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An evaluation of multi-dimensional social relationships within a colony group</title><p>We assessed the social relationships of four rhesus macaques based on their spontaneous social interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). These four monkeys have resided in the same colony room for a minimum of 4 y. In their daily interactions, they exhibited a rich array of social behaviors, including proximity, grooming, and aggression. These behaviors serve important functions in communication, bonding, conflict resolution, and social organization within monkey facilities and natural habitats alike. These behaviors were measured automatically from video using a multi-stage detection based on YOLOv5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, see Methods for more details), and then evaluated mathematically (as an example dyad depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b and c</xref>). We calculated interaction scores for pairs of monkeys using a dichotomous framework of 1 and –1 as in prior research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Funkhouser et al., 2018</xref>). Individual monkeys gained a social score of 1 for consistently displaying a tendency to approach others more frequently (proximity), receive more grooming from peers, and initiate aggression more frequently (shown by red arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Different behavioral dimensions of social relationships among a group of four monkeys within a colony room.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The diagram depicts the procedure of acquiring social behaviors in various pairs of monkeys in the study.

These models combine the scores of three dimensions of social relationships with independent weights. SEI summarizes the general social tendencies of each monkey based on their overall interactions with the other three individuals in the group. IEI quantifies the interaction tendencies within specific dyadic relationships. For simplicity, we first set all weights to 1 for both SEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h</xref>) and IEI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). This can be done by summing all interaction scores, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref> with arrows indicating from individual with a higher score to one with a lower score. This approach yielded a quantitative account of social interactions, considering both the overall relationships and specific dyadic partnerships. For example, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, Monkey A exhibited stronger social cohesion with Monkey K, as measured by higher frequency of proximity. Nevertheless, when aggregating the proximity scores from all partners (Monkey K, L, and C), Monkey A had the weakest overall social cohesion, with a total proximity score of –1. Indeed, it was lower than Monkey K, who had a total score of 1 within the group. Three out of the four monkeys in the group (Monkey C, K, and A), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, had individual engagement indices (colored symbols) that were not in line with their social engagement indices (gray open symbols). Hence, we use both SEI and IEI to understand the complexity of a social network.

In this task, a white square served as the visual target and the monkey had to maintain his gaze on it. A trial commenced with a fixation target appearing in the center of the screen for 800–1200 ms. In the social interference task (96% trials), an image (the distractor) was randomly presented eccentric either on the right or left side for 100 ms. After the first 50ms, a white gaze target was randomly illuminated either in the same hemifield as the distractor (congruent) or in the opposite hemifield (incongruent). Distractors were randomly selected from pictures of the faces of his three groupmates, pictures of the faces of three monkeys with whom he had no social interactions, or scrambled versions of these same face images. Each distractor had an equal chance of being presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Individuals’ social attention in response to the social interference task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The experimental design encompasses both social interference trails and visual motor trials.

Next, we calculated distractor biases for the four subject monkeys when exposed to in-group and out-group monkey faces on individual experimental days. Distractor biases towards in-group monkey faces were significantly smaller than those towards out-group faces, across monkey subjects, on all experimental days (n=4 monkey subjects ×12 experimental days, p=1.45 × 10<sup>–7</sup>).

Our experiments are limited by the fact that we only used 6 monkey faces as stimuli for both the in-group and out-group. Thus, the specific face pictures used might bias the observed differences between in-group and out-group faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>). To address this potential confound, we randomly withdrew a single image from an in-group monkey and one from an out-group monkey from the dataset, and reanalyzed distractor biases from the left two pictures of faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2a</xref>). For each individual subject, this resulted in three sets of two distractors from the in-group or out-group monkey faces. Then, we have got 81(3<sup>4</sup>) combinations from four monkey subjects, and finally a total of 81(3<sup>4</sup>) × 81(3<sup>4</sup>) combinations of subjects and distractors from both in-group and out-group. Within each combination, we statistically measured the difference of distractor biases towards the left two pictures from in-group and out-group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>, for 99.30% of the 6561 combinations distractor biases towards in-group monkey faces were significant less than those towards out-group faces (Two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p&lt;0.05). Thus, differences in social attention towards in-group and out-group monkeys are not likely driven by a specific picture in our stimulus set.</p><p>We next examined how general social tendencies of four monkey subjects varied with attentional capture by faces of in-group and out-group monkeys. We found that attention towards images of both in-group and out-group monkeys was highly correlated with the social engagement scores on three dimensions of social relationships: aggression, grooming and proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a–f</xref>). The correlation coefficients varied across them, with aggression demonstrating the highest correlation with r values of about –0.8. Grooming exhibited a lower correlation compared to aggression, while proximity was the least correlated of the three.</p><p>We computed SEIs using a linear model with an independent weight setting for each dimension (see Methods for details), which summarized these three dimensions within the network of social engagement. We computed the best-fit weights to quantify how social attention varied towards in-group and out-group monkey faces as a function of subjects’ social relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d–g</xref>). The range of each <italic>ω</italic> was constrained to vary between 0 and 1, with a step size of 0.02. The correlations under different sets of <italic>ω<sub>a</sub></italic>, <italic>ω<sub>g</sub></italic>, and <italic>ω<sub>p</sub></italic> were calculated based on social attention towards in-group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) and out-group faces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). The best-fit weights were chosen by searching for the values of <italic>ω<sub>f</sub></italic>, <italic>ω<sub>g</sub></italic>, and <italic>ω<sub>p</sub></italic>, that maximized the correlations (with smallest negative r values) between distractor biases and SEIs. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f and g</xref>, the ‘best’ weights for aggression, grooming, and proximity (<italic>ω<sub>a</sub></italic>, <italic>ω<sub>g</sub></italic>, and <italic>ω<sub>p</sub></italic>) were 0.34, 0.54, and 0.58, respectively, when monkeys viewed distractors drawn from in-group monkeys. The set of ‘best’ weights were 0.48, 0.62, and 0.92 when monkeys viewed distractors drawn from out-group monkeys. These weights of three dimensions for in-group data are smaller than those for out-group data. Comparing the weights for in-group and out-group distractors, the effect of proximity was larger than that of aggression and grooming. Then, the SEI was defined by these ‘best’ weights on three dimensions of social relationships.</p><p>We next examined the correlation between distractor biases and the SEIs determined by the corresponding weights. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3h</xref>, the yellow line indicates the correlation towards in-group with a slope of –26.22, whereas the green line indicates the correlation towards the out-group with a slope of –20.76. The difference of first saccade probability between intact and scrambled face pictures also showed a negative association with the SEIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a-f</xref>, two-sided Pearson’s correlation coefficient, in-group: <italic>r</italic>=–0.71, p=1.21 × 10<sup>–23</sup>; out-group: <italic>r</italic>=–0.73, p=1.12 × 10<sup>–25</sup>). Differences in the SEIs between any two monkeys can serve as an indicator of the magnitude of general social tendencies within the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>). The impact of social engagement was smaller when monkeys viewed distractors from in-group (orange lines) compared to those from out-group monkeys (green lines). The average difference of the SEIs dropped significantly from 2.67±1.32–1.95±0.99 from out-group to in-group (paired Student’s t-test, p=0.01). However, there was no relationship between the SEIs and performance in visual motor trials without a monkey face distractor, effectively ruling out any impacts of social tendencies on general oculomotor functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>, two-sided Pearson’s correlation coefficient, in-group: p=0.08; out-group: p=0.18). Together, these findings indicate that behavioral tendencies that in aggregate define social networks dynamically shape monkeys’ attention to social cues.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Oxytocin blunts the impact of general social tendencies on social attention</title><p>Oxytocin (OT) is an endogenous peptide hormone that regulates crucial components of mammalian reproductive systems and influences social behavior more broadly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Olff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang and Platt, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jiang and Platt, 2018b</xref>).

In this study, our goal was to probe links between social relationships among four monkeys in a group and behavioral performance in a separate computerized attention task. We specifically investigated how potentially distracting pictures of in-group and out-group monkeys impacted performance of a simple visual orienting task. We focused on three dimensions of social interactions (aggression, grooming, and proximity) at two distinct levels (general tendencies vs. dyadic relationships) and analyzed correlations with task performance. We mathematically assessed how social tendencies within the group, as well as specific dyadic relationships, varied with attentional capture by social stimuli. We also explored how the social peptide hormone oxytocin influenced the impact of multi-dimensional social relationships on social attention. Our findings offer insights into how social attention varies with both general social tendencies and specific dyadic relationships, thereby exposing links between visual social information processing and the dynamics of social networks in primate groups. Our study revealed that social attention is sensitive to group membership and reflects multi-dimensional social relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Social attention reflected both general social tendencies (SEIs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>) and individual dyadic relationships (IEIs, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), even for the same social cues (e.g. in-group). Our work provides a nuanced perspective on the mechanisms mediating the acquisition and use of social information.</p><p>Neural processes that distinguish in-group and out-group conspecifics presumably evolved because cooperation within groups conferred survival advantages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ten Velden et al., 2017</xref>). Individuals who formed strong bonds within their group were better equipped to secure resources, protect against predators, and navigate social hierarchies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jablonski, 2021</xref>). Consequently, abilities for recognizing and favoring in-group members, as well as kin, are thought to have evolved as adaptive strategies that maximize fitness and maintain social cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bergman et al., 2003</xref>). These adaptations can manifest as both in-group favoritism and out-group dislike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brewer, 1999</xref>). Such biases foster solidarity and cooperation within a group, but can also fuel intergroup conflict, prejudice, and discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Halevy et al., 2008</xref>). Here, we found that monkeys spontaneously differentiate members of their own social group (in-group) from those outside their group (out-group) when performing a simple visual orienting task. This distinction was evident in heightened vigilance towards the faces of out-group monkeys compared to those of in-group monkeys (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, this tendency varied among individuals. Monkeys who were less social, as defined by lower SEIs, showed greater vigilance to out-group monkeys. On the other hand, the most social monkey, defined by the highest SEI within the group, was equally vigilant to in-group and out-group monkeys. These findings suggest that individual variation in sensitivity to group membership will be key for understanding the complexities of social networks in both humans and animals.</p><p>Oxytocin is fundamental to parturition in females and is released during lactation to promote bonding between mothers and infants. This peptide hormone also plays a crucial role in shaping social development and promoting prosocial behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Putnam et al., 2016</xref>). Oxytocin also impacts social behavior in males by influencing intra-group affinity, coordination, trust, and empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">De Dreu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Burkhart et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgartner et al., 2008</xref>). Both male and female chimpanzees have shown increased levels of oxytocin before and after intergroup conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Samuni et al., 2017</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that oxytocin influences in-group and out-group behavioral dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Dreu, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">De Dreu et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, oxytocin enhances empathy and cooperation towards in-group conspecifics but increases competitiveness and hostility towards individuals from other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shamay-Tsoory and Abu-Akel, 2016</xref>). Our study demonstrates that oxytocin administration increases attention towards out-group individuals, while simultaneously blunting vigilance towards in-group individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), consistent with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang and Platt, 2018a</xref>). These impacts were strongest for individual variation in prosocial tendencies indexed by grooming behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). These findings resonate with prior work showing that individual variation in oxytocin concentration predicts social functioning in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parker et al., 2014</xref>) and that exogenous administration of oxytocin only improves social function in children with low endogenous levels of the peptide hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Primate brains evolved to navigate the demands of living in a complex social environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dunbar and Shultz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cheney et al., 1986</xref>). A growing body of evidence indicates both brain structure and function reflect social behavioral complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sallet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Testard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sliwa and Freiwald, 2017</xref>). For example, the so-called ‘social brain network’ varies in physical size as a function of both social network size and social status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Testard et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kanai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noonan et al., 2014</xref>). Such structural variation may both reflect and impact biological success. For example, rhesus monkeys who become more tolerant and friendly, thereby expanding their social networks, are more likely to survive natural disasters and subsequently degraded environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Testard et al., 2024</xref>). Our study unveiled subtle variation in social information processing as a function of both general social tendencies and specific dyadic social relationships, which we hypothesize arise from variation in the structure and function of components of the social brain network.</p><p>We further hypothesize that oxytocin serves as a gain control mechanism that regulates social information processing thereby shaping multi-dimensional social relationships via distinct but interacting neural pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Froemke and Young, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arakawa, 2021</xref>). OT modulation of meso-cortico-limbic circuitry facilitates approach-oriented behaviors related to affiliation, familiarity, and trust, particularly towards groupmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Dreu, 2012</xref>). Oxytocin also modulates cortico-amygdala circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Striepens et al., 2012</xref>), resulting in anxiolysis and reductions in fear-motivated action towards groupmates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Dreu et al., 2015</xref>), but heightened vigilance and defensive aggression towards out-group conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">De Dreu and Kret, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Dreu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harari-Dahan and Bernstein, 2014</xref>). Our findings are consistent with this body of evidence and help to elucidate how social perception and attention vary with and potentially support multi-dimensional social relationships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f, k</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e-h</xref>). The diverse impacts found here might be linked to many brain pathways, encompassing both the meso-cortico-limbic and cortico-amygdala circuitries. Our findings thus help to elucidate the links between the dynamics of multi-faceted social networks and the dynamics of visual attention through neuromodulatory gain control mechanisms. However, these conclusions may be constrained by the relatively small sample size and the homogeneity of a stimulus set in the study. Future research focusing on larger, more diverse cohorts and incorporating a broader range of stimuli will enhance the generalizability and applicability of the findings.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Four adult male rhesus macaques (<italic>Macaca mulatta,</italic> 8–13 y old, 10–12 kg) served as subjects in this study.

We used the LabelMe tool to translate the video data into image data. We randomly chose 396 images from four monkeys as the training dataset, and labeled them according to monkeys’ different behaviors: postures (upright, sitting or lying), head orientation, and rump orientation. The YOLOv5 model was used to extract the monkeys’ behavior by detecting frame by frame. After training, we checked the evaluation indicators of this model, including loss value of YOLOv5 in the training process, changes of mAP, confusion matrix. and PR curve. And, we found the YOLOv5 worked effectively on the dataset with mean average precision (IoU = 0.5) of 0.97 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The behavior performances of each subject in any given dyad were identified as three dimensions of social behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d–f</xref>): proximity (approach more-approach less), grooming (groomee-groomer), aggression (aggressor-victim). To ensure accuracy, we also had two observers—one animal caretaker and one lab member, both blind to the research purposes — independently mark monkey social behaviors from representative videos for all possible monkey dyads. Their identifications of behavior aligned well with the automatic detections.</p><p>Then, we graded clearly delineated antagonistic engagements in a 1 and –1 dichotomous fashion. In any dyad of interaction sessions, one monkey was deemed score 1 to the other if their actions occurred more times in one direction than in the other, such as showing more proximity, receiving more grooming, and initiating a physical aggression more frequently, while the other one was scored –1. Aggressive behaviors unfold with remarkable swiftness, with reciprocal responses occurring on a timescale measured in seconds. Therefore, we initially employed YOLOv5 for temporal assessment, followed by manual determination of the initiation sequence of attacks. Subsequently, we meticulously recorded the durations during which each party actively initiated aggression, thereby discerning the victor and vanquished in instances of aggressive behavior. If there were no related social interactions happened, both of them gained zero as their interaction scores.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Visual orienting task</title><p>Visual stimuli were presented at a refresh rate of 100 Hz on a monitor (VG278Q ASUS, China) positioned 40 cm from the monkey.

In the daily experiments, a 0.5° white square was served as a target. A trial began with the target located in the center of the black screen (RGB: 0, 0, 0) for a variable period of 800–1200 ms to minimize anticipatory movements, and monkeys were required to fixate within an invisible 2° × 2° window. Every 50 trials were served as a session including forty-eight social interference trials (96%) and two visuo-motor trials (4%) for data evaluation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). In the social interference task, a 7° circled picture was randomly presented 18° eccentric either on the right or left and briefly flashed as a distractor for 100ms. After the first 50 ms, the white target relocated 14° from center point on one of two locations: congruent (same hemifield with distractor) or incongruent (opposite hemifield), to guide saccadic eye movements. In the visual-motor task, only the target was randomly presented on one of hemifield without a distractor interference in order to assess monkeys’ behavioral performances. All social interference and visual-motor trials were introduced in a random order and one time in a session. All sessions were continuously run in an experimental day without pause. Thus, monkeys could be incapable to detect the testing session. Once monkeys made a correct saccade to the target within an interval of 300 ms from the target relocation, a few droplets of liquid were delivered as reward.</p><p>Distractors were composed of seven face pictures from different monkeys and their scrambled images and adjusted their luminance to 54.67±2.69 cd/m<sup>2</sup>.

All face pictures were well controlled with a neutral expression and forward gaze, and subtended by a 7° circle. Prior to this study, all these distractors have been daily introduced to four subjects as a target to evoke visual guided saccadic eye movements for 8 wk.

Eye signals were sampled at 1 kHz and stored for analysis offline. Eye traces in each trial were inspected by a custom-built MATLAB program and then manually reviewed. The identification of saccadic eye movements was based on velocity and acceleration thresholds (velocity, 50°/s; acceleration, 500°/s<sup>2</sup>).

Saccadic eye movements were quantified in terms of the response time (the latency of saccade to the target) and the initial eye movement direction profile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Drifting time and distractor bias</title><p>To evaluate the effects of the monkey face on saccadic eye movements, we calculated the drifting time (DT) between the saccadic latencies when the distractor was a monkey face picture  <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> or its scrambled image <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> in a certain visual condition (congruent or incongruent) on each experimental session:<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Furthermore, we found that our data were consistent with prior research: the congruent distractor accelerated the saccadic eye movement, whereas the incongruent distractor delayed saccade initiation.

The authors assessed general social tendencies and dyadic relationships among four monkeys in a group by scoring agonistic (aggression) and affiliative (grooming and proximity) behaviors in each pair. By measuring the saccadic reaction time in a classic social interference task, the authors reported that the monkeys with higher SEIs (i.e., more social individuals) were less distracted by the faces of other monkeys.

The statement in page 8 refers to the relative impact of different social behaviors—proximity, aggression, and grooming—on the derived weights for in-group and out-group distractors. Specifically, the data suggest that proximity exerts a stronger influence than aggression or grooming in differentiating the effects of out-group versus in-group distractors. Regarding the out-group condition, we acknowledge that it presents challenges for direct behavioral observation, as interactions involving out-group members are often more difficult to quantify in naturalistic settings. However, we agree with you about the suggestion to test certain in-group effects, particularly those influenced by oxytocin (OT), as they offer a more controlled framework to validate and interpret the observed differences in weights across experimental conditions. In line with this, we examined specific in-group behaviors under OT administration to disentangle their contributions to attentional dynamics (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5 e to h). By integrating controlled experimental manipulations, we think these results could provide deeper insights into how social relationships shape the observed patterns of attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I think it is important to provide how variable spontaneous social interactions were across sessions and how impactful the variability of the interactions is on the SEI and IEI, as it helps to understand how meaningful the differences of weights are across the conditions, but such data are missing.

As highlighted, we utilized the entire experimental period as the dataset to evaluate the monkeys' social interactions. The experiments presented in Figures 3 and 4 were designed to examine how social relationships correlate with patterns of social attention under two distinct conditions: without manipulation (Fig. 3) and with nebulized exposure to oxytocin and saline (Fig. 4). Theoretically, the weights observed in the unmanipulated condition and the nebulized saline condition should be similar. However, our results indicate that distractor biases shifted significantly following nebulized saline exposure (Fig. 4) compared to the unmanipulated condition (Fig. 3) (MK: p = 9.3×10<sup>-3</sup>, ML: p = 9.77×10<sup>-4</sup>, MC: p = 9.77×10<sup>-4</sup>, MA: p = 0.09; n<sub>1</sub> = n<sub>2</sub> = 12 experimental days; Two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test). This suggests that the nebulization process itself, despite acclimating the monkeys to saline exposure for approximately two weeks prior to the experiments, still influenced their attentional behaviors.</p><p>While the primary goal of nebulization was to assess the effects of oxytocin on social attention, our main conclusions remain robust, even considering the impact of nebulization on distractor biases. We acknowledge that variability in spontaneous social interactions across days or experimental sessions could be an important factor influencing the SEI and IEI. The dynamic nature of social interactions within the colony is likely affected by numerous variables. Future research will aim to integrate these factors into a more comprehensive and dynamic framework to better interpret their influence on social attention metrics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The study's conclusions are based on observations of only four monkeys, which limits the generalizability of the findings.

We acknowledge that the relatively small sample size could influence the generalizability of the findings. However, despite this limitation, our work systematically examined multifaceted social relationships among monkeys and their attentional strategies within a well-controlled experimental setup. We reported results across sessions and conditions (e.g., in-group vs. out-group; saline vs. Oxytocin), which strengthens the reliability of the observed effects of social networks within this context. We agree that increasing the sample size would improve the generalizability of the results. Future studies with a larger cohort will be critical for confirming the robustness of our findings and expanding their broader applicability. We have acknowledged this limitation in the revised manuscript and highlighted the potential for further research with larger sample sizes to validate and extend our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The limited set of stimulus images (in-group and out-group faces) may introduce unintended biases. This could be addressed by increasing the diversity of stimuli or incorporating a broader range of out-group members.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. We acknowledge that the use of a limited set of six monkey faces as stimuli for in-group and out-group conditions could potentially introduce biases. To address this concern, we conducted an additional analysis to minimize the potential impact of individual images on our findings using the current dataset. Specifically, we randomly excluded one in-group and one out-group image and reanalyzed distractor biases using the remaining two images (Supplementary Fig. 3a). For each subject, this approach generated three sets of two distractors per group, resulting in 81(3<sup>4</sup>) combinations across four monkey subjects, and a total of 81 × 81 subject-distractor pairings. We statistically compared distractor biases between in-group and out-group faces for each combination (Supplementary Fig. 3b). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 3c, 99.30% of the 6,561 combinations demonstrated significantly lower distractor biases towards in-group faces compared to out-group faces (two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that the observed differences in social attention between in-group and out-group monkeys are unlikely to be driven by specific images within the stimulus set. That said, we agree that increasing the diversity of stimulus images or incorporating a broader range of out-group members would improve the generalizability of the results. We have acknowledged this limitation in the revised manuscript and highlighted the potential for further research to incorporate a more diverse stimulus set to validate and extend our findings.</p><p>“However, these conclusions may be constrained by the relatively small sample size and the homogeneity of stimulus set in the study. Future research focusing on larger, more diverse cohorts and incorporating a broader range of stimuli will enhance the generalizability and applicability of the findings.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>It is difficult to distinguish &quot;Getting fighted&quot; and &quot;Fighting partner&quot; in Fig. 1b (esp. when printed). I thought Actor showed &quot;Fighting partner&quot; several times in Session 2, but it seems to be &quot;Getting fighted&quot; judging from Figs. 1c and 1d. Is this correct? If so, I would suggest to change the color to improve visibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable comment. We apologize for the confusion in the previous version. To improve clarity, we have both terms to “begin fighting” and “being fought”. As shown in Figure 1b, we now explicitly define the identities of the two monkeys as the actor (K) and the partner (L), with all behaviors described from the perspective of the actor. For example, when the actor (K) initiates the fight, it is marked as “begin fighting”, whereas when the partner (L) initiates the fight, the actor (K) is the recipient and labeled as “being fought”. Additionally, we have implemented your suggestion by changing the colors to enhance visibility, especially for the terms “begin fighting” and “being fought”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I have some minor concerns:</p><p>(1) Figure1B, caption for x axis is missing, 4 means 4 days?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for the comment. We have clarified the x-axis in Figure 1B, where the label &quot;4&quot; corresponds to 4 hours of video typing on each experimental day. The revised figure now includes the appropriate label for better clarity. We appreciate your careful attention to this detail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I am slightly concerned about animal safety. How do the experimenters ensure the animals' safety and well-being in cases of aggressive interactions or attacks?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. We share your concern regarding animal safety and take re the well-being of the monkeys in the study. All experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IBP-NHP-002(22)). The monkeys were housed together in the same colony room for over four years, in interconnected cages that allowed for direct physical interaction. Animal behaviors in cages were closely monitored via a live video system to ensure their safety. To prevent potential injuries, a sliding partition system was in place, enabling the isolation of individual animals when necessary, minimizing risks to their well-being.</p></body></sub-article></article>
