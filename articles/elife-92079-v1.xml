To this end, the age-typical loss of sensory acuity might in part be compensated for by an individual’s preserved attentional neural filtering. Is such a compensatory brain–behaviour link longitudinally stable? Can it predict individual change in listening behaviour? We here show that individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories modelling electroencephalographic and behavioural data of <italic>N</italic> = 105 ageing individuals (39–82 y). First, despite the expected decline in hearing-threshold-derived sensory acuity, listening-task performance proved stable over 2 y. Second, neural filtering and behaviour were correlated only within each separate measurement timepoint (T1, T2). Longitudinally, however, our results raise caution on attention-guided neural filtering metrics as predictors of individual trajectories in listening behaviour: neither neural filtering at T1 nor its 2-year change could predict individual 2-year behavioural change, under a combination of modelling strategies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Humans are social animals. Communicating with other humans is vital for our social wellbeing, and having strong connections with others has been associated with healthier aging. For most humans, speech is an integral part of communication, but speech comprehension can be challenging in everyday social settings: imagine trying to follow a conversation in a crowded restaurant or decipher an announcement in a busy train station. Noisy environments are particularly difficult to navigate for older individuals, since age-related hearing loss can impact the ability to detect and distinguish speech sounds. Some aging individuals cope better than others with this problem, but the reason why, and how listening success can change over a lifetime, is poorly understood.</p><p>One of the mechanisms involved in the segregation of speech from other sounds depends on the brain applying a ‘neural filter’ to auditory signals. The brain does this by aligning the activity of neurons in a part of the brain that deals with sounds, the auditory cortex, with fluctuations in the speech signal of interest. This neural ‘speech tracking’ can help the brain better encode the speech signals that a person is listening to.</p><p>Tune and Obleser wanted to know whether the accuracy with which individuals can implement this filtering strategy represents a marker of listening success. Further, the researchers wanted to answer whether differences in the strength of the neural filtering observed between aging listeners could predict how their listening ability would develop, and determine whether these neural changes were connected with changes in people’s behaviours.</p><p>To answer these questions, Tune and Obleser used data collected from a group of healthy middle-aged and older listeners twice, two years apart. They then built mathematical models using these data to investigate how differences between individuals in the brain and in behaviours relate to each other. The researchers found that, across both timepoints, individuals with stronger neural filtering were better at distinguishing speech and listening. However, neural filtering strength measured at the first timepoint was not a good predictor of how well individuals would be able to listen two years later. Indeed, changes at the brain and the behavioural level occurred independently of each other.</p><p>Tune and Obleser’s findings will be relevant to neuroscientists, as well as to psychologists and audiologists whose goal is to understand differences between individuals in terms of listening success. The results suggest that neural filtering guided by attention to speech is an important readout of an individual’s attention state. However, the results also caution against explaining listening performance based solely on neural factors, given that listening behaviours and neural filtering follow independent trajectories.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EEG</kwd><kwd>ageing</kwd><kwd>speech perception</kwd><kwd>auditory attention</kwd><kwd>neural speech tracking</kwd><kwd>latent change score models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-CoG-2014-646696</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Obleser</surname><given-names>Jonas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Individual listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow independent developmental trajectories in a large, <italic>N</italic> = 105, cohort of ageing individuals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Speech comprehension is an essential aspect of human communication, enabling us to understand and interact with others effectively. Preserved communication is therefore critical to social well-being and healthy ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lindenberger, 2014</xref>). Any translational advance aimed at maintaining and restoring successful cognitive ageing crucially relies on understanding the factors that explain and predict individual trajectories of listening performance. However, the evidence on these potential factors is astonishingly limited.</p><p>As we age, our ability to comprehend speech can decline due to age-related changes in the auditory system (i.e. sensory acuity) and in cognitive resources. Age-related hearing loss reduces the ability to detect and discriminate speech sounds, especially in noisy environments. However, it has long been recognised that increasing age and hearing loss cannot fully account for the considerable degree of inter-individual differences observed in listening behaviour and its lifespan change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akeroyd, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Houtgast and Festen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Humes et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that promote successful speech comprehension by implementing ‘neural filters’ that segregate behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds. Such neural filter mechanisms act by selectively increasing the sensory gain for behaviourally relevant inputs or by inhibiting the processing of irrelevant inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cherry, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Broadbent, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wöstmann et al., 2020</xref>). A growing body of evidence suggests that speech comprehension is neurally supported by an attention-guided filter mechanism that modulates sensory gain and arises from primary auditory and perisylvian brain regions: by synchronising its neural activity with the temporal structure of the speech signal of interest, the brain ‘tracks’ and thereby better encodes behaviourally relevant auditory inputs to enable attentive listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ding and Simon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zion Golumbic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lakatos et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In a large age-varying cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 155; 39–80 y), we have previously shown how the fidelity of this neural filtering strategy can help explain differences in listening behaviour (i) from individual to individual and (ii) within individuals from sentence to sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">O’Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mesgarani and Chang, 2012</xref>). As participants performed a challenging dual-talker listening task, we recorded their electroencephalogram (EEG). We observed that enhanced neural filtering—defined as stronger neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech—led to more accurate and overall faster responses. Notably, we observed both neural filtering as well as its link to behaviour to be independent of chronological age and severity of hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of key assumptions and research questions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Listening behaviour at a given timepoint is shaped by an individual’s sensory and neural functioning.

They also provide fruitful ground for scientific inquiries into the translational potential of neural markers. However, the potency of neural markers to predict future behavioural outcomes is often only implicitly assumed but seldom put to the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Woo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using auditory cognition as a model system, we here aim to overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success. Going further, we ask to what extent an individual’s attentional neural-filtering ability measured at a given moment is able to predict their future trajectory in listening performance. Only if this is the case, and only if such an association can plausibly be assumed to be causal for future changes in communication ability, neural filtering would be a potential translational target.</p><p>We here aim to fill this gap by analysing 2-year changes in the sensory, neural, and behavioural domain in a longitudinal subsample (<italic>N</italic> = 105; 39–82 y) of the original AUDADAPT cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

More importantly, we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied 2-year period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, Q1), and whether ageing individuals differ significantly in their degree of change (Q2). We expect individuals’ hearing acuity and behaviour to decrease from T1 to T2. Since we previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering to be independent of age and hearing status, we did not expect any systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering.</p><p>Second, we test the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss-independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To this end, we analyse the multivariate direct and indirect relationships of hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening behaviour within and across timepoints.</p><p>Third, leveraging the strengths of latent change score modelling (LCSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McArdle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>), we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways: we ask whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change (Q3), and whether 2-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour (Q4). Here, irrespective of the observed magnitude and direction of T1–T2 developments, two scenarios are conceivable: Intra-individual neural and behavioural change may be either be correlated—lending support to a compensatory role of neural filtering—or instead follow independent trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oschwald et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Answering these questions is vital for understanding the neurobiological mechanisms of successful communication across the lifespan. Answering them will also critically inform the development of interventions targeted at maintaining or restoring communication success and therefore concerns basic and applied researchers alike.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We studied an age-varying cohort of healthy middle-aged and older adults longitudinally (<italic>N</italic> = 105, 39–82 y, median age at T2: 63 y). The mean time difference between the two measurement timepoints reported here was 23.2 (SD: 4.0) mo. We characterise the multivariate relationship of key measures of sensory, neural, and behavioural functioning to explain and predict individual trajectories of listening performance.</p><p>At each of two measurement timepoints, participants underwent audiological assessment followed by EEG recording during which they performed a difficult dual-talker dichotic listening task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alavash et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alavash et al., 2019</xref>). In each trial of the task, participants listened to two temporally aligned but spatially separated five-word sentences. They then had to identify the final word in one of the two sentences from a visual array of four alternatives given a 4 s time limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In 50% of the trials, a visual spatial-attention cue indicated the side of target sentence presentation, the other half of trials were preceded by an uninformative neutral cue.</p><p>We extracted individuals’ mean accuracy and response speed (calculated as the inverse of reaction time) as key readouts of listening behaviour. On the basis of source-localised 1–8 Hz auditory cortical activity, we further quantified individuals’ neural filtering ability as their attention-guided neural tracking of relevant vs. irrelevant speech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref> and ‘Materials and methods’ for details). Our main analyses focus on neural filtering and listening performance averaged across all trials and thereby also across two separate spatial-attention conditions. This choice allowed us to most directly probe the trait-like nature and relationships of neural filtering. It was additionally supported by our previous observation of a general boost in behavioural performance with stronger neural filtering, irrespective of spatial attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We follow a three-step analysis strategy to address our specific research questions. First, we provide a largely descriptive overview of the observed average 2-year change per studied domain. Second, we follow up on this fundamental analysis with a causal mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imai et al., 2010</xref>) and single-trial mixed-effect model analysis geared to assess the longitudinal stability of our recently reported effects of age, hearing acuity, and neural filtering on listening task performance. Third, we integrate and extend the first two analysis perspectives in a joint LCSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McArdle, 2009</xref>) to most directly probe the role of neural filtering ability as a predictor of future attentive listening ability. Addressing our key change-related research questions at the latent rather than the manifest level supersedes the manual calculation of notoriously noisy differences scores and effectively removes the influence of each metric’s reliability on the estimation of change-related relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McArdle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Listening performance remains stable despite decreased hearing acuity</title><p>In a first analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we characterised how hearing acuity, neural filtering, and listening performance change across the middle to older adult lifespan.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (bottom-left panel), magnitude and direction of observed longitudinal change are highly variable across individuals and age groups, and we did not find evidence of any systematic group-level change from T1 to T2 (β = 0.001, SE = 0.001, p=0.16). In addition, individual neural filtering strength correlated only weakly across time (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, p=0.03).</p><p>We also assessed the reliability of two established neural traits using resting-state EEG from the same recording sessions: the individual alpha frequency (IAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corcoran et al., 2018</xref>) and the slope of 1/f neural noise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Voytek et al., 2015</xref>).

Given the moderately strong correlation of age and hearing acuity (<italic>r</italic> = –0.43; p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), we employed causal mediation analysis to model the direct as well as the hearing-acuity-mediated effect of age on the behavioural outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). To formally test the stability of direct and indirect relationships across time, we used a moderated mediation analysis. In this analysis, the inclusion of interactions by timepoint tested whether the influence of age, sensory acuity, and neural filtering on behaviour varied significantly across time.</p><p>Our expectations on the direct relationships were indeed borne out by the data: higher age was associated with poorer hearing ability (β = –0.43, SE = 0.09, p&lt;0.001) and listening performance (speed: β = –0.33, SE = 0.06, p&lt;0.001; accuracy: β = –0.26, SE = 0.06, p&lt;0.001). Better hearing ability, on the other hand, boosted accuracy but not response speed (accuracy: β = 0.30, SE = 0.1, p<italic>=</italic>0.003; speed: β = –0.06, SE = 0.1, p=0.56). These direct effects remained stable from T1 to T2 (all interactions by timepoint p&gt;0.56; all log Bayes factors [logBF<sub>01</sub>] &gt;2.5).</p><p>Age also impacted accuracy indirectly: the total effect of age was partially mediated via its detrimental effect on hearing acuity (average causal mediation effect [ACME], β = –0.12, SE = 0.04, p&lt;0.001). We did not find evidence for an analogous indirect effect on speed (ACME: β = 0.008, SE = 0.03, p=0.77). Again, the hearing-acuity-mediated effect of age on accuracy did not change from T1 to T2 as evidenced by moderated mediation analysis (interaction by timepoint p=0.73).</p><p>Speaking to the robustness of our previous results, we observed the beneficial effect of stronger neural filtering fidelity on both measures of listening performance (accuracy: β = 0.21, SE = 0.09, p=0.02; speed: β = 0.33, SE = 0.09, p&lt;0.001). Note that the magnitude of this direct brain–behaviour effect is comparable to that of the direct effect of age. Alternative models that included indirect, neural filtering-mediated paths from either age or hearing acuity to behaviour did not reveal any significant mediation effects.</p><p>Most importantly, the longitudinal stability of the observed direct brain–behaviour link was further supported by the absence of any significant changes with time (interactions by timepoint; all p&gt;0.28, all logBF<sub>01</sub> &gt; 2.1).</p><p>In our previous T1 analysis (<italic>N</italic> = 155) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>), we had found evidence for the here analysed brain–behaviour link at two different levels of observation: (i) at the trait level—individuals with overall stronger neural filtering also performed better overall—and (ii) at the state level—stronger neural filtering in a given trial raised the chances of responding correctly. Aiming at replication of the state-level (i.e. within-participant) relationship, we ran a single-trial linear mixed-effect model analysis on our longitudinal <italic>N</italic> = 105 sample.

This allowed us to most directly probe the potential role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural changes. Specifically, we asked: (i) Is an individual’s baseline (T1) level of neural filtering ability predictive of their 2-year change in behaviour? (ii) Are individual differences in longitudinal dynamics in the behavioural domain associated with those in the neural domain?</p><p>As a technical note, it is worth reiterating that in the present data the highly variable, weakly reliable surface measure of neural filtering was nonetheless robustly connected to the behavioural outcome (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is in such scenarios that the LCSM framework comes with particular methodological benefits: by expressing individuals’ T1 and T2 levels, as well as their T1–T2 change as latent variables instead of manifest indicators, these types of models circumvent the calculation of notoriously unreliable noisy difference scores. They also avoid potential regression to the mean due to random errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994</xref>).

These indicators were the average of each metric across the first and second half of the experiment, respectively (see ‘Materials and methods’ for details). For all measurement models, the standardised factor loadings were significant (all ps&lt;0.05; all standardised λ &gt; 0.55).

Since the analyses conducted up to this point have either directly shown or have suggested that longitudinal change per domain may be affected by age, we included individuals’ age at T1 as a time-invariant covariate in the final model. We modelled the influence of age on neural and behavioural functioning at T1 but also on individual change per domain. By accounting for linear effects of age on longitudinal change, we also minimise its potential impact on the estimation of change–change relationship of interest.

We here have addressed these questions leveraging a new representative prospective cohort sample of healthy middle-aged to older listeners.</p><p>Over 2 y from T1 to T2, individuals’ hearing ability worsened as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Linssen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Rigters et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wiley et al., 2008</xref>). Their listening performance, however, stayed stable. In addition, an individual’s baseline (T1) neural filtering strength proved to be a strikingly poor indicator of their future (T2) level of neural filtering. On the other hand, bolstering previous results, neural filtering reliably supported listening behaviour within the same session—both at T1 and T2—at two levels of granularity: individuals with generally stronger neural tracking of target vs. distractor speech performed the listening task on average more accurately and faster. They were also more likely to respond correctly in a given trial with relatively stronger neural filtering in that trial.</p><p>Crucially, however, momentary states of neural functioning were not predictive of future behavioural change, and the dynamics of longitudinal change at the neural and behavioural level appear to follow largely independent trajectories. Notably, these key findings hold for different definitions of neural-attentional filtering and under different spatial-attention conditions (see ‘Control analyses’).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Neural filtering fidelity as a trait-like neural marker of individual attentive listening ability?</title><p>In recent years, the enhanced representation of behaviourally relevant sounds via their prioritised neural tracking has been reported in numerous listening studies investigating different acoustic environments, participant populations, and stages of auditory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">O’Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fiedler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kaufman and Zion Golumbic, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kraus et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brodbeck et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forte et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fuglsang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>This neural signature is commonly interpreted as a neural instantiation of selective auditory attention in the service of successful speech comprehension. Note however that its link to behaviour is not always explicitly established (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">O’Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mesgarani and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Orf et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>). Given how robustly the current data show the enhanced neural tracking of attended vs. ignored speech at the group level, the weak reliability of individual neural filtering strength may come as a surprise. At the same time, stronger neural filtering was reliably linked to better behavioural performance within both T1 and T2.</p><p>How can these two findings be reconciled? Based on the current and previous results, what may be concluded about the role of neural filtering as a potential neural marker of individual attentive listening ability?</p><p>Previous studies on attention-guided neural speech tracking have not provided any direct evidence on the temporal stability of neural filtering nor on its relationship with behaviour. Studies on related neural signatures such as speech-aligned auditory brainstem responses or the entrainment of auditory cortical activity to rhythmic (non-speech) stimulation reported moderate to high reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Song et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Easwar et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cabral-Calderin and Henry, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Panela et al., 2024</xref>). However, these studies have (i) investigated the temporal stability across sessions spaced only days or weeks apart, (ii) focused on younger normal-hearing populations, or (iii) quantified the neural encoding of speech or non-speech stimulation that involved less or no attentional control. In contrast, we here explicitly focused on a definition of neural filtering that incorporated the neural tracking of attended and ignored speech to highlight the dependence of communication success on the attention-guided differential neural encoding of relevant vs. irrelevant input. These differences render a direct comparison to our approach difficult, but there is reason to consider a model-derived, latent representation of neural filtering as employed here the more generalisable metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hertzog and Schaie, 1988</xref>). Leaving the latent-variable framework aside, it is worth emphasising that the neural tracking of attended speech alone proved to be substantially more stable over time, with a retest reliability in the r<sub>tt</sub> = 0.6 range.</p><p>Our current results broadly align with a view of attention-guided neural speech tracking as a form of ‘neural entrainment in the broad sense’ that reflects a listener’s neural attentional state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lakatos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lakatos et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Under this interpretation, the stable link of neural filtering to listening behaviour at different levels of granularity is noteworthy: an individual’s ability to exert top-down selective attention to prioritise the neural encoding of behaviourally relevant information is far from stable but it fluctuates at different time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schroeder et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helfrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Buschman and Kastner, 2015</xref>). This entails that at a longer time scale, here captured by two distinct measurement timepoints, ageing individuals will differ with respect to their overall level of neural filtering and associated listening behaviour. Their level of neural and behavioural functioning will differ from other individuals’ levels at the same timepoint but also from their own level at a different timepoint. Moreover, a listener’s behavioural outcome at either timepoint is not only shaped by their broad neural attentional state with which they enter a communication situation. It is also critically influenced by short-term fluctuations in neural filtering strength around their current overall level of neural functioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>). As our control analyses have revealed, these fluctuations are more pronounced if neural filtering is defined by the tracking of both attended and ignored speech rather than by attended-speech tracking alone.</p><p>What does this mean for the potential translational value of neural tracking? Their highly dynamic nature gives neural tracking-based metrics value as online neural indicators of a listener’s momentary attentional focus. As such, they could serve as critical neural read-outs in novel brain–computer interfaces such as neurally steered hearing aids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Van Eyndhoven et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ceolini et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">O’Sullivan et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, however, their non-stationarity over time limits their potential as translational targets for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Panela et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gillis et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Di Liberto et al., 2022</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Individual trajectories of listening behaviour cannot be explained by changes within a single domain</title><p>As a second central query of the current study, we went beyond the establishment of robust brain–behaviour relationships and directly probed the potency of neural filtering to predict behavioural change over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Woo et al., 2017</xref>). We asked whether individual trajectories of listening behaviour could be predicted by past levels of neural filtering or by co-occurring changes in neural filtering.</p><p>Past studies have observed enhanced cortical speech tracking in ageing compared to young adults. This suggests a compensatory role of increased speech–brain coupling to counteract the deleterious effect of age or of hearing loss on speech comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schmitt et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gillis et al., 2022a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Presacco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Presacco et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Decruy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Decruy et al., 2020</xref>). As a corollary of this relationship, typically observed cross-sectionally, one might expect an individual’s neural filtering strength to be connected not only to present but also to future trajectories of listening behaviour.</p><p>Such relationships, if shown to be causal, would provide the strongest evidence for the role of neural speech tracking as a neural compensatory mechanism supporting communication success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Peelle and Wingfield, 2016</xref>). However, when analysed in our longitudinal sample of ageing listeners, irrespective of the precise definition of neural filtering, we did not find evidence for a predictive role of neural filtering despite supporting brain–behaviour links observed within each timepoint. What are the potential reasons for this absent connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)?</p><p>One obvious explanation, both in statistical and substantive terms, may lie in the low retest reliability of our neural filtering metric as discussed above. Analytically, however, we were able to mitigate this problem by adopting a modelling approach which effectively removes the influence of measurement error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McArdle and Nesselroade, 1994</xref>; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Still, individual change in response speed could only be predicted by an individual’s baseline speed and age but not by baseline neural filtering nor by its longitudinal change. Moreover, our control analysis of attended-speech tracking provided additional empirical support for the absence of such a predictive link despite the neural metric’s moderate manifest-level reliability. These findings call for a more substantive explanation that transcends methodological details.</p><p>While most desirable from a translational perspective and a core quest in the cognitive neuroscience of ageing, predicting change in cognitive functioning, here listening behaviour, from baseline or longitudinal change in brain function or structure is a non-trivial endeavour. Connecting individual trajectories of neural or cognitive functioning goes beyond the establishment of domain-specific age trends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lindenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tucker-Drob et al., 2022</xref>). It also goes beyond the mere extrapolation of (age-independent) brain–behaviour relationships observed at a given moment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boker and Martin, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Raz and Lindenberger, 2011</xref>). Indeed, empirical evidence—and to some degree also theoretical grounds—for robust brain–behaviour baseline–change or change–change associations is limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oschwald et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Most empirical studies reporting such significant cross-domain change–change correlations have in fact connected behavioural change to alterations in brain structure rather than brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Raz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McArdle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bender et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lövdén et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Persson et al., 2016</xref>). Focusing on structural change may be advantageous: not only can structural feature be quantified more directly and reliably, they also follow systematic age-dependent trajectories, thereby providing clearer causal pathways for ensuing behavioural change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bennett and Madden, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Grady, 2012</xref>). Still, less than half of the studies testing such cross-domain associations have indeed observed them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Oschwald et al., 2019</xref>). From the perspective of theoretical models of neurobiological and cognitive ageing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Reuter-Lorenz and Park, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cabeza et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stern et al., 2019</xref>), the absence of correlated trajectories of neural and cognitive functioning may indeed be the more expected result. These models highlight the multifaceted nature of healthy cognitive ageing in which environmental variables, neurobiology, and cognition are dynamically interrelated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Freund et al., 2013</xref>). Neural compensatory mechanisms, such as the neural filtering correlate targeted here, are thought to offset structural decline but are themselves influenced by a number of factors. This leads to increased inter-individual variability that may circumvent the emergence of group-level correlated change relationships.</p><p>Importantly, the behavioural outcome of interest, that is, the speed and accuracy with which an ageing individual solves a difficult listening situation, involves the orchestration of different perceptual and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Peelle, 2016</xref>). We here focused on one candidate neurobiological implementation of an auditory attentional filter to help explain inter-individual differences in listening behaviour and its lifespan trajectories. Yet, ageing individuals may rely on different alternative neural or cognitive strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tune et al., 2018</xref>). A complete understanding of inter-individual differences in listening behaviour in ageing adults will therefore depend on a number of different factors among which the attention-modulated tracking of relevant speech constitutes one, potentially necessary, but not sufficient neural correlate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wöstmann et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Obleser and Kayser, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tune et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gillis et al., 2022b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Strauß et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Not least, there are a number of methodological choices that might constrain the conclusions afforded by our current study. First, the current study was limited to two distinct timepoints spaced only 2 y apart. This limits the ability to model linear as well as non-linear dynamics of change. Second, it also does not allow the separation of distinct patterns of change co-occurring at the same time: one continuous, constant change with age along with a separate process in which relative change is proportional to the level observed at prior timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jacobucci et al., 2019</xref>). Third, we here focus on a single dichotic listening task from which both neural and behavioural functioning are derived. We therefore cannot assess whether the observed pattern would generalise to other listening tasks. Lastly, denser sampling across a longer time interval would have also increased statistical power to detect correlated change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rast and Hofer, 2014</xref>). It would have also allowed to more directly test hypotheses on causal pathways by which change in the neural domain should precede change in the behavioural domain.</p><p>The conclusion stands, though, that individual trajectories in listening behaviour cannot be explained by longitudinal change along a single dimension. Instead, a better understanding of the influences shaping individual listening behaviour across the adult lifespan will critically rely on uncovering the relative contribution and age-dependent dynamics of sensory, neural, and cognitive factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results presented here support the role of attention-guided neural filtering as a readout of an individual’s neural attentional state. At the same time, the state-like nature of neural tracking-based metrics limits their translational potential as predictors of longitudinal change in listening behaviour over middle to older adulthood. Our data caution against explaining audiology-typical listening performance solely from changes in aspects of neural functioning as listening behaviour and neural filtering ability follow largely independent developmental trajectories.

First, a spatial-attention cue either indicated the to-be-probed ear, thus invoking selective attention, or did not provide any information about the to-be-probed ear, thus invoking divided attention. Second, but irrelevant to the current study, a semantic cue specified a general or a specific semantic category for the final word of both sentences, thus allowing to utilise a semantic prediction. Cue levels were fully crossed in a 2 × 2 design and presentation of cue combinations varied on a trial-by-trial level.

We included participant- and item-specific random intercepts as well as random slopes for the effect of the spatial-attention cue and the probed ear.</p><p>We used deviation coding for categorical predictors and z-scored all continuous regressors. p-Values for individual model terms in general linear mixed-effect models are based on the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom, and on z-values and asymptotic Wald tests for the generalised linear mixed-effect model of accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luke, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Causal mediation analysis</title><p>We performed causal mediation analysis to model the direct as well as the hearing-acuity-mediated effect of age on accuracy and response speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Imai et al., 2010</xref>). Critically, these models also included a direct (i.e. independent of age and hearing loss) path of neural filtering on behaviour. To formally test the stability of direct and indirect relationships across time, we used a moderated mediation analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Preacher et al., 2007</xref>). In this analysis, the inclusion of interactions by timepoint tested whether the influence of age, sensory acuity, and neural functioning on behaviour varied across time. We z-scored all dependent and independent variables, and estimated the magnitude of direct and mediated effects along with percentile-based confidence intervals on the basis of 1000 replications.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Bayes factor calculation</title><p>To facilitate interpretation of non-significant effects, we calculated the Bayes factor (BF) based on the comparison of Bayesian information criterion (BIC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wagenmakers, 2007</xref>). We report log Bayes factors, with a log BF<sub>01</sub> of 0 representing equal evidence for and against the null hypothesis; log BF<sub>01</sub> with a positive sign indicating relatively more evidence for the null hypothesis than the alternative hypothesis, and vice versa. Magnitudes &gt;1 are taken as moderate, &gt;2.3 as strong evidence for either of the alternative or null hypotheses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee and Wagenmakers, 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Latent change score modelling</title><p>In the third and final step of our analysis approach, we used structural equation modelling (SEM) to investigate the role of neural filtering as a predictor of behavioural change. We used LCSM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McArdle, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>) to test (i) whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can be predictive of 2-year changes in behaviour, and (ii) whether 2-year changes in neural filtering and listening behaviour are systematically related. All models were specified and fitted with the R-based package lavaan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Rosseel, 2012</xref>) using maximum likelihood estimation.</p><p>To bring all manifest variables onto the same scale while preserving mean differences over time, we first stacked them across timepoint and then rescaled them using the proportion of maximum scale (‘POMS’) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moeller, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Little, 2013</xref>). We assessed model fit using established indices including the χ<sup>2</sup> test, the RMSEA, and the CFI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Raykov and Marcoulides, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kline, 2023</xref>). Likelihood ratio tests helped us decide whether (i) constraining individual parameters to be equal significantly decreased model fit and (ii) individual parameter estimates were statistically significant. We report standardised parameter estimates.</p><p>In a first step, we specified separate unstructured measurement models of accuracy, speed, and neural filtering to establish factorial invariance across time using a series of tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Polk et al., 2022</xref>). Latent variables representing each metric at T1 and T2 were constructed from the observed individual means averaged across the first and second half of the experiment, respectively. Covariances between T1 and T2 latent variables were freely estimated, and residual covariances were set to be equal for the first and second half of the experiment. The factor loading and mean of the first manifest variable were set to 1 and 0, respectively, to ensure model identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Little, 2013</xref>). Given our choice of POMS transformation of raw values to preserve mean differences over time, the mean of the second manifest variable had to be freely estimated to avoid model misfit. We sequentially tested for metric (i.e. identical factor loadings), strong (i.e. identical means), and strict (i.e. identical residuals) time invariance using likelihood ratio tests.</p><p>Next, for those metrics surviving factorial invariance testing, we constructed separate (i.e. univariate) change score models to test for group-level mean change following the tutorial by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kievit et al., 2018</xref>. We included a regression path from the T1 latent variable to the latent change variable to test how baseline functioning impacted the degree of longitudinal change. A likelihood ratio test of nested models (with mean change being freely estimated vs. constrained to be 0) determined the significance of group-level mean change.</p><p>In the last and final step, we constructed the bivariate LCSM that connected changes in response speed and neural filtering, which both significantly increased over time (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref> for full model details). We modelled the covariance between the baseline neural filtering and speed, as well as the covariance between neural and behavioural change. In addition, we included a regression path from T1 neural filtering to the T1–T2 change in response speed to directly test the predictive potency of baseline neural functioning to explain behavioural change.</p><p>Following the logic of a generalised variance test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brandmaier et al., 2018</xref>), we tested for significant inter-individual differences in neural and behavioural change. Note that such reliable variance in change is a necessary prerequisite for testing change–change correlations. In short, per domain (neural, behaviour), a likelihood ratio test compared the full model with a restricted model in which all paths pointing to or connected with the latent change variable are fixed to 0.</p><p>Finally, we asked whether neural and behavioural change covaried significantly. We ran a likelihood ratio test on the full model compared to a restricted model in which the covariance parameter was fixed to 0. For visualisation of results, we refit the final model using OpenMx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Neale et al., 2016</xref>) to predict latent factor scores based on maximum likelihood.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Participants gave written informed consent and received financial compensation (10€ per hour).

Neural attentional filtering was quantified using EEG by comparing neural envelope tracking to an attended vs. an unattended sentence. This dataset was used to examine the stability of the link between behavior and neural filtering over time. They found that neural filtering and behavior were correlated during each measurement, but EEG measures at the first timepoint did not predict behavioural performance two years later. Further, while behavioural measures showed relatively high test-retest reliability, the neural filtering reliability was weak with an r value of 0.21. The authors conclude that neural tracking-based metrics have limited ability to predict longitudinal changes in listening behavior.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is novel in its tracking of behavioural performance and neural envelope tracking over time, and it includes an impressively large dataset of 105 participants.

Neural attentional filtering was quantified using EEG by comparing neural envelope tracking to an attended vs. an unattended sentence. This dataset was used to examine the stability of the link between behavior and neural filtering over time. They found that neural filtering and behavior were correlated during each measurement, but EEG measures at the first time point did not predict behavioural performance two years later. Further, while behavioural measures showed relatively high test-retest reliability, the neural filtering reliability was weak with an r-value of 0.21. The authors conclude that neural tracking-based metrics have limited ability to predict longitudinal changes in listening behavior.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study is novel in its tracking of behavioural performance and neural envelope tracking over time, and it includes an impressively large dataset of 105 participants. The manuscript is clearly written.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The weaknesses are minor, primarily concerning how the reviewers interpret their data.

We describe in detail how we have addressed the two main concerns raised here—neural filtering’s low test-retest reliability and differences in age-related behavioural vs. neural change—in our response to the more detailed recommendations below.</p><p>To briefly summarise here:</p><p>(1) In Figure 5, we now illustrate more transparently how the employed structural equation framework helps to overcome the issue of low test-retest reliability of neural filtering as originally reported.</p><p>(2) We include two additional control analyses, one of which relates neural tracking of attended speech (featuring a moderately high T1–T2 correlation of r = .64 even outside of latent modelling) to behavioural change. Importantly, this analysis provides critical empirical support for the apparent independence of neural and behavioural trajectories.</p><p>(3) We more clearly describe how the latent-variable modelling strategy accounts for differences in age-related change along the neural and behavioural domain. Moreover, the results of the of 18 additional control analysis also suggest that the absence of a change-change relationship is not primarily due to differential effects of age on brain and behaviour.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Figure 3:</p><p>Does the 70-year range reach a tipping point?</p><p>Is that why neural filtering drops dramatically in this age group, whereas the other groups do not change or increase slightly?</p><p>This can also be seen with behavioral accuracy to a lesser extent. Perhaps test-retest reliability is affected by accelerated age-related declines in older listeners, as was found for envelope tracking measures in Decruy et al. 2019.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that at first glance the data seem to suggest a critical tipping point in the age range above 70 years. It is important to emphasize, however, that the four age bins were not based on equal number of data points. In fact, the &gt;70 age group included the fewest participants, leading to a less reliable estimate of change. Together with the known observation of increasing interindividual differences with increasing age, the results do not allow for any strong conclusions regarding a potential tipping point. For the same reasons, we used the four age bins for illustrative purposes, only, and did not include them in any statistical modelling.</p><p>We did however include chronological age as a continuous predictor in latent change score modelling. Here, we modelled its influence on participants’ T1 neural and behavioural status, as well as its effect on their respective change, thereby accounting for any differential (linear) effects of age on neural vs. behavioural functioning and its change.</p><p>On p.14 of the revised manuscript, we now state more clearly that the latent change score model did in fact account for the potential influence of age on the change-related relationships:</p><p>&quot;In line with our hypotheses, we modelled the longitudinal impact of T1 neural functioning on the change in speed, and tested for a change-change correlation. Since the analyses conducted up to this point have either directly shown or have suggested that longitudinal change per domain may be affected by age, we included individuals’ age as a time-invariant covariate in the final model. We modelled the influence of age on neural and behavioural functioning at T1 but also on individual change per domain. By accounting for linear effects of age on longitudinal change, we also minimize its potential impact on the estimation of change-change relationship of interest. Note that we refrained from fitting separate models per age group due to both limited and different number of data points per age group.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Would good test-retest reliability be expected when the actual values of envelope tracking for attended vs. unattended speech are so low? The investigators address this by including measurement errors in the models, but I am not certain this kind adequately deals with envelope tracking values that are close to the noise floor.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We addressed the concerns regarding the low re-test reliability of our neural-attentional metric (and its potential impact on observing a systematic changechange relationship) in two separate ways.</p><p>The major outcome of these tests is that low re-test reliability of neural tracking is (i) not generally true, and (ii) is not the cause of the main finding, i.e., a low or absent correlations of behavioural vs. neural changes over time.</p><p>In more detail, to show how latent change score modelling improves test-retest reliability by explicitly modelling measurement error, we first extracted and correlated T1 and T2 latent factors scores from the respective univariate models of neural filtering and response speed.</p><p>Indeed, at the latent level, the correlation of T1–T2 neural filtering was moderately high at r = .65 (compared to r = .21 at the manifest level). The correlation of T1–T2 response speed was estimated as r = .75 (compared to r = .71).</p><p>Figure 5A, reproduced below for the reviewer’s convenience, now includes insets quantifying these latent-level correlations over time.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Modelling of univariate and bivariate change.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Univariate latent change score models for response speed (left) and neural filtering (right).

The results are shown as part of a new main figure (and two new supplemental figures) reproduced below (see in particular Figure 6, panels C and D).</p><p>This analysis serves two purposes: On the one hand, it allows for a more direct evaluation of the actual strength of neural speech tracking as quantified by the Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Note that these individual averages fall well within the to be expected range given that the neural tracking estimates are based on relatively short sentences (i.e., duration of ~2.5 sec) (O’Sullivan et al., 2014).</p><p>On the other hand, neural tracking of attended speech showed a moderately high, r = .64, T1–T2 correlation even outside of latent modelling. Note that the magnitude of this T1–T2 reliability is close to the short-term test-retest reliability recently reported by Panela et al. (2023). Still, when including neural tracking of attended speech in the bivariate model of change, the change-change correlation with response speed was now estimated as close to 0 (φ = –.03, n.s). This observation suggests that manifest-level high re-test reliability does not necessarily improve chances of observing a significant change-change correlation.</p><p>Lastly, we would like to point out that these bivariate model results also help to shed light on the question of whether non-linear effects of age on neural / behavioural change may affect the chance of observing a systematic change-change relationship. As shown in Fig. 6C, for neural tracking of attended speech, we observed a fairly consistent longitudinal increase across age groups. Yet, as detailed above, the change-change correlation was virtually absent.</p><p>In sum, these new results provide compelling evidence for the absence of a systematic changechange relationship.</p><p>The respective control analysis results section reads as follows, and is accompanied by Figure 6 reproduced below:</p><p>&quot;Control analyses: The weak correlation of behavioural and neural change is robust against different quantifications of neural filtering</p><p>Taken together, our main analyses revealed that inter-individual differences in behavioural change could only be predicted by baseline age and baseline behavioural functioning, and did not correlate with contemporaneous neural changes.</p><p>However, one could ask in how far core methodological decisions taken in the current study, namely our focus on (i) the differential neural tracking of relevant vs. irrelevant speech as proxy of neural filtering, and (ii) on its trait-level characterization that averaged across different spatial-attention conditions may have impacted these results. Specifically, if the neural filtering index (compared to the neural tracking of attended speech alone) is found to be less stable generally, would this also impact the chances of observing a systematic change-change relationship? Relatedly, did the analysis of neural filtering across all trials underestimate the effects of interest?</p><p>To evaluate the impact of these consideration on our main findings, we conducted two additional control analyses: First, we repeated the main analyses using the neural filtering index (and response speed) averaged across selective-attention trials, only. Second, we repeated the main analyses using the neural tracking of attended speech, again averaged across selective-attention trials, only.</p><p>As shown in Figure 6, taken together, the control analyses provide compelling empirical support for the robustness of our main results: Linking response speed and neural filtering under selective attention strengthened their relationship at T1 (φ = .54, SE = .15, Dc2(df = 1) = 2.74, p = .1; see. Fig 6B) but did not yield any significant effects for the influence of T1 neural filtering on behavioural change (β = .13, SE = .21, Dc2(df = 1) = .43, p = .51), or for the relationship of neural and behavioural change (φ = .26, SE = .14, Dc2(df = 1) = 3.1, p = .08; please note the close correspondence to path estimates reported in Fig. 5).The second control analysis revealed a substantially higher manifest-level test-retest reliability of neural tracking of attended speech (r = .65, p&lt;.001; Fig. 6C) compared to that of the neural tracking index. However, when linked to longitudinal changes in response speed, this analysis provided even less evidence for systematic change-related relationships: Baseline-levels of attended-speech tracking did not predict future change in response speed (β = .18, SE = .11, Dc2(df = 1) = 2.73, p = .10), and changes in neural and behavioural functioning occurred independently of one another (φ = –.03, SE = .12, Dc2(df = 1) = .06, p = .81).</p><p>In sum, the two control analyses provide additional empirical support for the results revealed by our main analysis.&quot;</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Control analyses corroborate the independence of neural and behavioural trajectories under selective attention.</title><p>Cross-sectional and longitudinal change in neural filtering (<bold>A</bold>) and neural tracking of attended speech (<bold>C</bold>) averaged across selective-attention trials, only.

The authors conclude that the temporal instability of the neural filtering measure precludes its use for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention. I agree that test-retest reliability is needed for a clinical intervention. However, given the relationship with behavior at a specific point in time, would it not be a possible target for intervention to improve performance? Even if there are different trajectories, an individual may benefit from enhanced behavioral performance in the present.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We would agree that the observation of robust betweensubject (or even more desirable: within-subject) brain–behaviour relationships is a key desideratum in identifying potential interventional targets. At the same time, we would argue that the most direct way of evaluating a neural signature’s translational potential is by focusing on how it predicts or is linked to individual change. In revising both the Introduction and Discussion section, we hope to now better motivate our reasoning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other minor comments:</p><p>1.

Due to the use of in-ear headphones, we did not aim to measure the exact sound pressure level of presentation but instead ensured that even if stimuli were presented at the maximally possible intensity given our hardware, this would not result in subjectively uncomfortably loud stimulus presentation levels. The described procedure estimated per individual how far the maximal sound pressure level needed to be attenuated to arrive at a comfortable and easy-tounderstand presentation level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examined the longitudinal brain-behaviour link between attentional neural filtering and listening behaviour among a sample of aging individuals. The results based on the latent change score modeling showed that neither attentional neural filtering at T1 nor its T1-T2 change predicted individual two-year listening performance change.

Although no longitudinal change from T1 to T2 was found at the group-level, from the cross-sectional and longitudinal change results (see Figure 3), individuals of different age groups showed different development patterns. Particularly, individuals over the age of 70 show a clear downward trend in both neural filtering index and accuracy.

The author could perform a more in-depth data analysis on indicators under different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their critical yet positive assessment of our work that also appreciates its potential to further our understanding of key determinants of successful communication in healthy aging. Please also see our more in-depth responses to the detailed recommendations that relate to the three main concern raised above.</p><p>Regarding the first concern of the reviewer about the limited generalizability of our brain–behaviour results, we would argue that there are two sides to this argument.</p><p>On the one hand, the results do not directly speak to the generalizability of the observed complex brain–behaviour relationships to other listening tasks. This may be perceived as a weakness. Unfortunately, as part of our large-scale projects, we did not collect data from another listening task suitable for such a generalization test. Using any additional cognitive tests would shift the focus away from the goal of understanding the determinants of successful communication, and rather speak more generally to the relationship of neural and cognitive change.</p><p>On the other hand, we would argue the opposite, namely that the focus on the same listening task is in fact a major strength of the present study: The key research questions were motivated by our timepoint 1 findings of a brain-behaviour link both at the within-subject (state) and at the between subject (trait) level (Tune et al., 2021). Notably, in the current study, we show that both, the state- and the trait-level results, were replicated at timepoint 2. This observed stability of results provides compelling empirical evidence for the functional relevance of neural filtering to the listening outcome and critically sets the stage for the inquiry into the complex longitudinal change relationships. We now spell this out more clearly in the Introduction and the Discussion.</p><p>Here, we briefly summarise how we have addressed the two remaining main concerns.</p><p>(1) Please refer to our response R1’s comment #1 on the influence of (differential) age effects on brain and behaviour. These effects were in fact already accounted for by our modelling strategy which included the continuously (rather than binned by age group) modelled effect of age. We now communicate this more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) We added two control analyses, one of which replicated the main analysis using selective attention trials, only. Critically, as shown in Figure 6, while the strength of the relationship of neural filtering and behaviour at a given timepoint increased, the key change-related relationships of interest remained not only qualitatively unchanged, but resulted in highly similar quantitative estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>1. Theoretically, the relationship between brain and behavior may not be just one-way, but probably bi-directional. In this study, the authors only considered the unidirectional predictive effect of neural filtering on changes in listening task performance. However, it is possible that lower listening ability may limit information processing in older adults, which may lead to a decline in neural filtering abilities. The authors may also consider this theoretical hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. While we did not have any specific hypotheses about influence of the behavioural state at timepoint 1 on the change in neural filtering, we ran control analysis that freely estimates the respective path (rather than implicitly assuming it to be 0). However, the results did not provide evidence for such a relationship. We report the results on p. 14 of the revised manuscript:</p><p>&quot;We did not have any a priori hypotheses on the influence of T1 speed on the individual T1–T2 change in neural filtering. Still in a control analysis that freely estimated the respective path, we found that an individual’s latent T1 level of response speed was not predictive of the ensuing latent T1–T2 change in neural filtering (β = –.11, SE = .21, Dc2(df = 1) = .31, p = .58).&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The necessity of exploring the longitudinal relationship between attentional neural filtering and listening behaviour needs to be further clarified. That is, why choose attentional filtering (instead of the others) as an indicator to predict listening performance?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not quite certain we understood which ‘other’ metrics the reviewer was referring to here exactly. But we would like to reiterate our argument from above: we believe that focusing on neural and behavioural metrics that are (i) derived from the same task, and (ii) were previously shown to be linked at both the trait- and state-level provided strong empirical ground for our inquiries into their longitudinal change-related relationships.</p><p>Please note that we agree that the neural filtering index as a measure of attention-guided neural encoding of relevant vs. irrelevant speech signals is only one potential candidate neural measure but one that was clearly motivated by previous results. Nevertheless, in the revised manuscript we now also report on the relationship of neural tracking of attended speech and listening performance (see also our response to the reviewer’s comment #5 below).</p><p>Apart of this, by making the entire T1–T2 dataset openly available, we invite researchers to conduct any potential follow-up analyses focused on metrics not reported here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Regarding the Dichotic listening task, further clarification is needed.</p><p>(1) The task procedure and key parameters need to be supplemented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new supplemental Figure S6 which details the experimental design and procedure. We have also added further listening task details to the Methods section on p.23:</p><p>At each timepoint, participants performed a previously established dichotic listening task20.

Was there a speed-accuracy trade-off? Was it possible to consider an integrated ACC-RT indicator?</p><p>We instructed participants to respond within a 4-sec time window following the response screen onset but we did not explicitly instruct them to respond as quickly as possible. We also state this more explicitly in the revised Method section on p. 23 (see also our response to comment #3 by R3 on p. 15 below).</p><p>In a between-subjects analysis we observed, both within T1 and T2, a significant positive correlation (rT1 = .33, p&lt;.01; rT2 = .40, p&lt;.001) of participants’ overall accuracy and response speed, speaking against a speed-accuracy trade-off. For this reason, we did not consider an integrated speed–accuracy measure as behavioural indicator for modelling.</p><p>(3) The correlation between neural filtering at T1 and T2 was weak, which may be due to the low reliability of this indicator. The generally low reliability of the difference score is a notorious measurement problem recognized in the academic community.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewer on their assessment of notoriously noisy difference scores. It is the very reason that motivated our application of the latent change score model approach. This framework elegantly supersedes the manual calculation of differences scores, and by explicitly</p><p>modelling measurement error also removes the impact of varying degrees of reliability on the estimation of change and how it varies as a function of different influences.</p><p>While we had already detailed this rationale in the original manuscript, we now more prominently describe the advantages of the latent variable approach in the first paragraph of the Results section:</p><p>Third and final, we integrate and extend the first two analysis perspectives in a joint latent change score model (LCSM) to most directly probe the role of neural filtering ability as a predictor of future attentive listening ability. Addressing our key change-related research questions at the latent rather than the manifest level supersedes the manual calculation of notoriously noisy differences scores, and effectively removes the influence of each metric’s reliability on the estimation of change-related relationships.</p><p>We also kindly refer the reviewer to our in-depth response to R1’s comment #2 regarding the concern of neural filtering’s low test-rest reliability and its impact on estimating change-change relationships.</p><p>1. For the latent change score model, it is recommended that the authors:</p><p>This information has been added to Figure 5.</p><p>(2) In Figure 5 and Figure S2, why should the two means of the observed 2nd half scores be estimated?</p><p>In longitudinal modelling, special care needs to be applied to the pre-processing/transformation of raw data for the purpose of change score modelling. While it is generally desirable to bring all variables onto the same scale (typically achieved by standardising all variables), one needs to be careful not to remove the mean differences of interest in such a data transformation step. We therefore followed the procedure recommended by Little (2013) and rescaled variables stacked across T1 and T2 using the proportion of maximum scale (‘POMS’) methods. This procedure, however, results in mean values per timepoint ≠ 0, so the mean of the second half needed to be freely estimated to avoid model misfit. Note that the mean of the first half manifest variables was set to 0 (using the ‘marker method’; see Little, 2013) to ensure model identification.</p><p>We have added the following more detailed description to the Method section on p. 26:</p><p>To bring all manifest variables onto the same scale while preserving mean differences over time, we first stacked them across timepoint and then rescaled them using the proportion of maximum scale (‘POMS’) method99,100(…)Given our choice of POMS-transformation of raw to preserve mean differences over time, the mean of the second manifest variable had to be freely estimated (rather than implicitly assumed to be 0) to avoid severe model misfit.</p><p>(3) The authors need to clarify whether the latent change factor in Figure 5 is Δ(T1-T2) or Δ(T2-T1)?</p><p>Thank you for this comment. Our notation here was indeed confusing. The latent change factor quantifies the change from T1 to T2, so it is Δ(T2–T1). We have accordingly re-named the respective latent variables in all corresponding figures.</p><p>1. For data analysis, the author combined the trials under different conditions (valid and invalid cues) in the dichotic listening task and analyzed them together, which may mask the variations between different attention levels (selective vs. divided attention). It is recommended that the authors analyze the relationship between various indicators under different conditions.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment which prompted us to (i) more clearly motivate our decision to model neural filtering across all trials, and (ii) nevertheless report the results of an additional control analyses that focused on neural filtering (or the neural tracking of attended speech) in selective-attention trials, only.</p><p>Our decision to analyse neural filtering across all spatial-attention conditions was motivated by two key considerations: First, previous T1 results (Tune et al., 2021) suggested that irrespective of the spatial-attention condition, stronger neural filtering boosted behavioural performance. Second, analysing neural filtering (and associated behaviour) across all trials provided the most direct way of probing the trait-like nature of individual neural filtering ability.</p><p>We have included the following paragraph to the Results section on p. 6 to motivate this decision more clearly:</p><p>Our main analyses focus on neural filtering and listening performance averaged across all trials and thereby also across two separate spatial-attention conditions. This choice allowed us to most directly probe the trait-like nature and relationships of neural filtering. It was additionally supported by our previous observation of a general boost in behavioural performance with stronger neural filtering, irrespective of spatial attention.</p><p>On the other hand, one could argue that the effects of interest are underestimated by jointly analysing neural and behavioural functioning derived from both selective- and divided-attention conditions. After all, it is reasonable to expect a more pronounced neural filtering response in selective-attention trials.</p><p>For this reason, we now report, in the revised version, two additional control analyses that replicate the key analyses for the neural filtering index and for the tracking of attended speech, both averaged across selective-attention trials, only:In summary, analysing neural filtering under selective attention strengthened the brain-behaviour link within a given time-point but resulted in highly similar quantitative estimated for the key relationships of interest. The analysis of attended speech tracking notably improved the neural metric’s manifest-level re-test reliability (r = .64, p&lt;.001) – but resulted in an estimated change-change correlation close to 0.</p><p>Taken together, these control analyses provide compelling support for our main conclusion that neural and behavioural functioning follow largely independent developmental trajectories.</p><p>We kindly refer the reviewer to our detailed response to R1 for the text of the added control analysis section on p. 4f. above.

A slight change in the hearing threshold is observed in 2 years (1.2 dB on average) but the speech recognition performance remains stable. The main conclusion is that there is no significant correlation between longitudinal changes in neural and behavioral measures.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The sample size (N&gt;100) is remarkable, especially for longitudinal studies.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The participants are only tracked for 2 years and relatively weak longitudinal changes are observed, limiting how the data may shed light on the relationships between basic auditory function, speech recognition behavior, and speech neural responses.</p><p>Suggestions</p><p>First, it's not surprising that a 1.2 dB change in hearing threshold does not affect speech recognition, especially for the dichotic listening task and when speech is always presented 50 dB above the hearing threshold. For the same listener, if the speech level is adjusted for 1.2 dB or much more, the performance will not be influenced during the dichotic listening task. Therefore, it is important to mention in the abstract that &quot;sensory acuity&quot; is measured using the hearing threshold and the change in hearing threshold is only 1.2 dB.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have added the respective information to the abstract and have toned down our interpretation of the observed behavioural stability despite the expected decline in auditory acuity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the lack of correlation between age-related changes in &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; and behavior may not suggest that they follow independent development trajectories. The index for &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; does not seem to be stable and the correlation between the two tests is only R = 0.21. This low correlation probably indicates low test-retest reliability, instead of a dramatic change in the brain between the two tests. In other words, if the &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; index only very weakly correlates with itself between the two tests, it is not surprising that it does not correlate with other measures in a different test. If the &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; index is measured on two consecutive days and the index remains highly stable, I'm more convinced that it is a reliable measure that just changes a lot within 2 years, and the change is dissociated with the changes in behavior.</p><p>The authors attempted to solve the problem in the section entitled &quot;Neural filtering reliably supports listening performance independent of age and hearing status&quot;, but I didn't follow the logic. As far as I could tell, the section pooled together the measurements from two tests and did not address the test-retest stability issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our detailed response to R1’s comment #2 regarding the concern of how low (manifestlevel) reliability of our neural metric may have impacted the chance of observing a significant changechange correlation.</p><p>In addition, we would like to emphasize that the goal of the second step of our analysis procedure, featuring causal mediation analysis, was not to salvage the perhaps surprisingly low reliability of neural filtering. Instead, this section addressed a different research question, namely, whether the link of neural filtering to behaviour would hold across time, irrespective of the observed stability of the measure itself. The stability of the observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationships was assessed by testing for an interaction with timepoint.</p><p>We have revised the respective Results section to more clearly state our scientific questions, and how our analysis procedure helped to address them:</p><p>&quot;The temporal instability of neural filtering challenges its status as a potential trait-like neural marker of attentive listening ability. At the same time, irrespective of the degree of reliability of neural filtering itself, across individuals it may still be reliably linked to the behavioural outcome (see Fig. 1). This is being addressed next.</p><p>On the basis of the full T1–T2 dataset, we aimed to replicate our key T1 results and test whether the previously observed between-subjects brain-behaviour relationship would hold across time: We expected an individual’s neural filtering ability to impact their listening outcome (accuracy and response speed) independently of age or hearing status12. (…) To formally test the stability of direct and indirect relationships across time, we used a moderated mediation analysis. In this analysis, the inclusion of interactions by timepoint tested whether the influence of age, sensory acuity, and neural filtering on behaviour varied significantly across time.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, the behavioral measure that is not correlated with &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; is the response speed. I wonder if the participants are asked to respond as soon as possible (not mentioned in the method).If not, the response speed may strongly reflect general cognitive function or a personal style, which is not correlated with the changes in auditory functions. This can also explain why the hearing threshold affects speech recognition accuracy but not the response speed (lines 263-264).</p></disp-quote><p>Participants were asked to response within a given time window limited to 4 s but were not implicitly instructed to respond as quickly as possible. This is now stated more clearly in the Methods section (please also refer to our response to R2 on a similar question). It is important to emphasize—as shown in Figure 4A and Figure 5B —both at the manifest and latent variable level neural filtering (and in fact also the neural tracking of attended speech, see Fig. 6C) was reliably linked to response speed at T1 and T2. These results providing important empirical ground for the question of whether changes in neural filtering are systematically related to changes in response speed, and whether the fidelity of neural filtering at T1 represents a precursor of behavioural changes.</p><p>Moreover, an interpretation of response speed as an indicator of general cognitive function is not at all incompatible with the cognitive demands imposed by the task. As the reviewer rightly stated above, performance in a dichotic listening task does not simply hinge on how auditory acuity may limit perceptual encoding of speech inputs but also on how the goal-directed application of attention modulates the encoding of relevant vs. irrelevant inputs. We here focus on one candidate neural strategy we here termed ‘neural filtering’ in line with an influential metaphor of how auditory attention may be neurally implemented (Cherry, 1953; Erb &amp; Obleser, 2020; Fernandez-Duque &amp; Johnson, 1999).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Other issues:</p><p>The authors should consider using terminology that the readers are more familiar with and avoid unsubstantiated claims.</p><p>For example, the Introduction mentions that &quot;The observation of such brain-behaviour relationships critically advances our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning. Their translational potential as neural markers predictive of behaviour, however, is often only implicitly assumed but seldomly put to the test. Using auditory cognition as a model system, we here overcome this limitation by testing directly the hitherto unknown longitudinal stability of neural filtering as a neural compensatory mechanism upholding communication success.&quot;</p><p>For the first sentence, please be clear about which aspects of &quot;our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning&quot; is critically advanced by such brain-behaviour relationships, and why such brain-behaviour relationships are so critical given that so many studies have analyzed brain-behaviour relationships. The following two sentences seem to suggest that the current study is a translational study, but the later questions do not seem to be quite translational.</p></disp-quote><p>The uncovering of robust between- and within-subject brain behaviour-relationships is a key scientific goal that unites basic and applied neuroscience. From a basic neuroscience standpoint, the observation of such brain–behaviour links provides important mechanistic insight into the neurobiological implementation of higher order cognition – here the application of auditory spatial attention in the service of speech comprehension. At the same time, they provide fruitful ground for translational inquiries of applied neuroscience. We therefore don’t consider it contradictory at all that the current study addressed both more basic and applied/translational neuroscientific research questions.</p><p>We have rephrased the respective section as follows:</p><p>&quot;The observation of such brain–behaviour relationships critically advances our understanding of the neurobiological foundation of cognitive functioning by showing, for example, how neural implementations of auditory selective attention support attentive listening. They also provide fruitful ground for scientific inquiries into the translational potential of neural markers. However, the potency of neural markers to predict future behavioural outcomes is often only implicitly assumed but seldomly put to the test15.&quot;</p><p>More importantly, &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; is a key concept in the paper but I'm not sure what it means. The authors have only mentioned that auditory cognition is a model system for &quot;neuronal filtering&quot;, but not what &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; is. Even for auditory cognition, I'm not sure what &quot;neuronal filtering&quot; is and why the envelope response is representative of &quot;neuronal filtering&quot;.</p><p>As spelled out in the Introduction, we define our ‘neural filtering’ metric of interest as neural manifestation of the attention-guided segregation of behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds. By terming this signature neural ‘filtering’, we take up on a highly influential algorithmic metaphor of how auditory attention may be implemented at the neurobiological level (Cherry, 1953; Erb &amp; Obleser, 2020; Fernandez-Duque &amp; Johnson, 1999).</p><p>We now provide more mechanistic detail in our description of the neural filtering signature analysed in the current study:</p><p>&quot;Recent research has focused on the neurobiological mechanisms that promote successful speech comprehension by implementing ‘neural filters’ that segregate behaviourally relevant from irrelevant sounds. Such neural filter mechanisms act by selectively increasing the sensory gain for behaviourally relevant inputs or by inhibiting the processing of irrelevant inputs5-7. A growing body of evidence suggests that speech comprehension is neurally supported by an attention-guided filter mechanism that modulates sensory gain and arises from primary auditory and perisylvian brain regions: By synchronizing its neural activity with the temporal structure of the speech signal of interest, the brain ‘tracks’ and thereby better encodes behaviourally relevant auditory inputs to enable attentive listening 8-11.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1C should be better organized and the questions mentioned in the Introduction should be numbered.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised both the respective section of the Introduction and corresponding Figure 1 in line with the reviewer’s suggestions. The revised text and figure are reproduced below for the reviewer’s convenience:</p><p>&quot;First, by focusing on each domain individually, we ask how sensory, neural, and behavioural functioning evolve cross-sectionally across the middle and older adult life span (Fig. 1B). More importantly, we also ask how they change longitudinally across the studied two-year period (Fig. 1C, Q1), and whether aging individuals differ significantly in their degree of change (Q2). We expect individuals’ hearing acuity and behaviour to decrease from T1 to T2. Since we previously observed inter-individual differences in neural filtering to be independent of age and hearing status, we did not expect any systematic longitudinal change in neural filtering.</p><p>Second, we test the longitudinal stability of the previously observed age- and hearing-loss–independent effect of neural filtering on both accuracy and response speed (Fig. 1A). To this end, we analyse the multivariate direct and indirect relationships of hearing acuity, neural filtering and listening behaviour within and across timepoints.</p><p>Third, leveraging the strengths of latent change score modelling16,17, we fuse cross-sectional and longitudinal perspectives to probe the role of neural filtering as a precursor of behavioural change in two different ways: we ask whether an individual’s T1 neural filtering strength can predict the observed behavioural longitudinal change (Q3), and whether two-year change in neural filtering can explain concurrent change in listening behaviour (Q4). Here, irrespective of the observed magnitude and direction of T1–T2 developments, two scenarios are conceivable: Intra-individual neural and behavioural change may be either be correlated—lending support to a compensatory role of neural filtering—or instead follow independent trajectories18 (see Fig. 1C).&quot;</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of key assumptions and research questions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Listening behaviour at a given timepoint is shaped by an individuals’ sensory and neural functioning.
