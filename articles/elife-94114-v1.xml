In flies, TADs are formed by physical interactions between neighboring boundaries. Fly boundaries exhibit distinct partner preferences, and pairing interactions between boundaries are typically orientation-dependent. Pairing can be head-to-tail or head-to-head. The former generates a stem-loop TAD, while the latter gives a circle-loop TAD. The TAD that encompasses the <italic>Drosophila even skipped</italic> (<italic>eve</italic>) gene is formed by the head-to-tail pairing of the <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> boundaries. To explore the relationship between loop topology and the physical and regulatory landscape, we flanked the <italic>nhomie</italic> boundary region with two attP sites. The attP sites were then used to generate four boundary replacements: <italic>λ DNA</italic>, <italic>nhomie forward</italic> (WT orientation), <italic>nhomie reverse</italic> (opposite of WT orientation), and <italic>homie forward</italic> (same orientation as WT <italic>homie</italic>). The <italic>nhomie forward</italic> replacement restores the WT physical and regulatory landscape: in MicroC experiments, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is a ‘volcano’ triangle topped by a plume, and the <italic>eve</italic> gene and its regulatory elements are sequestered from interactions with neighbors. The <italic>λ DNA</italic> replacement lacks boundary function: the endpoint of the ‘new’ <italic>eve</italic> TAD on the <italic>nhomie</italic> side is ill-defined, and <italic>eve</italic> stripe enhancers activate a nearby gene, <italic>eIF3j</italic>. While <italic>nhomie reverse</italic> and <italic>homie forward</italic> restore the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, the topology is a circle-loop, and this changes the local physical and regulatory landscape. In MicroC experiments, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD interacts with its neighbors, and the plume at the top of the <italic>eve</italic> triangle peak is converted to a pair of ‘clouds’ of contacts with the next-door TADs. Consistent with the loss of isolation afforded by the stem-loop topology, the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers weakly activate genes in the neighboring TADs. Conversely, <italic>eve</italic> function is partially disrupted.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromosome structure</kwd><kwd>stem-loops</kwd><kwd>circle-loops</kwd><kwd>TADs</kwd><kwd>boundary:boundary pairing</kwd><kwd>pairing orientation</kwd><kwd>gene expression</kwd><kwd>chromatin insulator</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>New Jersey Commission on Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>COCR23PDF011</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ke</surname><given-names>Wenfan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Histochemical Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Keystone Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ke</surname><given-names>Wenfan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM126975</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schedl</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM137062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jaynes</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Boundary:boundary pairing generates either stem-loop or circle-loop TADs, and these loop topologies differ in how they impact chromosome structure and genetic activities.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomes in multicellular animals are organized into a series of topologically independent looped domains, called TADs, or topologically associating domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavalheiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jerković et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matthews and White, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowley and Corces, 2018</xref>). The arrangement of TADs in a given chromosomal DNA segment is generally (though not precisely) similar in different tissues and developmental stages, and this is a reflection of the mechanism underlying TAD formation—the endpoints of TADs are determined by a special class of elements called chromatin boundaries or insulators. While boundary-like elements have been identified in a wide range of animals and plants, the properties of this class of DNA elements have been most fully characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cavalheiro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>). Fly boundaries have one or more large (100–400 bp) nucleosome-free nuclease-hypersensitive sequences that are targets for multiple DNA binding chromosomal architectural proteins. While only a single chromosomal architectural protein, CTCF, has been characterized in mammals, there are several dozen such proteins in flies, and the list is still growing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Heger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heger and Wiehe, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoborg and Labrador, 2010</xref>). In addition to subdividing the chromosome into a series of loops, fly boundary elements have insulating activity. When placed between enhancers or silencers and their target promoters, boundaries block regulatory interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chetverina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>). This activity provides a mechanism for delimiting units of independent gene activity: genes located between a pair of compatible boundaries are subject to regulatory interactions with enhancers/silencers present in the same chromosomal interval, while they are insulated from the effects of enhancers/silencers located beyond either boundary in adjacent regulatory neighborhoods. It is currently thought that their ability to organize the chromosome into topologically independent loops is important for their insulating activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Shen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muravyova et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Studies dating back to the 1990s have suggested that fly boundaries subdivide the chromosome into loops by physically pairing with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chetverina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>). In these first experiments, regulatory interactions were observed for transgenes inserted at distant sites in chromosome that were carrying either the <italic>gypsy</italic> transposon boundary <italic>su(Hw</italic>) or the bithorax complex (BX-C) boundary <italic>Mcp</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muller et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sigrist and Pirrotta, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vazquez et al., 1993</xref>). Further support for the idea that boundaries function by pairing has come from chromatin immunoprecipitation, chromosome conformation capture (CCC), MicroC, and direct imaging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vazquez et al., 2006</xref>). More recent studies have revealed physical interactions in the CNS, such as those found for <italic>su(Hw</italic>) and <italic>Mcp,</italic> which ‘reach over’ multiple intervening TADs, consistent with them playing an important role in cell type-specific gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mohana et al., 2023</xref>) by bringing distant enhancers and promoters together.</p><p>The parameters governing pairing interactions have been defined using insulator bypass, transvection, and boundary competition assays. These studies have shown that fly boundaries are able to pair not only with heterologous boundaries but also with copies of themselves. Moreover, the pairing interactions typically exhibit a number of characteristic features: promiscuity coupled with clear partner preferences, and orientation dependence.</p><p>Partner preferences depend upon the chromosomal architectural proteins that interact with each boundary. For example, in the boundary bypass assay, a set of enhancers are placed upstream of two reporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai and Shen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muravyova et al., 2001</xref>). When multimerized dCTCF sites are placed between the enhancers and the closest reporters, both reporters are insulated from the enhancers. When a second set of multimerized dCTCF sites are placed downstream of the closest reporter, bypass is observed. In this case the closest reporter, which is bracketed by the multimerized dCTCF sites, is still insulated from the enhancers; however, the downstream reporter is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muravyova et al., 2001</xref>). Heterologous combinations give a different result: when multimerized dCTCF sites are placed upstream of the closest reporter and multimerized Zw5 sites are placed downstream, no bypass is observed. Endogenous fly boundaries also show partner preferences in bypass assays and in boundary competition experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kyrchanova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kyrchanova et al., 2008b</xref>). On the other hand, while boundaries have partner preferences, they are also promiscuous in their ability to establish functional interactions with other boundaries. For example, the <italic>Fab-8</italic> insulator can partner with <italic>scs’</italic> from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> heat shock locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gohl et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition, to partner preferences, pairing interactions between endogenous fly boundaries are, with a few exceptions, orientation-dependent. Self-pairing interactions are head-to-head. This seems to be a common feature of fly boundaries and has been observed for <italic>scs</italic>, <italic>scs’</italic>, <italic>iA2</italic>, <italic>wari</italic>, <italic>Mcp</italic>, <italic>Fab-8</italic>, <italic>AB-I, homie,</italic> and <italic>nhomie</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>). In contrast, pairing interactions between heterologous boundaries can be head-to-head or head-to-tail. The two boundaries bracketing the <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<italic>eve</italic>) locus, <italic>homie</italic> and <italic>nhomie</italic>, pair with each other head-to-tail, while boundaries in the <italic>Abdominal-B</italic> (<italic>Abd-B</italic>) region of the BX-C usually pair with their neighbors head-to-head. The topology of the loops (TADs) generated by head-to-tail and head-to-head pairing in <italic>cis</italic> between neighboring boundaries is distinct. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, head-to-tail pairing generates stem-loops, while head-to-head pairing generates circle-loops. The loops could be connected to each other by unanchored loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), or they could be linked directly to each other if boundaries can pair simultaneously with both neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). An alternating pattern of TADs connected by DNA segments that crosslink to each other with reduced frequency (c.f., <italic>λ DNA</italic> below) is not often observed in MicroC experiments. Instead, most TADs appeared to be directly connected to both of their neighbors without an intervening unanchored loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levo et al., 2022</xref>; see also below). This would suggest that TAD boundaries are typically linked to both neighbors, either simultaneously or as alternating pair-wise interactions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Diagram of the possible loop topologies generated by head-to-head and head-to-tail pairing.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Head-to-tail boundary pairing (arrows) generates a series of stem-loops linked together by an unanchored loop. In this case, the main axis of the chromosome would correspond to the unanchored loops connecting different stem-loops. (<bold>B</bold>) If boundaries pair with both neighbors (head-to-tail), the stem-loops would be linked to each other by the paired boundaries. In this case the main axis of the chromosome would correspond to the paired boundaries.

(<bold>D</bold>) If boundaries pair with both neighbors (head-to-head), the chromatin fiber will be organized into a series of circle-loops connected to each other at their base, and these paired boundaries will define the chromosomal axis. In both (<bold>B</bold>) and (<bold>D</bold>), the pairing interactions between the blue and red boundaries need not be in register with the pairing of the red boundary to the next-door green boundary. In this case, the main axis of the chromosome may bend and twist, and this could impact the relative orientation of the stem-loops/circle-loops. More complex structures would be generated by mixtures of stem-loops and circle-loops.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Key to understanding the 3D organization of chromosomes in multicellular eukaryotes will be the identification of TADs that are stem-loops and TADs that are circle-loops. In the studies reported here, we have used MicroC to analyze the contact maps generated by stem-loops and circle-loops. Stem-loop and circle-loop TADs are expected to interact differently with their neighbors, and this should be reflected in the patterns of crosslinking events between neighboring TADs. As illustrated for linked stem-loops in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, TAD2 is isolated from its next-door neighbors, TAD1 and TAD3. In this configuration, crosslinking events between sequences in TAD2 and sequences in TAD1 and TAD3 will be suppressed. On the other hand, TAD1 and TAD3 are in comparatively close proximity, and crosslinking between sequences in these two TADs is expected to be enhanced. A different pattern of neighborly interactions is expected for circle-loop TADs. In this case, the TAD in the middle, TAD2, is expected to interact with both of its neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To test these predictions, we have first compared the MicroC contact profiles for stem-loop and circle-loop TADs. For stem-loops we selected the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, while for circle-loops we chose the four TADs that comprise the <italic>Abd-B</italic> parasegment-specific regulatory domains. We show that these stem-loop and circle-loop TADs have distinctive crosslinking signatures. To confirm these MicroC signatures, we converted the topology of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD from a stem-loop to a circle-loop. In addition to changing the MicroC signature of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, the change in topology is accompanied by changes in the regulatory interactions between <italic>eve</italic> and its neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stem-loops versus circle-loops</title><p>The distinctive loop topologies of stem-loops and circle-loops are expected to be reflected in the contact maps that are generated in MicroC experiments. To determine if this is the case, we compared the MicroC contact maps for the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and the TADs that correspond to the four <italic>Abd-B</italic> parasegment-specific regulatory domains, <italic>iab-5</italic>, <italic>iab-6</italic>, <italic>iab-7,</italic> and <italic>iab-8</italic>. The <italic>eve</italic> TAD is generated by pairing interactions between the <italic>nhomie</italic> boundary upstream of the <italic>eve</italic> transcription unit and the <italic>homie</italic> boundary downstream. Since <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> pair with each other head-to-tail, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD has a stem-loop topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike the <italic>eve</italic> boundaries, the boundaries that delimit the <italic>Abd-B</italic> regulatory domains are thought to pair with their neighbors head-to-head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kyrchanova et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kyrchanova et al., 2008b</xref>). This means that the parasegment-specific regulatory domain TADs, <italic>iab-5</italic>, <italic>iab-6</italic>, <italic>iab-7,</italic> and <italic>iab-8</italic>, are expected to have a circle-loop topology.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and the four <italic>Abd-B</italic> TADs have distinctive MicroC contact patterns. The <italic>eve</italic> TAD is a ‘volcano’ triangle with a plume. The endpoints of the volcano triangle are delimited by <italic>nhomie</italic> on the left and <italic>homie</italic> on the right, and within the <italic>eve</italic> locus (the volcano), there are additional enhanced interactions. While the volcano triangle is generated by contacts between sequences within the <italic>eve</italic> stem-loop, contacts between sequences in <italic>eve</italic> and in the neighboring TAD on the left, TL (which contains multiple sub-TADs and six genes: <italic>CG15863, CG1418</italic>, <italic>Pal1, CG12133, eIF3j,</italic> and <italic>CG12134</italic>), are much reduced (L-ev in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). There is a similar suppression of contacts between sequences in the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and sequences in the large neighboring TAD on the right, TM (which contains <italic>TER94</italic> and <italic>Pka-R2</italic>; ev-M in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). On the other hand, as expected from the regulatory interactions observed for stem-loops in boundary bypass experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>), physical contacts between sequences in TL and TM are enhanced compared to those between <italic>eve</italic> and TL (L-ev) or TM (ev-M). Because of the preferential interactions between TADs to either side of the <italic>eve</italic> stem-loop, the <italic>eve</italic> volcano triangle is topped by a plume (L-M in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

The <italic>eve</italic> TAD is a volcano with a plume that is anchored by <italic>nhomie</italic> (<italic>nh</italic>) and <italic>homie</italic> (<italic>h</italic>). The plume is generated by crosslinking of sequences in the two neighboring TADs. At the bottom of the plume, TL sequences are linked to sequences in TM close to <italic>eve</italic>, including <italic>TER94</italic>. At the next level, sequences in TK are linked to TM (region K-M). In addition, sequences in TL are linked to sequences in TM located beyond the <italic>TER94</italic> gene. At the next level, sequences in TJ are linked to sequences in TM. Note that interactions between sequences in TL and TJ and sequences in TM close to the <italic>eve</italic> TAD are somewhat less frequent than those farther away from the <italic>eve</italic> TAD. Sequences in the neighboring TADs also interact with each other, as indicated. For example, sequences in TK and TJ interact with each other (J–K) and also interact with sequences in TI (I–K and I–J).

The <italic>AB-I</italic> boundary is located upstream of the <italic>Abd-B</italic> promoter. Each regulatory domain corresponds to a TAD. Though partially insulated from each other, each TAD interacts with its immediate neighbors. For example, <italic>iab-5</italic> interacts with its immediate neighbors <italic>iab-4</italic> and <italic>iab-6</italic> to give <italic>4–5</italic> and <italic>5–6,</italic> respectively.

In some <italic>λ DNA</italic> embryos, there were hints of stripes at the blastoderm stage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>); however, these ‘stripes’ were not observed in most embryos. Since <italic>CG12134</italic> (which forms the TL4 sub-TAD in wild type) is closest to the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers and interacts most strongly, it is possible that the promoter is not compatible with the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers.

As shown in the HCR-FISH experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and quantitated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we observed a series of <italic>eIF3j</italic> stripes over a dark background in pre-cellular blastoderm embryos.

While it is possible to detect all seven stripes in <italic>λ DNA</italic> blastoderm stage embryos, their levels of expression are not equal. The highest levels correspond to <italic>eve</italic> stripes 1, 2, 3, and 7, while <italic>eve</italic> stripes 4, 5, and 6 are expressed at much lower levels. Since the stripe enhancers for 1, 2, 3, and 7 are located between the <italic>eve</italic> promoter and <italic>nhomie</italic>, they are closer to the <italic>eIF3j</italic> promoter than the enhancers for stripes 4, 5, and 6, which are located downstream of the <italic>eve</italic> transcription unit. In addition to possible effects of distance, the subdomain linking the <italic>eve</italic> PRE and <italic>homie</italic> to the promoter is still observed in the <italic>λ DNA</italic> replacement, and this could partially sequester the enhancers located downstream of the <italic>eve</italic> promoter.</p><p>We also used digoxigenin <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization to analyze <italic>eIF3j</italic> expression.

In stage 5 embryos when <italic>eve</italic> expression is driven by specific stripe enhancers, <italic>eIF3j</italic> expression appears to be similar in all seven stripes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, WT and <italic>nhomie forward</italic>). In contrast, as was observed in the HCR-FISH experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), there is a clear bias for enhancers located upstream of <italic>eve,</italic> where <italic>eIF3j</italic> is also located, in the <italic>λ DNA</italic> replacement at this point in development. In stage 7–8 embryos, the seven-stripe enhancer drives <italic>eve</italic> expression. It is located close to <italic>nhomie</italic> and, not surprisingly, high levels of <italic>eIF3j</italic> expression are observed in all seven stripes in the <italic>λ DNA</italic> replacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At later embryonic stages, <italic>eve</italic> expression is driven by tissue-specific neurogenic, mesodermal, and anal plate enhancers. However, <italic>eIF3j</italic> is expressed at high levels in a complex pattern in older embryos, and we were unable to unambiguously detect expression driven by the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers over this background mRNA. This is also not surprising, given that all of the enhancers for these aspects of <italic>eve</italic> expression are located downstream of the <italic>eve</italic> promoter, like the enhancers driving stage 5 stripes 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>While the <italic>nhomie</italic> deletion did not have any obvious impact on the level or pattern of <italic>eve</italic> expression in blastoderm stage embryos (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), it seemed possible that <italic>eve</italic> activity was not entirely normal. To test this possibility, we mated males homozygous for either <italic>λ DNA</italic> or <italic>nhomie forward</italic> to females heterozygous for a chromosomal deficiency that includes the <italic>eve</italic> gene. We then quantitated the number of missing denticle bands in embryonic cuticle preps. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the frequency of larvae with ‘severe’ defects (two or more missing ventral denticle bands) in <italic>nhomie forward</italic> is similar to that in a WT <italic>yw</italic> control. In contrast, in the <italic>λ DNA</italic> replacement, the frequency of larval cuticles with two or more missing denticle bands is increased nearly twofold. Taken together, the increase in severity of the cuticle defects is significant at the p&lt;0.01 level (one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test). The A6 denticle band is missing most frequently, followed by A2, A4, and then A8. These even-numbered abdominal denticle bands are those that are lost in <italic>eve</italic> deficiency mutants (from which the name <italic>even skipped</italic> comes), suggesting that <italic>eve</italic> stripe expression at blastoderm stages is compromised in the embryos that produce these defective cuticles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The <italic>eve</italic> TAD is converted from a stem-loop to a circle-loop by inverting <italic>nhomie</italic></title><p>The orientation of boundary:boundary pairing interactions determines the topology of each chromatin loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 2016</xref>).

In addition, consistent with our expectation, the plume topping the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is gone and is replaced by a much more sparsely populated LDC domain (purple double-arrow and above). The more prominent LDC TAD-TAD interactions (the clouds) are between sequences in the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and the neighboring TADs. On the right, <italic>eve</italic> forms an LDC interaction domain with TM (ev-M).

In early blastoderm stage <italic>nhomie forward</italic> embryos, there is little evidence of <italic>eIF3j</italic> or <italic>TER94</italic> expression driven by <italic>eve</italic> stripe enhancers, and the HCR-FISH hybridization pattern is uniform (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

It is possible that the frequency of productive inter-TAD contacts differs from one embryo to the next; however, a more likely reason is that the high background of <italic>eIF3j</italic> and <italic>TER94</italic> transcripts obscures the low level of <italic>eve</italic> enhancer-driven expression at this stage.

One class is the PREs found in many developmental loci.

The other class of architectural elements are chromatin boundaries (also called insulators). PRE pairing in <italic>cis</italic> typically takes place within the context of a larger chromosomal domain, or TAD. In contrast, boundary elements are responsible for defining the endpoints of these looped domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arzate-Mejía et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batut et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ibragimov et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stadler et al., 2017</xref>). While not much is known about the parameters governing PRE pairing, the pairing interactions of fly boundaries have been studied in some detail. The key features include an ability to engage in promiscuous pairing interactions, distinct partner preferences, and orientation dependence. Of the endogenous (non-<italic>gypsy</italic>) boundaries whose functional properties have been studied in detail, only one<italic>, Fab-7</italic>, appears to be able to pair in both orientations. However, <italic>Fab-7</italic> may be unusual in that its boundary activity depends upon factors that have been implicated in the functioning of PREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kyrchanova et al., 2018</xref>). For all of the other boundaries studied so far, pairing interactions are orientation-dependent. When fly boundaries pair with themselves, the interactions are head-to-head (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>). This make sense, as the available evidence suggests that self-pairing interactions in <italic>trans</italic> may be largely responsible for the pairing of homologous chromosomes in precise register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erokhin et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujioka et al., 2016</xref>).

The topological consequences are quite distinct. The former generates a circle-loop, while the latter forms a stem-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chetverina et al., 2017</xref>). In the studies reported here, we have investigated how these two different topologies impact the local chromatin organization.

The MicroC profile shows that disruption of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and the neighboring TADs is one-sided. Within the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, the subdomain linking <italic>homie</italic> and the nearby PRE to the <italic>eve</italic> promoter is unaffected. Likewise, the large TAD, TM, which encompassess both <italic>TER94</italic> and <italic>pka-R2</italic>, and is defined at one end by <italic>homie</italic> and at the other by an uncharacterized boundary element upstream of the <italic>pka-R2</italic> promoter, is intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, on the <italic>nhomie</italic> side of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, the sub-TAD linking <italic>nhomie</italic> to the <italic>eve</italic> promoter is absent and is replaced by a less well-defined sub-TAD linking the <italic>eve</italic> promoter to an element near the <italic>CG12134</italic> promoter. However, the endpoint of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is no longer distinct, and <italic>eve</italic> sequences are now crosslinked to the <italic>eIF3j</italic> sub-TAD and to sequences in the more distant TL sub-TADs TL3, TL2, and TL1. Consistent with these alterations in the physical organization of the <italic>eve</italic> and neighboring TADs, the <italic>TER94</italic> gene is still insulated from the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers. While sequences in the <italic>eve</italic> TAD physically interact with the gene closest to <italic>nhomie</italic>, <italic>CG12134</italic>, only the next gene over, <italic>eIF3j</italic>, is clearly activated by the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers. Since crosslinking between sequences in <italic>CG12134</italic> and the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is more frequent than crosslinking between the <italic>eIF3j</italic> sub-TAD TL3 and the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, it seems likely that <italic>CG12134</italic> is refractory to activation by the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers. This could be due to an incompatibility between the <italic>CG12134</italic> promoter and the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers. Alternatively, the promoter may not be active at this stage. While <italic>eIF3j</italic> is activated by the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers in stage 5 embryos in the <italic>nhomie</italic> deletion, the stripe enhancers located upstream of the <italic>eve</italic> gene drive a higher level of expression than those located downstream. Two factors in addition to the effects of distance could potentially account for this finding. Since the <italic>eve</italic> promoter is located between the downstream enhancers and the <italic>eIF3j</italic> gene, activation of <italic>eIF3j</italic> by the downstream enhancers could be suppressed by promoter competition. Alternatively, or in addition, the sub-TAD formed between the 3′ PRE/<italic>homie</italic> and the <italic>eve</italic> promoter/proximal PRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujioka et al., 2008</xref>) could tend to isolate the downstream <italic>eve</italic> stripe enhancers from interactions with <italic>eIF3j</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Topology impacts local 3D genome organization and the potential for regulatory interactions</title><p>In boundary bypass experiments using endogenous fly boundaries, the ability of the upstream enhancers to activate the downstream reporter depended on the topology of the loop generated by the paired boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kyrchanova et al., 2008a</xref>). Activation is observed for stem-loops, as this configuration brings the upstream enhancers into close proximity with the downstream reporter. In contrast, the enhancers and downstream reporter are not brought into contact when the topology is a circle-loop. As would be predicted from these bypass experiments, the stem-loop formed by the head-to-tail pairing of <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> physically isolates the <italic>eve</italic> TAD from its neighbors, and this is reflected in the low density of contacts between sequences in <italic>eve</italic> and the neighboring TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Conversely, the TADs that flank <italic>eve</italic> are brought together, and contacts between them generate the plume that is observed above the <italic>eve</italic> volcano triangle.</p><p>The physical isolation afforded by the stem-loop topology is lost when the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is converted to a circle-loop either by inverting the <italic>nhomie</italic> boundary or by replacing <italic>nhomie</italic> with the <italic>homie</italic> boundary inserted in the forward direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

The alteration in the local 3D organization induced by the conversion of <italic>eve</italic> to a circle-loop is evident from the changes in the MicroC contact pattern. Instead of being isolated from neighboring TADs, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD interacts not only with its immediate neighbors, but also with more distant TADs. As a result, the plume of enhanced contacts linking TM to TL, TK, and TJ is absent and is replaced by contacts between these TADs and the <italic>eve</italic> TAD.</p><p>As might be expected from the MicroC contact patterns, the conversion to a circle-loop topology is accompanied by alterations in regulatory interactions between <italic>eve</italic> and the genes in the neighboring TADs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This pattern of activation mirrors the enhancement in contacts between the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and the neighboring TL and TM TADs evident in MicroC experiments. Thus, though <italic>eIF3j</italic> and <italic>TER94</italic> are clearly shielded from the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers when the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is a circle-loop, a greater degree of isolation from the action of the <italic>eve</italic> enhancers is afforded when the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is a stem-loop.</p><p>In addition to reducing insulation from regulatory interactions with genes in neighboring TADs, the circle-loop topology impacts the functioning of the <italic>eve</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Another (nonmutually exclusive) possibility comes from the studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yokoshi et al., 2020</xref>, who used live imaging to examine the effects of flanking a reporter with the <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> boundaries.

As indicated in the accompanying diagram, the brown and green boundaries pair with each other head-to-tail as do the blue and purple boundaries.

An important question is, what is the relative frequency of stem-loops versus circle-loops in the fly genome? The MicroC contact patterns for the stem-loop and circle-loop versions of the <italic>eve</italic> TAD are quite distinct. The former is a volcano triangle with a plume while the latter is a volcano triangle flanked by clouds. A survey of the MicroC contact patterns elsewhere in the non-repetitive regions of the fly genome indicates that volcanoes with plumes are rare (~30). For example, there are two volcano triangles with plumes in the <italic>Antennapedia</italic> complex, and they encompass the <italic>deformed</italic> and <italic>fushi-tarazu</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levo et al., 2022</xref>). However, since most of the ‘euchromatic’ regions of the fly genome are assembled into TADs whose MicroC profiles resemble that observed for <italic>eve</italic> circle-loops and the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region of BX-C, it is possible that much of the fly genome is assembled into circle-loops, not stem-loops.</p><p>While this suggestion is consistent with the available data, it is based on contact patterns between neighboring TADs, and important caveats remain. For one, the contact patterns between neighboring TADs can deviate in one way or another from that seen in the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region. For example, there are TADs in which interactions with one set of neighbors appear to be suppressed as expected for stem-loops, but the classic plume is absent, as interactions are not suppressed with the other neighbors (c.f., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In other cases, there is a series of complicated TAD-TAD interactions topped by a rectangular plume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>, purple arrow). For this reason, it will not be possible to draw firm conclusions about the frequency of stem-loops versus circle-loops genome-wide until the relative orientation of the paired boundaries themselves can be determined directly. On the other hand, it is clear from our studies that both classes of TADs must exist in flies. If, as seems likely, a significant fraction of the TADs genome-wide are circle-loops, this would effectively exclude cohesin-based loop extrusion as a general mechanism for TAD formation in flies. In addition, though stem-loops could be generated by a cohesin-dependent mechanism, it is unlikely that this mechanism is operational in flies, as we have shown here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bing et al., 2024</xref> that stem-loops in flies are formed by orientation-dependent boundary:boundary pairing.</p><p>Another important question is whether our findings have any relevance to the formation and topology of TADs in mammals. In the most common version of the loop extrusion model, the mammalian genome is assembled into an alternating pattern of stem-loops and unanchored loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Davidson and Peters, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Higashi and Uhlmann, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perea-Resa et al., 2021</xref>). In this case, one might expect to observe volcano triangles topped by plumes alternating with DNA segments that have a considerably lower density of internal contacts. However, this crosslinking pattern is not observed in published MicroC data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hsieh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krietenstein et al., 2020</xref>). Instead of an alternating pattern of high-density TAD triangles separated by regions of low-density contacts, the TAD triangles are generally linked to both neighbors, just as in flies. Moreover, also like in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are few stem-loop volcano TADs topped by plumes. Instead, the crosslinking pattern between neighboring TADs appears similar to that observed for circle-loops in flies. Of course, one problem with these MicroC studies is that the resolution may not be sufficient to detect volcanoes with plumes or the other features predicted by the loop-extrusion model. However, there are no obvious volcanoes with plumes in the much higher resolution RCMC studies of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goel et al., 2023</xref>. Instead, the MicroC profiles most closely resemble those seen in the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region of BX-C (c.f. the <italic>Ppm1g</italic> locus in Figure 4 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goel et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, compromising cohesin activity has minimal impact on the TADs in this region of the mouse genome, as evidenced from the MicroC pattern before and after knockdown. Based on these observations, one can reasonably question whether cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is deployed in mammals as the mechanism for not only generating TADs but also determining TAD boundaries. Clearly, validation of the loop-extrusion/CTCF road-block model as currently formulated will require a direct demonstration that mammalian TADs are exclusively either stem-loops or unanchored loops, and that the endpoints are always (or almost always) determined by CTCF roadblocks.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>TADs and A/B compartmentalization</title><p>A/B compartmentalization has been proposed as a mechanism for subdividing the chromosome into discrete domains that is independent of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and CTCF. In this model, shared biochemical/biophysical properties that reflect the relative transcriptional state of each chromosomal segment drive block polymer co-segregation into a series of discrete domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowley and Corces, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rowley et al., 2017</xref>). While previous studies suggested that the A and B compartments represented Mb-scale DNA segments, in more recent studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harris et al., 2023</xref> found that the average compartment size is on the order of 12 kb. Not only is this much smaller than originally suggested, it is also similar in size to that of most TADs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, including the <italic>eve</italic> TAD. Moreover, in their studies (and also in our data sets), there is close to a one-to-one correspondence between the linear arrangement of individual TADs along the chromosome and the DNA segments that are thought to assemble into discrete domains by co-polymer segregation. This close connection to TADs is also reflected in the patchwork patterns of interacting chromatin domains that are visualized in studies on A/B compartments.</p><p>According to this newer version of the compartment model, the chromatin state of each DNA segment determines not only whether it will assemble into a discrete domain, but also how the resulting domain interacts with next-door neighbors, next-next-door neighbors, etc. However, this model does not appear to fit with several of our findings. To begin with, the sequences included in the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and its patterns of interaction with neighboring TADs are essentially the same in NC14 embryos as they are in 12–16 hr embryos. In the former case, <italic>eve</italic> is transcriptionally poised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>), probably in most or all nuclei, while in the latter case, the entire <italic>eve</italic> TAD is silenced by a PcG-dependent mechanism in all but a few nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nègre et al., 2010</xref>). However, this transition from potentially active to silenced does not impact the <italic>eve</italic> TAD, nor does it alter how the <italic>eve</italic> TAD interacts with the neighboring TADs that are (mostly) transcriptionally active at both stages of development. Similarly, in the meta-loops we have examined, the transcriptional state of the TADs and their contact patterns with their neighbors are not consistent with a strict partitioning of chromosomal segments into one of two compartments. For example, in the <italic>CG3294</italic> meta-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), the three genes (<italic>CG33534</italic>, the odorant binding gene <italic>Obp22a</italic> and the <italic>Npc2a</italic> gene) that comprise the TAD upstream of the blue boundary would be predicted to be in the same chromatin state; however, while <italic>CG33534</italic> and <italic>Obp22a</italic> are not expressed in embryos, the <italic>Npc2a</italic> gene is expressed at high levels during embryogenesis and should partition into a separate TAD. The TAD downstream of the blue boundary contains two transcriptionally repressed genes (<italic>CG15353</italic> and <italic>Nplp4</italic>) in 12–16 hr embryos. This TAD physically interacts with the TAD downstream of the purple boundary that contains <italic>CG3294</italic> and <italic>slf</italic>. According to the A/B compartment model, the <italic>CG15353</italic> and <italic>Nplp4</italic> TAD interacts with the <italic>CG3294</italic> and <italic>slf</italic> TAD because the chromatin in these two TADs share biochemical/biophysical properties that are characteristic of the inactive B compartment. However, unlike <italic>CG15353</italic> and <italic>Nplp4</italic>, both <italic>slf</italic> and <italic>CG3294</italic> are expressed in 12–16 hr embryos, <italic>slf</italic> at a high level and <italic>CG3294</italic> at a low level.</p><p>Likewise, if block-polymer co-segregation is the determining factor for both TAD formation and the patterns of TAD:TAD interactions, then our manipulations of the <italic>nhomie</italic> boundary should have only a minimal impact on the MicroC contact maps, unless there are significant changes in the transcriptional status of <italic>eve</italic> and its neighbors. In the <italic>lambda</italic> DNA replacement, the left endpoint of the WT <italic>eve</italic> TAD (the normal location of <italic>nhomie</italic>) in 12–16 hr embryos is lost, and instead it appears to map primarily to the right or left boundaries of the TL-3 sub-TAD. TL-3 contains the <italic>eIF3j</italic> gene, which is expressed at high levels throughout the embryo at this stage, while <italic>eve</italic> itself is silenced by a PcG-dependent mechanism in all but a small number of cells. The <italic>nhomie reverse</italic> and <italic>homie forward</italic> replacements restore the <italic>eve</italic> TAD. This means that in this instance, TAD formation is mediated by the pairing of the two replacement boundaries with <italic>homie</italic> (as demonstrated by the viewpoints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and not by partitioning into an A or B compartment. The replacements also alter interactions between <italic>eve</italic> and the neighboring TADs. Unlike in WT where the <italic>eve</italic> TAD is physically isolated from its neighbors, the <italic>eve</italic> TAD interacts with both neighbors in these two replacements. However, the genes in the neighboring TADs do not share the same biochemical/biophysical state—they are active in 12–16 hr embryos, and so should segregate into the A compartment, while <italic>eve</italic> is inactive and should segregate into the B compartment.</p><p>While these observations are inconsistent with a model in which block-polymer co-segregation is responsible for the formation of TADs and determining the pattern of TAD:TAD interactions, this does not rule out a different role, namely in augmenting the insulating activity of boundary elements. One of the defining properties of boundary elements is to restrict the activities of enhancers and silencers, and this helps ensure that the chromatin within a given TAD shares the same biochemical and biophysical properties. The shared biochemical/biophysical properties could in turn enhance the segregation of the chromatin into different compartments, and thus mediate some of the changes we observe. As we cannot rule out the possibility that such biophysical forces augment the functional properties of boundaries, we should add them to the list of downstream events that are dependent upon boundary–boundary interactions and the specific topologies that they can induce. So, while compartment co-segregation may well play a role, on multiple length scales, in mediating the effects of boundaries and other regulatory elements on gene expression and chromosome topology, it certainly cannot ‘replace’ their functional properties as an explanation for those effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Creation of <italic>nhomie</italic> deletion flies</title><p>To modify <italic>nhomie</italic> at the <italic>eve</italic> locus, we used recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bateman et al., 2006</xref>).

They perform Micro-C on young embryos and conclude that endogenous Nhomie and Homie boundaries flanking eve pair with head-to-tail directionality to form a chromosomal stem loop. Abrogating the Nhomie boundary leads to ectopic activation of genes in the former neighboring TAD by eve embryonic stripe enhancers. Replacing Nhomie by an inverted version or by Homie (which pairs with itself head-to-head) transformed the stem loop into a circle loop. An important finding was that stem and circle loops differentially impact endogenous gene regulation both within the eve TAD and in the TADs bracketing eve. Intriguingly, an eve TAD with a circle loop configuration leads to ectopic activation of flanking genes by eve enhancers - indicating compromised regulatory boundary activity despite the presence of an eve TAD with intact left and right boundaries.</p><p>The results obtained are of high-quality and are meticulously discussed. This work advances our fundamental understanding of how 3D genome topologies affect enhancer-promoter communication.</p><p>This study raises interesting questions to be addressed in future studies.</p><p>First, given the unique specificity with which Nhomie and Homie pair (and exhibit &quot;homing&quot; activity), the generalizability of TAD formation by directional boundary pairing remains unclear. Testing whether boundary pairing is a phenomenon restricted to exceptional loci picked for study, rather than a broader rule of TAD formation, would best be done through the development of untargeted approaches to study boundary pairing.</p><p>Second, boundary pairing is one of several mechanisms that may form chromosomal contact domains such as TADs. Other mechanisms include cohesin-mediated chromosomal loop extrusion and the inherent tendency of transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin to segregate (or compartmentalize). The functional interplay between these possible TAD-forming mechanisms remains to be further investigated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94114.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study reports a set of experiments and subsequent analyses focusing on the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> boundary elements in shaping 3D genome structure and regulating gene expression. The authors primarily focus on the region of the fly genome containing the even skipped (eve) gene; eve is expressed in a canonical spatial pattern in fly embryos and its locus is flanked by the well-characterized neighbor of homie (nhomie) and homie boundary elements. The main focus of the investigation is the orientation dependence of these boundary elements, which had been observed previously using reporter assays. In this study, the authors use Crispr/Cas9 editing followed by recombination-mediated cassette exchange to create a series of recombinant fly lines in which the nhomie boundary element is either replaced with exongenous sequence from phage 𝝀, an inversion of nhomie, or a copy of homie that has the same orientation as the endogenous homie sequence. The nhomie sequence is also regenerated in its native orientation to control for effects introduced by the transgenesis process.</p><p>The authors then perform high-resolution Micro-C to analyze 3D structure and couple this with fluorescent and colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization experiments to measure the expression of eve and nearby genes during different stages of fly development. The major findings of these experiments are that total loss of boundary sequence (replacement with 𝝀 DNA) results in major 3D structure changes and the most prominent observed gene changes, while inversion of the nhomie boundary or replacement with homie resulted in more modest effects in terms of 3D structure and gene expression changes and a distinct pattern of gene expression change from the 𝝀 DNA replacement. As the samples in which the nhomie boundary is inverted or replaced with homie have similar Micro-C profiles at the eve locus and show similar patterns of a spurious gene activation relative to the control, the observed effects appear to be driven by the relative orientation of the nhomie and homie boundary elements to one another.</p><p>Collectively, the findings reported in the manuscript are of broad interest to the 3D genome field. Although extensive work has gone into characterizing the patterns of 3D genome organization in a whole host of species, the underlying mechanisms that structure genomes and their functional consequences are still poorly understood. The perhaps best understood system, mechanistically, is the coordinated action of CTCF with the cohesin complex, which in vertebrates appears to shape 3D contact maps through a loop extrusion-pausing mechanism that relies on orientation-dependent sequence elements found at the boundaries of interacting chromatin loops. Despite having a CTCF paralog and cohesin, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome does not appear to be structured by loop extrusion-pausing. The identification of orientation-dependent elements with pronounced structural effects on genome folding thus may shed light on alternative mechanisms used to regulated genome structure, which in turn may yield insights into the significance of particular folding patterns.</p><p>On the whole, this study is comprehensive and represents a useful contribution to the 3D genome field. The transgenic lines and Micro-C datasets generated in the course of the work will be valuable resources for the research community. Moreover, the manuscript, while dense in places, is generally clearly written and comprehensive in its description of the work. However, I have a number of comments and critiques of the manuscript, mainly centering on the framing of the experiments and presentation of the Micro-C results and on the manner in which the data are analyzed and reported.</p><p>As this document now reflects my review of a revised version of the initial preprint, I will begin to add the new content at this point. As discussed in detail in the following paragraphs, my initial impression of the manuscript has not changed, so I have accordingly left the above text unaltered.</p><p>In my initial review, I provided a number of suggestions to improve the quality of the manuscript. These suggestions, which took the form of six major and three minor points, largely focused on (1) altering the writing in certain places to make the story more broadly accessible to the readership and (2) the inclusion of key, missing methodological detail to increase the rigor and reproducibility of the study. No new experiments were requested, and all of the points could be readily addressed with rather straightforward textual changes.</p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors elected to directly address one of the major points and two of the minor points (major point 4, minor points 1 and 3). The remainder of my suggestions remain entirely unaddressed. A similar level of responsiveness was afforded to the very reasonable critiques of the other Reviewer and the Reviewing Editor. The authors have instead largely chosen to respond to the points raised exclusively in the rebuttal document. This document sprawls across &gt;22 pages, includes numerous in-line figures, and cites dozens of references. The tone of this document, in many places, is at best forceful. In a less generous interpretation, many sections are combative, dismissive, and borderline unprofessional.</p><p>It is my opinion that the authors are doing the scientific community a disservice with their response. While it is my understanding that readers will be able see the rebuttal letter, I find that end result far from satisfying. How many readers will take the trouble to access that file, versus the manuscript itself? Skirting the review critiques places an unfair burden on readers, who are expecting peer-reviewed science, to dig into the accessory files to follow the critique and response, rather than seeing in reflected in the final product as they accustomed. Intentionally or not, the tactics the authors have chosen detract from what is otherwise a novel and well-intentioned new publishing model. It is also worth pointing out that peer review is done as an act of service to the scientific community, as the senior authors are doubtless aware. The other reviewer, the Reviewing Editor, and I have all taken time away from advancing our own careers and those of our trainees to offer the thoughtful critiques that were so pointedly dismissed.</p><p>In summary, as the vast majority of my critiques remain unaddressed, I have simply reproduced them below.</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>(1) The authors motivate much of the introduction and results with hypothetical &quot;stem loop&quot; and &quot;circle loop&quot; models of chromosome confirmation, which they argue are reflected in the Micro-C data and help to explain the observed ISH patterns. While such structures may possibly form, the support for these specific models vs. the many alternatives is not in any way justified. For instance, no consideration is given to important biophysical properties such as persistence length, packing/scaling, and conformational entropy. As the biophysical properties of chromatin are a very trafficked topic both in terms of experimentation and computational modeling and generally considered in the analysis of chromosome conformation data, the study would be strengthened by acknowledgement of this body of work and more direct integration of its findings.</p><p>(2) Similar to Point 1, while there is a fair amount of discussion of how the observed results are or are not consistent with loop extrusion, there is no discussion of the biophysical forces that are thought to underly compartmentalization such as block-polymer co-segregation and their potential influence. I found this absence surprising, as it is generally accepted that A/B compartmentalization essentially can explain the contact maps observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other non-vertebrate eukaryotes (Rowley, ..., Corces 2017; PMID 28826674). The manuscript would be strengthened by consideration of this phenomenon.</p><p>(3) The contact maps presented in the study represent many cells and distinct cell types. It is clear from single-cell Hi-C and multiplexed FISH experiments that chromosome conformation is highly variable even within populations of the same cell, let alone between cell types, with structures such as TADs being entirely absent at the single cell level and only appearing upon pseudobulking. It is difficult to square these observations with the models of relatively static structures depicted here. The authors should provide commentary on this point.</p><p>(4) Related to Point 4, the lack of quantitative details about the Micro-C data make it difficult to evaluate if the changes observed are due to biological or technical factors.

They perform Micro-C on young embryos and conclude that endogenous Nhomie and Homie boundaries flanking eve pair with head-to-tail directionality to form a chromosomal stem loop. Abrogating the Nhomie boundary leads to ectopic activation of genes in the former neighboring TAD by eve embryonic stripe enhancers. Replacing Nhomie by an inverted version or by Homie (which pairs with itself head-to-head) transformed the stem loop into a circle loop. An important finding was that stem and circle loops differentially impact endogenous gene regulation both within the eve TAD and in the TADs bracketing eve. Intriguingly, an eve TAD with a circle loop configuration leads to ectopic activation of flanking genes by eve enhancers - indicating compromised regulatory boundary activity despite the presence of an eve TAD with intact left and right boundaries.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Overall, the results obtained are of high-quality and are meticulously discussed.

The resulting contact profiles show TAD neighborhoods, not actual TADs.</p><p>This problem is illustrated by comparing the contact profiles of mammalian MicroC data sets at different bin sizes in Author response image 1. In this figure, the darkness of the “pixels” in panels E, F, G, and H was enhanced by reducing brightness using Photoshop.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mammalian MicroC profiles at different bin sizes.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>[Author response image 1 is adapted from Krietenstein et al., 2020; Hsieh et al., 2020.]</p><p>Panels A and C are from Krietenstein et al. (2020), and show “TADs” using bin sizes typical of most mammalian studies. At this level of resolution, TADs, the “trees” that are the building blocks of chromosomes, are not visible. Instead, what is seen are TAD neighborhoods or “forests”. Each neighborhood consists of several dozen individual TADs. The large bins in these panels also artificially accentuated TAD:TAD interactions, generating a series of “stripes” and “dots” that correspond to TADs bumping into each other and sequences getting crosslinked. For example, in panel A there is a prominent stripe on the edge of a “TAD” (blue arrow). In panel C, this stripe resolves into a series of dots arranged as parallel, but interrupted, “stripes” (green and blue arrows). At the next level of resolution, it can be seen that the stripe marked by the blue arrow and magenta asterisk is generated by contacts between the left boundary of the TAD indicated by the magenta bar with sequences in a TAD (blue bar) ~180 kb way. While dots and stripes are prominent features in contact profiles visualized with larger bin sizes (A and C), the actual TADs that are observed with a bin size of 200 bp (examples are underlined by black bars in panel G) are not bordered by stripes, nor are they topped by obvious dots. The one possible exception is the dot that appears at the top of the volcano triangle underlined with magenta.</p><p>The chromosome 1 DNA segment from the MicroC data of Hsieh et al. (2020) shows a putative volcano triangle with a plume (indicated by a V in Author response image 1, panels D, F, and H). Sequences in the V TAD don’t crosslink with their immediate neighbors, and this gives a “plume” above the volcano triangle, as indicate by the light blue asterisk in panels D, F, and H. Interestingly, the V TAD does contact two distant TADs, U on the left and W on the right. The U TAD is ~550 kb from V, and the region of contact is indicated by the black arrow. The W TAD is ~585 kb from V, and the region of contact is indicated by the magenta arrow. While the plume still seems to be visible with a bin size of 400 bp (light blue asterisk), it is hard to discern when the bin size is 200 bp, as there are not enough reads.</p><p>The evidence demonstrating that cohesin is required for TAD formation/maintenance is based on low resolution Hi-C data, and the effects that are observed are on TAD neighborhoods (forests), and not TADs (trees). In fact, there is published evidence that cohesin is not required in mammals for TAD formation/maintenance. Author response image 2 shows the <italic>Ppm1g</italic> region of mouse chromosome 5 generated from data in a paper by Goel et al. (2023). In this experiment, the authors depleted the cohesin component RAD21 and then visualized the effects on TAD organization using the high resolution region capture MicroC (RCMC) protocol. The MicroC contact map in Author response image 2 visualizes a ~150 kb DNA segment around the <italic>Ppm1pg</italic> locus at 250 bp resolution. On the right side of the diagonal is the untreated control, while the left side shows the MicroC profile of the same region after RAD21 depletion. The authors indicated that there was a 97% depletion of RAD21 in their experiment. However, as is evident from a comparison of the experimental and control, loss of RAD21 has no apparent effect on the TAD organization of this mammalian DNA segment. Likewise, TAD:TAD interactions between next door neighbors (purple asterisks), next-next door neighbors (red asterisks) and next-next-next door neighbors (blue asterisks) is not perturbed either.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>[Author response image 2 is generated from data available from Goel et al., 2023.]</p><p>Several other features are worth noting. First, unlike the MicroC experiments shown in Author response image 1, there are dots at the apex of the TADs in this chromosomal segment. In the MicroC protocol, fixed chromatin is digested to mononucleosomes by extensive MNase digestion. The resulting DNA fragments are then ligated, and dinucleosome-length fragments are isolated and sequenced. DNA sequences that are nucleosome free in chromatin (which would be promoters, enhancers, silencers and boundary elements) are typically digested to oligonucleotides in this procedure and won’t be recovered. This means that the dots shown here must correspond to mononucleosome-length elements that are MNase resistant. This is also true for the dots in the MicroC contact profiles of the <italic>Drosophila Abd-B</italic> regulatory domain (see Fig. 2B in the paper). Second, the TADs are connected to each other by 45<sup>o</sup> stripes (see blue and green arrowheads). While it is not clear from this experiment whether the stipes are generated by an active mechanism (enzyme) or by some “passive” mechanism (e.g., sliding), the stripes in this chromosomal segment <italic><underline>are no</underline>t</italic> generated by cohesin, as they are unperturbed by RAD21 depletion. Third, there are no volcano triangles with plumes in this chromosomal DNA segment. Instead, the contact patterns between neighboring TADs closely resemble those seen for the <italic>Abd-B</italic> regulatory domains (compare Author response image 2 with Fig. 2B in the paper). This similarity suggests that the TADs in and around <italic>Ppm1g</italic> may be circle-loops, not stem-loops. As volcano triangles with plumes also seem to be rare in the MicroC data sets of Krietenstein et al. (2020) and Hsieh et al. (2020) (with the caveat that these data sets are low resolution: see Author response image 1), it is possible that much of the mammalian genome is assembled into circle-loop TADs, a topology that can’t be generated by the cohesin loop-extrusion (bolo tie clip) /CTCF roadblock model.</p><fig id="sa3fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>[Author response image 3 is generated from data available from Goel et al., 2023.]</p><p>While RAD21 depletion has no apparent effect on TADs, it does appear to have a modest impact on TAD neighborhoods. This was shown in a supplemental figure in Goel et al. (2023), which visualized the <italic>Ppm1g</italic> region of chromosome 5 with bin sizes of 5 kb and 1 kb. Author response image 3 shows an ~600 kb region from chromosome 5 containing the <italic>Ppm1g</italic> gene, visualized with a bin size of 1 kb. As can be seen from comparing the MicroC profiles in this image with that in Author response image 2, individual TADs are not visible. Instead, the individual TADs are binned into large TAD “neighborhoods” that consist of multiple TADs.</p><p>Unlike the individual TADs shown in Author response image 2, the TAD neighborhoods in Author response image 3 show a limited sensitivity to RAD21 depletion. The effects of RAD21 depletion can be seen by comparing the relative pixel density in the box before (blue box above the diagonal) and after auxin-induced RAD21 degradation (purple box below the diagonal). The reduction in pixel density is greatest for more distant TAD:TAD contacts (farthest from the diagonal: green double arrow). By contrast, the TADs themselves are unaffected, as are contacts between individual TADs and their neighbors (Author response image 2 above). A subset of higher density contact “dots” (green asterisks) also appear to be reduced after RAD21 depletion, though the effects are not uniform (blue asterisks). At this point it isn’t clear why contacts between distant TADs in the same neighborhood are lost when RAD21 is depleted; however, a plausible speculation is that it is related to the functioning of cohesin in holding newly replicated DNAs together until mitosis, and whatever other role(s) it might have in chromosome condensation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, given the unique specificity with which Nhomie and Homie are known to pair (and exhibit &quot;homing&quot; activity), it is conceivable that formation of the eve TAD by boundary pairing represents a phenomenon observed at exceptional loci rather than a universal rule of TAD formation. Indeed, characteristic Micro-C features of the eve TAD are only observed at a restricted number of loci in the fly genome…..</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(1.2)</bold> The available evidence does not support the claim that <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> are “exceptional.” To begin with, <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> rely on precisely the same set of factors that have been implicated in the functioning of other boundaries in the fly genome. For example, <italic>homie</italic> requires (among other factors) the generic boundary protein Su(Hw) for insulation and long-distance interactions (Fujioka et al. 2024). (This is also true of <italic>nhomie</italic>: unpublished data.) The Su(Hw) protein (like other fly polydactyl zinc finger proteins) can engage in distant interactions. This was first shown by Sigrist and Pirrotta (Sigrist and Pirrotta 1997), who found that the <italic>su(Hw)</italic> element from the <italic>gypsy</italic> transposon can mediate long-distance regulatory interactions (PRE-dependent silencing) between transgenes inserted at different sites on homologous chromosomes (<italic>trans</italic> interactions) and at sites on different chromosomes.</p><p>The ability to mediate long-distance interactions is not unique to the <italic>su(Hw)</italic> element, or <italic>homie</italic> and <italic>nhomie</italic>. Muller et al. (1999) found that the <italic>Mcp</italic> boundary from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> BX-C is also able to engage in long-distance regulatory interactions: both PRE-dependent silencing of <italic>mini-white</italic> and enhancer activation of <italic>mini-white</italic> and <italic>yellow</italic>. The functioning of the <italic>Mcp</italic> boundary depends upon two other generic insulator proteins, Pita and the fly CTCF homolog (Kyrchanova et al. 2017). Like Su(Hw), both are polydactyl zinc finger proteins, and they resemble the mammalian CTCF protein in that their N-terminal domain mediates multimerization (Bonchuk et al. 2020; Zolotarev et al. 2016). Author response image 4 shows PRE-dependent “pairing sensitive silencing” interactions between transgenes carrying a <italic>mini-white</italic> reporter, the <italic>Mcp</italic> and <italic>scs’</italic> (BEAF-dependent, Hart et al. 1997) boundary elements, and a PRE closely linked to <italic>Mcp</italic>. In this experiment, flies homozygous for different transgene inserts were mated and the eye color was examined in their <italic>trans-</italic>heterozygous progeny. As indicated in the figure, the strongest <italic>trans-</italic>silencing interactions were observed for inserts on the same chromosomal arm; however, transgenes inserted on the left arm of chromosome 3 can interact across the centromere with transgenes inserted on the right arm of chromosome 3.</p><fig id="sa3fig4" position="float"><label>Author response image 4.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig4-v1.tif"/></fig><p>[Author response image 4 is reproduced from Figure 6 from Muller et al., 1999, with permission from Genetics Society of America.

Likewise, in flies <italic>trans-</italic>heterozygous for <italic>mini-white</italic> transgenes inserted at different sites, the eye color is equivalent to the sum of the two transgenes.

On the other hand, not all possible pairwise interactions are observed. This would suggest that potential interactions depend upon the large scale (Mb) 3D folding of the 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosome.</p><p>When the <italic>scs</italic> boundary (Zw5-dependent, Gaszner et al. 1999) was added to the transgene to give <italic>sMws’</italic>, it further enhanced the ability of distant transgenes to find each other and pair.

Vazquez et al. (2006) subsequently tagged the <italic>sMws’</italic> transgene with LacO sequences (<italic>ps0Mws’</italic>) and visualized pairing interactions in imaginal discs. <italic>Trans</italic>-heterozygous combinations on the same chromosome were found paired in 94-99% of the disc nuclei, while a <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygous combination on different chromosomes was found paired in 96% of the nuclei (Author response image 6). Vazquez et al. (2006) also examined a combination of four transgenes inserted on the same chromosome (two at the same insertion site, and two at different insertion sites). In this case, all four transgenes were clustered together in 94% of the nuclei (Author response image 6). Their studies also suggest that the distant transgenes remain paired for at least several hours. A similar experiment was done by Li et al. (2011), except that the transgene contained only a single boundary, <italic>Mcp</italic> or <italic>Fab-7</italic>. While pairing was still observed in <italic>trans</italic>-heterozygotes, the frequency was reduced without <italic>scs</italic> and <italic>scs’</italic>.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>[Author response image 6 is reproduced from Table 3 from Vazquez et al., 2006.]</p><p>It is worth pointing out that there is no plausible mechanism in which cohesin could extrude a loop through hundreds of intervening TADs, across the centromere (<italic>ff#13.101</italic> with <italic>w#11.102</italic>: Author response image 4; <italic>w#14.29 with w#11.02</italic>: Author response images 4 and 5) and come to a halt when it “encounters” <italic>Mcp</italic>-containing transgenes on different homologs. The same is true for <italic>Mcp</italic>-dependent pairing interactions in <italic>cis</italic> (Fig. 7 in Muller et al. 1999) or <italic>Mcp</italic>-dependent pairing interactions between transgenes inserted on different chromosomes (Line 8 in Author Response Figure 6, Fig. 8 in Muller et al. 1999).</p><p>These are not the only boundaries that can engage in long-distance pairing. Mohana et al. (2023) identified nearly 60 meta-loops, many of which appear to be formed by the pairing of TAD boundary elements. Two examples (at 200 bp resolution from 12-16 hr embryos) are shown in Author response image 7.</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><caption><title>Metaloops on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> chromosomes: circle-loops and multiple stem-loops.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>One of these meta-loops (panel A) is generated by the pairing of two TAD boundaries on the 2<sup>nd</sup> chromosome. The first boundary, blue (indicated by blue arrow), is located at ~2,006,500 bp, between a small TAD containing the <italic>Nplp4</italic> and <italic>CG15353</italic> genes and a larger TAD containing 3 genes, <italic>CG33543</italic>, <italic>Obp22a,</italic> and <italic>Npc2a</italic>. <italic>Nplp4</italic> encodes a neuropeptide. The functions of <italic>CG15354</italic> and <italic>CG33543</italic> are unknown. <italic>Obp22a</italic> encodes an odorant binding protein, while <italic>Npc2a</italic> encodes the Niemann-Pick type C-2a protein that is involved sterol homeostasis. The other boundary (purple: indicated by purple arrow) is located between two TADs 2.8 Mb away at 4,794,250 bp. The upstream TAD contains the <italic>fipi</italic> gene (<italic>CG15630</italic>) which has neuronal functions in male courtship, while the downstream TAD contains <italic>CG3294</italic>, which is thought to be a spliceosome component, and <italic>schlaff</italic> (<italic>slf</italic>), which encodes a chitin binding protein. As illustrated in the accompanying diagram, the blue boundary pairs with the purple boundary in a head-to-head orientation, generating a ~2.8 Mb loop with a circle-loop topology. As a result of this pairing, the multi-gene (<italic>CG33543</italic>, <italic>Obp22a,</italic> and <italic>Npc2a</italic>) TAD upstream of the blue boundary interacts with the <italic>CG15630</italic> TAD upstream of the purple boundary. Conversely the small <italic>Nplp4:CG15353</italic> TAD downstream of the blue boundary interacts with the <italic>CG3294:slf</italic> TAD downstream of the purple boundary. Even if one imagined that the cohesin bolo tie clip was somehow able to extrude 2.8 Mb of chromatin and then know to stop when it encountered the blue and purple boundaries, it would’ve generated a stem-loop, not a circle-loop.</p><p>The second meta-loop (panel B) is more complicated, as it involves pairing interactions between four boundary elements. The blue boundary (blue arrow), located ~4,801,800 bp (3L), separates a large TAD containing the <italic>RhoGEF64C</italic> gene from a small TAD containing <italic>CG7509,</italic> which encodes a predicted subunit of an extracellular carboxypeptidase. As can be seen in the MicroC contact profile and the accompanying diagram, the blue boundary pairs with the purple boundary (purple arrow), which is located at ~7,013, 500 (3L), just upstream of the 2<sup>nd</sup> internal promoter (indicated by black arrowhead) of the <italic>Mp</italic> (<italic>Multiplexin</italic>) gene. This pairing interaction is head-to-tail and generates a large stem-loop that spans ~2.2 Mb. The stem-loop brings sequences upstream of the blue boundary and downstream of the purple boundary into contact (like the strings below a bolo tie clip), just as was observed in the boundary bypass experiments of Muravyova et al. (2001) and Kyrchanova et al. (2008). The physical interactions result in a box of contacts (right top) between sequences in the large <italic>RhoGEF64C</italic> TAD and sequences in a large TAD that contains an internal <italic>Mp</italic> promoter. The second pairing interaction is between the brown boundary (brown arrow) and the green boundary (green arrow). The brown boundary is located at ~4 805,600 bp (3L), and separates the TAD containing <italic>CG7590</italic> from a large TAD containing <italic>CG1808</italic> (predicted to encode an oxidoreductase) and the <italic>Dhc64C</italic> (<italic>Dynein heavy chain 64C</italic>) gene. The green boundary is located at ~6,995,500 bp (3L), and it separates a TAD containing <italic>CG32388</italic> and the <italic>biniou</italic> (<italic>bin</italic>) transcription factor from a TAD that contains the most distal promoter of the <italic>Mp</italic> gene (blue arrowhead). As indicated in the diagram, the brown and green boundaries pair with each other head-to-tail, and this generates a small internal loop (and the final configuration would resemble a bolo tie with two tie clips). This small internal loop brings the <italic>CG7590</italic> TAD into contact with the TAD that extends from the distal <italic>Mp</italic> promoter to the 2<sup>nd</sup> internal <italic>Mp</italic> promoter. The resulting contact profile is a rectangular box with diagonal endpoints corresponding to the paired blue:purple and brown:green boundaries. The pairing of the brown:green boundaries also brings the TADs immediately downstream of the brown boundary and upstream of the green boundary into contact with each other, and this gives a rectangular box of interactions between the <italic>Dhc64C</italic> TAD and sequences in the <italic>bin</italic>/<italic>CG3238</italic> TAD. This box is located on the lower left side of the contact map.</p><p>Since the <italic>bin</italic> and <italic>Mp</italic> meta-loops in Author response image 7B are stem-loops, they could have been generated by “sequential” cohesin loop extrusion events. Besides the fact that cohesin extrusion of 2 Mb of chromatin and breaking through multiple intervening TAD boundaries challenges the imagination, there is no mechanism in the cohesion loop extrusion/CTCF roadblock model to explain why cohesion complex 1 would come to a halt at the purple boundary on one side and the blue boundary on the other, while cohesin complex 2 would instead stop when it hits the brown and green boundaries. This highlights another problem with the cohesin loop extrusion/CTCF roadblock model, namely that the roadblocks are <italic>functionally autonomous</italic>: they have an intrinsic ability to block cohesin that is entirely independent of the intrinsic ability of other roadblocks in the neighborhood. As a result, there is no mechanism for generating specificity in loop formation. By contrast, boundary pairing interactions are by definition non-autonomous and depend on the ability of individual boundaries to pair with other boundaries: specificity is built into the model.</p><p>The mechanism for pairing, and accordingly the basis for partner preferences/specificity, are reasonably well understood. Probably the most common mechanism in flies is based on shared binding sites for architectural proteins that can form dimers or multimers (Bonchuk et al. 2021; Fedotova et al. 2017). Flies have a large family of polydactyl zinc finger DNA binding proteins, and as noted above, many of these form dimers or multimers, and also function as TAD boundary proteins. This pairing principle was first discovered by Kyrchanova et al. (2008). This paper also showed that orientation-dependent pairing interactions is a common feature of endogenous fly boundaries. Another mechanism for pairing is specific protein:protein interactions between different DNA binding factors (Blanton et al. 2003). Yet a third mechanism would be proteins that bridge different DNA binding proteins together. The boundaries that use these different mechanisms (BX-C boundaries, <italic>scs</italic>, <italic>scs’</italic>) depend upon the same sorts of proteins that are used by <italic>homie</italic> and <italic>nhomie</italic>. Likewise, this same set of factors reappears, in one combination or another, in most other TAD boundaries. As for the orientation of pairing interactions, this is most likely determined by the order of binding sites for chromosome architectural proteins in the partner boundaries.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>…. and many TADs lack focal 3D interactions between their boundaries.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(1.3)</bold> The evidence that flies differ from mammals in that they “lack” focal 3D interactions is not compelling. One of the problems with drawing this distinction is that almost all of the “focal 3D interactions” seen mammalian Hi-C experiments are a consequence of binning large DNA segments in low resolution restriction enzyme-dependent experiments. This is even true in the two “high” resolution MicroC experiments that have been published (Hsieh et al. 2020; Krietenstein et al. 2020). As illustrated above in Author response image 1, most of the “focal 3D interactions” (the dots at the apex of TAD triangles) seen with large bin sizes (1 kb and greater) disappear when the bin size is 200 bp, and TADs rather than TAD neighborhoods are being visualized.</p><p>As described in point (1.1) above, in the MicroC protocol, fixed chromatin is first digested to mononucleosomes by extensive MNase digestion, processed/biotinylated, and ligated to give dinucleosome-length fragments, which are then sequenced. Regions of chromatin that are nucleosome free (promoters, enhancers, silencers, boundary elements) will typically be reduced to oligonucleotides in this procedure and will not be recovered when dinucleosome-length fragments are sequenced. The loss of sequences from typical paired boundary elements is illustrated by the <italic>Lar</italic> (<italic>Leukocyte-antigen-related-like</italic>) meta-loop shown in Author response image 8 (at 200 bp resolution). Panels A and B show the contact profiles generated when the blue boundary (which separates two TADs that span the <italic>Lar</italic> transcription unit interacts with the purple boundary (which separates two TADs in a gene poor region ~620 kb away)). The blue and purple boundaries pair with each other head-to-head, and this pairing orientation generates yet another circle-loop. In the circle-loop topology, sequences in the TADs upstream of both boundaries come into contact with each other, and this gives the small dark rectangular box to the upper left of the paired boundaries (Author response image 8A). (Note that this small box corresponds to the two small TADs upstream of the blue and purple boundaries, respectively. See panel B.) Sequences in the TADs downstream of the two boundaries also come into contact with each other, and this gives the large box to the lower right of the paired boundaries. While this meta-loop is clearly generated by pairing interactions between the blue and purple boundaries, the interacting sequences are degraded in the MicroC protocol, and sequences corresponding to the blue and purple boundaries aren’t recovered. This can be seen in panel B (red arrow and red arrowheads). When a different Hi-C procedure is used (dHS-C) that captures nucleosome-free regions of chromatin that are physically linked to each other (Author response image 8C, D), the sequences in the interacting blue and purple boundaries are recovered and generate a prominent “dot” at their physical intersection (blue arrow in panel D).</p><fig id="sa3fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 8.</label><caption><title><italic>Lar</italic> metaloop.</title><p>(A, B) MicroC. (C, D) dHS-C.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While sequences corresponding to the blue and purple boundaries are lost in the MicroC procedure, there is at least one class of element that engages in physical pairing interactions whose sequences are (comparatively) resistant to MNase digestion. This class of elements includes many PREs (Kyrchanova et al. 2018; unpublished data), the boundary bypass elements in the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region of the BX-C (Kyrchanova et al. 2023; Kyrchanova et al. 2019a; Kyrchanova et al. 2019b; Postika et al. 2018), and “tethering” elements (Batut et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023). In all of the cases tested, these elements are bound in nuclear extracts by a large (&gt;1000 kD) GAGA factor-containing multiprotein complex called LBC. LBC also binds to the <italic>hsp70</italic> and <italic>eve</italic> promoters (unpublished data). Indirect end-labeling experiments (Galloni et al. 1993; Samal et al. 1981; Udvardy and Schedl 1984) indicate that the LBC protects a ~120-180 bp DNA segment from MNase digestion. It is likely that this is the reason why LBC-bound sequences can be recovered in MicroC experiments as dots when they are physically linked to each other. One such example (based on the ChIP signatures of the paired elements) is indicated by the green arrow in panel B and D of Author response image 8. Note that there are no dots corresponding to these two LBC elements within either of the TADs immediately downstream of the blue and purple boundaries. Instead the sequences corresponding to the two LBC elements are only recovered when the two elements pair with each other over a distance of ~620 kb. The fact that these two elements pair with each other is consistent with other findings which indicate that, like classical boundaries, LBC elements exhibit partner preferences. In fact, LBC elements can sometimes function as TAD boundaries. For example, the <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary has two LBC elements, and full <italic>Fab-7</italic> boundary function can be reconstituted with just these two elements (Kyrchanova et al. 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>&quot;Chromatin Structure II: Stem-loops and circle-loops&quot; by Ke*, Fujioka*, Schedl, and Jaynes reports a set of experiments and subsequent analyses focusing on the role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> boundary elements in shaping 3D genome structure and regulating gene expression. The authors primarily focus on the region of the fly genome containing the even skipped (eve) gene; eve is expressed in a canonical spatial pattern in fly embryos and its locus is flanked by the well-characterized neighbor of homie (nhomie) and homie boundary elements. The main focus of investigation is the orientation dependence of these boundary elements, which had been observed previously using reporter assays. In this study, the authors use Crispr/Cas9 editing followed by recombination-mediated cassette exchange to create a series of recombinant fly lines in which the nhomie boundary element is either replaced with exongenous sequence from phage 𝝀, an inversion of nhomie, or a copy of homie that has the same orientation as the endogenous homie sequence. The nhomie sequence is also regenerated in its native orientation to control for effects introduced by the transgenesis process.</p><p>The authors then perform high-resolution Micro-C to analyze 3D structure and couple this with fluorescent and colorimetric RNA in situ hybridization experiments to measure the expression of eve and nearby genes during different stages of fly development. The major findings of these experiments are that total loss of boundary sequence (replacement with 𝝀 DNA) results in major 3D structure changes and the most prominent observed gene changes, while inversion of the nhomie boundary or replacement with homie resulted in more modest effects in terms of 3D structure and gene expression changes and a distinct pattern of gene expression change from the 𝝀 DNA replacement. As the samples in which the nhomie boundary is inverted or replaced with homie have similar Micro-C profiles at the eve locus and show similar patterns of a spurious gene activation relative to the control, the observed effects appear to be driven by the relative orientation of the nhomie and homie boundary elements to one another.</p><p>Collectively, the findings reported in the manuscript are of broad interest to the 3D genome field. Although extensive work has gone into characterizing the patterns of 3D genome organization in a whole host of species, the underlying mechanisms that structure genomes and their functional consequences are still poorly understood. The perhaps best understood system, mechanistically, is the coordinated action of CTCF with the cohesin complex, which in vertebrates appears to shape 3D contact maps through a loop extrusion-pausing mechanism that relies on orientation-dependent sequence elements found at the boundaries of interacting chromatin loops.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(2.1)</bold> The notion that the mammalian genome is shaped in 3D by the coordinate action of cohesin and CTCF has achieved the status of dogma in the field of chromosome structure in vertebrates. However, as we have pointed out in (1.1), the evidence supporting this dogma is far from convincing. To begin with, it is based on low resolution Hi-C experiments that rely on large bin sizes to visualize so-called “TADs.” In fact, the notion that cohesin and CTCF are responsible on their own for shaping the mammalian 3D genome appears to be a result of mistaking a series of forests for the actual trees that populate each of the forests.</p><p>As illustrated in Author response image 1 above, the “TADs” that are visualized in these low resolution data sets are not TADs at all, but rather TAD neighborhoods consisting of several dozen or more individual TADs. Moreover, the “interesting” features that are evident at low resolution (&gt;1 kb), the dots and stripes, largely disappear at resolutions appropriate for visualizing individual TADs (~200 bp).</p><p>In Author response image 2, we presented data from one of the key experiments in Goel et al. (2023). In their experiment, the authors used RCMC to generate high resolution MicroC contact maps before and after RAD21 depletion. Contrary to dogma, RAD21 depletion has <italic>no effect</italic> on TADs in a chromosome 5 DNA segment spanning the <italic>Ppm1g</italic> gene, when TADs are visualized at 200 bp resolution (as in Author response image 2) or at 250 bp resolution (as in Goel et al. 2023). These TADs look very much like the TADs we observe in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, in particular, in the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region of the BX-C that is thought to be assembled into a series of circle-loops (see Fig. 2B).</p><p>While Goel et al. (2023) observed no effect of RAD21 depletion on TADs, they found that loss of RAD21 does have some impact on the frequency of longer-distance (but not short-distance) contacts in TAD neighborhoods when their RCMC data set is visualized using bin sizes of 5 kb and 1 kb. This is shown using data from their paper, imaged using a bin size of 1 kb, in Author response image 3. The significance of this finding is, however, uncertain. It could mean that the 3D organization of large TAD neighborhoods have a special requirement for cohesin activity. On the other hand, since cohesin functions to hold sister chromosomes together after replication until they separate during mitosis (and might also participate in mitotic condensation), it is also possible that the loss of long-range contacts in large TAD neighborhoods when RAD21 is depleted is simply a reflection of this particular activity. Further studies will be required to address these possibilities.</p><p>As for CTCF: a careful inspection of the ChIP data in Author response image 2 indicates that CTCF is <italic>not</italic> found at each and every TAD boundary. In fact, the notion that CTCF is the <italic>be-all and end-all</italic> of TAD boundaries in mammals is truly hard to fathom. For one, the demands for specificity in TAD formation (and in regulatory interactions) are likely much greater than those in flies, and specificity can’t be generated by a single DNA binding protein. For another, several dozen chromosomal architectural proteins have already been identified in flies. This means that (unlike what is <italic>thought</italic> to be true in mammals) it is possible to use a combinatorial mechanism to generate specificity in, for example, the long-distance interactions in Author response images 7 and 8. As noted in (2.1) above, many of the known chromosomal architectural proteins in flies are polydactyl zinc finger proteins (just like CTCF). There are some 200 different polydactyl zinc finger proteins in flies, and the function of only a hand full of these is known at present. However, it seems likely that a reasonable fraction of this class of DNA binding proteins will ultimately turn out to have an architectural function of some type (Bonchuk et al. 2021; Fedotova et al. 2017). The number of different polydactyl zinc finger protein genes in mammals is nearly 3 times that of flies. It is really possible that of these, only CTCF is involved in shaping the 3D structure of the mammalian genome?</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite having a CTCF paralog and cohesin, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome does not appear to be structure by loop extrusion-pausing. The identification of orientation-dependent elements with pronounced structural effects on genome folding thus may shed light on alternative mechanisms used to regulated genome structure, which in turn may yield insights into the significance of particular folding patterns.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(2.2)</bold> Here we would like to draw the reviewer’s and reader’s attention to Author response image 7, which shows that orientation-dependent pairing interactions have a significant impact on physical interactions between different sequences. We would also refer the reader to two other publications. One of these is Kyrchanova et al. (2008), which was the first to demonstrate that orientation of pairing interactions matters. The second is Fujioka et al. (2016), which describes experiments indicating that <italic>nhomie</italic> and <italic>homie</italic> pair with each other head-to-tail and with themselves head-to-head.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the whole, this study is comprehensive and represents a useful contribution to the 3D genome field. The transgenic lines and Micro-C datasets generated in the course of the work will be valuable resources for the research community. Moreover, the manuscript, while dense in places, is generally clearly written and comprehensive in its description of the work. However, I have a number of comments and critiques of the manuscript, mainly centering on the framing of the experiments and presentation of the Micro-C results and on manner in which the data are analyzed and reported. They are as follows:</p><p>Major Points:</p><p>(1) The authors motivate much of the introduction and results with hypothetical &quot;stem loop&quot; and &quot;circle loop&quot; models of chromosome confirmation, which they argue are reflected in the Micro-C data and help to explain the observed ISH patterns. While such structures may possibly form, the support for these specific models vs. the many alternatives is not in any way justified. For instance, no consideration is given to important biophysical properties such as persistence length, packing/scaling, and conformational entropy. As the biophysical properties of chromatin are a very trafficked topic both in terms of experimentation and computational modeling and generally considered in the analysis of chromosome conformation data, the study would be strengthened by acknowledgement of this body of work and more direct integration of its findings.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(2.3)</bold> The reviewer is not correct in claiming that “stem-loops” and “circle-loops” are “hypothetical.” There is ample evidence that both types of loops are present in eukaryotic genomes, and that loop conformation has significant readouts in terms of not only the physical properties of TADs but also their functional properties. Here we would draw the reviewer’s attention to Author response images 7 and 8 for examples of loops formed by the orientation-dependent pairing of yet other TAD boundary elements. As evident from the MicroC data in these figures, circle-loops and stem-loops have readily distinguishable contact patterns. The experiments in Fujioka et al. (2016) demonstrate that <italic>homie</italic> and <italic>nhomie</italic> pair with each other head-to-tail, while they pair with themselves head-to-head. The accompany paper (Bing et al. 2024) also provides evidence that loop topology is reflected both in the pattern of activation of reporters and in the MicroC contact profiles. We would also mention again Kyrchanova et al. (2008), who were the first to report orientation-dependent pairing of endogenous fly boundaries.</p><p>At this juncture, it would premature to try to incorporate computational modeling of chromosome conformation in our studies. The reason is that the experimental foundations that would be essential for building accurate models are lacking. As should be evident from Author response images 1-3 above, studies on mammalian chromosomes are simply not of high enough resolution to draw firm conclusions about chromosome conformation: in most studies only the forests are visible. While the situation is better in flies, there are still too many unknown. As just one example, it would be important to know the orientation of the boundary pairing interactions that generate each TAD. While it is possible to infer loop topology from how TADs interact with their neighbors (a plume versus clouds), a conclusive identification of stem- and circle-loops will require a method to unambiguously determine whether a TAD boundary pairs with its neighbor head-to-head or head-to-tail.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Similar to Point 1, while there is a fair amount of discussion of how the observed results are or are not consistent with loop extrusion, there is no discussion of the biophysical forces that are thought to underly compartmentalization such as block-polymer co-segregation and their potential influence. I found this absence surprising, as it is generally accepted that A/B compartmentalization essentially can explain the contact maps observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other non-vertebrate eukaryotes (Rowley, ..., Corces 2017; PMID 28826674). The manuscript would be strengthened by consideration of this phenomenon.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(2.4)</bold> As the reviewer indicates, an alternative mechanism for generating TADs and for explaining the patterns of TAD:TAD interactions is provided by the A/B compartment model. This model is not consistent with the experiments described in either this manuscript or in the accompanying manuscript (Bing et al. 2024). Nor does it fit with extensive studies on the structural and functional properties of boundary elements in the <italic>Abd-B</italic> region of the bithorax complex. As the reviewer has suggested, we have included a discussion of the A/B compartment model in the last section of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The contact maps presented in the study represent many cells and distinct cell types. It is clear from single-cell Hi-C and multiplexed FISH experiments that chromosome conformation is highly variable even within populations of the same cell, let alone between cell types, with structures such as TADs being entirely absent at the single cell level and only appearing upon pseudobulking. It is difficult to square these observations with the models of relatively static structures depicted here. The authors should provide commentary on this point.</p></disp-quote><p><bold>(2.5)</bold> As should be evident from Author response image 1, single-cell Hi-C experiments would not provide useful information about the physical organization of individual TADs, TAD boundaries, or how individual TADs interact with their immediate neighbors. In addition, since they capture only a very small fraction of the possible contacts within and between TADs, we suspect that these single-cell studies aren’t likely to be useful for making solid conclusions about TAD neighborhoods like those shown in Author response image 1 panels A, B, C, and D, or Author response image 3. While it might be possible to discern relatively stable contacts between pairs of insulators in single cells with the right experimental protocol, the stabilities/dynamics of these interactions may be better judged by the length of time that physical interactions are seen to persist in live imaging studies such as Chen et al. (2018), Vazquez et al. (2006) and Li et al. (2011).</p><p>The <italic>in situ</italic> FISH data we’ve seen also seems problematic in that probe hybridization results in a significant de-condensation of chromatin. For two probe sets complementary to adjacent ~1.2 kb DNA sequences, the measured center-to-center distance that we’ve seen was ~110 nM. This is about 1/3 the length that is expected for a 1.2 kb naked DNA fragment, and about 1.7 times larger than that expected for a beads-on-a-string nucleosome array (~60 nM). However, chromatin is thought to be compacted into a 30 nM fiber, which is estimated to reduce the length of DNA by at least another ~6 fold. If this estimate is correct, FISH hybridization would appear to result in a ~10 fold decompaction of chromatin. A decompaction of this magnitude would necessarily be followed by a significant distortion in the actual conformation of chromatin loops.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The analysis of the Micro-C data appears to be largely qualitative. Key information about the number of reads sequenced, reaps mapped, and data quality are not presented. No quantitative framework for identifying features such as the &quot;plumes&quot; is described. The study and its findings would be strengthened by a more rigorous analysis of these rich datasets, including the use of systematic thresholds for calling patterns of organization in the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Additional information on the number of reads and data quality have been included in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Related to Point 4, the lack of quantitative details about the Micro-C data make it difficult to evaluate if the changes observed are due to biological or technical factors. It is essential that the authors provide quantitative means of controlling for factors like sampling depth, normalization, and data quality between the samples.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests that biological and/or technical differences between the four samples could account for the observed changes in the MicroC patterns for the <italic>eve</italic> TAD and its neighbors. If this were the case, then similar changes in MicroC patterns should be observed elsewhere in the genome. Since much of the genome is analyzed in these MicroC experiments, there is an abundance of internal controls for each experimental manipulation of the <italic>nhomie</italic> boundary. For two of the <italic>nhomie</italic> replacements, <italic>nhomie reverse</italic> and <italic>homie forward</italic>, the plume above the <italic>eve</italic> volcano triangle is replaced by clouds surrounding the <italic>eve</italic> volcano triangle. If these changes in the <italic>eve</italic> MicroC contact patterns are due to significant technical (or biological) factors, we should observe precisely the same sorts of changes in TADs elsewhere in the genome that are volcano triangles with plumes.</p><p>Author response image 9 shows the MicroC contact pattern for several genes in the Antennapedia complex. The <italic>deformed</italic> gene is included in a TAD which, like <italic>eve</italic>, is a volcano triangle topped by a plume. A comparison of the <italic>deformed</italic> MicroC contact patterns for <italic>nhomie forward</italic> (panel B) with the MicroC patterns for <italic>nhomie reverse</italic> (panel C) and <italic>homie forward</italic> (panel D) indicates that while there are clearly technical differences between the samples, these differences do not result in the conversion of the <italic>deformed</italic> plume into clouds as is observed for the <italic>eve</italic> TAD. The MicroC patterns elsewhere in Antennapedia complex are also very similar in all four samples. Likewise, comparisons of regions elsewhere in the fly genome indicate that the basic contact patterns are similar in all four samples. So while there are technical differences which are reflected in the relative pixel density in the TAD triangles and the LDC domains, these differences do not result in converting plumes into clouds nor do the alter the basic patterns of TAD triangles and LDC domains. As for biological differences—the embryos in each sample are at roughly the same developmental stage and were collected and processed using the same procedures. Thus, the biological factors that could reasonably be expected to impact the organization of specific TADs (e.g., cell-type specific differences) are not going to impact the patterns we see in our experiments.</p><fig id="sa3fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 9.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-94114-sa3-fig9-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The ISH effects reported are modest, especially in the case of the HCR.

We would suggest that the evidence for loop extrusion falls short of compelling (as it is based on the analysis of TAD neighborhoods, not TADs—that is forests, not trees) and, given the results reported in Goel et al. (in particular Fig. 4 and Sup. Fig. 8), is clearly suspect. This is not to mention the fact that cohesin loop extrusion can’t generate circle-loop TADs, yet circle-loops clearly exist. Likewise, as discussed in (2.4), it is not clear to us that the shared chromatin states, polymer co-segregation and co-repulsion, account for the compartmental patchwork patterns of TAD:TAD interactions. The results from the experimental manipulations in this paper and the accompanying paper, together with studies by others, e.g., Kyrchanova et al. (2008) and Mohana et al.

However, this is to be expected. As we discussed in (1.3) above, only MNase-resistant elements will generate dots in standard MicroC experiments.

In other studies, we’ve found that there are only minor differences in MicroC patterns between the blastoderm stage and stage 12-16 embryos. While these minor differences are clearly interesting, we didn’t discuss them in the text. In all of our experiments, chromosomes are likely to be paired. In NC14 embryos (the stage for visualizing <italic>eve</italic> stripes and the MicroC contact profiles in Fig. 2) replication of euchromatic sequences is thought to be quite rapid. While homolog pairing is incomplete at this stage, sister chromosomes are paired. In stage 12-16 embryos, homologs will be paired, and if the cells are arrested in G2, then sister chromosome will also be paired. So, in all of the experiments, chromosomes (sisters and/or homologs) are paired.
