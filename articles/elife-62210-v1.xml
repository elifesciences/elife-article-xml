self-renewal and differentiation is critical for a healthy blood supply; imbalances underlie hematological diseases. The importance of HSCs and their progenitors have led to their extensive characterization at genomic and transcriptomic levels. However, the proteomics of hematopoiesis remains incompletely understood. Here we report a proteomics resource from mass spectrometry of mouse young adult and old adult mouse HSCs, multipotent progenitors and oligopotent progenitors; 12 cell types in total. We validated differential protein levels, including confirmation that Dnmt3a protein levels are undetected in young adult mouse HSCs until forced into cycle. Additionally, through integrating proteomics and RNA-sequencing datasets, we identified a subset of genes with apparent post-transcriptional repression in young adult mouse HSCs. In summary, we report proteomic coverage of young and old mouse HSCs and progenitors, with broader implications for understanding mechanisms for stem cell maintenance, niche interactions and fate determination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>mass spectromtetry</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007557</institution-id><institution>California Institute of Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RT3-07683</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Irving L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006352</institution-id><institution>Virginia and D.K.

They have the ability to not only self-renew, but also differentiate into effector cells in response to physiological demands such as infection or bleeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Spangrude et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baum et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seita and Weissman, 2010</xref>). HSCs have broad-reaching therapeutic promise in regenerative medicine, immunological tolerance, genetic autoimmune diseases, hematologic malignances and inherited disorders of the blood system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Weissman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Weissman, 2005</xref>). HSCs are also the locus of disease-causative mutations in a number of relatively common blood diseases and leukemias. HSC clones sustaining several driver mutations inhibit differentiation, drive proliferation, block programmed cell death and phagocytosis, and outcompete normal HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tomasetti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Miyamoto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jamieson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rossi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busque et al., 2018</xref>). The initiating driver mutations in HSCs on their own can lead to clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which predisposes an individual to these blood diseases, as well as atherosclerosis, and affects a significant percentage of aging populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>). Understanding the transcriptomics and the proteomics of normal HSCs and each step of differentiation should reveal how these variations lead to such a wide swath of human diseases. In addition, insofar as most or all tissues and organs maintain their numbers by tissue-specific stem cells, lessons learned by examining HSCs could inform similar processes in other tissues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Workflow and validation of proteomics in various hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hierarchy of hematopoietic differentiation.

More recently, much of what is known about gene expression of HSCs and their progeny has been discovered through DNA microarray, bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing and ATAC-sequencing experiments, but few proteomic investigations on purified mouse HSCs have been conducted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Seita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galeev et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buenrostro et al., 2018</xref>). However, mRNA detection is a readout of translational potential and not protein presence, and therefore understanding the proteomic profiles of these cell types would allow for deeper insight into stem and progenitor biology. Furthermore, it has been well documented that mRNA abundance and protein abundance are not always well correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gygi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koussounadis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). mRNA translation studies in HSCs suggest multiple modes in the regulation of protein abundance, and therefore mRNA levels of genes of interest may be insufficient for determining protein levels in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>). Signer and co-workers have also recently reported increased sensitivity to protein misfolding and a restricted capacity for proteasomal turnover in the HSC compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020</xref>). These data support a hypothesis whereby mRNA translation can be the vital regulatory step in HSC fate determination, and a direct measurement of the suite of proteins within each cell type during hematopoiesis can provide further insight into biological mechanisms at play.</p><p>Several groups have previously performed mass spectrometry or mass cytometry analysis on mouse and human HSCs and progenitor cells, but these studies have been either highly-focused, conducted on mixed populations or, in the case of mass cytometry, require antibodies towards proteins of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jassinskaja et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Palii et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amon et al., 2019</xref>). Currently, there is an incomplete understanding of the proteome across the entirety of early hematopoiesis, including HSCs, MPPs (MPPa, b, and c) as well as OPPs (CMP, GMP, MEP, CLP). Closing this knowledge gap provides us with the potential to determine key players in biochemical processes critical to hematopoiesis and broadly in stem cell biology, to identify cell-specific surface proteins for improved purification and to discover therapeutic protein targets.</p><p>HSCs are very rare and often difficult to purify, presenting a formidable challenge for traditional biochemical methods of investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mayle et al., 2013</xref>). Experiments requiring large amounts of highly-pure starting material, such as cell lysate, have been technically arduous. Recently the Mann laboratory reported the use of mass spectrometry instrumentation capable of increased sensitivity and improved proteomic coverage from no more than 200 ng (~7000 cells), dramatically improving the feasibility of performing large-scale proteomics studies on low-abundant cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meier et al., 2018</xref>). With this instrumentation available, we sought to complement and elaborate upon current proteomic data with a comprehensive unbiased proteomics database characterizing the proteome throughout young adult and old adult mouse hematopoiesis. We report here the proteomes of highly-purified HSCs and their progenitors in young and old hematopoiesis as detectable with very low input and state-of-the-art, yet accessible, mass spectrometry technology. Our database has been validated through FACS and fluorescence microscopy experiments for proteins of interest. We identified a unique relationship between mRNA abundance and protein abundance exclusive to the HSC compartment. These data are organized into a resource that allows for researchers to understand how protein abundance is altered during young adult and old adult HSC differentiation. This approach can be applied beyond HSCs to other rare cell types, including many types of stem and progenitor cells, where mass spectrometry technology in tandem with RNA-sequencing has yet to be applied to highly-purified samples.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of sample preparation for low numbers of rare cells</title><p>Critical to our ability to deeply characterize the proteome throughout early mouse hematopoiesis was the development of a method by which to efficiently purify and process samples for mass spectrometry analysis from samples prepared with approximately 50,000 cells. To this end, we created a workflow whereby cells were purified by FACS using three sorting panels allowing for the isolation of 12 cells types: young adult and old adult HSC (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>-</sup>, CD150<sup>+</sup>, Flt3<sup>-</sup>), MPPa (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup>, CD150<sup>+</sup>, Flt3<sup>-</sup>), young adult and old adult MPPb (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup>, CD150<sup>-</sup>, Flt3<sup>-</sup>), young adult and old adult MPPc (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup>, CD150<sup>-</sup>, Flt3<sup>+</sup>), young adult CLP (Lin, cKit<sup>lo</sup>, Sca1<sup>lo</sup>, Flt3<sup>+</sup>, IL7Rα<sup>+</sup>), young adult CMP (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>lo/-</sup>, CD34<sup>med/hi</sup>, CD16/32<sup>-/lo</sup>), young adult MEP (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>lo/-</sup>, CD34<sup>-</sup>, CD16/32<sup>-/lo</sup>, CD150<sup>+</sup>) and young adult GMP (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>lo/-</sup>, CD34<sup>hi</sup>, CD16/32<sup>hi</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cells were purity sorted into FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum in PBS) and washed twice with PBS to remove any remaining serum prior to storage. Samples for mass spectrometry analysis were prepared with a minimum of 50,000 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since multiple sorts were required to obtain the requisite cells per biological cohort, we pooled samples and maintained equal contributions from each mouse for each cell type. We also normalized the amount of lysis buffer used with respect to cell number. A commercially-available mass spectrometry sample preparation kit was utilized to minimize sample loss and strengthen reproducibility and proved critical to our efforts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For all young and old adult mouse HSCs, at least three biological cohorts of mice were utilized for each cell type, and the sample was run in technical duplicate with 200 ng (~7000 cells) of loading material per replicate. In total, six replicates were acquired for each of the eight young adult stem and progenitor cell types and old mouse HSCs, and four replicates for each of the three old MPPs were utilized. We included both biological and technical replicates to account for limitations in detection using mass spectrometry analysis. Despite utilizing state-of-the-art equipment which significantly improves issues of resolution, sensitivity and speed, there still may be scenarios where low-abundance peptides or peptides non-amenable to ionization are not well detected. By performing multiple technical replicates on the same sample, we ensure detection of as many proteins as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Each individual replicate was processed through Byonic software as an individual dataset. After performing mass spectrometry analysis in sextuplicate, we saw diminishing returns on additional replicates in the context of new protein discovery, minimizing the likelihood that differences in proteomic diversity are artifactual or a result of differential data quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A database of proteins expressed by rare cell types</title><p>In order to generate a repository of proteins present in HSCs and their progenitors that are detectable by mass spectrometry, we divided each individual protein raw intensity value by the total intensity detected for each technical replicate and multiplied by 1 million for ease of analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 1). An average of non-zero values was taken for each gene within each cell type for global analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 2). Across all cell types we detected a total of 7917 genes encoding proteins expressed and detectable in HSCs and their progenitors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables 1 and 2). The adult HSC compartment had the least protein diversity, with 4030 proteins detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These values reflect the total number of unique proteins detectable by mass spectrometry. We observed a general trend in increased protein diversity during the differentiation process, with MPPs and OPPs expressing larger numbers of distinct proteins compared to HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This result differs from transcriptomic reports where HSCs present increased mRNA diversity in the stem cell compartment compared to their progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>). To validate the quality of our coverage across all cell types analyzed, we performed PANTHER gene list analyses for both protein class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mi et al., 2019b</xref>). The percentages of classes of proteins detected were consistent across all cell types, indicating that samples were reproducibly processed and that no large subsets of proteins, by both class and function, were noticeably absent. To validate that differential proteomic expression profiles were not predominantly due to global differences in protein detection across cell types, we analyzed the abundance of the housekeeping protein Hprt1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Protein levels were consistent across all cell types characterized. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed exquisite distribution of adult hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 3). Excitingly, each component played a distinct role in separating cell types from one another: component 1 isolates HSCs from all other cell types, whereas component 2 separates stem and multipotent progenitors from the more-committed oligopotent progenitor compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Characterization of HSC and progenitor proteomes</title><p>With our database generated, we next validated detection of known markers of stem and progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). As expected, cKit was detected across all cell types with levels high in HSCs, MPPs and lower in CLPs and GMPs. CD150/Slamf1 abundance was exclusive to HSC and MPPa compartments, an attestation to the purity of these sorted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Ly6d, a marker of early B-cell progenitors, was uniquely detected in the CLP compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghaedi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inlay et al., 2009</xref>). The cell-cycle associated protein Ki67 was lowly detected in the HSC compartment with a steady increase in abundance in the MPP compartment and highest in the OPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We exclusively detected Flt3 in MPPc and CLP, CD16/32 in GMP and (very lowly) CMP, and IL7Ra in CLP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also compared the relative median fluorescent intensities of surface markers as detected by FACS to their relative abundance by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). Similar to previous studies by Trumpp and co-workers, we were not able to detect Sca1 in any of our datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>). Levels of CD34 detected in the HSC compartment were the only surprising results in our analysis, but Trumpp and co-workers have also detected variable levels of CD34 in the HSC compartment across their replicates. However, in both datasets, coverage of the protein is extremely low, and all other quality-control parameters suggest robustness and purity of the samples. Since neither approach included isolation of proteins based off of cellular localization, the levels of CD34 detected may be attributed to intracellular CD34 or perhaps CD34 antibodies are incapable of detection of CD34 in HSCs due to differential post-translational modifications and/or structural variation resulting in differential antibody binding.</p><p>To characterize enriched pathways, we performed geneset enrichment analyses (FDR = 0.05). Proteins associated with cell cycle and DNA damage repair were significantly less abundant in HSCs compared to progenitor cells, and both processes have been shown to be dramatically reduced in the HSC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nijnik et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pietras et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rossi et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossi et al., 2007b</xref>). More specifically, it has previously been shown that quiescent HSCs accumulate DNA damage and old adult mouse HSCs have both nuclear phospho-ɣH2AX and DNA breaks by comet assay. However, bringing G0 HSCs into cell cycle in vitro leads to upregulation of many DNA repair pathways in G1 prior to entry into S phase and is sufficient to rescue most if not all HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rossi et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rübe et al., 2011</xref>). Given that approximately 80–90% of HSCs are quiescent, we anticipated lower levels of DNA repair-associated response in our dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rossi et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sudo et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tesio et al., 2015</xref>). For example, the double-strand DNA repair protein Rad51 is not detected in our HSC proteomics data but is detected in all other cell types.

The endothelial surface adhesion molecule (Esam) has previously been shown to be highly expressed by HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ishibashi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ooi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yokota et al., 2009</xref>).

This finding was further validated by microscopy where freshly-sorted HSCs or a mixed population of stem and progenitor cells (LSK: Lin<sup>-</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>) were stained with anti-Ki67 and anti-Dnmt3a. HSCs were both Ki67 negative and Dnmt3a negative compared to LSK cells that were positive for both proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Mutations in Dnmt3a expression have been implicated as disease-initiating mutations in hematologic malignancies and are among the most common mutations found in disease pathologies, including pre-AML mutations in HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yang et al., 2015</xref>) and in CHIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jaiswal et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jaiswal et al., 2014</xref>).

Self-renewal is perpetual in the absence of Dnmt3a and expression is required for differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Challen et al., 2012</xref>). DNA methylome analysis has shown that in the absence of Dnmt3a, genes promoting self-renewal are not repressed, therefore preventing differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Challen et al., 2012</xref>). We reasoned that perhaps Dnmt3a protein abundance would increase in HSCs moving out of G0 and into cell cycle. To this end, HSCs were sorted and cultured under media conditions promoting cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wilkinson et al., 2019</xref>). Fluorescence microscopy revealed that cultured HSCs have increased levels of Ki67 and Dnmt3a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Our findings support a scenario where Dnmt3a protein is not present in G0 quiescent HSCs but is accumulated as HSCs enter cell cycle in order to silence stem-associated genes and enable HSC differentiation into multipotent or oligopotent cells. Given the sensitivity of HSCs to perturbations in protein synthesis and turnover, we further hypothesize that non-cycling HSCs likely do not synthesize Dnmt3a rather than synthesize the protein only to rapidly degrade it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition to our own independent validation, we compared our findings to previous literature reports. Insulin-like growth factor one receptor (Igf1r) has been shown to be undetectable by single-cell staining in the HSC compartment compared to MPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Venkatraman et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, Igf1r is not detected in our young adult HSC mass spectrometry data but is detectable in the MPPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables 1 and 2). Lin, Goodell and co-workers have shown that the proliferation-associated protein CD81 is found on HSCs that have moved into cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lin et al., 2011</xref>).

For example, 619 proteins were absent in the HSC compartment but were found in all other cell types. In investigating uniquely-expressed proteins, particularly the 340 proteins exclusively found in the GMP compartment, we identified GMP-specific proteins including CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein ε (Cebpe), Adhesion G Protein-Coupled Receptor G3 (Adgrg3) and Membrane-spanning 4-domains, subfamily A, member 3 (Ms4a3), all of which have previously been reported to be associated with macrophage and granulocyte-specific lineage commitment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables 1-3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goardon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hsiao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ishibashi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 2006</xref>).

Discrepancies in detection for other proteins could be due to a multitude of reasons, including different experimental methods (comparative vs. shotgun, tagged vs. label-free, sorting schemes, instrumentation, data analysis and statistical methodology). With most of these data consistent across both experiments, such as HSC-enriched abundance of Igf2bp2 and Hmga2, our additional cell type coverage allows for a deeper resolution into differential and total detection levels throughout the hematopoietic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nishino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>).

Additionally, Ki67 detection was still lower in the old HSC compartment compared to that of young adult and old downstream progenitors, although more frequently detected than the young adult HSC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also detected an increase in Ki67 abundance in old MPPbs compared to young adult MPPbs.</p><p>Given the multitude of functional studies that have been conducted to identify genes implicated in HSC fate determination and stemness, we were interested to compare our findings of differentially expressed proteins during young vs. old adult hematopoiesis with previous reports. von-Willebrand Factor (vWF) is associated with myeloid and platelet biases during hematopoiesis, and we also detected increased vWF in old mouse HSCs and MPPas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pinho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013</xref>). Integrin surface proteins are critical in mediating a pro-inflammatory response that can elicit bias in HSC fate determination, and such proteins are also well documented to increase during aging in addition to inflammatory events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gekas and Graf, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Haas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pang et al., 2011</xref>). We detected Itga2b (CD41) in old mouse HSCs, which has been demonstrated to induce a myeloid bias, but, similar to Mann et. al., we did not see a significant difference between young and old adult (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Tables 1 and 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gekas and Graf, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mann et al., 2018</xref>).

Additionally, we performed gene set enrichment analysis and identified that, like young adult mouse HSCs, old mouse HSCs had lower levels of abundance of proteins associated with cell cycle and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). However, compared to young adult mouse HSCs, cell cycle and DNA damage repair-associated proteins were more enriched in the old cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>mRNA abundance comparison</title><p>Globally, mRNA expression and protein abundance are not well correlated across yeast and higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). We were interested to determine if there were changes in the relationship between mRNA and protein during hematopoiesis—both broadly across the proteome as well as for specific proteins of interest. Bulk mRNA sequencing was conducted from young adult mouse HSCs, MPPas, MPPbs and MPPcs as described previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Moraga et al., 2015</xref>). The diversity of mRNAs was similar across cell types despite much lower protein diversity in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We plotted protein intensity values against mRNA expression values (normalized protein intensity vs. mRNA transcripts per million (TPM)) and calculated Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) to determine the degree of monotonic relationship between mRNA and protein for HSCs, MPPas, MPPbs and MPPcs. The correlation was lowest in the HSC compartment (ρ = 0.300), with comparable levels between MPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, these correlation values are similar to what has been previously reported for a mixed population of human HSCs and MPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amon et al., 2019</xref>). Pearson correlation of genes that were detected as mRNA and protein in all four cell types revealed largest difference in fold changes (normalized protein intensity/mRNA TPM) when comparing HSC to MPP values, but less so between MPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). In fact, such a difference was observed on PCA of fold changes of genes with cell types as features. With the original bases of cell type features projected onto the PCA, HSC distinctly points in opposite direction along PC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). These analyses support previous reports by Signer and co-workers that mRNA translation is uniquely regulated in the HSC compartment at least in part through a mechanism other than altered gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>). Given these distinct differences observed between HSCs and MPPs, and the potential for post-transcriptional regulation of protein abundance, we searched for proteins that were uniquely low in HSCs or uniquely not present in HSCs, but highly detected or present as mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). To detect uniquely low proteins in HSCs, we plotted normalized protein intensity/mRNA TPM fold changes of HSCs against every MPP for all genes and selected the top 2.5% of genes with differentially higher fold changes in MPPs compared to HSCs (i.e. more protein detected per mRNA in MPPs compared to HSCs). To identify uniquely undetected proteins, we further segmented all genes in the transcriptome for each cell type by genes that were detected by RNA-seq only (mRNA Only, green bars), RNA-seq only unique to a cell type (Unique mRNA Only (U), yellow bars), and detected by both RNA-seq and MS analysis (Both, orange bars) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In order to be considered a uniquely undetected protein for a cell type, the protein was required to be detected by MS in at least 3 replicates of another cell type to ensure that these proteins are readily detectable by MS analysis and therefore confidently absent in the cell type of interest. We observed that of the proteins that were not detected in HSCs despite the presence of mRNA, a large number of them were unique to HSCs—more so than by random chance compared to MPPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that the lower diversity of proteins in HSCs is likely attributed to biological, rather than technical, reasons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison between the proteome and transcriptome of HSCs and MPPs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

Comparable to previous reports, we determined total RNA content in HSCs to be approximately 1 pg/cell and a significant increase in total RNA content in all progenitor populations in comparison after normalization with respect to cell size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jarzebowski et al., 2018</xref>).

Given the significant reduction in protein diversity in HSCs despite a similar number of genes detected at the transcript level, we wondered if miRNAs were contributing to this reduction in protein abundance. Across the transcriptome of HSCs and MPPs ~ 86% of genes are potential targets of miRNAs for all cell types according to the miRDB database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Within the list of genes that are putative targets of miRNA, genes that are uniquely detected at the mRNA level but absent at the protein level are more enriched in the HSC dataset than by random chance (881 in total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). The mRNA expression values of these unique genes in the HSC compartment do not deviate strongly compared to mRNA expression values in MPPs, and therefore transcriptional regulation cannot sufficiently explain the absence of their low detection by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). To consider which miRNAs may be most responsible for the lower proteome diversity in young adult mouse HSCs, we counted the number of genes uniquely undetected in the proteome of HSCs that overlapped with the putative target list for each miRNA. Within the fourth quartile of miRNAs with the highest overlaps, we saw known miRNAs implicated in mouse HSC and early hematopoiesis biology, such as <italic>Mir29a</italic>, <italic>Mir25a</italic>, <italic>Mir125b</italic> and <italic>Mir130a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 10; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bissels et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo and Scadden, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">O'Connell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, we have previously shown <italic>Mir29a</italic> to be highly expressed in HSCs compared to progenitor cells, and it has been implicated in negatively regulating Dnmt3a levels, in turn, promoting self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2015</xref>).

Of the 881 uniquely undetected young adult HSC proteins that are putative targets of miRNAs, 776 (88%) are detected in old mouse HSCs, with 105 still undetected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). With this increase in protein diversity, many putative miRNA target genes uniquely undetected at the protein level in young adult mouse HSCs are detected in old mouse HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>). This rescue of protein diversity in old mouse HSCs may be attributed to alternative regulatory mechanisms in protein abundance between young and old adult mouse HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Notably, ribosomal proteins were more readily detected in the old HSC compartment compared to the young adult compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology genesets reveals the lowest enrichment of proteins associated with epigenetic regulation of gene expression and ribosome biogenesis in young adult mouse HSCs, with levels in old mouse HSCs comparable to those of progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). This suggests a model in which the regulatory mechanism of old mouse HSCs for protein abundance is more similar to MPPs, with increased reliance on epigenetic regulation of transcription and perhaps increased translational capacity, although this has not yet been well studied. In addition to revealing the potential implications of known miRNAs on protein levels, our analysis lays the foundation for the potential discovery of novel miRNAs that play a role in HSC biology, such as <italic>Mir551</italic>. It also suggests potential differences in post-transcriptional regulation of the stem cell compartment in the aging process, highlighting the importance of coupling transcriptomic studies with proteomic studies to fully understand the biology of rare cell types in any system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This manuscript provides deep proteomic coverage of mouse young and old adult HSCs and their progenitors and complements currently available mass spectrometry datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cabezas-Wallscheid et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jassinskaja et al., 2017</xref>). We utilized shotgun mass spectrometry to allow for an unbiased, exhaustive characterization of the early young and old adult hematopoietic proteome to levels not yet studied, 12 cell types in all. We validated the quality of our data via multiple methods. These data are consistent with the detection of established surface markers that functionally separate HSCs and progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). PCA visualizes the clustering of cell types with biological consistency across each principal component. We also validate our intensity readouts via FACS analysis and microscopy of select genes, including Esam, Pfkl, and Dnmt3a. Many of the proteomic profiles identified validate functional and qualitative studies reported by other groups, such as DNA damage pathways, and abundance of Ki67, Igf2bp2, and Hmga2. The increased detection of CD150/Slamf1 and vWF in the old HSC and MPPa compartment is consistent with previous observations of increased myeloid bias in old mouse HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beerman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sanjuan-Pla et al., 2013</xref>). Curiously in the old HSC compartment, we see an increase in protein diversity compared to young adult mouse HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Additional studies are underway in our laboratory in order to understand the mechanism by which this occurs and the biochemical consequences of increased protein diversity in the stem cell compartment.</p><p>The lower proteomic diversity in HSCs compared to progenitors corroborates decreased rates of protein synthesis in the HSC compartment and stands in contrast to equally-diverse transcriptomes for HSCs and MPPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramos et al., 2006</xref>). To this effect, some RNAs may not be translated, and their presence could reflect the opening of their chromatin rather than the need for these proteins to be translated within the HSC compartment. Correlation studies and PCA of genes suggest differential regulation between mRNA and protein levels when comparing HSCs to their progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). PCA of the cell types also supports the hypothesis that HSCs exhibit more regulation following gene transcription than previously appreciated, as the top 250 proteins most antagonistic to component 1 enriched for proteins involved in ‘chromatin silencing’, ‘histone modification’, and ‘mRNA processing’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 3). Additionally, HSCs have very low levels of proteins associated with Epigenetic Gene Expression as determined with enrichment analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Total RNA levels are also reduced in HSCs compared to progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), and we report a lower level of proteins associated with ribosome biogenesis in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Previous single-cell mRNA quantification studies in E-SLAM HSCs (EPCR<sup>+</sup>, CD48<sup>-</sup>, CD150<sup>+</sup>), LMPP (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, Flk2<sup>+</sup>, CD34+<sup>+</sup>), GMP (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, Flk2<sup>+</sup>, CD16/32<sup>+</sup>, CD34<sup>+</sup>) and MEPs (Lin<sup>-</sup>, cKit<sup>+</sup>, Sca1<sup>+</sup>, CD16/32<sup>-</sup>, CD34<sup>-</sup>) revealed a steady increase in total mRNA during differentiation, with E-SLAM HSCs having the lowest levels of total mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nestorowa et al., 2016</xref>). While these experiments were performed on cells sorted using very different gating strategies compared to our own, our reports do not stand in contrast these findings. It is possible that HSCs, while having less mRNA content and reduced transcription, still maintain higher diversity in message transcribed. Taken together with previous literature reports on translation and chromatin structure in the HSC compartment, these data suggest a new hypothesis in the regulation of stem maintenance and HSC homeostasis, wherein HSCs undergo a loss of diversity from gene accessibility to protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Loss of diversity hypothesis.</title><p>In our model, young adult mouse HSCs have more open chromatin than progenitor cells; however, lower rates of transcription result in comparable levels of message diversity at the mRNA level. Decreased rates of translation due to fewer ribosomes and reduced ribosomal activity, miRNA interference and sensitivity towards the unfolded protein response result in less protein diversity as detected by mass spectrometry. Prog = Progenitor.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62210-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>It has been reported that HSCs have more open chromatin than MPPs, suggesting an increased plasticity in gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buenrostro et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, mRNA translation is markedly reduced and highly sensitive to perturbations in the HSC compartment, and we now report a lower correlation between mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore propose that perhaps primary regulatory mechanisms of stemness shift downstream of gene transcription towards translation specifically in the young adult HSC compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These results are further supported by previous studies in a mixed population of human HSCs and MPPs where the correlation between mRNA and protein, particularly for genes critical for stem-cell maintenance, such as quiescence and telomere maintenance, was markedly reduced compared to more- committed progenitor populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amon et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There are two possible contributing factors to reduced protein abundance in the HSC compartment: Rates of translation and/or rates of degradation. Our data and others suggest that rates of translation are extraordinarily critical for stem cell proteostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>). However, this does not rule out a more robust presence of protein turnover machinery mediated through proteasomal or lysosomal degradation in HSCs. Signer and co-workers recently reported the reduction of ubiquitylated proteins and misfolded proteins in HSCs and that these levels are sensitive to increased rates of translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hidalgo San Jose et al., 2020</xref>). They also demonstrate that increasing levels of misfolded proteins can result in proteasomal stress and elicit the unfolded protein response. Our dataset reveals that proteins associated with the monoubiquitination are less abundant in HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>). While these data indicate that proteasomal degradation is not a major contributing factor to reduced protein levels, at least in young adult mouse HSCs, they do not take into account the possibility of lysosomal degradation, which has previously been demonstrated to be important in neural stem cell maintenance and quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leeman et al., 2018</xref>). While we report here the findings of our mass spectrometry characterization of early hematopoiesis, including this unique discordance between mRNA and protein in the young adult HSC compartment, there is still much to uncover from a mechanistic perspective. Future studies in our lab are underway to identify the mechanisms which result in decreased proteome diversity in young adult HSC and whether such a phenomenon persists during aging and in development.</p><p>These data provide a deeper understanding of proteins expressed during young and old adult hematopoiesis that are currently detectable by mass spectrometry. However, we caution that this resource is by no means a complete list of proteins expressed by every cell in early hematopoiesis. As mass spectrometry methods continue to allow for improved data coverage with low amounts of protein and characterization of hematopoietic cells becomes more nuanced, deeper proteomic characterizations of hematopoiesis will become possible. It also will open up the opportunity to further segment stem and progenitor cell fractions, such as the fractionation of the HSC compartment based on the different stages of cell cycle. This can be important for our analysis of protein changes throughout early hematopoiesis, as HSCs are more quiescent than downstream progenitors, which can contribute to differential abundance of proteins as a consequence of cell cycle. This is highlighted by our analysis of Dnmt3a, which is not expressed until quiescent stem cells enter cycle, wherein the daughter cells could include MPP or OPP, necessitating closing expression of some genes operative in stem cells but not MPP. In addition, Signer, Morrison and co-workers have reported that differences in the rates of translation between HSCs and MPPs cannot be entirely explained by cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Signer et al., 2014</xref>). Our data reveal global differential regulation in protein abundance, some of which will be cell cycle-dependent as well as cycle-independent. Given the dearth of proteomic information currently available for early hematopoietic cells in young and old adult mice, these data reveal previously-uncharacterized suites of proteins detectable in young and old HSCs and progenitors. The nature of these expansive data allows not only for the identification of novel surface markers of each cell type but also a deeper understanding of intracellular regulatory proteins of transcription and translation that contribute to stem- and progenitor-cell quiescence survival, fate commitment and function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

For old adult mouse studies, C57BL/6 mice (24–27 months) were a gift from Charles Chan. An equal number of male and female mice were used across all experiments. For young adult studies, 50 mice were used for each biological cohort. For old adult studies, two mice were used for each biological cohort. Cells were pooled for each cohort across multiple sorts with sort numbers documented for mass spectrometry sample preparation. Care was taken to ensure that each cell type from a biological cohort within a processed group of cells (HSCs and MPPs together; CMPs, GMPs, MEPs together; CLPs together), had equal contribution from each sort within the cohort. For example, given the rarity of HSCs, every HSC that could be purified during each sort was sorted, but for the more abundant MPPcs, 100,000 cell aliquots were sorted and lysis scaled accordingly. Mice for all experiments were immunocompetent and group housed in an AAALAC certified barrier facility. The light cycle in the facility is 12 hr on/12 hr off. All experiments were performed according to guidelines established by the Stanford University Administrative Panel on Laboratory Animal Care under protocol #10266.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Method details</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Data collection and processing</title><p>In all downstream cell processing, FACS buffer (2% fetal bovine serum (FBS, US Origin, HyClone, Cytiva, Marlborough, Massachusetts) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, calcium and magnesium free, Gibco, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts)) was used at ice-cold temperature unless otherwise stated.

Upon completion, slides were washed with PBS for 5 min, three times, and appropriate secondary added (Donkey anti-mouse IgG Highly Cross-Absorbed Secondary A647, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts or Cy3 Affinipure F(ab’)2 Fragment Donkey Anti-Rabbit IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvaniaa; 1:500 in blocking buffer). Cells were allowed to incubate with secondary for 1 hr prior to washing with PBS for 5 min, three times. DAPI (1:100, final concentration 200 ng/mL in PBS) was added to the slides and allowed to incubate for 10 min prior to mounting.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-10"><title>Fluorescence image quantification</title><p>All quantification was done using ImageJ. Individual cells were manually outlined on the DAPI channel. Using the outline, integrated density and area was measured for all cells across all channels. For every channel for every cell type, mean fluorescence of the background was measured at locations with no cells. Corrected Total Cell Fluorescence (CTCF) was calculated as the following: CTCF = Integrated Density – (Area * Background Mean Fluorescence). To compare between cells, CTCF value of a protein for each cell was normalized with the CTCF value of DAPI for each cell. Significance was determined using unpaired t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-11"><title>Processing of purified cell types for mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>Sorted cells were pelleted and washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove any remaining FBS (1,300 rpm x 5 min, 4°C). PBS was aspirated away, and the pellets were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen prior to storage at −80°C. Prior to lysis, cells were thawed on ice and subjected to sample preparation with the PreOmics iST NHS kit (PreOmics, Planegg, Germany) according to literature protocol. (To normalize lysis across cell number, 10 μL of lysis buffer was added for every 100,000 cells). The only additional modification made to the protocol was scaling down in volume of digest buffer to align with amount of lysis buffer (for example, 20 μL digest buffer for 20 μL lysis buffer). Samples were resuspended in 12 μL of LC-Load Buffer from the iST NHS kit and peptide concentration determined (Pierce Quantitative Colorimetric or Fluorescent Peptide Assay, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Sample concentration was normalized to 100 ng/μL and 2 μL was loaded onto the instrument.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-12"><title>Mass spectrometry analysis – liquid chromatography and timsTOF Pro</title><p>A nanoElute was attached in line to a timsTOF Pro equipped with a CaptiveSpray Source (Bruker, Hamburg, Germany). Chromatography was conducted at 40°C through a 25 cm reversed-phase Aurora Series C18 column (IonOpticks, Middle Camberwell, Australia) at a constant flow-rate of 0.4 μL/min. Mobile phase A was 98/2/0.1% Water/MeCN/Formic Acid (v/v/v) and phase B was MeCN with 0.1% Formic Acid (v/v). During a 120 min method, peptides were separated by a 4-step linear gradient (0% to 15% B over 60 min, 15% to 23% B over 30 min, 23% to 35% B over 10 min, 35% to 80% over 10 min) followed by a 10 min isocratic flush at 80% for 10 min before washing and a return to low organic conditions. Experiments were run as data-dependent acquisitions with ion mobility activated in PASEF mode. MS and MS/MS spectra were collected with <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> X00 to 1500 and ions with <italic>z</italic> = +one were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-13"><title>Mass spectrometry data analysis</title><p>Raw data files were processed with Byonic software (Protein Metrics, Cupertino, California). Fixed modifications included +113.084 C. Variable modifications included Acetyl +42.010565 N-term, pyro-Glu −17.026549 N-term Q, pyro-Glu −18.010565 N-term E. Precursor tolerance 30.0 ppm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-14"><title>Data compilation</title><p>Raw files were read for UniProtIDs, gene names and their respective mappings. ‘nan’, ‘’ (empty strings), and ‘2 SV’ were ignored. Mappings between gene names and UniProtIDs were not one-to-one. Some genes and UniProtIDs were unmapped. Therefore, before compiling the raw data, a comprehensive, one-to-one mapping was first made. Using the Retrieve/ID mapping program at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.uniprot.org">www.uniprot.org</ext-link> (release 2019–11), all gene names were mapped to all possible UniProtIDs, and UniprotIDs were mapped to all possible gene names. The mappings from raw files and UniProt were combined to group equivalent gene names and UniProtIDs (usually with isoforms) together. From each group, one gene name and one UniProtID were selected for downstream data compilation. Any UniProtID or gene name that was not mapped was either given a protein ID (UNM #) or a gene name (Unm #). 38 gene names had no UniProtIDs and 8 UniprotIDs had no gene names. All raw files were compiled into a single data table with the selected UniProtIDs and gene names (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-15"><title>RNA isolation and library preparation</title><p>RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen, ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts) as per the manufacturer’s recommendations and was further facilitated by using linear polyacrylamide as a carrier during the procedure. We treated the total RNA samples with RQ1 RNase free DNase (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) to remove minute quantities of genomic DNA if present. DNase treated samples were cleaned using RNAeasy minelute columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1–10 ng of total RNA was used as input for cDNA preparation and amplification using Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 (NuGEN Technologies, Redwood City, California). Amplified cDNA was sheared using Covaris S2 using the following settings: duty cycle 10%, intensity 5, cycle/burst 100, total time 5 min (Covaris, Woburn, Massachusetts). The sheared cDNA was cleaned up using Agencourt Ampure XP (Beckman Coulter Life Sciences, San Jose, California). 500 ng of sheared cDNA were used as input for library preparation using NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina as per manufacturer’s recommendations (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-16"><title>RNA-seq and data analysis</title><p>Libraries were sequenced using NextSeq 500 (Illumina, San Diego, California) to obtain 2 × 150 base pair paired-end reads and HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, California) to get 2 × 100 base pair paired-end reads.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-17"><title>Data normalization</title><p>For quantitative comparisons, all individual replicates in both proteomics and transcriptomics were normalized to sum to 1,000,000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 1 for proteome, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 8 for transcriptome). When calculating log<sub>2</sub> fold changes of subsets of data including zeros, 0.0001 was first added to clearly separate out non-detected values from lowly-detected values. Attention was paid to ensure that this smoothing did not significantly affect non-zero values. For comparisons between cell types or between protein and mRNA, proteomic replicates within a cell type were combined by taking the average of non-zero values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, Table 2). Transcriptomic replicates within a cell type were combined by taking the average of all values. For analyses requiring protein to mRNA comparisons, we wanted to ensure no overlaps between proteomics and transcriptomics was missed due to gene name differences. All gene names were converted to EntrezID using the following process. Gene names were mapped to all possible EntrezID using MGI Batch Query available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.informatics.jax.org/batch">www.informatics.jax.org/batch</ext-link> (retrieved Jan 8) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mouse Genome Database Group et al., 2019</xref>). A gene name could map to multiple EntrezIDs. Among such gene names, EntrezIDs that were of other species and those that did not belong to ‘old symbol’, ‘related synonym’, ‘current symbol’, ‘Homologene’, ‘synonym’ and ‘Genbank’ were removed. Among this list, filtering for those belonging to ‘current symbol’ recovered most mappings. Of those that were not recovered, all that belonged to ‘old symbol’ were removed. 87 gene names did not map to any EntrezID. When graphing proteomic and transcriptomic data of one specific gene side-by-side for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, all intensity values or TPM values across all cell types were averaged to generate an average value for MS or RNA-seq data, respectively. We then divided each replicate value by the average value and multiplied by 100 to obtain the relative % abundance. When graphing mass spectrometry and FACS data side-by-side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, average MFI and average intensity were calculated across all experimental replicates for the earliest known positive cell type, for FACS and MS, respectively. Positive cell types were HSC for cKit and CD150, MPPa for CD34, MPPc for Flt3 and GMP for CD16/32. The percentage with respect to the average was calculated and graphed for each replicate. For MS replicates, t-tests were not conducted given variability in detection frequency across replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-18"><title>Total RNA content analysis</title><p>Four independent replicates were sorted, isolated, and quantified for analysis. Cells were purified as described above and 1000 cells of each cell type were sorted from four mice (two males, two females) into TRIzol. Cells lysed in TRIzol were heated to 37℃ for 5 min to ensure complete homogenization. Phase separation was achieved by adding chloroform (100 µL), vortexing for 5 s, and then centrifugation at 12,000 g for 15 min at 4℃. Aqueous phases from each sample were carefully removed without disturbing the interphase. Three volumes of 100% ethanol were added to each aqueous phase to precipitate the RNA and vortexed for 5 s to mix. Precipitated RNA samples were added to Zymo-5 clean and concentrator columns and RNA was cleaned up as per the manufactures recommended protocol (Zymo Research, Tustin, California). RNA was finally eluted twice in 20 µL (final 40 µL) and quantification performed using a NanoDrop (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts). Total RNA content was normalized with respect to relative cell size as determined by FSC-A analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Analyses with proteome only</title><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>PANTHER 15.0 gene list analysis</title><p>Gene names of proteins detected by mass spectrometry for each cell type in at least one replicate were uploaded to the PANTHER gene list analysis website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pantherdb.org/">http://www.pantherdb.org/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mi et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mi et al., 2019b</xref>).

For each gene set, log<sub>2</sub> normalized data of individual replicates including young and old adult data were run through single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) available in R through the Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hänzelmann et al., 2013</xref>). The enrichment scores were analyzed via Kruskal-Wallis test to determine if any differences existed between cell types for all gene sets. Significance was determined using Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with FDR = 0.05. The stringency was further increased by only considering gene sets with at least 30 genes and at least half of the genes detected within the proteomic data. Of the 7526 gene sets available, 1108 gene sets were significant while meeting our criteria. All gene sets presented as bar graphs in the manuscript were within the 1108 gene sets. Bar graphs were plotted by finding the average enrichment score across replicates for each cell type, and ranked according to the average enrichment scores. In bar graphs without old adult cell types, enrichment analyses were still carried out including the old adult data. No additional pair-wise tests were done as we were ultimately interested in global differences and rankings between cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Unique minimum/zero values for ribosomal proteins</title><p>In subset of genes starting with ‘Rpl’ (Ribosomal protein large) or ‘Rps’ (Ribosomal protein small), the cell with the lowest intensity value or uniquely zero value was determined (genes with multiple zeros was classified as ‘other’).

Within the mRNA only category, if a gene was uniquely detected as mRNA only in one particular cell type and detected as protein in at least three replicates in other cell types, the gene was considered a uniquely untranslated gene (‘unique mRNA only’). Because such unique mRNA genes were so high in HSCs, we considered if there was enrichment beyond a stochastic distribution. To that end, we established a null distribution. For each cell type independently, all genes were randomly assigned the category of ‘mRNA only’ or ‘both’ with proportions equal to the distribution in the actual cell type. For each cell type, the number of unique mRNA only genes was determined as determined based on the random assignment using the same method described above. This was repeated 1000 times, and the 95% confidence interval for what the expected number of unique mRNA genes would be for each cell type was determined. The actual unique mRNA gene count was above the confidence interval for HSCs and below for MPPs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Correlating proteomics to transcriptomics within cell type</title><p>To consider the degree of monotonic relationship between mRNA and protein, Spearman correlation was evaluated between proteomics and transcriptomics for each cell type using the cor.test function available in base R package.

Within this subset, Pearson correlation was calculated between permutations of cell types using the Pearson function available in base R package. The Pearson correlation values of fold changes between cell types were plotted on a heat map. To find the genes that were most differentially translated in all cell types compared to HSCs (specifically, highly translated in MPPs, lowly translated in HSCs), we compared the protein/mRNA fold-change values of HSC against each MPP for all genes detected by both cell types as mRNA and protein. For each MPP, the top 2.5% genes less translated in HSCs were determined. The intersection of such top 2.5% genes for comparisons to all MPPs was found.

This paper elegantly utilized state-of-the-art mass spectrometry and successfully scaled down the technique to obtain good quality proteomic data from small numbers of young and old adult mouse hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. This paper provides a great resource to the field with broader implications for understanding mechanisms for stem cell maintenance, niche interactions, and fate determination.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Proteomic analysis of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors reveals post transcriptional regulation in stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Sean J Morrison (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors performed proteomic profilings of mouse adult and aged HSCs, multipotent progenitors and oligopotent progenitors using mass spectrometry. The adult HSC compartment had decreased protein diversity compared to other compartments. Validation of differentially translated proteins revealed that Dnmt3a protein levels are undetected in adult HSCs, although its mRNA is expressed at levels comparable to those in MPPs. In addition, they identified a subset of genes with apparent post-transcriptional repression in adult HSCs, which included many miRNA target genes including Dnmt3a.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors showed that many putative miRNA target genes uniquely undetected at the protein level in adult HSCs are detected in aged HSCs (Figure 5—figure supplement 4). Are these alterations with aging associated with the reductions in miRNA expression?</p><p>2) The authors show in Figure 1C the number of proteins detected in each cell type (protein diversity). The authors should clarify the fraction of these proteins that overlapped between the different cell populations to highlight commonly expressed proteins and those that are more restricted in their expression.</p><p>3) In Figure 3A the authors report the total numbers of proteins identified in young and old HSCs. The authors should provide the identities of the proteins that were most differentially abundant between old and young HSCs. This would increase the impact of the manuscript given that this comparison is the most novel part of the paper.</p><p>4) Please remove speculative aspects of glycolysis and glutathione/ROS etc until a functional basis has been established (see #2 below in the section on expected future work).</p><p>5) The manuscript is well written in general with clear data presentation. However, many comparisons in mass spec data are without clear statistics (for example, Figure 2B, D, Figure 3C). I understand that zero-value data were not presented, possibly due to detection limit. But some statistics with the whole dataset will provide needed robustness to the conclusion.</p><p>6) In Figure 4C, the authors found poor correlation between protein and mRNA expression in HSCs and MPPs. Although the correlation was the lowest in HSCs, it was considerably low in MPPs as well (Spearman correlation 0.3 vs. ~0.4). Is it technical limitation of detecting proteins that result in the low correlations across all cell types?</p><p>7) The quality and size of the Figure 2E can be better. It is hard to see the expression.</p><p>Revisions expected in follow-up work:</p><p>1) The authors proposed the implication of miR29a in the compromised translation of Dnmt3a in HSCs. Is miR29a specifically expressed in HSCs? Please check its expression in HSCs, MPPs, and LPPs by RT-qPCR. Also, please show the protein levels of other target genes of miR29a in HSCs.</p><p>2) The discussion of glycolysis and glutathione metabolic processes in the Results comes across as being a little superficial. Although many claims have been made related to glycolysis in HSCs the reality is that nobody has done the isotope tracing in vivo that would be required to test these claims. Glycolytic flux cannot be predicted based on protein or RNA expression levels. Moreover, whether HSCs are highly glycolytic or not, it's not clear what implications this would have for ROS levels or glutathione homeostasis. Most importantly, the authors do not state what direction &quot;glutathione metabolic process&quot; proteins are changing in between HSCs and other cell types, which proteins are changing, or whether they are changing in the same direction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62210.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>1) The authors showed that many putative miRNA target genes uniquely undetected at the protein level in adult HSCs are detected in aged HSCs (Figure 5—figure supplement 4).

To explore this possibility, we summarized the list of putative miRNA targets not detected in adult HSCs but detected in aged HSCs in Figure 5E where a large number of undetected proteins are now detected. While reduction in miRNA expression certainly can be one mechanism for the increased proteomic diversity in aged HSCs, there are also many other possibilities that may contribute to our observation. As of now, we would prefer not to speculate too much more without additional experiments, which are beyond the scope of our current manuscript. However, these are certainly experiments of interest to us and would serve as appropriate updates to our manuscript post-publication as per <italic>eLife</italic> policies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show in Figure 1C the number of proteins detected in each cell type (protein diversity). The authors should clarify the fraction of these proteins that overlapped between the different cell populations to highlight commonly expressed proteins and those that are more restricted in their expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that this data was not made obvious to the reviewers. Figure 2F includes the data of interest – 3130 proteins were detected across all cell types analyzed, and 619 proteins were uniquely absent in the HSC compartment. The number of proteins unique to each cell type are also included (ex. 340 proteins in GMPs). We have included additional discussion of this figure for added clarification, though we feel that it is currently located in the appropriate spot in the manuscript after validation of the quality of the dataset under the subheading “Characterization of proteins uniquely absent/detected by cell type(s)”. The manuscript now reads: <italic>“</italic>Over 40% of proteins were detected across all cell types, 3130 proteins in total (Figure 2F). […] For example, 619 proteins were absent in the HSC compartment but were found in all other cell types.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3A the authors report the total numbers of proteins identified in young and old HSCs.

After filtering for proteins that were detected in at least three replicates in old HSCs, we generated a list of proteins (now Table 7, with Tables 7, 8, 9 shifted to 8, 9, 10 respectively) that were either 1) not detected in adult HSCs but detected in old HSCs or 2) in the top 2.5% of old/young intensity foldchange values. The table is now referenced in the section titled “Characterization of Old Adult HSC and MPP proteomes” with the methods used to identify the proteins included in the “Analyses with Proteome Only” section in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Please remove speculative aspects of glycolysis and glutathione/ROS etc until a functional basis has been established (see #2 below in the section on expected future work).</p></disp-quote><p>Since these data were shown as a validation of the mass spectrometry data rather than a key finding for the manuscript, we have chosen to remove a significant portion of the text related to glycolysis and GO enrichment analysis of glutathione metabolic process. Validation studies for Esam and Pfkl are now consolidated to a single paragraph. We hope this addresses the reviewers’ concerns related to glycolysis and glutathione metabolic process discussions and improves the focus of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The manuscript is well written in general with clear data presentation. However, many comparisons in mass spec data are without clear statistics (for example, Figure 2B, D, Figure 3C). I understand that zero-value data were not presented, possibly due to detection limit. But some statistics with the whole dataset will provide needed robustness to the conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ request for statistics. Excluding statistics was a conscious decision we made while writing our manuscript for reasons we hope to explain here. We would first like to note that each individual mass spectrometry sample (MS) was analyzed and subjected to a false discovery rate cutoff of 1% in addition to the search parameters and statistics outlined in our deposited MS data. Therefore, each replicate already represents a statistically-significant readout. When visualizing the data and comparing between samples, we chose not to include statistics in part due to complications introduced by 0 intensity values. 0s introduce a significant amount of variability to a cell type’s protein detection profile. For example, a protein detected 4 times over 6 replicates with an intensity value of 100 could be undetected twice. Should that protein be assigned a value of 100 or 66.7? A parametric test assumes that a dataset of interest follows the distribution model posited by the statistical test (ex. t-distribution for t-test), but this assumption is challenged by the presence of 0s. On the other hand, a non-parametric test loses information on the quantitative nature of our dataset while treating all zeros equally (not all zero values may be equal especially between cell types and even from protein-to-protein depending on intensity of the protein when detected). We chose not to perform statistical tests after removing 0-values as that can also skew interpretation from protein to protein and cell type to cell type since the number of 0s can vary especially when a protein is lowly detectable. Given the challenges introduced by accounting for or omitting 0-values, we opted to present the data while keeping in mind the purpose of our manuscript – a tool for initial discovery followed up with orthogonal methods of validation such as FACS and microscopy. The best demonstration of such use is given by our example of Dnmt3a in our manuscript which we provide statistics for in our orthogonal validation. Additionally, we consulted several biostatisticians and have been advised that there is not a widely-accepted statistical method that can be applied across multiple, low-input proteomic datasets such as our entire dataset. The technical and experimental validation required to develop and apply a novel statistical model for our data is beyond the scope of this manuscript. We hope the reviewer will be understanding of this limitation. There are methods that we could use to provide some an error bar or a p-value, but we feel that they would detract from the presentation of our data as a platform for discovery. However, if the Editors and reviewer feel that the addition of a specific statistical analyses beyond what is already performed for each replicate is absolutely required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, we are willing to reconsider.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 4C, the authors found poor correlation between protein and mRNA expression in HSCs and MPPs. Although the correlation was the lowest in HSCs, it was considerably low in MPPs as well (Spearman correlation 0.3 vs. ~0.4). Is it technical limitation of detecting proteins that result in the low correlations across all cell types?</p></disp-quote><p>The correlations were calculated based on genes that were expressed as both mRNA and protein for each cell type, so the proteins that were not detected did not contribute to the correlation values. Nonetheless, the poor correlation between mRNA and protein in yeast and mammalian cells is well-documented in literature, so we are not surprised or concerned by our analysis (Gygi et al., 1999; Koussounadis et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2016). These references are included in the original manuscript. Additionally, Amon et al., 2019, which reports MS analysis of human HSCs and MPPs as a mixed population also observes a reduced correlation between mRNA and protein in the HSC/MPP compartment (R<sup>2</sup>=0.32) compared to committed progenitor populations MEP and GMP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.50 and 0.41, respectively). Our correlation between mRNA and protein in the HSC compartment is found to be 0.300, which is consistent with this finding. However, we are also careful in the text to emphasize that our protein datasets represent what is currently detectable by mass spectrometry analysis, and it is possible that additional proteins are present that cannot be detected due to extremely low abundance, although they will not significantly alter the correlation between mRNA and protein as we currently present in our manuscript. The text now reads:</p><p><italic>&quot;The correlation was lowest in the HSC compartment (ρ = 0.300), with comparable levels between MPPs (Figure 4B, C and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Importantly, these correlation values are similar to what has been previously reported for a mixed population of human HSCs and MPPs (Amon et al., 2019).&quot;</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The quality and size of the Figure 2E can be better.

Also, please show the protein levels of other target genes of miR29a in HSCs.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not explicitly stating this in the manuscript and for not including the appropriate citation. We and others have previously reported that miR-29a is more highly expressed in HSCs compared to progenitor cells. The text now reads: “Notably, miR-29a has been shown the be highly expressed in HSCs compared to progenitor cells and has been implicated in negatively regulating Dnmt3a levels, in turn, promoting self-renewal (Han et al., 2010, Hu et al., 2015).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
