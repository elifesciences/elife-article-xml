targeting mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in cancer. However, notwithstanding the targeting of mutant dehydrogenases, nearly all hopeful ‘mito-therapeutics’ cannot discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous OXPHOS and thus suffer from a limited therapeutic index. Using acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a model, herein, we leveraged an in-house diagnostic biochemical workflow to identify ‘actionable’ bioenergetic vulnerabilities intrinsic to cancerous mitochondria. Consistent with prior reports, AML growth and proliferation was associated with a hyper-metabolic phenotype which included increases in basal and maximal respiration. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell, clonally expanding hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts, as well as chemoresistant AML were all consistently hallmarked by intrinsic OXPHOS limitations. Remarkably, by performing experiments across a physiological span of ATP free energy, we provide direct evidence that leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume ATP. Relevant to AML biology, acute restoration of oxidative ATP synthesis proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, suggesting that active OXPHOS repression supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML. Together, these findings argue against ATP being the primary output of leukemic mitochondria and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS may represent an untapped therapeutic avenue for combatting hematological malignancy and chemoresistance.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cancer bioenergetics</kwd><kwd>OXPHOS</kwd><kwd>acute myeloid leukemia</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial proteomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000182</institution-id><institution>U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-19-1-0213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fisher-Wellman</surname><given-names>Kelsey H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P01 CA171983</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cabot</surname><given-names>Myles C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Across a physiological span of ATP-free energy, leukemic mitochondria primarily consume, rather than produce, ATP.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In comparison to normal hematopoietic cells, various human leukemias present with increases in mitochondrial mass and higher basal respiration rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goto et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sriskanthadevan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suganuma et al., 2010</xref>), the latter of which appears to sensitize them to global disruptions in mitochondrial flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuntz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lagadinou et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mirali et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Skrtić et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiang et al., 2015</xref>). Although these studies have ignited interest in mitochondrial-targeted chemotherapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guièze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panina et al., 2020</xref>), experimental rationale for targeting OXPHOS in leukemia is largely based on the assumption that heightened respiration is representative of the cancerous mitochondrial network’s attempt to accommodate an increased ATP demand (i.e. increased ‘OXPHOS reliance’). However, identical increases in mitochondrial respiration can derive from any number of physiological stimuli, ranging from increased demand for ATP resynthesis to decreased OXPHOS efficiency. Distinguishing between these potential outcomes is critical, as such insight likely demarcates targeted drug efficacy from undesirable systemic toxicity. For example, it is currently unclear how targeting increased ‘OXPHOS reliance’ in leukemia can specifically disrupt leukemic oxidative metabolism without impacting OXPHOS in other highly metabolic organs (e.g. brain, heart, muscle).</p><p>Given the ubiquitous necessity of OXPHOS for healthy cellular metabolism, a major barrier to mitochondrial-targeted drugs in leukemia relates to the need for cancer-cell selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dykens and Will, 2007</xref>). The current project was based on the premise that establishing cause and effect between mitochondrial bioenergetics and cancer is one of the keys to developing targeted and more effective therapies. As a first step, this will undoubtedly require advanced technical approaches capable of quantifying the interplay among the major mitochondrial thermodynamic free energy driving forces to distinguish between changes in bioenergetic demand versus efficiency. To this end, our group recently developed a diagnostic biochemical workflow that quantifies the changes in free energy driving forces over the entire range of respiratory demand, thus providing a comprehensive profile of mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity, relative to the underlying proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLaughlin et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Herein, we leveraged our mitochondrial diagnostics workflow across several hematological cell types, including AML cell lines, primary human leukemias, and AML cells made refractory to the chemotherapeutic venetoclax. Clonal cell expansion in leukemia, including chemoresistant AML, was universally associated with two primary phenotypes; (1) higher basal respiration driven by increased cellular mitochondrial content, and (2) intrinsic OXPHOS repression. Parallel assessment of the underlying mitochondrial proteome linked this unique ability to bolster cellular mitochondrial content while simultaneously constraining oxidative ATP synthesis to shifts in adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) isoform expression. Specifically, decreased ANT1 and increased ANT2/ANT3 appears to prime leukemic mitochondria for ATP uptake, rather than export, that, in turn directly inhibits the ability of mitochondrial OXPHOS to contribute to the cellular ATP-free energy (ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>). These findings are consistent with recent evidence demonstrating that mitochondrial OXPHOS is dispensable for tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Reyes et al., 2020</xref>), and raise the intriguing possibility that the requirement for mitochondria in leukemia may have little to do with oxidative ATP production but instead reflect a requirement for unimpeded mitochondrial flux to support other aspects of anabolic growth [e.g., NAD<sup>+</sup> regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luengo et al., 2020</xref>), nucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Martínez-Reyes et al., 2020</xref>)]. Critically however, accommodating such a flux demand, at least in leukemia, appears to require intrinsic mitochondrial remodeling that allows for forward electron transport/oxygen consumption to occur alongside ATP consumption. Given that acute restoration of OXPHOS kinetics in AML proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, the present findings provide proof-of-principle that interventions designed to restore, rather than disrupt, OXPHOS may impart therapeutic efficacy across various hematological malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondrial bioenergetic profiling of acute leukemia reveals respiratory flux limitations</title><p>To begin to characterize the mitochondrial network in leukemia, we selected three commercially available acute leukemia cell lines – HL-60, KG-1, MV-4–11 – and comprehensively evaluated their bioenergetic profiles. These cells arise from unique precursors along the hematopoietic lineage, express a diverse array of cell surface markers, and have distinct underlying genetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inoue et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mrózek et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rücker et al., 2006</xref>). Results were compared to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from healthy volunteers. The decision to use PBMC as a control was based on the assumption that comprehensive bioenergetic phenotyping of non-proliferative PBMC compared to various AML cell lines would provide sufficient experimental design contrast to reveal fundamental mitochondrial bioenergetic phenotypes potentially required for clonal cell expansion.</p><p>Using intact PBMC and leukemia cell lines, respiratory flux (<italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub>) was assessed under basal conditions, as well as in response to ATP synthase inhibition (oligomycin), and FCCP titration (i.e. mitochondrial uncoupler). All experiments were performed in bicarbonate-free IMDM growth media, supplemented with 10% FBS. Following FCCP titration, respiration was inhibited with a combination of rotenone (inhibits complex I) and antimycin A (inhibits complex III). Consistent with prior work in human leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jitschin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sriskanthadevan et al., 2015</xref>), basal respiration normalized to cell count was elevated above PBMC across all leukemia lines and maximal respiratory flux was higher in KG-1 and MV-4–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Interestingly, upon normalization to total protein, although basal respiration remained higher in KG-1 and MV-4–11, differences in maximal respiratory flux were eliminated, particularly at higher FCCP concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In fact, maximal FCCP-supported <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub> was nearly two-fold lower in HL-60 compared to PBMC when normalized to total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Relative to PBMC, maximal respiration induced by FCCP occurred at much lower concentrations in leukemia (i.e. lower Km; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with increasing FCCP concentrations leading to an overt bioenergetic collapse (i.e. diminishing respiration rates; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; compare <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub> at FC [2.0 µM] vs FC [5.0 µM]). Similar findings were observed using the mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Measurements of extracellular acidification (ECAR), an indirect readout of glycolytic flux, revealed higher extracellular acidification and a rightward shift in ECAR relative to oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in AML cell lines, consistent with prior reports detailing a hyper-metabolic phenotype in leukemia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suganuma et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>To determine if flux differences in leukemia could be explained by differences in mitochondrial content, nuclear and mitochondrial volumes were assessed independently by tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM) or MitoTracker fluorescence and confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

However, when normalized to nuclear volume, mitochondrial content was elevated above PBMC only in HL-60 and MV-4–11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Interestingly, across all cell types, considerable discrepancies were apparent when protein-normalized maximal respiratory flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) was compared to mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). This was particularly evident in HL-60 cells where mean maximal respiration, relative to the size of the underlying mitochondrial network, was ~5-fold lower compared to PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Together, these data suggested that at least a portion of the expansive mitochondrial network in AML may be biochemically constrained and thus unable to contribute to oxidative metabolism under basal conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Intrinsic limitations to OXPHOS characterize the mitochondrial network in leukemia cell lines</title><p>To directly test OXPHOS kinetics in leukemia, two complementary assays were designed. Both assays used digitonin-permeabilized cells energized with identical carbon substrates, and respiratory flux was stimulated with either FCCP or ATP free energy. In the first assay, the maximal capacity of the electron transport system (ETS) was assessed by energizing permeabilized cells with saturating carbon substrates (P/M/G/S/O) and titrating in FCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). The use of multiple substrates was intended to saturate carbon substrate availability such that maximal ETS flux could be quantified.

Thus, to evaluate OXPHOS kinetic efficiency in leukemia across a physiological range of ATP resynthesis demands, we utilized the creatine kinase (CK) energetic clamp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Glancy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Messer et al., 2004</xref>). This technique leverages the enzymatic activity of CK, which couples the interconversion of ATP and ADP to that of phosphocreatine (PCR) and free creatine (CR) such that extramitochondrial ATP-free energy (i.e. ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>) can be empirically titrated using PCR. Using this approach, permeabilized cells were energized with the same carbon substrate mix used for the ETS capacity assay and respiration was stimulated at minimal ATP-free energy. Note, ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> equal to −54.16 kJ/mol reflects an ATP/ADP ratio in vivo that would be expected to induce ‘maximal’ OXPHOS flux and is thus referred to throughout as ‘<italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Cytochrome C (Cyt C) was added to assess the integrity of the mitochondrial outer-membrane, and ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> was then titrated via sequential additions of PCR. With respect to the ETS capacity assay, respiration stimulated by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> partially normalized <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub> between MV-4–11 and PBMC and revealed decreased respiratory kinetics in both HL-60 and KG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>In both assays, the utilization of identical substrates (‘P/M/G/S/O’) allowed us to directly quantitate absolute OXPHOS kinetics (‘<italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub>’), relative to the maximal capacity of the electron transport system (‘<italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>Total</sub>’). Together, <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub> and <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>Total</sub> provide a quantitative index of fractional OXPHOS capacity as the ratio of the two reflects the proportion of the entire respiratory system that can be used for OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A ratio of ‘1’ reflects maximal OXPHOS reliance, whereas a ratio of ‘0’ indicates that the mitochondrial proton current cannot be utilized for ATP synthesis. Strikingly, calculated fractional OXPHOS in leukemic mitochondria was consistently decreased compared to PBMC, corresponding to a factor of ~0.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that only half of the available ETS capacity in leukemia can be dedicated to OXPHOS under physiological ATP free energy constraints. Given that the OXPHOS network is responsible for driving ATP/ADP disequilibrium to establish cellular ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>, low fractional OXPHOS was interpreted to reflect reduced bioenergetic efficiency in leukemia. Moreover, such findings indicate that traditional measurements of ‘OXPHOS’ capacity using intact cells (e.g. extracellular flux analysis) woefully underestimate true OXPHOS kinetics.</p><p>To differentiate between bioenergetic signatures inherent to proliferating cells and those which are unique to leukemia, experiments were repeated in mononuclear cells isolated from bone marrow aspirates collected from healthy volunteers. In these experiments, fractional OXPHOS in healthy bone marrow cells was comparable to PBMC and once again elevated above all leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>; ‘BM<sub>Healthy</sub>’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). As an additional control, identical experiments were carried out in primary human muscle precursor cells (human myoblasts – ‘HMB’ <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). These cells were cultured from muscle biopsies uniformly collected from the gastrocnemius muscle (10 cm distal to the tibial tuberosity) of healthy human subjects and were intended to serve as a non-cancerous, proliferative human progenitor control. Importantly, fractional OXPHOS was elevated above leukemia in human muscle progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>: ‘HMB’), indicating that decreased bioenergetic efficiency is not an absolute requirement of cellular proliferation, but rather a unique bioenergetic feature of leukemic mitochondria.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Exposure to physiological ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> reveals direct inhibition of ETS flux by ATP in leukemic mitochondria</title><p>To gain insight into the mechanism of OXPHOS limitations in leukemia, at the end of the ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> titration, oligomycin was added to inhibit ATP synthesis and maximal uncoupled respiration was stimulated with FCCP titration. Maximal FCCP-supported flux under these conditions is denoted as ‘FCCP<sub>ΔGATP</sub>’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the intact cell assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), increased glycolytic flux is presumed to maintain cellular ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> during FCCP titration. Thus, the continued presence of extra-mitochondrial ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> in our permeabilized cell system was intended to model the adenylate constraints present in intact cells. By comparing maximal OXPHOS flux (‘<italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub>’) to maximum FCCP-stimulated respiration in the presence of ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> (‘FCCP<sub>ΔGATP</sub>’), it becomes possible to quantitate any flux limitations imposed by physiological ATP/ADP. Importantly, ATP synthase is not functional during the assay, thus any flux limitations imposed by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> would be interpreted to reflect direct ETS regulation (e.g. allostery). In PBMC and human muscle progenitor cells, the addition of FCCP at the end of the ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> titration restored respiration to levels obtained under low (−54.16 kJ/mol) ATP free energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), indicating minimal ETS flux inhibition by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>. Surprisingly, relative to <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub>, FCCP-stimulated respiration was substantially blunted in the presence of high ATP-free energy across all three leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as well as healthy bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), resulting in a near twofold difference in the FCCP<sub>ΔGATP</sub>/<italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub> ratio, termed ‘FCCP Effect’ throughout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Importantly, in the absence of ATP, the addition of CK and PCR up to 21 mM did not impact FCCP-supported flux in permeabilized MV-4–11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To determine the sensitivity of ETS inhibition by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>, FCCP-supported flux in MV-4–11 cells was assessed at defined ATP-free energies. In these experiments, extramitochondrial ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> was administered after CV inhibition with oligomycin, followed by FCCP titration. Results revealed a dose-dependent decrease in uncoupled respiration in response to increasing ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), confirming that ATP-free energy is both necessary and sufficient to induce direct ETS flux inhibition in leukemia.</p><p>Inhibition of respiratory flux mediated by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> could reflect a number of potential mechanisms ranging from cytoskeletal alterations, direct inhibition of the matrix dehydrogenase network (e.g. inhibitory phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase), and/or ETS inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2018</xref>). To differentiate between these potential outcomes, mitochondria were isolated from PBMC and each of the three leukemia cell lines and similarly assessed for OXPHOS kinetics. In mitochondria energized with saturating carbon, increasing ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> led to a more pronounced decrease in respiration in mitochondria of all three leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The ability of FCCP to restore maximal respiratory flux was also once again blunted in leukemic mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>), consistent with lower fractional OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Evidence of ATP-dependent inhibition of ETS flux using both isolated mitochondria and permeabilized cells was used as criteria to rule out any involvement of the cytoskeleton. To differentiate between respiratory flux inhibition localized to the matrix dehydrogenases or the ETS, NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> redox poise was measured in substrate-replete isolated mitochondria exposed to an identical ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> span. Results are depicted as a percentage of complete reduction, where 0% reduction reflects isolated mitochondria at 37°C without added substrates and 100% reduction is recorded at the end of the assay with the addition of the CIV inhibitor cyanide. Except for a slight hyper-reduction in HL-60 mitochondria, NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> redox was similar across groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating that ATP-mediated respiratory flux inhibition in leukemia is not due to a generalized impairment in carbon substrate uptake and/or dehydrogenase flux. Having eliminated the cytoskeleton and the dehydrogenase network as potential sites of inhibition, we next turned our attention to the ETS. To determine if flux inhibition induced by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> was specific to a given respiratory complex, OXPHOS kinetics were assessed in isolated mitochondria energized with either complex I (CI)- or CII-linked substrate combinations. Note, the presence of saturating malate in the CI substrate mix results in CII inhibition via malate-fumarate equilibration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Likewise, the addition of rotenone in the presence of succinate eliminates residual CI-supported flux by downstream products of succinate oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Using either CI- or CII-linked substrates, we once again observed a more pronounced decrease in respiration in response to ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> titration in leukemic mitochondria, as well as a relative inability of FCCP to restore maximal respiratory flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–H</xref>). Taken together these findings demonstrate that leukemic mitochondria are characterized by a unique form of OXPHOS regulation involving ETS inhibition by ATP free energy.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>In leukemic mitochondria ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> regulates ETS flux independent of substrate condition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) OXPHOS kinetics supported by P/M/G/S/O in mitochondria isolated from PBMC and leukemia cells.

It is critical to point out that the directionality of transport by ANT is dependent on inner membrane polarization. Based on this, if indeed ANT2/3 were favoring matrix ATP uptake in leukemia then chemical inhibition of the phosphorylation system should depolarize, rather than hyperpolarize, membrane potential in leukemic isolated mitochondria. To test this, we quantified mitochondrial membrane potential in substrate-replete isolated mitochondria from HL-60 and KG-1, as well as PBMC, across a ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> span and then assessed the impact of ANT inhibition with CAT or CV inhibition with oligomycin. Contrary to that seen in PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), the addition of CAT or oligomycin caused a near complete elimination of mitochondrial membrane potential in HL-60 and KG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), indicative of matrix ATP uptake/consumption. Interestingly, in similar experiments with MV-4–11 mitochondria, the addition of oligomycin partially polarized membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), presumably due to the higher ETS capacity of MV-4–11 compared to HL-60 or KG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, in the absence of any carbon substrates (i.e. no forward electron transport), membrane potential generated exclusively by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> was ~2 fold more polarized in all AML lines compared to PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In fact, for each AML line, membrane potential generated by ATP consumption was comparable to that generated during forward electron transport with saturating carbon substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>). Together, these data indicate that leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume, rather than produce, ATP. Such a mechanism appears mediated by the dominant expression of ANT2/3 in AML and once inside the matrix, ATP exerts a direct inhibitory effect on ETS flux.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Low fractional OXPHOS in AML is reversed by small-molecule inhibitors of TRAP1</title><p>Having established that extramitochondrial ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> must gain access to the matrix space to inhibit ETS flux in leukemia, we next set out to elucidate the potential protein mediator(s) of this effect.

This means that biological processes driven by ATP hydrolysis are presumably fueled by ATP-free energy, rather than ATP levels per se. The primary advantage of the CK clamp technique is that it allows for mitochondrial bioenergetics to be evaluated across a physiological ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> span without appreciable changes in ATP concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Thus, we reasoned that the CK clamp could be utilized to assess 17-AAG effectiveness across a ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> span under conditions in which free [ATP] is not rate-limiting. For contrast, we compared the respiratory impact of 17-AAG to that of the commonly used ETC inhibitor antimycin A. Although antimycin A decreased respiratory flux in permeabilized MV-4–11 cells, percent inhibition by the compound was largely insensitive to ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>, consistent with its known mechanism of action at CIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>).

To test this, we repeated the <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub> experiments in control and TRAP1 knockdown cells in the presence of either 17-AAG or gamitrinib. In control cells, acute administration of 17-AAG and gamitrinib once again increased fractional OXPHOS and restored the FCCP effect and near identical results were also apparent in TRAP1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1L</xref>). Such findings indicated that OXPHOS restoration by 17-AAG/gamitrinib occurs independent of TRAP1 and is thus attributable to an ‘off-target’ mechanism. One such off-target effect documented for 17-AAG relates to the ability of the compound to bind voltage-dependent anion transporter (VDAC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xie et al., 2011</xref>), the principal gatekeeper to adenylate transport across the outer mitochondrial membrane. A similar mechanism has also been described for the anticancer compound curcumin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tewari et al., 2015</xref>); however, the implications of these interactions on cellular bioenergetics remain incompletely understood. Interestingly, nearly identical to the effect observed in the presence of 17-AAG/gamitrinib, acute exposure to curcumin also reversed ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>-mediated ETS inhibition in MV-4–11 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). Based on the striking functional similarities between 17-AAG, gamitrinib and curcumin, such findings suggest a potential novel mechanism whereby these small molecules are uniquely capable of selectively blocking matrix ATP uptake, while remaining permissive to ADP uptake, presumably via interaction with the VDAC-ANT axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). In support of this, curcumin-VDAC interaction is known to lock VDAC in the ‘closed’ confirmation, in turn making it partially selective for cation (i.e. ADP<sup>3-</sup>), rather than anion (i.e. ATP<sup>4-</sup>), transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tewari et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial fractional OXPHOS and AML biology, we assessed cellular proliferation and viability in control and TRAP1 knockdown cells exposed to gamitrinib, curcumin, or vehicle control.

To address the specific role for OXPHOS in AML chemoresistance, we conducted a series of experiments in chemosensitive HL-60 cells and compared the results to HL-60 cells made to be refractory to venetoclax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). In these experiments, <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>Total</sub> and <italic>J</italic>H<sup>+</sup><sub>OXPHOS</sub> were determined as described above. In addition, OXPHOS kinetic data generated using the CK clamp was integrated with parallel analysis of OXPHOS efficiency (mitochondrial ATP synthesis relative to oxygen consumption; quantified as the P/O ratio). By incorporating empirically derived P/O, respiratory flux at each ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> can be converted to ATP production rate. Assuming extra-mitochondrial force applied via the CK clamp is fixed at each titration step, ATP production rate can be used to quantitate OXPHOS power output in Watts (J∙s<sup>−1</sup>). Power is an extremely useful parameter because it encompasses thermodynamic, kinetic, as well as stochiometric descriptions that effectively report on the actual quantities of OXPHOS work performed across the demand range. Looking first at intact cellular respirometry, both basal and maximal respiratory capacity were elevated in venetoclax-resistant HL-60 (HL60<sub>VR</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).

However, fractional OXPHOS kinetics had not been empirically evaluated in leukemia at the onset of this project. Thus, it remained to be determined whether higher basal respiration in leukemia reflected accelerated demand for ATP regeneration or intrinsic OXPHOS insufficiency. Both conditions would be expected to similarly restrict cellular ATP/ADP equilibrium displacement (i.e. ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> charge) and thus could potentially result in identical respiratory profiles in intact cells. For example, a small network of mitochondria each respiring near maximal capacity could in theory produce an identical ‘basal’ oxygen consumption rate to that of a comparatively larger mitochondrial network in which forward respiratory flux was constrained across each mitochondrial unit. Our findings provide definitive support for the latter scenario in AML, as application of our diagnostic biochemical workflow revealed that intrinsic limitations in fractional OXPHOS characterize an expansive mitochondrial network in human leukemia. In fact, a substantial portion of the AML mitochondrial network is incapable of contributing to oxidative ATP production, as leukemic mitochondria primarily consume, rather than produce, ATP across a physiological ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> span. Intrinsic OXPHOS limitations in AML appear to derive from a unique biochemical mechanism whereby extra-mitochondrial ATP gains access to the matrix space, where it then directly inhibits electron transport flux in a ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>-dependent manner. Such inhibition is independent of ATP synthase (i.e. CV) and presumably localized to the respiratory complexes downstream of the ubiquinone pool (i.e. CIII, Cyt C, CIV). Given that evidence for this effect was also observed in bone marrow-derived CD34+ stem cells, allosteric and/or post-translation regulation of ETS flux is likely a primary mode of OXPHOS regulation in hematopoietic progenitors that is maintained during leukemogenesis. Importantly, reversal of this effect was strongly cytotoxic to AML, indicating that direct OXPHOS regulation by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> confers a survival advantage during hematopoietic clonal cell expansion. Although additional work will be required to fully elucidate the mechanism(s) by which ATP uptake directly inhibits OXPHOS flux in AML, our preliminary findings leveraging gamitrinib and curcumin provide proof-of-principle that such regulation can indeed be targeted therapeutically.</p><p>While prior work has implicated ANT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chevrollier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Maldonado et al., 2016</xref>) in cancer biology, we present for the first time here a potential mechanism whereby ANT2/3 regulate leukemic cell metabolism via ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>. Specifically, our findings inform a model of leukemia bioenergetics in which decreased ANT1, and increased ANT2/3 favor the uptake of extra-mitochondrial ATP into the matrix space. The transfer of ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> from the cytosol to the matrix in turn constrains OXPHOS via direct inhibition of the ETS. Direct ETS inhibition by ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> could derive from multiple sources, such as adenylate-mediated allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kadenbach, 2021</xref>), inhibitory phosphorylation of the respiratory complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Helling et al., 2012</xref>), or chaperone mediated protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sciacovelli et al., 2013</xref>). In either case, the exquisite sensitivity of the ETS to ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> likely prevents the mitochondrial network from contributing to the cellular ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> charge in the leukemic blasts. Consequentially, maintenance of a low cellular ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> would be predicted to maximize both glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, entirely consistent with the known hyper-metabolic phenotype of human leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Goto et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goto et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suganuma et al., 2010</xref>). Such conditions are likely advantageous to proliferating leukemic blasts, as insufficient ATPase activity has been demonstrated to be rate-limiting for cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luengo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Currently, there is great interest in developing novel pharmacotherapies that target mitochondrial OXPHOS in leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Farge et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guièze et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kuntz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Panina et al., 2020</xref>). Yet, a large caveat of targeting mitochondria is the ubiquitous necessity of OXPHOS for healthy cellular metabolism. If indeed the proliferative potential of leukemia depends upon mitochondrial ATP consumption, rather than production, it is tempting to speculate that a pharmaceutical intervention designed to restore OXPHOS kinetics and/or ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> could effectively halt cell proliferation, in turn allowing for proliferating blasts to succumb to apoptosis. Such a targeted approach would be expected to minimize secondary toxicity as increased OXPHOS efficiency is likely advantageous across non-cancerous, highly metabolic tissues (e.g. brain, heart, muscle), as well as in the context of adaptive cellular immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vardhana et al., 2020</xref>). Based upon our proposed model, targeting the acute OXPHOS regulating capabilities of ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> through the VDAC-ANT axis provides an appealing, leukemia-specific target for pharmaceutical intervention, as small-molecule interference of this pathway restored OXPHOS kinetics in leukemic mitochondria and induced cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Although prior work has identified TRAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bryant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ramkumar et al., 2020</xref>) as a potential anticancer target in leukemia, genetic knockdown in MV-4–11 cells increased, rather than decreased, cellular proliferation in the present study. Of note, the mitochondrial-localized TRAP1 inhibitor gamitrinib is currently being evaluated in a first-in-human phase I clinical trial for treatment of advanced cancers (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> Identifier: NCT04827810). It is currently unclear how much of the cytotoxicity induced by 17-AAG and/or gamitrinib is attributable to on-target TRAP1 inhibition vs off-target interference with ATP exchange via VDAC-ANT. Moreover, the mechanism of cytotoxicity induced by 17-AAG/gamitrinib/curcumin requires additional experimentation. Although speculative, it is possible that the ability of these compounds to selectively block matrix ATP uptake acutely restores full respiratory competence of the expansive AML mitochondrial network, in turn increasing redox pressure across the ETS and boosting ROS production above a cytotoxic threshold.</p><p>Taken together, the present findings provide novel insight into the hyper-metabolic phenotype characteristic of human leukemia. With respect to the mitochondria, it bears repeating that heightened basal respiration in AML is almost exclusively assumed to reflect an increased reliance on oxidative ATP synthesis (i.e. OXPHOS). Although this assumption largely underscores the growing interest in targeting mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in cancer, direct interrogation of the mitochondrial network herein consistently revealed active OXPHOS repression in AML. Representative of this phenotype, TRAP1 knockdown and venetoclax resistance both resulted in an increase in basal respiration that was subsequently linked to decreased, not increased, OXPHOS kinetics. Such findings highlight the diagnostic limitations of metabolic measurements made in intact cells and suggest that too much reliance on binary readouts of respiration versus glycolysis may in fact be masking ‘actionable’ cancer-specific mitochondrial biology. By leveraging comprehensive mitochondrial diagnostics, our collective findings inform a model whereby intrinsic OXPHOS limitations support aggressive disease dissemination in leukemia and raise the intriguing possibility that pharmaceutical interventions aimed at blocking mitochondrial ATP uptake/consumption warrants further exploration. Given that increased OXPHOS efficiency is advantageous across non-cancerous tissues, a potential benefit to this novel treatment paradigm is the minimization of secondary toxicity (i.e. a wide therapeutic window).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells;

The assay was performed in bicarbonate free IMDM, supplemented with 2 mM HEPES, in the absence of FBS, pH 7.4. The flux analysis protocol was as follows: Basal OCR and ECAR were measured followed by the addition of 5 μM Oligomycin, and 50 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG). All data were normalized to viable cell count.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Isolation of mitochondria from PBMCs and leukemia cells</title><p>In order to pellet cells, PBMC fractions were washed with PBS and centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min at 4°C and leukemia cells were centrifuged at 300 x g for 10 min followed by a PBS wash. Cell pellets were resuspended in Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer with BSA (100 mM KCl, 50 mM MOPS, 1 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2% BSA, pH 7.1) and homogenized using a borosilicate glass mortar and Teflon pestle. Homogenates were centrifuged at 800 x g for 10 min at 4°C. The supernatant was collected, and the remaining pellet was resuspended in Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer with BSA, then homogenized and centrifuged again. This process was repeated a total of three times. The collected supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet the mitochondrial fraction. The fraction was resuspended in Mitochondrial Isolation Buffer without BSA, transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and subjected to another spin at 10,000 x g. The mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in ~100 µL of Mitochondria Isolation Buffer and protein concentration was calculated using the Pierce BCA assay. Respiration assays using isolated mitochondria were similar to that described for permeabilized cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mitochondrial NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> redox in isolated mitochondria</title><p>Fluorescent determination of NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> was performed using a QuantaMaster Spectrofluorometer (QM-400, Horiba Scientific, Kyoto, Japan). The NADH/NAD + was detected at Ex/Em: 350/450. NADH/NAD + was measured in mitochondria isolated from PBMC and leukemia cell lines using the CK clamp assay. Experiments were performed at 37°C in a 200 µL reaction volume. To start, Respiratory Buffer supplemented with creatine (200 µL), Cyt C (10 µM), mitochondrial lysate (100 µg) were added into a glass cuvette. Mitochondria were incubated at 37°C for ~5 min in the absence of substrate to induce 0% reduction of the NADH pool. Saturating carbon substrates were added (P/M/G/S/O), and respiration was stimulated with the CK clamp. Titration of ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> was performed via PCR titration (6, 15, 21 mM). Oligomycin (0.02 µM) was added to inhibit ATP synthesis and cyanide (CN, 10 mM) was added to induce 100% reduction of the matrix NADH pool. The NADH/NAD + was expressed as a percentage reduction of the CN value (i.e. 100% reduction) based upon the formula % Reduction = (F-F<sub>0%</sub>)/(F<sub>100%</sub>-F<sub>0%</sub>)*100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨ) in isolated mitochondria</title><p>Fluorescent determination of ΔΨ was carried out via a QuantaMaster Spectrofluorometer (QM-400; Horiba Scientific). Determination of ΔΨ via TMRM was done as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fisher-Wellman et al., 2018</xref>), taking the fluorescence ratio of the following excitation/emission parameters [Ex/Em, 576/590 and 551/590].

Experiments were performed at 37°C in a 2.5 mL reaction volume in Respiratory Buffer supplemented with AP5A (0.2 mM), and digitonin (0.02 mg/mL). ATP synthesis and oxygen consumption were determined in permeabilized cells energized with P/M/G/S/O in the presence of 0.1 mM ADP. The P/O ratio was then calculated using the ratio of the <italic>J</italic>ATP and the steady state <italic>J</italic>O<sub>2</sub>, divided by 2. Empirically derived P/O ratios were then used to convert oxygen consumption rates recorded during the CK clamp assay (using identical substrates) to ATP production rate [(oxygen consumption rate) x (P/O x 2)]. A fixed extra-mitochondrial force was assumed to be applied via the CK clamp at each PCR titration. These forces corresponded to −54.16,–58.93, −60.64, and −61.49 kJ/mol. These forces were used along with ATP production rate to quantitate OXPHOS power output in Watts (J/s) according to the following formula [(pmol ATP/s/million cells) x (5.416 or 5.893 or 6.064 or 6.149 * 10<sup>−8</sup> J/pmol ATP) = µWatts/million cells].</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mitochondrial lysis, protein digestion, and peptide labeling for TMT quantitative proteomics</title><p>Mitochondrial pellets from leukemia cells and PBMC (approximately 250 µg of protein) were lysed in ice-cold 8 M Urea Lysis Buffer (8 M urea in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 40 mM NaCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1x cOmplete ULTRA mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLaughlin et al., 2020</xref>). The samples were frozen on dry ice and thawed for three freeze-thaw cycles and further disrupted by sonication with a probe sonicator in three 5 s bursts set at an amplitude of 30 (Q Sonica, Newtown, CT). Samples were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet insoluble material. Protein concentration was determined by BCA, and equal amounts of protein (200 μg, adjusted to 2.5 mg/mL with Urea Lysis Buffer) were reduced with 5 mM DTT at 32°C for 30 min, cooled to room temperature, and then alkylated with 15 mM iodoacetamide for 30 min in the dark. Unreacted iodoacetamide was quenched by the addition of DTT up to 15 mM. Initial digestion was performed with Lys C (Thermo Fisher) 1:100 w-w; 2 µg enzyme per 200 µg protein for 4 hr at 32°C. Following dilution to 1.5 M urea with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 30 mM NaCl, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, the samples were digested overnight with trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) 50:1 w/w, protein:enzyme at 32°C. Samples were acidified to 0.5% TFA and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C to pellet insoluble material. Supernatant containing soluble peptides was desalted on a 50 mg tC18 SEP-PAK solid phase extraction column (Waters, Milford, MA) and eluted (500 μL 25% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA and 2 × 500 μL 50% acetonitrile/0.1% TFA).

The samples from isolated mitochondria were re-suspended in 100 μL of 200 mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB), mixed with a unique 10-plex Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) reagent (0.8 mg re-suspended in 50 μL100% acetonitrile), and shaken for 4 hr at room temperature (Thermo Fisher). A total of 2 × 10 plex kits were used and one sample was TMT-labeled in both kits to control for quantification differences across multiplex preparations. Following quenching with 0.8 μL 50% hydroxylamine samples were frozen, and lyophilized. Samples were re-suspended in ~1 mL of 0.5% TFA and again subjected to solid phase extraction, but with a 100 mg tC18 SEP-PAK SPE column (Waters). The multiplexed peptide sample was subjected to high pH reversed phase fractionation according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo Fisher). In this protocol, peptides (100 µg) are loaded onto a pH-resistant resin and then desalted with water washing combined with low-speed centrifugation. A step-gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration in a high-pH elution solution is then applied to columns to elute bound peptides into eight fractions. Following elution, fractions were frozen and lyophilized.</p><p>nLC-MS/MS for TMT proteomics nLC-MS/MS was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLaughlin et al., 2020</xref>). Peptide fractions were suspended in 0.1% formic acid at a concentration of 0.25 µg/µL, following peptide quantification (ThermoFisher). All samples were subjected to nanoLC-MS/MS analysis using an UltiMate 3000 RSLCnano system (Thermo Fisher) coupled to a Q Exactive PlusHybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) via nanoelectrospray ionization source. For each injection of 4 µL (1 µg), the sample was first trapped on an Acclaim PepMap 100 20 mm ×0.075 mm trapping column (Thermo Fisher) 5 μl/min at 98/2 v/v water/acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, after which the analytical separation was performed over a 90-min gradient (flow rate of 300 nanoliters/min) of 3–30% acetonitrile using a 2 µm EASY-Spray PepMap RSLC C18 75 µm × 250 mm column (Thermo Fisher) with a column temperature of 55°C. MS1 was performed at 70,000 resolution, with an AGC target of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> ions and a maximum IT of 60 ms. MS2 spectra were collected by data-dependent acquisition (DDA) of the top 20 most abundant precursor ions with a charge greater than one per MS1 scan, with dynamic exclusion enabled for 30 s. Precursor ions were filtered with a 1.0 m/z isolation window and fragmented with a normalized collision energy of 30.

Data were searched against human Mito Carta 2.0 database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calvo et al., 2016</xref>). PSMs were filtered to a 1% FDR. PSMs were grouped to unique peptides while maintaining a 1% FDR at the peptide level. Peptides were grouped to proteins using the rules of strict parsimony and proteins were filtered to 1% FDR using the Protein FDR Validator node of PD2.2. MS2 reporter ion intensities for all PSMs having co-isolation interference below 0.5 (50% of the ion current in the isolation window) and an average S/N &gt; 10 for reporter ions were summed together at the peptide and protein level. Imputation was performed via low abundance resampling.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Statistical analysis for TMT proteomic</title><p>The protein group tab in the PDv2.2 results was exported as tab delimited.txt. files, and analyzed based on a previously described workflow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McLaughlin et al., 2020</xref>). First, M2 reporter (TMT) intensities were summed together for each TMT channel, each channel’s sum was divided by the average of all channels’ sums, resulting in channel-specific loading control normalization factors to correct for any deviation from equal protein input in the 10-plex experiments. Reporter intensities for proteins were divided by the loading control normalization factors for each respective TMT channel. All loading control-normalized reporter intensities were converted to log<sub>2</sub> space and the average value from the 10 samples per kit was subtracted from each sample-specific measurement to normalize the relative measurements to the mean of each kit. Data from each kit were then combined for statistical comparisons. For comparison of PBMC to leukemia cell lines, condition average, standard deviation, p-value (p, two-tailed student’s t-test, assuming equal variance), and adjusted p-value (P<italic><sub>adjusted</sub></italic>, Benjamini Hochberg FDR correction) were calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lesack and Naugler, 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kathryn Cheah as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paolo Gallipoli (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this article, Nelson et al. provide evidence suggesting potential differences in functionality of mitochondria between leukemic cells and normal leukocytes. Specifically, the authors performed comparative biochemical characterization of mitochondrial function between normal and leukemic cells which demonstrated that mitochondria of leukemic cells exhibit intrinsic limitations in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) relative to peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The authors go on to provide insights into underpinning mechanisms. They identified ANT and TRAP1 proteins as differentially expressed between PBMCs and leukemic cells, whereby pharmacological inhibition of these factors resulted in partial reversion of mitochondrial phenotypes. Overall, it was found that this study was of broad interest inasmuch as it provides previously unappreciated insights into the bioenergetics of leukemia with potential therapeutic considerations. Nevertheless, several weaknesses were observed related to non-optimal controls and lack of orthogonal genetic validation of the results obtained using pharmacological approaches.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. PBMCs were deemed to be insufficient control since the observed differences between PBMCs and leukemic cells may result from distinct differentiation stages rather than reflecting normal vs. malignant state. Although it was appreciated that human myoblasts were used as an alternative control, it was found that they do not resolve the latter issue as herein the differences could also stem from tissue specificity. It was thus suggested that normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells should be employed as a control.</p><p>2. Results using ANT and TRAP1 inhibitors should be validated using appropriate genetic approaches. Manipulation of ANT2 and/or TRAP1 levels and/or activity should also be accompanied by functional assays (e.g. proliferation, survival etc).</p><p>3. The authors should consider altering expression and/or activity of ANTs and TRAP1 in normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells and study impact of such interventions on their fate.</p><p>4. Testing interactions between TRAP1 inhibitors and standard AML therapies (e.g. cytarabine) would further strengthen this study.</p><p>5. Considering the central role of glycolysis in bioenergetics, it was thought that parallel characterization of mitochondrial functions and glycolysis between normal and leukemic cells may be warranted.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63104.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

It was thus suggested that normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells should be employed as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>The decision to use PBMC as a control was based on the assumption that comprehensive bioenergetic phenotyping of non-proliferative PBMC compared to various AML cell lines would provide sufficient experimental design contrast to reveal fundamental mitochondrial bioenergetic phenotypes potentially required for clonal cell expansion. Practically speaking, PBMC were also used because they were amendable to discovery science in which multiple assays could be performed for each biological prep. For example, most respirometry experiments required a minimum of 3x10<sup>6</sup> cells for permeabilized assays and ~150x10<sup>6</sup> for isolated mitochondria. The use of PBMC allowed us to perform multiple experiments using permeabilized cells, as well as perform assays on isolated mitochondria for each human subject.</p><p>Yet, the reviewers’ points regarding alternative controls were well taken especially since the AML cell lines were from different points within the progenitor cell lineage (HL60: promyeloblast, KG1: myeloblast, MV-4-11: lymphoblast). To address this concern, we repeated a subset of key experiments using 3 new control groups. First, as a progenitor/stem cell control we purchased commercially available, purified CD34+ cells. We also used purified CD34+ cells exposed to proliferative stimuli/growth factors (TPO, SLC, FLT-3) as a comparator of clonal expansion. In this respect, unstimulated CD34+ (i.e., CD34+ cells not exposed to proliferative stimuli) control for cell lineage and stimulated CD34+ cells control for AML-phenotypes linked to proliferation that are independent of malignancy. Lastly, mononuclear cells were isolate from bone marrow aspirates obtained from healthy volunteers. One of the major findings with the addition of the new control groups was that relative to naïve CD34+ or PBMC, fractional OXPHOS (proportion of proton current that is used for ATP synthesis) was significantly lower in clonally expanding CD34+ cells (i.e., CD34+<sub>GFs</sub>), as well as primary AML, highlighting that OXPHOS limitations are inherent to, and potentially beneficial for, hematopoietic clonal cell proliferation. Based upon these results, we observed similar bioenergetic phenotypes between PBMC and CD34+, prompting us to feel confident in our use of PBMCs as a control. Results from the additional groups are now displayed in Figure 2 and new Figure 7.</p><p>In addition, we also now include data detailing how mitochondrial OXPHOS kinetics are altered in response to acquired chemotherapy resistance (Figure 8). Although upregulations in mitochondrial content and apparent increases in oxidative metabolism are documented features of drug resistance in AML, very little information exists that specifically relates to OXPHOS. We thus investigated fractional OXPHOS and OXPHOS power output in chemosensitive (i.e., ‘wt’) HL-60 cells, as well as HL-60 cells made to be refractory to venetoclax. The use of ‘wt’ counterparts eliminated the need for a ‘non-cancer’ control and thus allowed us to compare OXPHOS kinetics in relation to AML biology in a well-controlled system. As seen when comparing AML to naïve CD34+, basal respiration and maximal respiratory capacity were further elevated in venetoclax resistant HL-60. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell than wt, absolute OXPHOS capacity, fractional OXPHOS and OXPHOs power output were not increased, but decreased in venetoclax resistant cells. Together these data support the overall model that indicates that low fractional OXPHOS supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML and thus we feel strongly that these data belong in the current report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Results using ANT and TRAP1 inhibitors should be validated using appropriate genetic approaches. Manipulation of ANT2 and/or TRAP1 levels and/or activity should also be accompanied by functional assays (e.g. proliferation, survival etc).</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewers’ suggestions, we prioritized genetic manipulation of TRAP1 as we hypothesized that ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>-mediated ETS inhibition may be driven by acute activation of TRAP1. MV-4-11 cells were infected with lentivirus containing pooled short hairpin RNA (shRNA) against TRAP1 which led to a &gt; 90% reduction in TRAP1 mRNA. Control cells were infected with lentivirus containing scrambled shRNA. All constructs encoded GFP, as well as a puromycin selection gene to allow for stable selection.</p><p>Consistent with previous reports, we noticed an increase in basal respiration in TRAP1 knockdown cells. But surprisingly, and opposite to that observed with acute use of TRAP1 inhibitors (17-AAG/gamitrinib), TRAP1 knockdown exacerbated the ability of ATP free energy to blunt ETS flux. These findings clearly indicate that the ability of 17-AAG/gamitrinib to prevent ΔG<sub>ATP</sub>-mediated ETS inhibition is independent of TRAP1 and thus attributable to an ‘off-target’ mechanism. Given that prior research had demonstrated an ability of 17-AAG to bind VDAC, coupled with the fact that a different molecule, curcumin, essentially phenocopied the effect of 17-AAG, the TRAP1 KD experiments informed a new model to explain low fractional OXPHOS in AML. Prior work has demonstrated that curcumin-VDAC interaction locks VDAC in the ‘closed’ confirmation, in turn making it partially selective for cation (i.e., ADP<sup>3-</sup>), rather than anion (i.e., ATP<sup>4-</sup>), transport. Based on this, our biochemical data inform a model in which 17-AAG, gamitrinib and curcumin are capable of selectively blocking matrix ATP uptake, while remaining permissible to ADP to support oxidative ATP synthesis (i.e., OXPHOS). Results from these experiments are now displayed in new Figure 6. We provide evidence of 3 small molecules that appear capable of ‘reversing’ this effect in vitro. Importantly, all 3 compounds induce cytotoxicity in AML, suggesting that restoring OXPHOS may impart therapeutic efficacy in AML. In either case, the transfer of ΔG<sub>ATP</sub> from the cytosol to the matrix represents an appealing, leukemia specific actionable mitochondrial phenotype that deserves additional consideration. With respect to the mechanism of cytotoxicity, although speculative, it is possible that selectively targeting matrix ATP uptake in leukemic blasts restores full respiratory competence of the already expansive mitochondrial network. This may in turn increase redox pressure across the ETS and boost ROS production above a cytotoxic threshold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should consider altering expression and/or activity of ANTs and TRAP1 in normal CD34+ hematopoietic cells and study impact of such interventions on their fate.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we were able to explore the impact of TRAP1 knockdown in MV411 cells, infection efficiency was quite low in these cells and thus required repeated rounds of puromycin selection to generate polyclonal populations of cells in which TRAP1 expression was &gt;90% depleted. Based on this, we did not feel it was feasible to explore genetic manipulations in CD34+ cells as suggested. However, we did investigate the impact of CAT, 17-AAG, and gamitrinib on OXPHOS kinetics in CD34+ (naïve and stimulated to proliferate), bone marrow mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and PBMC. In addition, we assessed cell viability in response to 24hr exposure to 17-AAG or gamitrinib in PBMC. With respect to OXPHOS kinetics, neither CAT, 17-AAG, or gamitrinib impacted OXPHOS kinetics in any of the non-cancer control groups. The notable exception was the CD34+ stimulated to undergo clonal cell expansion. Based on all the data, we interpret these findings to indicate that mitochondrial ATP uptake/consumption is a unique bioenergetic feature that tracks with hematopoietic clonal cell expansion. Interestingly, similar OXPHOS phenotypes are apparent in AML, as well as clonally expanding CD34+, indicating that mitochondrial ATP consumption is not exclusive to malignant growth.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Testing interactions between TRAP1 inhibitors and standard AML therapies (e.g. cytarabine) would further strengthen this study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid suggestion and previous studies have shown synergistic effects on cell toxicity with sequential treatment of nucleoside analogs and 17-AAG (PMID: 15784732, 14570880). To address this, TRAP1 knockdown and control (scrambled shRNA) cells were exposed for 24 hours to gamitrinib (mitochondrial targeted TRAP1 inhibitor) or curcumin (TRAP1 and VDAC inhibitor), either alone or in combination with cytarabine (Ara-C). Compared to marginal cytotoxicity in response to Ara-C dose escalation, 24hr exposure to either gamitrinib or curcumin decreased cell viability by as much as 60%. Additionally, PBMC were exposed for 24hr to 17-AAG or gamitrinib in the presence of Ara-C, and neither combination impacted cell viability. These findings suggests that gamitrinib and curcumin extend greater cytotoxicity compared to conventional AML therapy and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS may have therapeutic potential for treating blood cancer. These findings are presented in the new Figure 6 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Considering the central role of glycolysis in bioenergetics, it was thought that parallel characterization of mitochondrial functions and glycolysis between normal and leukemic cells may be warranted.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the reviewers’ suggestion, measurements of extracellular acidification (ECAR), an indirect readout of glycolytic flux, were measured. Results revealed higher ECAR and a rightward shift in ECAR relative to oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in AML cell lines (Supp. Figure 1E). These findings were consistent with prior reports detailing a hyper-metabolic phenotype in AML.</p></body></sub-article></article>
