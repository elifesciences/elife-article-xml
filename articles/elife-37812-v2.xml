ATP release is among the earliest cellular responses to mechanical stimulation. Mechanical stimulation of a single murine osteoblast led to the release of 70 ± 24 amole ATP, which stimulated calcium responses in neighboring cells. Osteoblasts contained ATP-rich vesicles that were released upon mechanical stimulation. Surprisingly, interventions that promoted vesicular release reduced ATP release, while inhibitors of vesicular release potentiated ATP release. Searching for an alternative ATP release route, we found that mechanical stresses induced reversible cell membrane injury <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PLC/PKC-dependent vesicular exocytosis facilitated membrane repair, thereby minimizing cell injury and reducing ATP release. Priming cellular repair machinery prior to mechanical stimulation reduced subsequent membrane injury and ATP release, linking cellular mechanosensitivity to prior mechanical exposure. Thus, our findings position ATP release as an integrated readout of membrane injury and repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37812.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Athletes' skeletons get stronger with training, while bones weaken in people who cannot move or in astronauts experiencing weightlessness. This is because bone cells thrive when exposed to forces. When a bone cell is exposed to a physical force, the first thing that happens is the release of the energy-rich molecule called ATP into the space outside the cell. This molecule then binds to the neighboring cell to unleash a cascade of responses. ATP can exit the cell either through special canals in the cell membrane or released in tiny pod-like structures called vesicles. It is known that strong forces can injure the cell membrane and cause ATP to spill out. However, it is less clear how ATP is released when cells are subjected to regular forces.</p><p>Mikolajewicz et al. investigated whether ATP exits through injured membranes of cells experiencing regular forces. Bone cells grown in the laboratory were gently poked with a glass needle or placed in a turbulent fluid to simulate forces experienced in the body. Dyes and fluorescent imaging techniques were used to observe the movement of vesicles and calculate the concentration of ATP in these cells.</p><p>The experiments showed that regular forces in the body do indeed injure the cell membranes and cause ATP to spill out. But importantly, the cells repaired the injuries quickly by releasing vesicles that patch the wound. As soon as the membrane is sealed, ATP stops coming out. From the first injury, cells adapted and quickly strengthened their membrane and repair system to be more resilient against future forces. This process was also seen in the shin bones of mice.</p><p>These results are important because knowing how bone cells sense, respond and convert physical forces can help us develop treatments for astronauts, the injured and aged.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ATP release</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd><kwd>mechano-adaptation</kwd><kwd>membrane injury</kwd><kwd>purinergic (P2) signalling</kwd><kwd>vesicular exocytosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-77643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Komarova</surname><given-names>Svetlana V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-288253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Komarova</surname><given-names>Svetlana V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bone cells exposed to physiological forces release ATP through repairable membrane injury, generating an intercellular signal that conveys the destructive potential of forces and the adaptive capacity of endangered cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mechanical environment is an important determinant of bone health, as emphasized by a consistent bone loss in astronauts exposed to microgravity or in paralyzed or bedridden patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Nagaraja and Jo, 2014</xref>).

Treatment with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) caused a 33 ± 2% increase in the vesicular density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), consistent with a NEM-induced increase in the readily releasable vesicular pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lonart and Südhof, 2000</xref>), and a 55 ± 8% increase in mechanically-evoked vesicular exocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>).

Proportional to the extent of tFSS, 21 ± 11 to 422 ± 97 amol ATP/cell were released, approaching 31.5% of total intracellular ATP at high tFSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). tFSS (10x media displacements) induced release of 324 ± 50 amol ATP/cell, while ionomycin only led to release of 94 ± 5 amol ATP/cell.

Adopting a Fura2-based dye-leakage assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Togo et al., 1999</xref>), we examined changes in 340 ex/510 em Fura2 fluorescence following mechanical stimulation of osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In ~40% of micropipette-stimulated osteoblasts, intracellular Fura2 fluorescence returned to pre-stimulation baseline (minor or no injury; mIn). However, in 30–40% of osteoblasts post-stimulation fluorescence was partially reduced (intermediate injury; iIn) and in 15–20% of osteoblasts completely lost (severe injury; sIn) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The extent of injury sustained by a micropipette-stimulated cell correlated with the magnitude and duration of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>), as well as the percentage of secondary responders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that ATP release is related to the extent of membrane disruption. In a dye uptake assay, we added membrane impermeable dyes, trypan blue (TB) or rhodamine-conjugate dextran (R-dextran), to osteoblasts before or after mechanical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). When the dyes were applied prior to tFSS, the proportion of dye-permeable osteoblasts positively correlated with the degree of tFSS. The extent of dye uptake was higher for TB (~900 Da) compared to R-dextran (~10 kDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). However, when membrane permeability was examined 300 s after stimulation, a significantly lower percentage of cells were permeable to the dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H,I</xref>). Hemichannel involvement was excluded, since hemichannel blockers did not affect mechanically-stimulated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> elevations, membrane permeability or ATP release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with transient membrane disruption, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, ~140 kDa) leaked into the extracellular media proportionally to tFSS magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>), even though cell viability was minimally affected 1 hr after tFSS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

We have shown that vesicular release was critical for the repair of mechanically induced membrane injury and that the Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PLC/PKC pathway regulates vesicular exocytosis in osteoblasts. We interrogated the role of vesicular release in the mechanoresponse using NEM, a modulator of vesicular docking machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lonart and Südhof, 2000</xref>). While NEM is commonly used as an inhibitor of vesicular release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kowal et al., 2015</xref>), it has also been shown to increase vesicular release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kirmse and Kirischuk, 2006</xref>) through accumulation of readily-releasable vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lonart and Südhof, 2000</xref>). Using real-time imaging, we demonstrated that NEM increased the basal vesicular density and potentiated mechanically stimulated vesicular exocytosis in osteoblasts. In the presence of NEM, mechanically induced membrane injury and ATP release were significantly reduced. Vesicular exocytosis has been implicated as a mechanism of ATP release from osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kringelbach et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Romanello et al., 2005</xref>) based on the assumed inhibition of vesicular exocytosis by NEM or vesicular trafficking by brefeldin A, bafilomycin or monensin. However, our data demonstrated that the role of vesicles cannot be inferred without a direct validation of the effect of NEM on vesicular release. In our study, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>e</sub> depletion abolished mechanically stimulated vesicular release, interfered with membrane repair and increased ATP release. Calcium is one of the first mechanically induced signals that initiates downstream responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robling and Turner, 2009</xref>), including exocytosis-mediated membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cooper and McNeil, 2015</xref>).

Our study suggests that the osteoporotic phenotype reported in PKCµ-deficient bones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Li et al., 2017</xref>) may be associated with defective mechanoresponsiveness.

We have demonstrated that membrane injury and repair are common under physiological stresses <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and determined the critical role for PKC-regulated vesicular exocytosis in bone cell membrane repair. We suggest that rather than delivering ATP to extracellular space, exocytosis of ATP-containing vesicles limits the much larger efflux of intracellular ATP through damaged membranes. We propose a model of biological adaptation to mechanical forces, which directly links mechanosensation through reversible membrane injury and ATP release to the development of adaptive resilience against the destructive potential of mechanical forces. PKC-mediated vesicular release provides a target for potential therapeutic interventions to modulate mechano-responsiveness and mechano-resilience in humans habitually experiencing altered mechanical environment, such as astronauts or paralysis patients.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were approved by McGill’s University’s Animal Care Committee (protocols # 2012–7127 and 2016–7821) and complied with the ethical guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">BMP2-transfected C2C12 <break/>myoblast cells <break/>(C2C12-BMP2; C2-OB)</td><td valign="bottom">Dr. M.

Recordings consisted of ~10 s baseline [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and additional 110–170 s following application of mechanical stimulation or treatment. The excitation wavelength was alternated between 340 and 380 nm using an ultra-high-speed wavelength switching illumination system (Lambda DG-4, Quorum Technologies). Regions of interest (ROI) were manually defined and the ratio of the fluorescent emission at 510 nm, following 340 and 380 nm excitation (f340/f380), was calculated and exported using the imaging software (Volocity, Improvision). All data were imported into an excel spreadsheet for characterization using a MATLAB algorithm previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mackay et al., 2016</xref>). The following parameters were obtained for statistical analysis: amplitude (amp; magnitude of response), activation time (t<sub>10%-90%</sub>; time between 10% and 90% of maximum response), and decay constant (τ<sub>decay</sub>) of exponential decay region of deactivation phase of transient response.

Cells were washed with PS and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 780 laser scanning confocal microscope. An argon and diode laser were used as light sources (ex. 405 nm and 458 nm) and the detection wavelength ranges were set to 410–470 nm and 490–570 nm to ensure separation of overlapping emission spectra, for MANT-ATP and quinacrine, respectively. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Plan-Apochromat 63x/1.40 Oil immersion objective lens. Subsequent analysis was carried out using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, USA). Vesicular density was determined using ImageJ by counting number of intracellular quinacrine-positive puncta and normalizing count to cell surface area.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-2"><title>Kinetics</title><p>To study vesicular release kinetics, time-lapse recordings of quinacrine-loaded cells were acquired with a Nikon T2000 fluorescent inverted microscope after a 10-min period of post-stain acclimatization to minimize the effects of mechanical agitation. Quinacrine-rich vesicles were imaged using a 40x objective at a sampling frequency of 2 Hz for 2 min. To minimize the phototoxic effects of quinacrine, the excitation intensity was set to 33% of peak intensity and the shutter was shut in between 100 ms exposures. Image sequences were exported using the imaging software Volocity (Improvision) for subsequent analysis in ImageJ. To quantify the kinetics of vesicular release, sudden losses of fluorescence were monitored. Vesicles that gradually came in and out of focus did not qualify as release events. SparkSpotter (Babraham Bioinformatics, UK), an ImageJ plugin, was used to identify release events in temporally reversed and contrast-enhanced image stacks, so that the loss of fluorescence would instead be detected as a sudden increase by the spark identifying algorithm.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Mechanically-stimulated ATP release from murine bone cells is regulated by a balance of injury and repair&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Miguel A. Valverde as Guest Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Margarita Calvo (Reviewer #2); Paul McNeil (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript that seeks to explain the mechano-adaptive mechanism of bone cells to repair an injured plasma membrane. The data support a model whereby mechanical stress triggers a response involving ATP release through the disrupted membrane and calcium/PKC dependent vesicular exocytosis to repair the membrane. This is a novel mechanism based on a combination of imaging and functional assays to evaluate the response of both in vitro and in vivo bone cells.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mechanical signals play a critical role in the cellular/tissue regulation of the osteorticular system. Despite the importance of the mechanical loading in osteoarticular system health and disease, the mechanisms that participate in the maintenance of the integrity of the individual cells exposed to cyclical mechanical loading are not fully understood. Recently, different mechanoosmosensitive ion channels have been implicated in the homeostatic response to mechanical loading. The manuscript by Mikolajewicz and colleagues use different cultured bone cells as well as in vivo assays to address the how non-lethal cell membrane injury triggers cell membrane repair. They show that mechanical stress, generates ATP release, intracellular calcium signals and Ca<sup>2+</sup>/PKC dependent membrane exocytosis.</p><p>The authors build a model in which the mechanical stimulation results in membrane disruption, which leads to ATP efflux and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, triggering vesicular exocytosis and membrane repair that then limits ATP release. Although it seems a convincing model we would like to see further work done to evaluate the contribution of mechanosensitive ion channels in the repairing mechanism.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written (but with overcrowded figures), interesting, timely and will add an interesting angle to the mechanisms of cellular response to mechanical loading.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It will be essential to evaluate the role of mechanosensitive ion channels in the repair mechanisms. Piezo1/2 and TRPV4 channels have been proposed to play a key role in many mechanobiological responses of different cell types, particularly the osteo-articular system. Therefore, their contribution should be evaluated by experiments in which their activity is assessed by loss-of-function e.g. implementing knockdown by applying si/shRNA and/or specific pharmacological approaches.</p><p>2) For the quantification of the western blots, total as well as phosphorylated forms of PKC and PKD should be used for normalization (phospho/total).</p><p>Other points to consider:</p><p>1) Some of the experiments were run in one type of cells and other ones in other cells? Is there any rationale on using one or the other cell type? If yes, it need to be explained clearly in the text.</p><p>2) Please define what the N numbers refer to in each figure.</p><p>3) For western blots, please provide the entire gel (as a supplementary figure).</p><p>4) Figures are too busy, particularly Figure 6. Can you please simply/reorganize this figure to facilitate its reading/understanding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>&quot;Mechanically-stimulated ATP release from murine bone cells is regulated by a balance of injury and repair&quot; provides interesting and novel observations on mechanotransduction in osteoblasts that might be relevant for in-vivo function, with basic science and biomedical-translational relevance.</p><p>I would encourage the authors to explore more in-depth an eventual role of Piezo ion channels in the observed mechanotransduction. They go to great lengths to probe an array of molecules involved in mechanotransduction, Piezo should also be appreciated with more dedication.</p><p>Besides this issue, I have not identified additional major concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, Dr Komarova et al. describe a regulatory mechanism that controls the amount of ATP released in response to reversible membrane injury. They describe that exocytosis of ATP-containing vesicles can limit the efflux of intracellular ATP through the injured membranes (which is of a much larger scale). This is a newly described mechanism of cell resilience against mechanical forces.</p><p>I have a few questions that would like the authors to address:</p><p>1) You initially say that you tested osteoblasts from three different sources: two primary cultures (BM-OB and CB-OB) and one cell line (C2-OB). I may have missed it, but why did you choose to do some of the experiments in some of these cells and other ones in other cells? Is there any rationale on using one or the other cell type? If yes, it need to be explained clearly in the text.</p><p>2) In Figure 1 you show experiments in the 3 different cell types and there are significant differences between them. But these are not mentioned neither discussed in the manuscript. Could you please discuss.</p><p>3) Regarding n numbers; I understood that n=1 in the in vivo experiment means one animal. But in the in vitro experiments what do you define as n=1? Is one plate with x number of wells (biological replicates)? Or n=1 is one well? In this case n=x could mean that there are x wells coming all from the same original culture?</p><p>4) In the in vivo experiments, why did you only use female mice? Any rationale behind this? Could you explain in the text?</p><p>5) For the western blots I would like to see the entire gel, not just to show the band (if it makes the figure complicated you can add the gels as supplemental). But this is important for future replications.</p><p>6) Also for WB, why did you not measure total PKC and PKD. You should normalise the quantity of phosphoPKC or phosphoPKD to the total amount of these proteins (phsopho/total).</p><p>7) Figure 6 is far too busy and hard to understand. Could you please make it simpler or bigger? (Or divide in two figures when you include the bands and measurements of total kinases over phospho).</p><p>8) I think a schematic representation or diagram summarizing your results as a last figure could help a lot to understand the results and will give a clearer message.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper adds significantly to a novel, recently proposed (Yu et al., 2017) hypothesis for explaining how bone adapts to mechanical stress. Physiologically relevant mechanical stresses are observed in vitro and in vivo to disrupt osteocyte plasma membranes. These membrane disruptions are not necessarily lethal but can be repaired allowing cell survival of this injury. However the disruption is thought to initiate signaling, such as a rise in intracellular calcium, that then leads to bone adaptation events. Here the authors show that ATP is released through osteocyte disruptions, a second signaling mechanism that might lead to an adaptive response. The sections of the paper dealing with repair are less strong as the authors do not have a technique for quantitative assay of this event.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37812.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] I would encourage the authors to explore more in-depth an eventual role of Piezo ion channels in the observed mechanotransduction.

Both Piezo 1/2 and TRPV4 channels have been previously demonstrated to be sensitive to Gd<sup>3+</sup> [8, 9]. However, our data indicate that ATP release from mechanically-stimulated osteoblasts is not inhibited by Gd<sup>3+</sup> (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). We have additionally investigated the involvement of TRPV4 using its specific inhibitors HC 067047 [10] and GSK 2193874 [11], and are now providing new data addressing the involvement of Piezo1 using its specific inhibitor GsMTx-4 [12]. Consistent with the effects of Gd<sup>3+</sup>, specific inhibitors of Piezo 1 and TRPV4 were not effective in inhibiting mechanically stimulated ATP release from osteoblasts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Our findings are consistent with previous work that tested the involvement of Piezo1 and TRPV4 in osteoblasts using Gd<sup>3+</sup> [13].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Besides this issue, I have not identified additional major concerns.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) You initially say that you tested osteoblasts from three different sources: two primary cultures (BM-OB and CB-OB) and one cell line (C2-OB).

To validate these findings, we used primary cultures of mouse osteoblasts. Since both bone-marrow-derived [14, 15] and compact-bone derived [16, 17] osteoblast cultures are used in the literature, we explored both cultures, and obtained qualitatively similar results, in spite of differences in the origin and differentiation state of the cells (pre-osteoblast-like in bone marrow derived cultures and late OB-osteocytes-like in compact bone-derived cultures). Since compact-bone derived late osteoblasts/osteocytes are closer to the in vivo model we used in this study, we continued using these cells for data validation throughout the study. Nevertheless, we included the data obtained in bone-marrow-derived cultures, since they demonstrate a side-by-side comparison for responses in osteoblastic cells obtained through different ex vivo protocols. While not a primary objective of this study, we believe that such data is important for understanding how different in vitro models behave. We have now included this clarification in the ‘Cell Cultures’ section of the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1 you show experiments in the 3 different cell types and there are significant differences between them.
