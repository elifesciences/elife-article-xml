processes, but obtaining such data is challenging, especially for rare proteins, cell types, or events. Proximity labeling enables discovery of protein neighborhoods defining functional complexes and/or organellar protein compositions. Recent technological improvements, namely two highly active biotin ligase variants (TurboID and miniTurbo), allowed us to address two challenging questions in plants: (1) what are in vivo partners of a low abundant key developmental transcription factor and (2) what is the nuclear proteome of a rare cell type? Proteins identified with FAMA-TurboID include known interactors of this stomatal transcription factor and novel proteins that could facilitate its activator and repressor functions. Directing TurboID to stomatal nuclei enabled purification of cell type- and subcellular compartment-specific proteins. Broad tests of TurboID and miniTurbo in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and versatile vectors enable customization by plant researchers.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47864.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain thousands of different proteins that work together to control processes essential for life. To fully understand how these processes work it is important to know which proteins interact with each other, and which proteins are present at specific times or in certain cellular locations. Investigating this is particularly difficult if the proteins of interest are rare, either because they are present only at low levels or because they are unique to a particular type of cell.</p><p>One such protein known as FAMA is only found in young guard cells in plants. Guard cells are rare cells that surround pores on the surface of leaves. They help open or close the pores to allow carbon dioxide and water in and out of the plant. Inside these cells, FAMA regulates the activity of genes in the nucleus, the compartment in the cell that houses the plant’s DNA.</p><p>Two recently developed molecular biology tools, called TurboID and miniTurbo, allow researchers to identify proteins that are in close contact with a protein of interest or are present at a specific place inside living animal cells. These tools use a modified enzyme to add a small chemical tag to proteins that are close to it, or anything to which it is anchored. Mair et al. adapted these tools for use in plants and tested their utility in two species that are commonly used in research: a tobacco relative called <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana,</italic> and the thale cress <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p><p>Their experiments showed that TurboID and miniTurbo can be used to tag proteins in different types of plant cells and organs, as well as at different stages of the plants’ lives. To test whether the tools are suitable for identifying partners of rare proteins, Mair et al. used FAMA as their protein of interest. Using TurboID, they detected several proteins in close proximity to FAMA, including some that FAMA was not previously known to interact with. Mair et al. also found that TurboID could identify a number of proteins that were present in the nuclei of guard cells. This shows that the tool can be used to detect proteins in sub-compartments of rare plant cell types.</p><p>Taken together, these findings show that TurboID and miniTurbo may be customized to study plant protein interactions and to explore local protein ‘neighborhoods’, even for rare proteins or specific cell types. To enable other plant biology researchers to easily access the TurboID and miniTurbo toolset developed in this work, it has been added to the non-profit molecular biology repository Addgene.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd><kwd>nuclear proteome</kwd><kwd>guard cell</kwd><kwd>biotin ligase</kwd><kwd>FAMA</kwd><kwd><italic>N. benthamiana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergmann</surname><given-names>Dominique C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J4019-B29</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mair</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1-CA186568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ting</surname><given-names>Alice Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005843</institution-id><institution>Carnegie Institution of Washington</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Shou-ling</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006919</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lester Wolfe Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branon</surname><given-names>Tess C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006919</institution-id><institution>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Dow Graduate Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Branon</surname><given-names>Tess C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Proximity-labeling using engineered biotin ligases TurboID and miniTurbo enables detection of cell-type-specific and low abundance protein complexes and subcellular proteomes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and other plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All major processes of life, including growth and development and interactions among cells, organisms and the environment, rely on the activity and co-operation of hundreds of proteins. To fully understand these processes on a cellular level, we must know all players present in a cell or cell type at a specific location and time. This requires information about transcription and chromatin state, as well as about protein abundance and protein complex compositions. A large international effort, the ‘human cell atlas’ project, is taking a first step in this direction. It aims to characterize all cell types in the human body, using recent advancements in high-throughput single cell and multiplex techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Regev et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stuart and Satija, 2019</xref>). Following this example, a call for a ‘plant cell atlas’ describing nucleic acid, protein and metabolite composition of different cell types in plants was issued at the start of this year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rhee et al., 2019</xref>). While several groups have produced single-cell gene expression profiles (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Efroni et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ryu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Denyer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nelms and Walbot, 2019</xref>) and tissue/cell-type-specific profiles of active translation (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vragović et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tian et al., 2019</xref>), we lack effective tools to obtain similarly precise information about protein distribution, abundance and the composition of protein complexes.</p><p>Today’s state-of-the-art for identification of <italic>in-planta</italic> protein interactors and complexes is affinity purification with protein-specific antibodies or single- and tandem affinity purification tags and subsequent mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Struk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Xu et al., 2010</xref>). However, while affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategies are undoubtedly useful in many instances, AP-MS is challenging for very low abundant proteins, those expressed only in rare cell types or developmental stages, and those with poor solubility like integral membrane proteins. Moreover, AP-MS tends to miss weak and transient interactions unless paired with crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Qi and Katagiri, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Van Leene et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bontinck et al., 2018</xref>). For obtaining subcellular proteomes, typical traditional approaches rely on cell fractionation protocols that enrich organelles from whole tissues, followed by protein extraction and MS analysis. Besides cross-contamination with other organelles, cell fractionation has the issue that only compartments that can be purified are accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Agrawal et al., 2011</xref>). The usefulness of this strategy for studying local protein compositions in individual cell types is further limited by the requirement of prior enrichment of the cell type of interest. For rare and transient cell types, acquiring a sufficient amount of ‘pure’ organelle material for MS analysis would be a major challenge.</p><p>Recent technological innovations in the form of proximity labeling (PL) techniques provide the sensitivity and specificity needed to identify protein complexes and (local) proteomes on a cell-type-specific level. These techniques employ engineered enzymes to covalently attach biotin to nearby proteins which can then be affinity purified from total protein extracts using streptavidin-coupled beads without the need for crosslinking to stabilize weak and transient protein interactions or cell sorting and fractionation to enrich organelles. Because proteins do not have to be isolated in their native state, harsher extraction and more stringent wash conditions can be applied, which can reduce false positives from post-lysis interactions or from non-specific binding of proteins to the beads, and can improve solubilization of membrane proteins (for recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gingras et al., 2019</xref>). An ever growing number of applications for PL in animals, including the characterization of protein complexes (e.g. the nuclear pore complex; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), of organellar proteomes (e.g. mitochondrial matrix and intermembrane space; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hung et al., 2016</xref>), as well as for local proteomes (e.g. inside cilia; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mick et al., 2015</xref>, at synaptic clefts; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Loh et al., 2016</xref>, or at endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hung et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrate the usefulness and versatility of these techniques. Although the potential utility for PL in plants is equally tremendous, its adaptation in plants has been slower, with the successes being limited primarily to systems employing transient and/or high expression. The first three of these (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conlan et al., 2018</xref>) utilized BioID, which is based on an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> biotin ligase (BirA) made promiscuous by a point mutation (R118G) to yield BirA*. BirA* is either fused to a protein of interest or targeted to a desired subcellular localization to mark protein interactors and local proteomes, respectively. When biotin is supplied in the presence of ATP, BirA* binds and activates biotin and releases reactive biotinyl-AMP which can covalently bind to close-by primary amines on lysine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). Based on experiments with the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2014</xref>), the labeling radius of BirA* was estimated to be approximately 10 nm, which is in the size-range of an average globular protein. The actual labeling range may vary between experiments and is dependent on characteristics of the BirA* fusion protein, such as linker length and bait mobility, and on the labeling time.</p><p>Structural features of plants, including cell walls and the cuticle, most plants’ growth temperature optima and the fact that plants produce and store biotin in their cells, provide major impediments to BioID-based PL systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bontinck et al., 2018</xref>). Recent engineering of improved versions of BirA, however, might improve PL efficiency in plants and provide the tools required to build a ‘plant cell atlas’. In a directed evolution approach, two new variants – TurboID and miniTurbo – with similar specificity as BirA* but greatly increased activity and lower temperature requirements were created (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). TurboID and miniTurbo were successfully utilized to generate different organellar proteomes in HEK cells and work in vivo in a broad range of species, including <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> which were previously inaccessible for BioID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). While this work was in review, a new manuscript demonstrating the effectiveness of TurboID in tobacco plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) was published. However, TurboID was again highly expressed and the activity of miniTurbo was not tested. Moreover, the potential of TurboID to identify rare protein complexes or local proteomes in individual cell types of a complex multicellular organisms had not yet been addressed.</p><p>Here, we show that TurboID and miniTurbo enable effective PL in a wide variety of tissues and expression levels in plants. We use TurboID to identify partners of the stomatal guard cell transcription factor FAMA and to obtain the nuclear proteome of a rare cell type in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings – young stomatal guard cells. Our work indicates high <italic>sensitivity</italic> of the new PL enzymes in plants and is complementary to recent work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>) demonstrating high <italic>specificity</italic> in a plant-pathogen signaling context. To enable adoption by the plant research community, we provide reagents and a broadly applicable workflow for PL experiments under different experimental conditions in a variety of tissues in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and highlight critical steps in experimental design and execution.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Highlights</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>TurboID (TbID) and miniTurbo (mTb) work well in all tested tissues and growth stages of stably transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and in transiently transformed <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Labeling times of under 10 min can give immunoblot-detectable signals, but longer incubation may be required for protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS).</p></list-item><list-item><p>In Arabidopsis, TbID activity is higher than mTb activity, but ‘background’ labeling with endogenous biotin is also increased.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Biotin concentrations in the range of 2.5–50 µM and 20–50 µM are suitable for enhanced labeling with TbID and mTb.

We therefore made an initial diagnosis of whether the improved BirA* variants TurboID and miniTurbo (hereafter called TbID and mTb) are appropriate for PL applications in plants, by testing their activity in the nucleus and cytosol of two plant model systems: transiently transformed <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves and young seedlings of stably transformed <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. To enable a comparison with previous experiments in the literature, we also included the original BirA* in our experiments and expressed all three versions under the ubiquitous UBIQUITIN10 (UBQ10) promoter. A YFP tag was added to confirm correct expression and localization of the TbID and mTb biotin ligases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>).</p><p>To test biotin ligase activities, we treated leaf discs from <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves or whole 5-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings, each expressing TbID or mTb, with biotin and subsequently monitored biotinylation in total protein extracts using streptavidin immunoblots. For biotin treatment, we briefly vacuum infiltrated the plant tissue with the biotin solution and then incubated the tissue submerged in the solution for 1 h at room temperature (approximately 22°C). Mock- or untreated plants were used as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In TbID- and mTb-expressing <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, biotin treatment induced strong labeling of proteins, demonstrating that the new biotin ligases work under our chosen conditions in plants. As was observed in other organisms, both TbID and mTb showed greatly increased activity compared to BirA*, which mainly achieved weak self-labeling within 1 h of biotin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). Since plants produce and store free biotin in their cells, we were concerned about 'background’ labeling in the absence of exogenous biotin. Although it did appear, background labeling was in most cases negligible. Direct comparison of TbID and mTb in our plant systems revealed little difference in either activity or background labeling in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), possibly due to the high expression levels of the constructs.

Using immunoblots, we observed similarly fast labeling in plants. TbID induced labeling of proteins over background levels within 15–30 min of treatment with 250 or 50 µM biotin at room temperature (22°C) and labeling steadily increased over the next 3 to 5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Encouragingly, the activity of both variants was nearly as high at 22°C as at 30°C. Moreover, TbID showed only a moderate increase of activity at 37°C, while mTb activity was actually reduced at this temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). High activity at ambient temperatures was also observed in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Increasing temperatures above plant growth conditions to improve labeling is therefore not needed.</p><p>The biotin concentration used for PL is an important consideration. Endogenous levels of biotin in plants are sufficient for low-level labeling of proteins by TbID, and to some extent also by mTb. While this may be useful for some applications, most applications will require strongly enhanced and time-regulated labeling through the addition of exogenous biotin. Although using excessive amounts of biotin is inconsequential for immunoblots, it poses a problem for downstream protein purification with streptavidin beads, as will be discussed later. We therefore tested biotin concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 250 µM to determine the optimal substrate concentration for TbID and mTb. We found that TbID has a larger dynamic range than mTb. Weak over-background labeling could already be seen with 0.5 µM biotin, which increased weakly through 20 µM, followed by a steeper increase with 30 µM and was more or less saturated at 50–75 µM. mTb required between 2.5 and 10 µM biotin for weak activity, showed a steep increase with 20 µM (comparable to TbID) and was also saturated at 50–75 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). TbID and mTb are therefore comparable to BirA* in their biotin requirement and concentrations of 2.5–50 µM (TbID) and 20–50 µM (mTb) seem to be appropriate.</p><p>In initial experiments, we vacuum infiltrated the plant material with the biotin solution to maximize biotin uptake. At least in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings, this is not necessary. Simply submerging the plantlets in the biotin solution resulted in the same amount of labeling as vacuum infiltration followed by incubation in the biotin solution did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This finding is very important since it not only simplifies handling of the experiment, but also improves isolation of labeled proteins by reducing the amount of free biotin in the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TurboID works in a wide variety of developmental stages and tissues</title><p>For TbID to be widely applicable, it must be able to biotinylate proteins in many developmental stages and plant tissues. One initial concern, especially with TbID, was that background labeling from endogenous biotin would accumulate over time, making timed experiments with older tissues unfeasible. This was, however, not the case. Labeling worked well in 4- to 14-day-old plate-grown seedlings without significant increase of background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The same was true for separated roots and shoots of 6- to 14-day-old seedlings and even for rosette leaves and flower buds of adult <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants grown on soil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). Background activity was low, especially in leaf tissue, and labeling worked well. Vacuum infiltration was not required for the tested plant sample types, except for unopened floral buds, where infiltration improved labeling relative to submergence in the biotin solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This is likely because petals and reproductive tissues are not in direct contact with the biotin solution. Overall, our experiments suggest that TbID will be applicable in a wide range of developmental stages and tissues.

The low abundance of FAMA and FAMA-expressing cells renders identification of interaction partners and cell-type-specific nuclear proteins by traditional methods challenging and makes it well suited for a proof-of-concept experiment. Potential FAMA interaction partners were previously identified in yeast-2-hybrid (Y2H) and bimolecular fluorescence complementation studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanaoka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>), but only few have been confirmed by in vivo functional data.</p><p>For our study, we generated plants expressing TbID and a fluorescent tag for visualization under the FAMA promoter, either as a FAMA-protein fusion or alone with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore performed labeling time-courses with the FAMA-TbID line, using immunoblots as a readout. FAMA auto-labeling could be observed after as little as 5 min but clear labeling of other proteins required approximately 15 to 30 min. Longer incubation led to further increase in labeling up to 3 h, both in the form of stronger discrete bands and of diffuse labeling, but stayed more or less the same thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Based on these observations, we chose 0.5 and 3 h biotin treatments, after which we would expect abundant and most FAMA interactors to be labeled, respectively, for the ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). For the ‘nuclear proteome’ experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), only the longer 3 h time point was used, since over-labeling of the compartment was not a concern. Accordingly, the FAMA-TbID, <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID and WT lines were treated for 0, 0.5 and 3 h, and the <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID line only for 3 h. As plant material, we chose seedlings 5 days post germination, which corresponds to a peak time in FAMA promoter activity, as determined empirically by microscopy. We used three biological replicates per sample. To make the datasets as comparable as possible, all steps preceding data analysis were done together for the two experiments, as described in the next section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>From labeling to identification of biotinylated proteins – identifying critical steps</title><p>Through empirical testing of experimental conditions using the <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID line, we identified steps and choices that have a big impact on success of protein purification and identification after PL with TbID. These include sample choice to maximize bait abundance, removal of free biotin, optimizing the amount of streptavidin beads for affinity purification (AP) and choosing among MS sample prep procedures. Below, we describe our experimental procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and highlight key choices.</p><p>We first labeled 5-day-old seedlings, by submerging them in a 50 µM biotin solution for 0, 0.5 or 3 hr, quickly washed them with ice cold water to stop the labeling reaction and to remove excess biotin and isolated total proteins for AP of biotinylated proteins. The protein extracts were then passed through PD-10 gel filtration columns to reduce the amount of free biotin in the sample before proceeding with AP using magnetic streptavidin beads. Successful labeling and purification was confirmed by immunoblots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>). The inclusion of a biotin-depletion step was found to be critical as free biotin in the protein extracts competes with biotinylated proteins for binding of the streptavidin beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). While for mammalian cell culture or rice protoplasts thorough washing of the cells seems to suffice for removal of free biotin, this is not the case for intact plant tissue (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conlan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). Especially when large amounts of starting material and moderate amounts of biotin are used, little to none of the biotinylated proteins may be bound by the beads. To maximize the amount of purified proteins it is further advisable to determine the appropriate amount of beads required for each experiment. We used 200 µl beads for approximately 16 mg total protein per sample. This amount was chosen based on tests with different bead-to-extract ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>) and was sufficient to bind most biotinylated proteins in our protein extracts, although the beads were slightly oversaturated by the highly labeled <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5D</xref>).</p><p>Following AP, we performed liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis to identify and quantify the captured proteins. Tryptic digest for LC-MS/MS analysis was done on-beads, since test experiments revealed that elution from the beads using two different methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheah and Yamada, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schopp and Béthune, 2018</xref>) and subsequent in-gel digestion of biotinylated proteins yielded significantly lower protein amounts and less protein identifications (data not shown). This apparent sample loss is caused by the strong biotin-streptavidin interaction, which allows for stringent washing conditions but also prevents efficient elution of biotinylated proteins from the beads. Notably, highly biotinylated proteins, which likely comprise the most interesting candidates, will interact with more than one streptavidin molecule and will be especially hard to elute. After MS analysis, we identified and quantified the proteins by label-free quantification and filtered for significantly enriched proteins. This part was done separately for the ‘FAMA interactome’ and ‘nuclear proteome’ experiments and is described in the following sections.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Proximity labeling is superior to AP-MS for identification of candidate interactors of FAMA</title><p>FAMA acts as both an activator and repressor for hundreds of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hachez et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a need for coordinated action with other TFs, co-activators and -repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matos et al., 2014</xref>). Identifying such proteins through classical affinity purification-mass spectrometry approaches is hampered by the low overall abundance of FAMA. Apart from INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1), which is a known heterodimerization partner of FAMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanaoka et al., 2008</xref>), we failed to identify any transcriptional (co-)regulators by AP-MS with FAMA-CFP, despite the use of crosslinking agents and large amounts of plant material (15 g of 4-day-old seedlings per sample). Moreover, less than 20% of the AP-MS-derived ‘candidates’ were predicted to be nuclear, and one quarter were chloroplast proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 5). We therefore wanted to see if PL would improve the identification of biologically relevant FAMA interactors.</p><p>For the ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment we compared proteins purified from plants expressing the FAMA-TbID fusion (FAMA-TbID) with proteins from WT and with proteins from plants expressing nuclear TbID (<sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID) after 0, 0.5 and 3 h of biotin treatment. In total, we identified 2511 proteins with high confidence (quantified in all three replicates of at least one sample). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed a clear separation of the samples by genotype and time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Despite this clear separation, the majority of proteins were common to all samples, including the untreated WT control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 1), and moreover, were unchanged between samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>). This indicates that a large proportion of identified proteins bound to the beads non-specifically. This is not uncommon for affinity purification experiments, and underlines the importance of appropriate controls and data filtering pipelines.</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id

First, we removed proteins that were not significantly enriched in the FAMA-TbID samples compared to WT. These comprise sticky proteins that bind the beads non-specifically and a handful of proteins that are biotinylated natively by <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plant biotin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alban, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nikolau et al., 2003</xref>). This was done by pair-wise comparison of FAMA-TbID and WT samples at each time point, using only proteins that were found in all three replicates of the corresponding FAMA-TbID samples, and resulted in a list of 73, 85 and 239 significantly enriched proteins (including FAMA) at the 0, 0.5 and 3 h time points, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> – Table 2). Since TbID is highly active and endogenous levels of biotin are sufficient for low-level labeling, there is a risk that proteins are labeled stochastically and that, over time, the whole nuclear proteome would be labeled. Notably, more than half of the proteins enriched in the FAMA-TbID plants at any of the time points were also enriched in the <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 2). We therefore applied a second filtering step to remove proteins that were not significantly enriched in the FAMA-TbID versus the <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID samples. Pair-wise comparison of FAMA-TbID and <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID samples at the three time points, further reduced the dataset to 6, 15 and 57 proteins (including FAMA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 2). Finally, we removed proteins that were not significantly enriched after biotin treatment compared to the untreated samples, since these proteins are likely genotype-specific contaminations. One protein, which was only enriched in the absence of exogenous biotin but not after biotin treatment, was removed as well.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47864.026</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>‘FAMA interactome’ experiment – PL with TbID reveals potential FAMA interactors involved in transcriptional regulation.</title><p>Workflow (left) and results (right) of the experimental setup and data filtering process. Biotinylated proteins from seedlings expressing FAMA-TbID or nuclear TbID in FAMA-stage cells (<sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID) and from wild-type (WT) after 0, 0.5 and 3 h of biotin treatment were affinity purified (AP) with streptavidin beads and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Proteins that were identified in all three biological replicates of at least one genotype and time point (2511 proteins) were used to filter for FAMA-complex candidates by three consecutive filtering steps: First, proteins enriched in FAMA-TbID compared to WT were determined for each time point using unpaired two-sided t-tests with a permutation-based FDR for multiple sample correction to remove background from non-specific binding to the beads. Only proteins that were identified in all three replicates of FAMA-TbID at this time point (high confidence identifications) were used for the test (cutoff: FDR = 0.05, S0 = 0.5; ❶). Significantly enriched proteins were then filtered for enrichment compared to <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID (same t-test parameters; ❷) to remove stochastically labeled proteins. Finally, the remaining proteins were filtered for enrichment in biotin-treated versus untreated FAMA-TbID samples (t-test: p&lt;0.05; ❸) to remove proteins that were not labeled in response to biotin treatment.

Notably, more than half of the candidates have a role in regulation of transcription or are chaperones which could assist in FAMA’s role as a TF or in protein folding and stabilization, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 4). Moreover, several of these proteins have previously been shown to interact with each other, which suggests that they could be part of the same FAMA complexes. This is a huge improvement compared to our AP-MS experiment, which could only confirm FAMA’s interaction with its obligate heterodimerization partner ICE1. The transcriptional regulators we found with PL can be roughly divided into two categories: TFs and transcriptional co-regulators. Among the TFs we again found ICE1 (as well as peptides shared between ICE1 and its orthologue SCRM2). We also found three other bHLH TFs (AIB/JAM1, JAM3, and BIM1) and the non-canonical bHLH-type TF BZR1. AIB and JAM3 play partially redundant roles in negative regulation of jasmonic acid (JA) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sasaki-Sekimoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fonseca et al., 2014</xref>), while BIM1 and BZR1 mediate brassinosteroid (BR) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2002</xref>). Both JA and BR signaling play roles in stomatal function or development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya and Assmann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gudesblat et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kim et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Among the transcriptional co-regulators we found two significantly enriched transcriptional co-activators: MED16, which is part of the mediator complex that links TFs to RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kidd et al., 2011</xref>), and HAC1, which is a histone acetyl transferase (HAT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2007</xref>). Combined with previous data showing a link between FAMA and RNA Pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), this suggests that FAMA activates genes both directly by recruiting RNA Pol II and by opening up the chromatin for other transcriptional regulators. Among transcriptional co-repressors were TOPLESS (TPL)-related proteins TPR3 and TPR4 and LEUNIG (LUG) and LEUNIG HOMOLOG (LUH), which recruit histone deacetylases (HDACs) to TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Long et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, we identified the linker protein SEUSS (SEU), which mediates interaction of LUG and LUH with TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Karmarkar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sitaraman et al., 2008</xref>). The identification of all three members of the SEU/LUG/LUH co-repressor complex is a strong indication of a functional complex with FAMA in the plant. Relaxing our filtering criteria to include proteins that are enriched in the FAMA-TbID vs <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID samples but were not significant under our stringent cutoff, we find several more components of transcriptional co-regulator complexes, including three more MED proteins, another HAT, two more TPL-related proteins and TPL itself.</p><p>RBR1, a cell cycle regulator and a known interactor of FAMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matos et al., 2014</xref>), is also among the FAMA-TbID enriched proteins but, due to a modest fold change, did not pass our last filters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, – <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> Table 2). This suggests that by setting a stringent cutoff on enrichment between FAMA-TbID and <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID, we might lose some true interactors. This might be especially true of ubiquitously expressed proteins with many partners like RBR1, where FAMA-RBR1 interactions are likely to represent only a small fraction of all complexes.</p><p>For a small-scale validation of candidates biotinylated by FAMA-TbID, we tested four proteins (co-repressor complex components SEU and LUH and TFs BZR1 and BIM1) for direct interaction with FAMA in a Y2H system. Additionally, we co-expressed SEU and LUH with FAMA-TbID or nuclear TbID in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and tested for biotinylation of the candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). Our experiments suggest that BIM1 and SEU are direct interaction partners of FAMA, while LUH and BZR1 might be in indirect contact with FAMA or require a specific protein or DNA context to be present for interaction.</p><p>Overall, our ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment demonstrates the usefulness of PL to identify potential interaction partners of rare proteins. We identified several good FAMA-complex candidates which could support FAMA in its role as a key TF and provide a possible mechanism for FAMA to induce fate-determining and lasting transcriptional changes in developing GCs. Some of the FAMA-complex candidates identified through PL are also slightly enriched in FAMA AP-MS samples compared to their controls. However, the enrichment is not enough to call any of them, except ICE1, significant in the AP-MS experiment. PL therefore not only gave us higher specificity for nuclear proteins than the AP-MS did, but it is potentially more sensitive as well. It is worth noting, that most FAMA interaction candidates were identified at the 3 h time point and that longer biotin treatment greatly improved identification of biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Proximity labeling can be used to analyze the nuclear proteome in rare FAMA-expressing cells during GC development</title><p>The second question our PL experiment should answer was whether TbID could be used to take a snapshot of the nuclear proteome of FAMA-expressing cells. Traditional tools to study organellar proteomes are not well-suited for such an endeavor, since they require isolation of the cell type and organelle of interest and therefore lack the required sensitivity. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>), showed that TbID can be used to efficiently and specifically purify proteins from different subcellular compartments without prior cell fractionation. Their work was done using a homogeneous population of cultured mammalian cells, however, so it remained to be shown whether it would be possible to isolate an organellar proteome from an individual cell type, especially a rare or transient one, in a complex multicellular organism.</p><p>To identify nuclear proteins in FAMA-expressing young GCs and compare them to the global nuclear proteome at this growth stage, we purified proteins from seedlings expressing nuclear TbID under the FAMA (<sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID) and UBQ10 (<sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID) promoter and from WT after three hours of biotin treatment. PCA, hierarchical clustering and multi scatterplots showed a clear separation of the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>).

This resulted in a combined list of 4,681 ‘experimentally determined nuclear proteins’; 4021 from MS and 975 from localization studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Table 4). More than three quarters of the proteins enriched in our <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID and <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID datasets are either experimentally verified nuclear proteins or are predicted to be localized in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Tables 2, 3 and 5). This suggests that most identified proteins are indeed nuclear proteins. Of the remaining proteins, most are predicted to be in the cytosol and could have been labeled by TbID right after translation and before nuclear import of the biotin ligase or by a small mis-localized fraction of TbID. Chloroplast proteins, which are a major source of contamination in plant MS experiments, make up only about 4% of our identified proteins based on experimental and prediction data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Table 5). For a comparison, about 12% and 6% of the proteins identified in the two most recent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nuclear proteome studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Palm et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goto et al., 2019</xref>), are predicted to be in the chloroplast (SUBAcon prediction, SUBA4). Gene ontology (GO) analysis is also consistent with nuclear enrichment in both nuclear TbID datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Tables 2, 3 and 7). Importantly, our nuclear TbID successfully labeled all major sub-nuclear compartments and domains, including the nuclear pore complex, the nuclear envelope, the nuclear lamina, the nucleolus and other small speckles, as well as DNA- and chromatin-associated proteins (subdomain markers from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Petrovská et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tamura and Hara-Nishimura, 2013</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Table 8 for examples).</p><p>After the general assessment of data quality and nuclear specificity, we asked whether we could identify known markers for FAMA-stage GC nuclei from our dataset by comparing the <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID to the <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Table 3). Unlike ubiquitously expressed proteins, which should be enriched in the <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID samples, FAMA-cell specific or highly enriched proteins should be equally abundant in both sample groups. Indeed, looking at proteins that were equally abundant or slightly enriched in the <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID samples, we find several known stomatal lineage- and GC-associated TFs, namely FAMA itself, HOMEODOMAIN GLABROUS 2 (HDG2) and STOMATAL CARPENTER 1 (SCAP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Peterson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Negi et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, there were 10 proteins among the 44 highly <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID enriched proteins, that were previously identified as part of the GC proteome by Zhao and colleagues using MS analysis of 300 million GC protoplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhao et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> – Tables 3 and 6). It is worth noting that neither FAMA nor SCAP1 are in the Zhao GC protoplast proteome, presumably due to their relatively low expression and the use of material from more mature plants. These results suggest that PL can find lowly expressed proteins, that our knowledge of the GC proteome is not complete, and that additional important regulators of GC development and function might be uncovered by looking at stage-specific proteomes.</p><p>Overall, this experiment demonstrates the usefulness of TbID as a tool for studying subcellular proteomes on a whole-plant as well as on a cell-type-specific level. This will allow us to address questions that were previously inaccessible and thus has the potential to greatly improve our understanding of cellular processes in a cell-type-specific context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Suitability of TurboID and miniTurbo for application in plants and performance of TurboID in FAMA-complex identification and nuclear proteome analysis</title><p>Our experiments presented in this study demonstrate that the new biotin ligase versions TbID and mTb drastically improve the sensitivity of PL in plants, compared to previously used BirA*, and tolerate a range of experimental conditions. We observed rapid labeling of proteins by TbID and mTb in different species, tissues and at different growth stages from seedlings to mature plants, using a simple biotin treatment protocol at room temperature. This greatly broadens the range of possible PL applications for plants and will allow to address hitherto inaccessible or hard to address questions in the future. To test the usefulness of TbID for identification of protein interactors and organellar proteomes, we aimed to identify FAMA protein complexes and the nuclear proteome in FAMA-expressing cells. We deliberately picked a rare protein and cell type to observe its performance under conditions that make the use of traditional methods challenging or unfeasible.</p><p>In spite of FAMA’s low abundance, PL with the FAMA fusion protein in our ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment worked very well and outperformed our FAMA AP-MS experiments both in sensitivity and in specificity for nuclear proteins. Unlike in the AP-MS experiments, we identified a number of new proteins with gene regulatory functions that could support FAMA in its role as a master regulator of GC differentiation. Beyond the known dimerization partner ICE1, which was found in both types of experiments, PL identified four additional bHLH TFs with the potential to form alterative FAMA heterodimers as well as three non-bHLH TFs. Strong, direct interaction with BIM1 could be confirmed by Y2H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A-B</xref>). We further identified several epigenetic regulators, which could fulfill roles predicted for FAMA complexes based on previous genetic and transcriptomic experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adrian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hachez et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matos et al., 2014</xref>) and fill a gap in our current model of gene regulation during GC formation. It was satisfying to see that when FAMA complex candidates were known to form functional complexes, we often identified multiple components of the complex. One example is the SEU-LUG/LUH co-repressor complex, of which SEU acts as an adapter protein, linking LUG/LUH to TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Karmarkar, 2008</xref>). Our Y2H and PL experiments support a role of SEU as an adapter in FAMA repressive complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). MED14, which was found as potential FAMA complex component using relaxed criteria, could also be part of this interaction chain. LUG is known to act by recruiting HDACs to promote epigenetic gene repression, but can also interact with mediator complex subunits like MED14 to interfere with their interaction with transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu and Karmarkar, 2008</xref>). MED14, if indeed a FAMA complex component, could therefore either interact with the FAMA heterodimer or with the repressors LUG or LUH. It is likely that our candidates are part of different activating and repressive FAMA complexes. Which proteins are in which complex and which are direct FAMA interactors will need to be further tested with independent methods.</p><p>Interestingly, we did not confirm all of FAMA’s previously postulated interaction partners in our PL experiment. This has both biological and technical causes. It is possible that some previously observed interactions are too rare or conditional (e.g. MED8 may require pathogen exposure) while others probably only happen under artificial conditions like in Y2H assays (e.g. bHLH71 and bHLH93, which seem not to be required for stomatal development; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohashi-Ito and Bergmann, 2006</xref>). Enrichment of NRPB3 in FAMA-TbID samples, on the other hand, could not be assessed because of non-specific binding of the protein to the beads. Other technical aspects that can complicate or prevent identification of interaction partners are removal of low-frequency interactions through stringent data filtering or a general lack of labeling. Because only proteins with exposed, deprotonated lysine residues can be labeled, sterically or chemically inaccessible proteins will not be detected.</p><p>PL of FAMA-expressing nuclei and comparison with a general nuclear proteome in our ‘nuclear proteome’ experiment showed that TbID is suitable to capture subcellular proteomes at a cell-type-specific level, even when the cell type is rare. We identified 2232 proteins in both nuclear datasets combined, which is 25% more than the most recent nuclear proteome obtained from cultured <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> cells (1528 proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goto et al., 2019</xref>). Judging from experimentally determined and predicted localization of the identified proteins and functional annotation with GO analysis, we obtained high specificity for nuclear proteins and identified proteins from all major nuclear subdomains. The biggest ‘contamination’ stems from the cytosol, which could be caused by a fraction of TbID in the cytosol (e.g. right after translation) or from activated biotin diffusing out of the nucleus. Chloroplast-predicted proteins made up only a small fraction. Among FAMA-nuclei enriched proteins, we identified several known nuclear markers of young GCs, confirming our ability to detect cell-type-specific proteins, as well as proteins that have not yet been linked to GC development or function but could be interesting to investigate further. One of them is SHL (SHORT LIFE), which is a histone reader that can bind both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 histone marks and has been implicated in seed dormancy and flower repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müssig et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qian et al., 2018</xref>). Interaction of FAMA with RBR1 and with newly identified co-repressors and co-activators from this study, strongly suggests that chromatin marks are important to lock GC in their terminally differentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lee et al., 2014</xref>) and SHL could be involved in this process.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Considerations for a successful PL experiment</title><p>When designing a PL experiment, several things should be considered in order to achieve the best possible result. First, a choice has to be made which biotin ligase to use. Whether TbID or mTb is more suitable will depend on the research question. TbID is more active, which is an advantage for low abundant proteins, for cases where over-labeling is not a concern or when labeling times should be kept as short as possible. mTb is less active in the presence of endogenous levels of biotin and will give less background labeling, which could be beneficial in tissues with higher than average endogenous biotin levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shellhammer and Meinke, 1990</xref>) or when a more restricted and controlled labeling time is desired. Additional factors that should be considered when choosing a biotin ligase are whether one version works better in a specific subcellular compartment (as was the case in human HEK cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>) and whether the larger TbID interferes with the activity or correct subcellular targeting of the protein of interest (POI). We added a fluorophore to all our biotin ligase constructs. This is very useful to confirm correct expression and subcellular localization of the TbID or mTb fusion protein, but may in some cases affect the activity of the ligase or the tagged protein. Interference with activity and targeting can depend on the position of the biotin ligase relative to the POI (N- or C-terminal tag). Another decision at the construct-design phase is the choice of linker length. For our experiments we added a short flexible linker to TbID. For identification of large protein complexes, increasing the linker length may improve labeling of more distal proteins.</p><p>Another crucial consideration are controls. Extensive and well-chosen controls are essential to distinguish between true candidates and proteins that either bind non-specifically to the beads or that are stochastically labeled because they are localized in the same subcellular compart as the POI. The former class of contaminants can be identified by including a non-transformed control (e.g. WT). The best control for the latter will be situation-dependent. For identifying interaction partners of a POI, one could use free TbID or mTb targeted to the same subcellular localization as the POI, as we have done in our ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment. Alternatively, one or more unrelated proteins that are in the same (sub)compartment but do not interact with the POI can be used. This strategy might improve identification of proteins that are highly abundant or ubiquitously expressed but of which only a small fraction interacts with the bait. Such proteins may be lost during data filtering if a whole-compartment control is used, as we observed for RBR1 in our ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment. In either case, the control construct should have approximately the same expression level as the POI. For sub-organellar proteomes (e.g. a specific region at the plasma membrane) or for organellar proteomes in a specific cell type, it is useful to label the whole compartment or the compartment in all cell types for comparison.</p><p>Before doing a large-scale PL experiment, different experimental conditions should be tested to find a biotin concentration/treatment time/plant amount/bead amount combination that is suitable for the question and budget. Increasing the plant amount, labeling time or biotin concentration can improve protein coverage and can help to get more complete compartmental proteomes, but will also affect the amount of beads required. Excessive labeling is only advisable in closed compartments and when labeling of all proteins is the goal. Immunoblots are a useful tool to test different combinations of labeling concentration and time as well as for determining the correct bead amount for the pulldown so as not to over-saturate the beads. One should keep in mind, though, that the signal intensity on a western blot does not necessarily reflect the amount of labeled protein, because highly biotinylated proteins have multiple binding sites for streptavidin, which leads to signal amplification. Moreover, labeling strength will also depend on the number of sterically/chemically available sites for biotinylation, and therefore also on the size and properties of a protein.</p><p>If biotinylation is induced by addition of exogenous biotin, a crucial step before AP of biotinylated target proteins is the depletion of free biotin in the sample to reduce the amount of beads required and therefore the per sample cost. We tested the effectiveness of two different approaches: gel filtration with PD-10 desalting columns (also used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conlan et al., 2018</xref>) and repeated concentration and dilution with Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khan et al., 2018</xref>). The latter method has the potential to remove more biotin and to be more suitable for large amounts of plant material. In our hands, though, using Amicon centrifugal filters led to considerable sample loss, presumably due to binding of the membrane, and was very slow. PD-10 columns, in contrast, did not lead to a notable loss of biotinylated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>). Surprisingly, consecutive filtering of protein extracts with two PD-10 columns did not improve the bead requirement. An alternative to these two methods is dialysis, which is suitable for larger volumes but is very time consuming. If the target is in an easy-to-isolate and sufficiently abundant organelle, cell fractionation prior to AP might also be considered to remove unbound biotin.</p><p>For AP, different kinds of avidin, streptavidin or neutravidin beads are available. Their strong interaction with biotin allows for efficient pulldowns and stringent wash conditions, but makes elution of the bound proteins difficult, especially if they are biotinylated at multiple sites. Should elution of the bound proteins be important for downstream processing or the identity of the biotinylated peptides be of major interest, the use of biotin antibodies might be preferable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Udeshi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Finally, some consideration should also be given to the MS strategy. For example, digesting the proteins on the streptavidin beads instead of eluting them can increase the peptide yield. For data analysis, label-free quantification produces a more quantitative comparison of samples than comparison of peptide counts. Care should be taken that an appropriate data normalization method is chosen, especially when samples are very different, as can be the case when different cellular compartments are compared. Isotopic labeling, which allows samples to be analyzed together, can further improve quantitative comparison.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential applications and challenges for PL in plants</title><p>We can see many potential applications for PL in plants, extending beyond the ones presented in this work.

The strategy is comparable to currently used co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments but has the benefit that weak and transient, as well as other hard-to-purify interactions, are easier to detect. For this approach, proteins closely related to the bait can be used as controls for interaction specificity.</p><p>One of the major applications we demonstrate in this study is de novo identification of protein interaction partners and complex components. Extending from that, PL can be used to observe changes in complex composition in response to internal or external cues (e.g. stress treatment). Currently used techniques like peptide arrays, two-hybrid screens in yeast or plant protoplasts and AP-MS have the disadvantage that they are either artificial or work poorly for low abundant and membrane proteins and tend to miss weak and transient interactions. PL could overcome some of their deficiencies. One should keep in mind, however, that rather than identifying proteins bound directly to a bait protein, PL will mark proteins in its vicinity. Labeling is generally strongest for direct interactors, but labeling radius will depend on properties of the bait such as size, mobility and linker length as well as on the duration of labeling. To define a protein interaction network, it will be useful to use several different baits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gingras et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Another application of PL is characterization of subcellular proteomes, such as whole organellar proteomes, as we have demonstrated for the nucleus. Going forward, more detailed characterization of different organellar proteomes as well as sub-organellar proteomes and local protein composition, for example at membrane contact sites, can and should be addressed. This can be done on a whole plant level, but also at organ- and even cell-type-specific level. Importantly, PL enables investigation of previously inaccessible compartments and of rare and transient cell types as we have demonstrated for FAMA-expressing GCs. Differences between individual cell types or treatments can be investigated as well. Labeling times will, among other things, depend on the 2D or 3D mobility and distribution of the bait. For whole-compartment labeling, a combination of several baits may increase efficiency and protein coverage. One drawback of PL compared to traditional biochemical methods is that it requires the generation of transgenic plants, which limits its use to plants that can currently be transformed.</p><p>PL can also be used in combination with microscopy, to visualize the subcellular localization of biotinylated proteins and reveal labeling patterns of individual bait proteins. This can be utilized to confirm that labeling is restricted to the desired compartment, but it can also be used to fine-map the subcellular localization of a protein of interest or to obtain information about its topology, as was demonstrated for an ER transmembrane protein in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Extended uses of PL techniques that will require some modification of TbID and mTb or the PL protocol before they can be applied include interaction-dependent labeling of protein complexes (split-BioID), identification of RNAs associated with biotinylated proteins and identification of proteins associated with specific DNA or RNA sequences (for a recent review of PL methods describing these applications see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Trinkle-Mulcahy, 2019</xref>).</p><p>While there are is a plethora of questions that can be addressed with PL, there are also limitations to what will be possible. For example, although TbID and mTb are much faster than BirA*, controlled short labeling pulses (as are possible with APEX-based PL techniques) will be hard to achieve. TbID and mTb are always active and use endogenous biotin to continuously label proteins, preventing a sharp labeling start. In addition, exogenous biotin needs time to enter the plant tissue to initiate labeling. In mammalian cell culture, 10 min of labeling might be sufficient, but in a whole multicellular organism it may take much longer, depending on the experimental setup and how complete labeling should be. In our ‘nuclear proteome’ experiment, for example, 3 h of biotin treatment were not sufficient to reach labeling saturation and only very few proteins were enriched in <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID samples by 30 min of biotin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s6">Figure 5—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> – Table 3). Development of strategies to reduce background labeling, for example by (conditional) reduction of endogenous biotin levels, could improve labeling time control in the future. Another limitation stems from temperature sensitivity. Although TbID and mTb work well at room temperature and elevated temperatures, they are inactive at 4°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>) and thus likely incompatible with cold treatment as might be done for cold adaptation and cold stress experiments. Further, it is likely that some compartments will be harder to work in than others. Insufficient ATP and biotin availability and adverse pH or redox conditions could reduce TbID and mTb activity. For example, although the final step of biotin synthesis happens in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alban, 2011</xref>), free biotin in mitochondria is undetectable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baldet et al., 1993</xref>). It is possible that active biotin export from mitochondria will be a challenge for PL.</p><p>Going forward, it will be interesting to see how TbID and mTb perform for different applications and which challenges arise from the use in other plants, tissues and organelles. Our experiments in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> suggest that PL will be widely applicable in plants and will provide a valuable tool for the plant community.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>E. coli</italic> - modified)</td><td>BirA*</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branon et al., 2018</xref>;

The TbID and mTb PCR products were then cloned into a pENTR vector containing YFP between the attL1 and L2 sites to generate YFP-TbID and YFP-mTb fusions or into a pDONR-P2R-P3 vector containing mVenus-STOP between the attR2 and L3 sites to generate TbID-mVenus-STOP and mTb-mVenus-STOP fusions by restriction cloning with AscI. The AscI site in the pDONR-P2R-P3 vector was first introduced by mutagenesis PCR using primers pDONR-mut-AscI-fw and pDONR-mut-AscI-rv. These vectors can be used for three-way gateway recombination with a promoter and gene of choice as described below. For two-way recombination with a promoter of choice, TbID and mTb (with and without NES) were further amplified from the pDONR-P2R-P3 plasmids described above using primers BirA-YFPnls-fw and BirA-YFPnls-rv to remove the N-terminal linker and to add a NotI and NcoI site at the N-and C-terminus, respectively. BirA* was directly amplified from the PCR products with BirA-fw and BirA-rv or BirA-NES-rv in the same way. The resulting PCR products were either cloned into a pENTR vector containing YFP followed by a stop codon (versions with NES) or a YFP followed by an NLS and a stop codon (versions without NES) between the attL1 and L2 sites using NotI and NcoI to generate BirA-<sub>NES</sub>YFP and BirA-YFP<sub>NLS</sub> fusions (BirA = BirA*, TbID or mTb).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Mair et al., (Tools and Resources) has undertaken a robust assessment of an improved proximity labeling with biotin (BioID) approach in plants. Few studies in plants have employed BioID, and here the authors have presented a laborious collection of data outlining conditions necessary for the implementation of these improved methods (TurboID and miniTurboID) to identify new protein-protein interactions in plants in both stable and transient backgrounds. The authors start out by comparing cytosolic and nuclear localized BirA*- and TurboID- and MiniTurboID-YFP fusion expressed transiently in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and stably expressed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines. Using carefully designed experiments variables such as labelling temperature, biotin concentration, labelling time are tested and optimal conditions identified for TurboID as well as miniTurbo. This is done in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves as well as in different developmental stages and organs of Arabidopsis. Optimal conditions for affinity purification of biotinylated proteins and sample processing prior to mass spec analysis are carefully worked out and documented in great detail. Once these conditions are worked out the authors test the TurboID version to characterize a cell type specific transcription factor (FAMA) complex, with a FAMA-TurboID fusion, as well as the nuclear composition of specific guard cells expression transcription factor FAMA (pFAMA:TurboID). This is done in a temporal manor, by using short and medium length labelling times (0.5 and 3 hrs) compared to O hrs as well as comparison to the nuclear proteome (pUBQ:TurboID) and non-transformed negative controls. Both the FAMA complex and the FAMA nucleo-proteome experiments are very well designed and well documented. The FAMA complex experiment after filtering out 'non-specific' biotinylated proteins result in 47 potential FAMA complex associated/neighbourhood proteins.</p><p>The manuscript also describes a collection of vectors that have been made available for rapid implementation of their approach of this technique by the community.</p><p>Overall, performed experiments were well designed and presented data/information are very valuable for the plant science community to design the TurboID and miniTurbo based PL experiments for their researches.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Could the authors please explain how normalization of the data during MaxQuant search was done and/or was this done with Perseus? Some samples are very different from control samples, and in these cases application of global normalization across all samples during MaxQuant search (for instance) may bias the results significantly.</p><p>2) Please describe the filtering process and methods in more detail. The filtering process (Figure 5 and Figure 6) is difficult to really follow and does rely on numerous factors involved with MS data processing (matching parameters, LFQ parameters). The work has been replicated (n=3) which does add higher levels of certainty in the final results – FAMA interaction candidates and a guard cell nuclear proteome. But the initial datasets are 2511 and 3176 proteins, respectively and are filtered to 47 and 451/1583 proteins. For the GC proteome the authors indicate they found several known nuclear marker for young GCs – in fact they found 3 (subsection “Suitability of TurboID and miniTurboID for application in plants and performance of TurboID in FAMA-complex identification and nuclear proteome analysis”, last paragraph). It would be helpfull in understanding this extensive filtereing if authors could provide the MaxQuant Search files such as 'experimentalDesign', 'parameters' for the reviewers (and include in the Pride data submission).</p><p>3) The extensive data filtering to generate a high confidence sets (especially with regard to FAMA interactors) would usually require validation of some of the new candidates. Have the authors conducted any preliminary validations of the new interactors? Even relatively preliminary data would strengthen their claims for this approach. This could be preliminary transient work e.g. co express FAMA-TurboId and Target:Myc, pull down with streptavidin and conduct a western blot with anti-Myc. This would ideally be transient targets rather than complex partners, as this is the articulated advantage of this method over e.g. AP-MS.</p><p>4) The access to the raw MS data in PRIDE does not work. Both PRIDE login details resulted in no available data. I would guess data have been updated in the interim and this requires a new username / password to be issued for reviewers. Thus the robustness of the MS data matching employed by the authors could not be evaluated nor examine the quantitative process which is presumably available in a viewable data format.</p><p>5) Figure 5—figure supplement 2B: Why is replicate 1 is separated from replicate 2 and 3? It seems that separation by replicates is more significant than separation by genotypes. Is this due to how samples were processed? It was not totally clear from the method. Would be nice to have multi scatter plots as well to show correlation between samples.</p><p>6) In my understanding Branon et al. named the new ligases as TurboID(TbID) and miniTurbo(mTb), and therefore authors should use same terms to avoid any confusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.47864.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Could the authors please explain how normalization of the data during MaxQuant search was done and/or was this done with Perseus?

We agree that data normalization is a very important step and can have a large impact on the results of any MS study and have therefore carefully considered this issue.</p><p>For the MS experiments included in our manuscripts, data normalization was done in MaxQuant as part of the label-free quantification (LFQ) process, which is described in detail in (Cox et al., 2014). We also contacted that study’s author, Jürgen Cox (MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried) for clarification about normalization. In essence, the MaxLFQ algorithm first normalizes peptide intensities (by pair-wise comparison of peptide intensities between samples and calculation of optimized normalization factors) and then quantifies peptide/protein abundance. It is therefore a global normalization method, as has been pointed out, and requires samples to be overall similar not to introduce a bias. If samples are too different for normalization with MaxLFQ, the algorithm will fail and not terminate successfully (personal communication with Jürgen Cox).</p><p>In the case of AP-MS studies, for which MaxQuant is often used, the algorithm uses the fact that pulldown samples usually contain a large body of non-specific proteins (background) that is common to all samples. In our ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment, samples are overall very similar (see heatmaps and multi scatterplots Figure 5—figure supplements 2 and 3), with over 80% of identified proteins found in all of the nine sample groups, including the WT controls, and about 50% being found in all of the 27 samples. Due to the large number of sticky proteins that presumably bound to the beads non-specifically, this dataset meets the criteria that the majority of proteins are expected to be equally abundant in all samples. We therefore believe, that for this dataset normalization in MaxQuant is a valid choice.</p><p>Although MaxLFQ normalization did not fail for the ‘nuclear proteome’ dataset, we agree that global normalization is not optimal in this case. We compared non-normalized and normalized data and found that global normalization in MaxQuant leads to a slight overall reduction of LFQ values in <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID samples (due to higher protein identifications and quantity) and an underestimation of protein abundance in these samples. We have therefore decided to re-analyze the MS data for this experiment (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplements 1-4). For our new analysis, we used the Normalyzer tool (Chawade, Alexandersson, and Levander, 2014) to determine an optimal normalization method, based on the assumption that the majority of proteins is not equal in all samples and on the performance of the commonly used normalization methods supported by the algorithm (see Materials and methods section subsection “Protein enrichment over time”, for more details). Using LOESS-R (a local normalization method), we see an expected increase of proteins enriched in the <sub>UBQ</sub>nucTbID dataset (632 proteins), and a slight decrease in enriched proteins in the <sub>FAMA</sub>nucTbID dataset (61 proteins lost, 4 proteins gained). FAMA nuclei specific proteins remained largely unchanged, with all three marker proteins included, as did the subcellular distribution of our nuclear proteins based on experimental and prediction data.</p><p>Overall, we believe that the new analysis reflects the data better. We would, however, like to point out that despite the shift in numbers of enriched proteins, the major findings and conclusions of the experiment remain unchanged.</p><p>To emphasize the importance of data normalization for PL experiments for our readers, we have included a sentence on data normalization in the Discussion (subsection “Considerations for a successful PL experiment”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Please describe the filtering process and methods in more detail. The filtering process (Figure 5 and Figure 6) is difficult to really follow and does rely on numerous factors involved with MS data processing (matching parameters, LFQ parameters). The work has been replicated (n=3) which does add higher levels of certainty in the final results – FAMA interaction candidates and a guard cell nuclear proteome.

It would be helpful in understanding this extensive filtereing if authors could provide the MaxQuant Search files such as 'experimentalDesign', 'parameters' for the reviewers (and include in the Pride data submission).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers point out, we observe a high number of proteins in our dataset, that were identified across all sample types, including the WT control (see Figure 5—figure supplements 2-3 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). These likely comprise proteins that bound to the beads non-specifically (sticky proteins and proteins too abundant to be washed off completely) and a small number of naturally biotinylated proteins. These proteins were identified in our first filtering step by comparing TbID samples with WT samples (not enriched in the TbID samples) and removed before further comparisons between TbID samples were made. It is not uncommon for AP-MS experiments that a large fraction of identified proteins binds to the beads, especially when a large amount of beads is used as in our experiments. Although these proteins are useful for MS data normalization, we hope to improve sample purity in future experiments.</p><p>To make our filtering process and the aims of each filtering step more accessible to the reader, we have added more detail to the description of the process in the Results section (subsection “Proximity labeling is superior to AP-MS for identification of candidate interactors of FAMA”). The filtering process and the applied statistical tests with cutoff values are also described in the figure legends of Figures 5 and 6 and a detailed description of the whole data analysis (including MS instrument and MS search settings) can be found in the Materials and methods sections.</p><p>The MaxQuant search output (containing the ‘parameters’ and ‘summary’ files, as well as all results files) had been included in the PRIDE data submission together with the RAW data files, but were unfortunately inaccessible to reviewers (see response to major point 4). To make it easier to follow our data filtering steps, we updated our PRIDE submissions to include our Perseus analysis files, which can be viewed and manipulated in Perseus (version 1.6.2.3).</p><p>Concerning the nuclear markers for young GCs: Although three proteins may seem to be a low number, we would like to point out that FAMA-stage young GCs are a rare cell type we still have very little information on. At the moment we do not know any other nuclear proteins specific for this cell type. This re-emphasizes the challenges of proteomics with rare cell types and the need for techniques such as PL to identify more proteins specific for (or highly enriched in) the nucleus of this, and other rare, cell types.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The extensive data filtering to generate a high confidence sets (especially with regard to FAMA interactors) would usually require validation of some of the new candidates. Have the authors conducted any preliminary validations of the new interactors? Even relatively preliminary data would strengthen their claims for this approach. This could be preliminary transient work e.g. co express FAMA-TurboId and Target:Myc, pull down with streptavidin and conduct a western blot with anti-Myc. This would ideally be transient targets rather than complex partners, as this is the articulated advantage of this method over e.g. AP-MS.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in total agreement that validation of candidates is important. We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion of an experiment that seems straightforward to do without involving stable transformation, but we feel that this experiment, that essentially uses the same proteins but at much higher levels in biologically irrelevant cells, may not be the ideal way to validate the results. In addition, with the publication of (Zhang et al., 2019), some of the concern about the ability of TurboID to detect interactions may have been addressed.</p><p>Nonetheless, we did a small-scale test as requested by the reviewer and also used an orthogonal method (Y2H) to test some of the interactions. The data are now presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 5 (subsection “Proximity labeling is superior to AP-MS for identification of candidate interactors of FAMA”, seventh paragraph; subsection “Suitability of TurboID and miniTurbo for application in plants and performance of TurboID in FAMA-complex identification and nuclear proteome analysis”, second paragraph and Materials and methods subsection “Cloning of FAMA interaction partner candidates for Y2H and PL assays in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>”; subsection “Evaluation of selected FAMA interaction partner candidates by Y2H and PL assays in <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>”). Briefly, in our Y2H, we looked for interaction of FAMA with four candidates recovered from the PL screen: SEUSS (SEU) and LUH (two parts of a co-repressor complex) and BZR1 and BIM1 (two TFs involved in BR signaling), as well as known positive (ICE1) and negative (MUTE) controls. There was clear interaction with BIM1 and SEU and weak interaction with LUH. To gain more insight into the FAMA-SEU-LUH interaction, we co-expressed FAMA-TbID or nuclear TbID with SEU and/or LUH in tobacco and tested for biotinylation of SEU and LUH. To label only close interactors we did not add exogenous biotin. Under these conditions, we could observe biotinylation of ICE1 (pos. control) and SEU, but not of LUH, supporting our hypothesis that SEU is a direct interaction partner of FAMA, while LUH might bind to FAMA via SEU.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The access to the raw MS data in PRIDE does not work. Both PRIDE login details resulted in no available data. I would guess data have been updated in the interim and this requires a new username / password to be issued for reviewers. Thus the robustness of the MS data matching employed by the authors could not be evaluated nor examine the quantitative process which is presumably available in a viewable data format.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very sorry that the reviewers did not have access to the PRIDE submission. We indeed uploaded additional data before submission, which changed the reviewer account, something we did not realize until receiving the reviewers’ comments. We have double checked that the access information is correct in the newly submitted version, and ask the editor and reviewer to let us know immediately if they have access problems so we can fix them.</p><p>We would like to point out that the current version of PRIDE does not allow full data submission for MaxQuant analysis because not all required files are generated by MaxQuant. Our submissions are therefore not in a graphically viewable format in the PRIDE repository. To allow data re-analysis and evaluation we have submitted the RAW files (for re-analysis in any software of choice), the MaxQuant output folder that contains the search summary and search result (to evaluate the data search and do data filtering with a software of choice), as well as our Perseus files containing the analysis path (for graphical visualization of the data and data filtering process in Perseus).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 5—figure supplement 2B: Why is replicate 1 is separated from replicate 2 and 3? It seems that separation by replicates is more significant than separation by genotypes. Is this due to how samples were processed? It was not totally clear from the method. Would be nice to have multi scatter plots as well to show correlation between samples.</p></disp-quote><p>As we pointed out in the figure legends to Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1, we have a relatively strong batch effect from sample preparation. Batch effects are not uncommon in mass spec analysis, especially when enrichment steps are involved in sample preparation (which is the case in our experiments), and can sometimes be the strongest separating factor. As this is designed to be a method useful for the community, we chose to be completely transparent about this issue. Due to the number of samples we were unable to process all samples at the same time (a situation others are likely to encounter). We therefore did sample prep in three batches, each of them containing one replicate of each sample type, to avoid introducing a bias from slightly different sample handling in different batches (described in Materials and methods subsection “Affinity purification of biotinylated proteins”).</p><p>Concerning the significance of separation, we would like to point out that PCA was done with the full dataset of ‘high confidence’ proteins (present in all replicates of at least one sample type) and the majority of proteins in this dataset (~ 90%) are not significantly enriched in any of the TbID samples. Nevertheless, we already see separation of WT and TbID samples in PC1. To better visualize the high similarity of all samples in the ‘FAMA interactome’ experiment we added a multi scatterplot also displaying the Pearson correlation between sample pairs as suggested by the reviewers (see Figure 5—figure supplement 3). We also added a multi scatterplot for the ‘nuclear proteome’ experiment (Figure 6—figure supplement 2), which shows much stronger differences of individual samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In my understanding Branon et al. named the new ligases as TurboID(TbID) and miniTurbo(mTb), and therefore authors should use same terms to avoid any confusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced TID with TbID, miniTID with mTb and miniTurboID with miniTurbo throughout the text, in all figures and tables.</p></body></sub-article></article>
