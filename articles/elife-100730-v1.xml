the beginning of developmental patterning. Here, we demonstrate that the molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2), a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family, is asymmetrically expressed in the late 2-cell stage of mouse embryos. The knockdown of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres prevented its progeny predominantly towards the inner cell mass (ICM) fate. In contrast, the overexpression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres did not induce the blastomere to differentiate towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, we demonstrated that HSPA2 interacted with CARM1 and its levels correlated with ICM-associated genes. Collectively, our results identify HSPA2 as a critical early regulator of the first cell-fate decision in mammalian 2-cell embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>inner cell mass</kwd><kwd>embryo</kwd><kwd>first cell-fate decision</kwd><kwd>HSPA2</kwd><kwd>CARM1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170817</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Keliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2023QNTD004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Keliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022JC006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Keliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>tsqn202211373</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Boyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Innovative research team of high-level local universities in Shanghai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SHSMU-ZLCX20210201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Keliang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022HWYQ-034</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Boyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007129</institution-id><institution>Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZR2021QC106</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Boyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HSPA2 as a critical early regulator of the first cell-fate decision in mammalian embryos.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The preimplantation development of mammalian embryos is a complex and orderly process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mu et al., 2022</xref>). The first cell-fate decision is a key event in the preimplantation development in mammalian embryos. Specifically, the first cell-fate decision occurs at the morula stage following embryonic compaction and results in the division of embryonic cells into two distinct lineages: the trophectoderm (TE) and the inner cell mass (ICM). The TE is a single layer surrounding the fluid-filled cavity known as the blastocoel that provides extraembryonic structures such as the placenta, whereas the ICM, which is attached to the inside of the TE, contains pluripotent cells that give rise to the fetus and extraembryonic tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cockburn and Rossant, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rossant and Tam, 2009</xref>). However, it remains an open question of how these cells shape the first cell-fate decision of preimplantation development, and when they begin to trigger the initial differentiation signals.</p><p>The asymmetry of the blastocyst may be traced back to the asymmetric nuclear abundance of coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) at the 4-cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</xref>). The heterogeneous activity of CARM1 leads to the differential methylation of H3 methylation of arginine 26 (H3R26me). More extensive methylation of H3R26me can result in a higher increase in the expression levels of ICM-specific genes (e.g. <italic>Pou5f1</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic>) and global chromatin accessibility, which direct their progeny into the ICM fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sotomayor-Lugo et al., 2024</xref>). Recent studies have further suggested that the asymmetry of blastomeres can even be traced back to the 2-cell stage. For example, a long non-coding RNA, <italic>Gm45001</italic> (<italic>LincGET</italic>), is known to be asymmetrically expressed in the nuclei of blastomeres in 2- and 4-cell embryos. Specifically, <italic>Gm45001</italic> and CARM1 are known to form a complex that promotes H3R26me and activates the expression of ICM genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, HMGA1, a member of the high mobility group (HMG) protein family, is also known to exhibit heterogeneity as early as the 2-cell stage and involves in cell fate differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Collectively, these studies suggest that molecular heterogeneity takes place in the early stage of embryonic development and is associated with cell fate differentiation.</p><p>Despite these findings, the specific factors that exhibit heterogeneity at the 2-cell stage and the mechanisms by which the cell fate and differentiation can be decided still require further investigation. The molecular chaperone heat shock protein A2 (HSPA2) is a member of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) family that is evolutionarily conserved in human and metazoan. It is originally identified in male germ cells and described as a testis-specific protein that is essential for spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gómez-Torres et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scieglinska and Krawczyk, 2015</xref>). The <italic>Hspa2</italic> gene is located on chromosome 14 (14q24.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and the aberrant expression of HSPA2 in testes was shown to induce primary spermatocytes to arrest in meiosis I and undergo apoptosis, thus leading to male infertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bonnycastle et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dix et al., 1996</xref>). HSPA2 is expressed in somatic tissues and during mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Murashov and Wolgemuth, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rupik et al., 2006</xref>), and high levels of HSPA2 expression play a critical role in the genesis and progression of carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Garg et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Garg et al., 2010b</xref>). However, the role of HSPA2 in lineage differentiation of embryonic cells is yet to be unveiled.</p><p>In this study, we separated blastomeres from the 4-cell stage and cultured to the morula stage, analyzed the gene expression pattern by using Smart-seq2 to identify differentially expressed genes. <italic>Hspa2</italic> was identified and was shown to be asymmetrically distributed in 2- to 4-cell blastomeres. The knockdown of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in one of the 2-cell blastomeres prevented its progeny predominantly towards the ICM fate. Furthermore, HSPA2 and CARM1 were found to form a protein complex and regulated ICM-specific gene expression. Collectively, these results suggest that <italic>Hspa2</italic> expression patterns can bias cell-fate in the mouse embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Hspa</italic>2 is asymmetrically expressed among late 2- and 4-cell blastomeres</title><p>In our previous study, we established a culture system that allows zygotes without their zona pellucida to develop in vitro until the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Song et al., 2022</xref>). Previous studies have mainly focused on gene heterogeneity in 4-cell stage mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goolam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</xref>). Here, in order to expand the heterogeneity among blastomeres and identify factors that may involve in cell lineage differentiation, single blastomeres from the mouse 4-cell embryo were separated and cultured to the morula stage. By using Smart-seq2 technology, we analyzed the gene expression pattern of the morulae, which developed from the 4-cell blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). <italic>Hspa2</italic> was identified by differential gene expression analysis and showed distinct mRNA levels among the four morulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, the level of <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA showed stronger positive correlation (<italic>R</italic>=0.624) in gene expression than random gene pairs (<italic>R</italic>=0.029), indicating that <italic>Nanog</italic> expression levels increased with the increase of <italic>Hspa2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). When the late 2-cell embryo was divided into single blastomeres and cultured to the morula stage, we obtained similar results that <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA distinctly distributed between the two morulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Next, we investigated the expression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> during preimplantation embryo development from meiosis II to the blastocyst stage. qRT-PCR analysis showed that <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA was stored maternally at the MII oocyte and decreased at the two-cell stage but remarkably increased from the 2-cell to the 4-cell stage, coinciding with zygotic genome activation (ZGA). There was a slight change in expression as embryos developed to the 8-cell and morula stages, and developed into blastocysts that had higher expression levels than the 2-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>Hspa2</italic> is asymmetrically expressed among mouse 2- and 4-cell blastomeres.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic overview.

Co-IP analysis showed that HSPA2 and CARM1 proteins interacted effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Moreover, we investigated whether HSPA2 could regulate H3R26me2 modification, a known event that occurs downstream of CARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Torres-Padilla et al., 2007</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that CARM1-mediated H3R26me2 levels were significantly reduced in the interference group at the 4-cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Previous studies demonstrated that molecular polarity and differential gene regulation by signaling pathways drive the first cell-fate decision in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hirate and Sasaki, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Johnson and Ziomek, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Korotkevich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>). The tracing of embryonic lineages from the 2-cell stage onwards by live embryo labeling demonstrated that the cellular heterogeneity is initiated early in the embryo, and thus was proposed as cellular heterogeneity hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Piotrowska and Zernicka-Goetz, 2001</xref>). H3R26me and its methyltransferase CARM1 exhibit asymmetric expression patterns in the 4-cell stage of mouse embryos and play an important role in regulating the first cell-fate decision. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2021</xref>). PRDM14 is also heterogeneously expressed in 4-cell stage mouse embryos and interacts with CARM1 to drive progenies towards pluripotent ICM fate by increasing the expression levels of H3R26me in 4-cell embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Burton et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the progress in our understanding of the mechanisms governing early cell fate decisions, many important questions still remain unanswered. We do not yet fully comprehend when the initial heterogeneities among cells arise and how are they translated into divergent patterns of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Singh et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although 2-cell blastomeres are generally considered to be totipotent, the previous reports showing that when 2-cell blastomeres are separated, in the majority of cases, only one of the two blastomeres develops into a mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Casser et al., 2017</xref>). In this study, we found that the expression levels of HSPA2 were symmetrically distributed between the two blastomeres at the early 2-cell stage, but showed heterogeneous distribution at the late 2-cell embryos. Interestingly, <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA also heterogeneous distribution at the late 2-cell and 4-cell embryos after microinjection of si-<italic>Hspa2</italic> in zygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). This indicates that the heterogeneity of HSPA2 at the late 2-cell embryo may be initiated concomitant with the zygotic genome activation (ZGA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). Alternatively, the asymmetry may be triggered by unequally distributed unknown factors that already existed in the early 2-cell embryos or the heterogeneous spatial distribution of maternal genes in the zygote.</p><p>The reduced expression of HSPA2 led to the reduced expression levels of ICM-marker genes at both the mRNA and protein levels. Interfering with HSPA2 expression in one blastomere of the 2-cell embryos reduced the contribution of that blastomere to ICM differentiation. Notably, the number of ICM and total cells in the blastocyst was significantly reduced when compared to the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and E</xref>). We observed that the GO enriched terms were also closely related to negative regulation of cell cycle, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle phase transition and regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). <italic>Hspa2</italic> knockdown via siRNA reduced cell proliferation and led to G1/S phase cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that knockdown of HSPA2 results in lower cell number in ICM by interfering with the cell cycle. Additionally, the lower cell number in ICM may also associated with failed cytokinesis and the generation of binucleated or polyploid cells. Interestingly, half of the ICM cells still formed with HSPA2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), possibly due to the incomplete knockdown achieved or the possibility that redundant pathways exist.</p><p>However, the overexpression of HSPA2 did neither adversely affect embryo development nor induce blastomere bias towards an ICM fate. It may be because that once the intracellular concentration of <italic>Hspa2</italic> reaches a threshold level, it was not able to control the target gene expression. Furthermore, we also found that HSPA2 interacted with CARM1, and reduced HSPA2 level, led to the reduced expression of CARM1, and thus reduced the levels of H3R26me2 modification at the 4-cell stage. Collectively, these results suggest that HSPA2 physically binds to CARM1 to activate ICM-specific gene expression through H3R26me2 modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>).</p><p>In fact, our RNA-seq results revealed that the DEGs at blastocyst stage with HSPA2 knocking down were also enriched in Wnt signaling pathway and Hippo signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), which are also reported to be involved in cell proliferation, cell polarity, and cell fate determination during embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nishioka et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morris et al., 2012</xref>). This indicates that several alternative mechanisms are compatible with the asymmetric hypothesis, including polarized cell division and differential gene regulation by signaling.</p><p>In summary, our findings provide an exciting step forward for the first time that the role of HSPA2 in governing the first cell-fate decision in the mouse embryo lineage allocation. It may be beneficial for achieving a better understanding of embryogenesis patterns and cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies</title><p>In this study, we utilized CDX2 (ab76541), NANOG (ab17338) and H3R26me2 (ab127095) antibodies from Abcam; a CARM1 (12,495 s) antibody from Cell Signaling Technology; SOX2 (11064–1-AP), GAPDH (10494–1-AP), CARM1 (55246–1-AP), HSPA2 (12797–1-AP) and ACTIN (66009–1-Ig) antibodies from Proteintech; and an OCT4 (sc-5279) antibody from Santa Cruz Biotech.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse embryo collection</title><p>Animal experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital for Reproductive Medicine affiliated to Shandong University.

Knocking down HSPA2 in zygotes, the authors describe lower chances of developing into blastocysts, which show a reduced number of inner cell mass cells. They find that HSPA2 mRNA and protein levels show some heterogeneity among blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and propose that HSPA2 could contribute to skewing their relative contribution to embryonic lineages. To test this, the authors try to reduce HSPA2 expression in one of the 2-cell stage blastomere and propose that it biases their contribution to towards extra-embryonic lineages. To explain this, the authors propose that HSPA2 would interact with CARM1, which controls chromatin accessibility around genes regulating differentiation into embryonic lineage.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The study offers simple and straightforward experiments with large sample sizes.</p><p>(2) Unlike most studies in the field, this research often relies on both mRNA and protein levels to analyse gene expression and differentiation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Image and statistical analyses are not well described.</p><p>(2) The functionality of the overexpression construct is not fully validated.</p><p>(3) Tracking of KD cells in embryos injected at the 2-cell stage with GFP is unclear.</p><p>(4) A key rationale of the study relies on measuring small differences in the levels of mRNA and proteins using semi-quantitative methods to compare blastomeres. As such, it is not possible to know whether those subtle differences are biologically meaningful. For example, the lowest HSPA2 level of the embryo with the highest level is much higher than the top cell from the embryo with the lowest level. What does this level mean then? Does this mean that some blastomeres grafted from strong embryos would systematically outcompete all other blastomeres from weaker embryos? That would be very surprising. I think the authors should be more careful and consider the lack of quantitative power of their approach before reaching firm conclusions. Although to be fair, the authors only follow a long trend of studies with the same intrinsic flaw of this approach.</p><p>(5) Some of the analyses on immunostaining do not take into account that this technique only allows for semi-quantitative measurements and comparisons.</p><p>a) Some of the microscopy images are shown with an incorrect look-up table.</p><p>b) Some of the schematics are incorrect and misleading.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100730.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Gao et al. use RNA-seq to identify Hspa2 as one of the earliest transcripts heterogeneously distributed between blastomeres. Functional studies are performed using siRNA knockdown showing Hspa2 may bias cells toward the ICM lineage via interaction with the known methyltransferase CARM1.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study tackles an important question regarding the origins of the first cell fate decision in the preimplantation embryo. It provides novelty in its identification of Hspa2 as a heterogeneous transcript in the early embryo and proposes a plausible mechanism showing interactions with Carm1. Multiple approaches are used to validate their functional studies (FISH, WB, development rates, proteomics). Given only 4 other transcripts/RNA have been identified at or before the 4-cell stage (LincGET, CARM1, PRDM14, HMGA1), this would be an important addition to our understanding of how TE vs ICM fate is established.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The RNA-seq results leading the authors to focus on Hspa2 are not included in the manuscript. This dataset would serve as an important resource but is neither included nor discussed.

Knocking down HSPA2 in zygotes, the authors describe lower chances of developing into blastocysts, which show a reduced number of inner cell mass cells. They find that HSPA2 mRNA and protein levels show some heterogeneity among blastomeres at the 4-cell stage and propose that HSPA2 could contribute to skewing their relative contribution to embryonic lineages. To test this, the authors try to reduce HSPA2 expression in one of the 2-cell stage blastomere and propose that it biases their contribution to towards extra-embryonic lineages. To explain this, the authors propose that HSPA2 would interact with CARM1, which controls chromatin accessibility around genes regulating differentiation into embryonic lineage.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The study offers simple and straightforward experiments with large sample sizes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kind recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Unlike most studies in the field, this research often relies on both mRNA and protein levels to analyses gene expression and differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kind recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Image and statistical analyses are not well described.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We redescribe the image and statistical analyses in our revised version (line 255-257).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The functionality of the overexpression construct is not validated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kind suggestion. We validate the functionality of the overexpression construct in our revised version (Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Tracking of KD cells in embryos injected at the 2-cell stage with GFP is unclear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kind suggestion. We randomly co-injected green fluorescent protein (Gfp) mRNA as a linage tracer with either Hspa2-siRNA or NC-FAM into one of the 2 -cell, and then monitored embryo development to the blastocyst stage (line 342-344).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) A key rationale of the study relies on measuring small differences in the levels of mRNA and proteins using semi-quantitative methods to compare blastomeres. As such, it is not possible to know whether those subtle differences are biologically meaningful. For example, the lowest HSPA2 level of the embryo with the highest level is much higher than the top cell from the embryo with the lowest level. What does this level mean then? Does this mean that some blastomeres grafted from strong embryos would systematically outcompete all other blastomeres from weaker embryos? That would be very surprising. I think the authors should be more careful and consider the lack of quantitative power of their approach before reaching firm conclusions. Although to be fair, the authors only follow a long trend of studies with the same intrinsic flaw of this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. Indeed, despite the approach drew on previous research (Zhou Cell 2018), we were clearly aware that this approach can only reflect relative comparisons. This means that the relative difference among the blastomeres from the same embryo were detected and compared. We did not compare the absolute levels of mRNA between different embryos. We also offered simple and straightforward experiments with large sample sizes to confirm this conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Some of the analyses on immunostaining do not take into account that this technique only allows for semi-quantitative measurements and comparisons.</p><p>a) Some of the microscopy images are shown with an incorrect look-up table.</p><p>b) Some of the schematics are incorrect and misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised microscopy images and schematics in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Gao et al. use RNA-seq to identify Hspa2 as one of the earliest transcripts heterogeneously distributed between blastomeres. Functional studies are performed using siRNA knockdown showing Hspa2 may bias cells toward the ICM lineage via interaction with the known methyltransferase CARM1.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study tackles an important question regarding the origins of the first cell fate decision in the preimplantation embryo. It provides novelty in its identification of Hspa2 as a heterogeneous transcript in the early embryo and proposes a plausible mechanism showing interactions with Carm1. Multiple approaches are used to validate their functional studies (FISH, WB, development rates, proteomics). Given only 4 other transcripts/RNA have been identified at or before the 4-cell stage (LincGET, CARM1, PRDM14, HMGA1), this would be an important addition to our understanding of how TE vs ICM fate is established.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your kind recognition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The RNA-seq results leading the authors to focus on Hspa2 are not included in the manuscript. This dataset would serve as an important resource but is neither included nor discussed. Nor is it mentioned whether Hspa2 was identified in prior RNA-seq embryos studies (for example Deng Science 2014).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. To identify genes that show a significantly high variability across blastomeres in the same embryo, we regressed out the embryo effect by established a new method, which will be published and uploaded to the database in the future. Thus, the RNA-seq results leading the we focus on Hspa2 are not included in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the functional studies are centered on Hspa2 knockdown at the zygote (1-cell) stage, which would largely target maternal transcript. Given the proposed mechanism relies on Hspa2 heterogeneity post-ZGA (late 2-cell stage), the knockdown studies don't necessarily test this and thus don't provide direct support to the authors' conclusions. The relevance of the study would be improved if the authors could show that zygotic knockdown leads to symmetric Hspa2 levels at the late 2-cell and/or 4-cell stage. It may be possible that zygotic knockdown leads to lower global Hspa2 levels, but that asymmetry is still generated at the 4-cell stage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We showed that the <italic>Hspa2</italic> levels at the late 2-cell and 4cell stage after zygotic knockdown in our revised version (Figure S1 G-H, line 450-452).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors show that Hspa2 knockdown at the 1-cell stage lowers total Carm1 levels at the 4-cell stage. However, it is unclear how total abundance within the embryo alters lineage specification within blastomeres. The authors go on to propose a plausible mechanism involving Hspa2 and Carm1 interaction, but do not discuss how expression levels may be involved.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. Previous research suggests that heterogeneous activity of the methyltransferase CARM1 results in differential methylation of histone H3R26 to modulate establishment of lineage specification (Zernicka-Goetz Cell 2018). Thus, we didn't discuss the total abundance within the embryo alters lineage specification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Major issue with analyses:</p><p>Image analysis needs to be much better explained than simply saying that ImageJ was used. Where are cells measured (at their equatorial plane? What is the size of the ROI?)? Ideally, the ROI and/or raw measurements should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We redescribe the Image analysis in our revised version (line 187-194).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What are the objective criteria determining whether a cell is counted as GFP positive, CDX2 positive, or OCT4 positive? This is very unclear and key to the interpretation of many experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We think that the cell containing fluorescence signals above background noise were counted positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Statistical analyses mention ANOVA in the methods but the student's t-test in the figure legend. Which is which? Most data are heavily normalized, which would unlikely fit the description for Student's t-test analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We redescribe the statistical analyses in our materials and methods (line 253-260).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5H describes a relative fluorescence intensity with control at 1. The legend describes a normalization to &quot;DNA&quot; (I guess the authors meant DAPI), which is unlikely to give 1. This suggests that additional normalization was done and is not described. Is that the case? Also, since the authors propose that HSPA2 would control Histone modification and chromatin packing, I do not think that using DAPI is an appropriate way of normalizing the fluorescence signal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We replaced DNA with DAPI in our revised version. Based on previous studies, we adopted DAPI as a normalized fluorescence signal (Zhou Cell 2018, Zernicka-Goetz Cell 2018).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1E shows data normalized to the lowest level while Figure 1H is normalized to the highest level. A consistent representation would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised the Figure 1H in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is Figure 1C showing a t-test between correlations?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, Figure 1C shows the t-test between correlation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Major issue with the interpretation of semi-quantitative methods and measurements:</p><p>qPCR, WB, immunostaining are all semi-quantitative methods that require some kind of normalization due to non-linear bias in the way the molecules are picked up. Such normalization makes it difficult to know whether a detectable difference is meaningful biologically speaking i.e. if a difference of 1 CT between blastomeres can be detected after qPCR, is it meaningful? If that were the case, then embryos with lower CT than others (Figure 1D) would not be able to develop into blastocyst, like siRNA injected embryos, or grafting a blastomere with a high CT onto an embryo with low CT would lead to the systematic differentiation of these strong blastomeres into ICM.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. The CT values represent the relative mRNA levels of <italic>Hspa2</italic> between blastomeres, and the higher CT value represents the lower expression of <italic>Hspa2</italic> at mRNA level. Figure 1D shows the <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA levels between blastomeres. The blastomere with lowlevel expression of the <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA is not bias an ICM fates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The same goes for fluorescence analyses (Figure 1F). Can the authors also provide the measurements for DAPI as they did for HSPA2? I am sure that with enough measurements, DAPI is variable enough to give a statistical difference among blastomeres with questionable biological meaning.</p><p>I think the reasoning used here (unfortunately following the reasoning that has been used in a series of studies by other groups) of ranking blastomeres after semi-quantitative measurement is fundamentally flawed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. The DAPI was determined by the maximal area using a custom Python script. Based on previous studies, we adopted DAPI as a normalized fluorescence signal (Zhou Cell 2018). This approach is to normalize embryo-to-embryo variance from the technical reason.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Major issue with overexpression experiment:</p><p>While the siRNA experiment is partially validated by qPCR and WB measurements of HSPA2 after KD, the overexpression experiment is not. Do the authors have any evidence that the construct they use is produced into protein and functional? Can the authors check by WB? Can the authors rescue the siRNA with their overexpression?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We verified the overexpression experiment by WB in in our revised version (Figure S3, line 360-361). Considering that siRNA degrades mRNA and prevents the mRNA translation process, we did not co-inject the siRNA with their overexpression.</p><p>The lack of effect of HSPA2 overexpression on blastocyst formation is difficult to reconcile with the interpretation from the authors that levels of HSPA2 bias lineages.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors tried lower concentrations? Have the authors tried FISH on their half-injected 2cell embryos? Of course, if the antibody against HSPA2 would work with immunostaining, that would be ideal.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We chose the concentrations for our study based on previous research (Zernicka-Goetz Cell 2016). To verified Hspa2 was successfully inject into one blastomere at the 2-cell stage, we observed green fluorescence after co-injected GFP mRNA with either siRNA or NC-FAM into one blastomere of the two-cell embryos. Thus, we didn't try FISH on half-injected 2-cell embryos. We tried to perform immunostaining experiments with various HSPA2 antibodies (Proteintech: 12797-1-AP, Abcam: ab108416) and no good results were achieved.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100730-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Major issue with tracking of injected cells:</p><p>It is unclear what counts as a GFP-positive cell. In Figure 3D, most cells appear to have the same level of GFP.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. The cell containing green fluorescence signals above background noise were counted GFP-positive in Figure 3D. Most cells seem to have the same level of GFP because they are daughter cells of the blastomeres injected with GFP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the images of GFP-expressing cells used to track the control of KD cells shown in Figure 3A, it seems that the control embryos have mostly GFP cells in the ICM. Is that the case, or just a bad example?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. The green fluorescent signals in Figure 3A represented OCT4 protein, an ICM marker.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors do FISH against HSPA2 and visualize their GFP cells to validate the heterogeneous expression in situ?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We have verified the heterogeneous expression of HSPA2 in Figure1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Issue with fluorescent images:</p><p>Many images are shown with inappropriate look-up tables with saturated DAPI, OCT4, CDX2, and FISH. This raises the doubt that analyses were made on saturated images, which would be incorrect.</p></disp-quote><p>The LUT of Figure 5H should be adjusted similarly between the control and siRNA.</p><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised some images which showed inappropriate lookup tables in our revised version. The LUT of Figure 5H had been adjusted between the control and siRNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Issue with schematics:</p><p>Schematics of blastomere isolation grown into blastocyst-like structures are misleading since the final blastocyst-like structure should not have a zona pellucida and should have fewer cells than regular blastocysts.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised schematics of blastomere grown into morula in our revised version (Figure 1A and Figure S1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The summary schematics in the final figure should not state HSPA2 -/- since experiments in the study did not use KO but KD.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised the summary schematics in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The blastocysts are the same sizes as the cleavage stage or morula embryos which implies that cells lose volume to the lumen, which is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised the schematics in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Issue with data presentation:</p><p>In the tables within the figures, the number of decimals given should be the same for the mean and SE (one decimal should be more than enough).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We revised the figure 2H in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparison of cell number and distribution within embryos (e.g. Figure 2B) would be best represented by a correlation analysis of TE vs ICM cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We add the figure of a correlation analysis of TE vs ICM cells in our revised version (Figure 3B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The docking simulations are described in the main text as &quot;experiments&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We redescribed the docking simulations in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Issue with data interpretation:</p><p>The reduced number of ICM cells is interpreted as a slowed-down cell cycle. This could also be explained by failed cytokinesis and the generation of binucleated or polyploid cells. Have the authors checked for that? For example, by looking at their DAPI staining.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. Our RNA-seq results revealed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at blastocyst stage with HSPA2 knocking down are closely related to negative regulation of cell cycle, G1/S transition of mitotic cell cycle, mitotic cell cycle phase transition and regulation of mitotic cell cycle phase transition. Additionally, the previous study demonstrated that knockdown of HSPA2 reduced cell proliferation and led to G1/S phase cell cycle arrest (Hu Ann Transl Med 2019). Additionally, the lower cell number in ICM may also associated with failed cytokinesis and the generation of binucleated or polyploid cells. Thus, we guessed that HSPA2 has a role in ICM lineage establishment, although half of the ICM cells were able to survive with HSPA2 deficiency (line 463-472).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is unclear to me why reduced ICM should lead to fewer blastocysts. Blastocysts should be able to form as long as their TE is fine. In Figure 2G, embryos seem to be cultured in close proximity, which is fine if they are healthy but not if some of the embryos start dying and releasing toxic compounds (e.g. ROS). Have the authors tried removing the dying KD embryos to see if the development of the remaining embryos would improve?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We think HSPA2 may affect blastocyst development by affecting other signaling pathways. And, the GO enriched terms was closely related to blastocyst development (Figure 2E). There was no significant difference in morula formation rate between <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD group and NC group, thus the assumption that the toxic compounds released by some of the embryos that lead to downregulation of blastocyst rate may not be correct. Indeed, the rate of blastocyst formation in <italic>Hspa2</italic>-KD embryos was reduced significantly lower when few embryos was cultured separately. In addition, we discussed the possibility that the lower cell number in ICM may also associated with failed cytokinesis and the generation of binucleated or polyploid cells.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100730-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>One of the significant findings in the paper is the discovery portion where Hspa2 is identified as a heterogeneous transcript.

For example:</p><p>(1) The paragraph in the introduction (Lines 56-68) should be moved to the discussion as the Hspa2 reveal should be in section 3.1, not prior to the RNA-seq results presented in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We think it is more logical that HSPA2 needs to be introduced in the introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Add text at the beginning of Section 3.1 to describe the rationale and results for the RNAseq. It would help the readers if the authors clearly stated why they chose the 4-cell stage.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment.

We moved Figure S1C to the main figure in our revised version (line 286-291).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 1C: the correlation between Hspa2 and ICM markers would be strengthened if additional transcripts were used (Oct4, Sox2, Sox21). The graph in 1C would also be more informative if represented as a scatter plot with correlation coefficients (Nanog log2TPM vs Hspa2 log2TPM), rather than bar graphs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We chose Nanog as the correlation between Hspa2 and Nanog, a ICM markers, was showing the strongest correlation in result. And, the figure 1C shows the stronger positive correlation between <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Hspa2</italic> in gene expression than random gene pairs (n=100, n means the number of random gene pairs).

The graph axes had revised in our revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Line 278: the results in Figure S1C would benefit from more text regarding expression patterns throughout development. The maternal transcript appears to have a sharp downregulation by the early 2-cell stage, and is then upregulated coinciding with ZGA.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment.

We converted the table in 2H to a bar graph.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Blast rates are represented with too many significant digits (Figures 2H, 4B). They should only be reported to the closest ones given the unit of measure (number of blasts divided by number of zygotes). For instance, a blast rate of 81.63 {plus minus} 2.000 reflects excessive precision that is not measured in the data, it should rather read 82 {plus minus} 2%.

For the overexpression experiment, we first chose to inject <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA at the zygote stage and found that the overexpression of Hspa2 does not induce blastomere cells to bias an ICM fate. The qRT-PCR results indicated that the expression level of <italic>Hspa2</italic> in overexpression group was significantly increased compared with normal group at 4cell and blastocyst stage (Figure 4C, 4D). In addition, there is no guarantee that an equal amount of <italic>Hspa2</italic> mRNA be injected into each blastomere in 2-cell stage.

Please add further details and discussion in the results and discussion sections.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment.

For instance, ICM cells may still form due to the incomplete knockdown achieved or the possibility that redundant pathways exist.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. We redescribe the relevant statement in our revised version (line 468-473).</p></disp-quote><p>The 5th paragraph of the discussion seems incomplete. The authors point out a possible link between Hspa2 and Hippo and Wnt signaling pathways, but need to expand their discussion on how this may act as an additional mechanism incorporating Hspa2 with lineage segregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thanks for your advisable comment.

All figure legends added statistical test details in statistical analysis.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>In all graphs, individual blastomere expression levels should be represented as boxwhisker/bar/scatter/violin plots since the comparison is groups rather than time points (i.e. symbols should not be connected with a line in Figures 1B, 1D, 1F-G, 1I, S1D, S1F).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment. Each colored line represents a single cell, and the dots of the same color represent the blastomere of the same cell. Thus, we use a line representation individual blastomere.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For all fluorescent images, having two representative images may be confusing for the reader. Figures may be improved by just including one representative image for each stage/treatment (Figures 1F, 1I, S1F, 3A, 3D, 4E, 4G).</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your advisable comment.
