Our measurements showed that the fly head cuticle has surprisingly high transmission at wavelengths &gt;900nm, and the difficulty of through-cuticle imaging is due to the air sacs and/or fat tissue underneath the head cuticle. By compressing or removing the air sacs, we performed multiphoton imaging of the fly brain through the intact cuticle. Our anatomical and functional imaging results show that 2- and 3-photon imaging are comparable in superficial regions such as the mushroom body, but 3-photon imaging is superior in deeper regions such as the central complex and beyond. We further demonstrated 2-photon through-cuticle functional imaging of odor-evoked calcium responses from the mushroom body γ-lobes in behaving flies short term and long term. The through-cuticle imaging method developed here extends the time limits of in vivo imaging in flies and opens new ways to capture neural structure and activity from the fly brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiphoton imaging</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-1707312</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yapici</surname><given-names>Nilay</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM133698</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yapici</surname><given-names>Nilay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Scholars Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yapici</surname><given-names>Nilay</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

They navigate their environment via coordinated movements and learn and remember the relative values of sensory stimuli around them to maximize their fitness and survival. At each instant in time, an animal must evaluate external sensory information and its current behavioral state to decide what to do next (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lütcke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tinbergen, 1969</xref>). A major technological challenge to revealing how the brain encodes behavioral states in real-time is that even the simplest neural computation involves interactions across the nervous system at various time scales, while our tools for assessing neural activity are restricted in time and space because of the currently available imaging sensors, methods, and preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lerner et al., 2016</xref>). Optical methods remain the most established and fruitful path for revealing population dynamics in neural circuits at long time scales (ranging from minutes to hours) by providing high temporal and spatial resolution measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ji et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The fly, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, offers an ideal experimental system to investigate neural correlates of behavioral states and decisions because of its compact nervous system and diverse state-dependent behaviors that it executes in response to sensory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barron et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dickson, 2008</xref>). To understand how molecularly defined neural circuits evaluate sensory information in different behavioral states, it is critical to capture the activity of populations of neurons over long time scales as flies are changing their physiological needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Simpson and Looger, 2018</xref>). These functional imaging experiments require imaging preparations, which should allow chronic neural activity imaging for at least 12 hr. Current methods used in fly optical physiology require the fly head cuticle, trachea, and fat body to be removed by microsurgery to provide optical access to the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Minocci et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seelig et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinha et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). These preparations are limited in imaging duration because, after some time, the brain tissue starts to degenerate due to damaged circulation resulting from the cuticle removal surgery. For example, with current imaging preparations, fly olfactory neurons show reliable Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses for four to five hours after surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). An imaging method in which the head cuticle is intact, thereby eliminating the need for traumatic head surgery before functional imaging, is essential for advancing fly neuroscience research in the direction of chronic recordings of neural activity during ongoing behaviors. This includes being able to image the same fly brain across multiple days. In mice, multiday imaging experiments are achieved by implanting a cranial window following removal of part of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hefendehl et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>). Similar imaging preparations have been developed for flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Grover et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sinha et al., 2013</xref>). However, because imaging window implantation requires a tedious surgery with low success rates and complications that occur afterwards, these methods are not commonly used. A recent development in multiphoton imaging is the use of long-wavelength lasers in 3-photon (3P) microscopy which improves signal-to-background ratio (SBR) by several orders of magnitude compared to current 2-photon (2P) imaging methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wang et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2018b</xref>). While 3P microscopy with 1700 nm excitation of red fluorophores and adaptive optics has shown promising results in imaging the fly brain through the cuticle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tao et al., 2017</xref>), it is not clear if the technique is widely applicable to common blue and green fluorophores with much shorter excitation wavelengths (e.g. 1320 nm).</p><p>Here, we developed a method for imaging fly neural structure and activity through the intact head cuticle using both 2P and 3P microscopy. We first measured the ballistic and total optical transmission through the dorsal fly head cuticle and surprisingly found that the head cuticle has high transmission at the wavelengths that are used to excite green fluorophores in 2P and 3P microscopy (~920 nm and ~1320 nm, respectively). We showed that the tissue that interferes with the laser light and limits imaging through the cuticle into the brain is not the head cuticle but the air sacs and the tissue underneath the cuticle. Next, we developed fly preparations by either compressing the air sacs or removing them from the imaging window, allowing through-cuticle imaging of the fly brain. Using these imaging preparations, we performed deep, high spatial resolution imaging of the fly brain and determined the attenuation length for imaging through the cuticle with 2P (920 nm) and 3P (1320 nm) excitation and compared our results to cuticle-removed preparations. Our measurements showed that 2P and 3P excitation performed similarly in shallow regions (i.e. in the mushroom body) of the fly brain, but 3P excitation at 1320 nm was superior for imaging neural activity and anatomical features in deeper brain structures (i.e. in the central complex). Furthermore, using 2P and 3P excitation, we recorded food odor-evoked neural responses from the Kenyon cells comprising the mushroom body γ-lobes using a genetically encoded Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator, GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). In our simultaneous 2P and 3P functional imaging experiments, we found no differences between 2P and 3P excitation, while recording odor-evoked responses from the mushroom body γ-lobes through the cuticle. To demonstrate that our cuticle-intact imaging method can be used for recording neural activity in behaving flies, we used 2P excitation and captured odor-evoked neural responses from mushroom body γ-lobes in flies walking on an air-suspended spherical treadmill. Finally, we demonstrated long-term functional imaging by reliably capturing odor-evoked neural responses from γ-lobes with 2P excitation for 12 consecutive hours. The cuticle-intact imaging method developed here allows multiphoton imaging of the fly brain through the head cuticle opening new ways to capture neural structure and activity from the fly brain at long time scales and potentially through the entire lifespan of flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fly head cuticle transmits long-wavelength light with high efficiency</title><p>To develop a cuticle-intact imaging method using multiphoton microscopy, we first measured light transmission at different wavelengths through the fly head cuticle. Previous experiments showed that, within the wavelength range of 350–1000 nm, the relative transmission of the dorsal head cuticle of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> improves with increasing wavelengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). However, the absolute transmission, which is critical for assessing the practicality of through-cuticle imaging, was not reported. In our experiments, we quantified both the total and ballistic transmission of infrared (IR) laser lights through the cuticle using the setup from our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mok et al., 2021</xref>). Dissected head cuticle samples were mounted between two glass coverslips and placed in the beam path between the laser source and the photodetector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The total and ballistic transmission through the cuticle samples were measured using a custom-built system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For ballistic transmission, light from a single-mode fiber was magnified and focused on the cuticle with a ~25 µm spot size. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> illustrates the light path of ballistic transmission experiments. The sample stage was translated to obtain measurements at different locations on the head cuticle. Ballistic transmission through the cuticle was measured at seven different wavelengths (852 nm, 911 nm, 980 nm, 1056 nm, 1300 nm, 1552 nm, 1624 nm) that match the excitation wavelengths for typical 2P and 3P imaging. We found that for all the IR wavelengths tested, the ballistic transmission through the cuticle was high, reaching &gt;90% at 1300 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Since fluorescence signal within the focal volume in 2P and 3P microscopy is mostly generated by the ballistic photons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Horton et al., 2013</xref>), our results showed that ballistic photon attenuation by the fly cuticle does not limit multiphoton imaging through the intact cuticle.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ballistic and total optical transmission of the fly head cuticle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the cuticle preparation.

For these measurements, laser light from a single mode fiber was magnified and focused on the cuticle sample with a ~50 µm spot size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mok et al., 2021</xref>). An integrating sphere (IS) was placed immediately after the cuticle to measure the total transmission. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> illustrates the light path of total transmission experiments. Total transmission through the cuticle was measured at nine different wavelengths (514 nm, 630 nm, 852 nm, 911 nm, 980 nm, 1056 nm, 1300 nm, 1552 nm, 1624 nm). The shorter wavelengths of 514 nm and 630 nm were chosen to match the typical fluorescence emission wavelengths of green and red fluorophores. Similar to the ballistic transmission experiments, we found that the total transmission generally increased with wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>), and the total transmission for both the green and red wavelengths was sufficiently high ( &gt;60%) for practical epi-fluorescence imaging using 2P or 3P excitation. We also scanned the cuticle with a motorized stage in the setup at selected wavelengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and H</xref>), and these spatially resolved transmission maps confirmed that there are only a few localized regions at the periphery of the cuticle with low transmission. Our results demonstrated that absorption and scattering of long-wavelength light by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head cuticle is small, and cuticle-intact in vivo imaging of green (e.g. green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GCaMP) and red fluorophores (e.g. red fluorescent protein (RFP), and RCaMP) through the intact cuticle is possible in adult flies using 2P or 3P excitation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Through-cuticle multiphoton imaging of the fly brain</title><p>Based on our cuticle transmission results, we developed a cuticle-intact imaging method where we either used head compression to minimize the volume of the air sacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) or removed them completely from the head capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). Using our new fly preparations, we imaged the fly brain through the cuticle with no head compression, semi compression, or full compression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>). We expressed membrane-targeted GFP (CD8-GFP) selectively in mushroom body Kenyon cells and scanned the fly brain through the cuticle using 2P and 3P excitation at 920 nm and 1320 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). Kenyon cells are the primary intrinsic neurons in the insect mushroom body.

We further quantified and compared the laser power required to obtain the same fluorescence signal of 0.1 photon per laser pulse.

We imaged the entire fly brain using the cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed imaging preparations with 2P and 3P. As expected, electrical stimulation generated a neural response in all the region of interests (ROIs) recorded across different depths of the fly brain. 3P cuticle-removed preparation allowed us to image down to ~250 µm deep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), while the depth limit for 3P cuticle-intact imaging was ~120 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

These results suggested that the presence of the cuticle and the underlying tissue decreases 2P and 3P functional imaging depth in the brain by ~2× and reduces dF/F<sub>o</sub>.

By quantitatively measuring the optical properties of the fly cuticle at wavelengths that correspond to 2P and 3P imaging, we discovered that fly cuticle transmits long wavelength light with surprisingly high efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found that it is not the absorption by the cuticle but rather the opacity of the air sacs and the tissues located between the head cuticle and the brain that limit the penetration depth of multiphoton imaging (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). By compressing the fly head using a glass coverslip, we reduced the volume of the air sacs between the cuticle and the brain, which increases the transmission of laser light and therefore allows high resolution imaging of the fly brain through the intact cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

These experiments require long-term imaging methods to record neural activity in vivo. The through-cuticle imaging method developed here significantly extends the time frame of current in vivo imaging preparations used for anatomical and functional studies in fly neuroscience. Our imaging method will allow researchers to capture the activity of neural populations during changing behavioral states; facilitate decoding of neural plasticity during memory formation; and might permit observation of changes in brain structures during development and aging. Our first demonstration of long-term functional imaging of the fly brain captures food odor responses from mushroom body γ-lobes for up to 12 hr continuously. Our results suggest that odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses did not change during the repeated odor stimulation. Even longer imaging time is possible by feeding flies under the microscope. We performed 2P imaging for demonstrating the possibility of long-term recording of neural activity because conventional 2P microscopy has adequate penetration depth for imaging the behavioral responses within the mushroom body, and 2P microscopy is widely used by the fly neuroscience community. On the other hand, our deep functional imaging data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) showed that combination of our cuticle-intact fly preparation and 3P imaging may provide the exciting possibility of long-term imaging in deeper regions of the fly brain such as the central complex. We note that the success rate of chronic imaging experiments was ~50% because of the drift in the axial position of the brain when imaging for long periods of time.

The dissected cuticle was sandwiched between two #1 coverslips (VWR #1 16004–094) with ~10 µL of UV curable resin (Bondic UV glue #SK8024) to avoid dehydration of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Measurements from each dissected cuticle was done within a day. The first several measurements were repeated at the end of all measurements to ensure that dehydration or protein degradation, which may affect the optical properties of the tissue, did not happen as the experiment progressed. The total transmission and ballistic transmission of cuticle samples were measured using a custom-built device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For ballistic transmission experiments, light from a single-mode fiber was magnified and focused on the cuticle with a ~25 µm spot size. We assume that collimated light passes through the sample since the Rayleigh range for a 25 µm (1/e<sup>2</sup>) focus spot is approximately 0.8–1.3 mm in water (refractive index 1.33) for wavelengths between 852 nm and 1624 nm, which is much larger than the thickness of the entire coverslip sandwich preparation ( &lt;400 µm). The transmitted light from the cuticle was then coupled to another single-mode fiber with identical focusing optics and detected with a power meter (S146C, Thorlabs). Such a confocal setup ensures that only the ballistic transmission is measured. The incident power is ~10 mW on the cuticle for each measurement. An InGaAs camera (WiDy SWIR 640 U-S, NiT) and a CMOS camera (DCC1645C, Thorlabs) were used to image the sample and incident beam to ensure that the incident light spot is always on the cuticle and to avoid the dark pigments (usually at the edge of the cuticle), ocelli, and possible cracks introduced during dissection.

Low melting agarose (GeneMate #E-3126–25) with 0.5 M NaCl (Sigma #S7653-250G) was used to make an electrical connection between the wires and the fly, making sure the electrical path runs through the body.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7-3"><title>Electrical stimulation and imaging</title><p>Both the cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed flies were imaged with 2P and 3P excitation, taking images at different depths throughout the brain. For electrical stimulation the flies were stimulated for 1 s at 5 V and imaged at various depths to see a consistent GCaMP signal increase. 3P activity was taken with an FOV of 200 × 100 µm with pixel count of 256 × 128. The frame rate was 6.5 Hz. Every five frames were averaged to achieve an effective frame rate of 1.3 Hz. 2P activity was taken with an FOV of 200 × 100 µm with pixel count of 256 × 128. The frame rate is 113 Hz. Every 100 frames are averaged to achieve an effective frame rate of 1.1 Hz. ROIs were generated by manual segmentation. The baselines of the activity traces (F0) for each ROIs were determined using a rolling average of 4 s over the trace after excluding data points during electric stimulation. The activity traces (F) were normalized according to the formula (F − F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub>. Three stimulations were done for each depth.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Olfactory imaging conditions and preparation of flies used in imaging experiments</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Simultaneous 2P/3P functional imaging</title><p>Flies were food deprived for 16–24 hr in vials with a wet Kim wipe.

Clean room air was pumped (Active Aqua Air Pump, 4 Outlets, 6 W, 15 L/min) into the olfactometer, and the flow rate was regulated by a mass flow controller (Aalborg GFC17). Two Arduino controlled 3-way solenoid valves (3-Way Ported Style with Circuit Board Mounts, LFAA0503110H) controlled air flow. One valve delivered the odorized airstream either to an exhaust outlet or to the main air channel, while another valve directed air flow either to the stimulus or control channel. The stimulus channel contained a 50 ml glass vial containing undiluted apple cider vinegar (volume = 10 ml) (Wegmans), while the control channel contained a 50 ml glass vial containing mineral oil (volume = 10 ml). Flies were placed approximately 1 cm from a clear PVC output tube (OD = 1.3 mm, ID = 0.84 mm), which passed an air stream to the antennae (~1L/min). The odor stimulus latency was calculated before the experiments using a photo ionization detector (PID) (Aurora Scientific). We sampled odor delivery using the PID every 20 ms and found average latency to peak odor amplitude was &lt;100 ms across 34 measurements. Flies were stimulated with air (50 s), before and after the odor stimulus (odor + air, 3 s). Same stimulus scheme was repeated three times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Odor delivery during spherical treadmill and chronic imaging</title><p>An air supported spherical treadmill setup was used to record fly walking behavior during multiphoton imaging. Male flies at 5–6 days post eclosion were anesthetized on ice for about 2 min and mounted to a coverslip with semicompression as described in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>. The cover slip was glued to a custom 3D-printed holder with an internal airway to deliver airflow along the underside of the coverslip directly onto the antenna without interfering with the air supported ball. The air duct was positioned 90 degrees to the right of the fly about 1 cm away. Clean room air was pumped (Hygger B07Y8CHXTL) into a mass flow meter set at 1 L/min (Aalborg GFC17). The regulated airflow was directed through an Arduino controlled three-way solenoid pinch valve (Masterflex UX-98302–42) using 1/16” ID tubing. The valve directed the airflow either through 50 ml glass vile containing 10 ml of undiluted apple cider vinegar for the stimulus, or through a 50 ml glass vile containing 10 ml of mineral oil for the control. The latency from stimulus signal from the Arduino to odor molecules arriving at the fly’s antenna was measured using a photo-ionization detector (Aurora Scientific) prior to the experiments and found to be &lt;200 ms to peak stimulus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Fly behavior during olfactory stimulation coupled with 2P/3P imaging</title><p>The spherical treadmill was manufactured by custom milling with 6061 aluminum alloy. The treadmill has a concave surface at the end for placing the ball, which is supported by airflow. We fabricated foam balls (Last-A-Foam FR-7110, General Plastics, Burlington Way, WA USA) that are 10 mm in diameter using a ball-shaped file. We drew random patterns with black ink on the foam balls to provide a high-contrast surface for the ball tracking analysis. Fly behavior was videotaped from the side to capture any movement by a CCD camera (DCC1545M, Thorlabs) equipped with a machine vision camera lens (MVL6 × 12 Z, Thorlabs) and 950 nm long pass filter (FELH0950, Thorlabs). The acquisition frame rate for video recording was set to 8 Hz under IR light illumination at 970 nm (M970L4, Thorlabs). The stimulus signal from the Arduino is captured by NI-6009 (National Instrument) using a custom script written in MATLAB 2020b (Mathworks) to synchronize with the behavior video in data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Male courtship assay</title><p>5–6 days of wild-type virgin female and male flies were collected right after eclosion and aged at 25°C for ~5 days. On the day of the courtship assay, control group males were placed on ice for 1–5 min, then placed in the imaging chamber without being head compressed or head fixed. They were allowed to recover for 5 hr at 25°C before getting tested in the courtship assay. Experimental group flies went through the entire head-compression and head-fixing procedure described in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>. These flies were removed from the imaging chamber after being head fixed and allowed to recover for 5 hr at 25°C before getting tested in the courtship assay. To quantify male courtship behavior, male and female flies were aspirated into a 1 cm courtship chamber and allowed to interact for 30 min. Courtship assays were recorded using a camera (FLIR Blackfly, BFS-U3-31S4M-C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry for brain tissue damage assessment</title><p>To investigate laser-induced stress in the fly brain, we exposed 4–6 days old male flies (MB &gt; UAS GFP) to 2P laser at 920 nm with 15 mW power or to a 3P laser at 1320 nm with 15 mW power. Flies were prepared using the medium compression preparation described previously. Control flies were prepared the same way and kept in the dark at room temperature for the duration of the experimental procedure. Laser scanning was done in the same depth as the MB γ-lobes. Each scan lasted for 6 min. Flies were rested for 6 min until the next imaging session. Each fly was exposed to four imaging sessions. Once the experiment was completed, fly brains were dissected and stained with the HSP70 antibody. For the positive control group, flies were exposed to 30°C for 10 min in an incubator to induce HSP70 expression. For the negative control group, flies were kept at room temperature. Brains from each experimental and control groups were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20–30 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Tissues were washed three to four times over 1 hr in Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, calcium- and magnesium-free; Lonza BioWhittaker #17-517Q) containing 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBT, Phosphate-buffered saline + Triton) at room temperature. Samples were blocked in 5% normal goat serum in PBT (NGS-PBT) for 1 hr and then incubated with primary antibodies diluted in NGS-PBT for 24 hr at 4°C. Primary antibodies used were anti-GFP (Torrey Pines, TP40, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1000), anti-BRP (DSHB, nc82, mouse monoclonal, 1:20), and anti-HSP70 (Sigma, SAB5200204, rat monoclonal, 1:200). The next day, samples were washed five to six times over 2 hr in PBT at room temperature and incubated with secondary antibodies (invitrogen) diluted in NGS-PBT for 24 hr at 4°C. On the third day, samples were washed four to six times over 2 hr in PBT at room temperature and mounted with VECTASHIELD Mounting Media (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA, USA) using glass slides between two bridge glass coverslips. The samples were covered by a glass coverslip on top and sealed using clear nail polish. Images were acquired at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution at ~1.7 μm intervals using an upright Zeiss LSM 880 laser scanning confocal microscope and Zeiss digital image processing software ZEN. The power, pinhole size and gain values were kept the same for all imaged brains during confocal microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Image processing and data analysis</title><sec id="s4-13-1"><title>Resolution measurements</title><p>We measured the lateral or axial brightness distribution of small features within the fly brains using either the GFP fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) or the THG signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and G</xref>).

It is valuable to be able to record from flies with minimal surgery. This means that the fly is less stressed, that the tissue is more healthy, and the recordings can go on for longer. The authors demonstrate optical recordings of odor responses through the cuticle, but not at the single-cell resolution that many readers would like. They also illustrate better imaging at greater depth using 3-photon illumination. The approach is potentially very useful, and the case for it would be even stronger were there a more complete comparison with conventional recordings with the cuticle removed.</p><p>1.

They achieve this by compression of air sacs to provide optical access to the brain while keeping the cuticle intact. Their results show that the through-cuticle preparation is compatible with 2- and 3-photon structural and functional imaging, with 3-photon imaging providing higher anatomic resolution in deeper brain regions. Through 2-photon calcium imaging of the mushroom body γ lobes, the authors demonstrate that odor-evoked responses can be studied short-term and long-term in behaving flies. The demonstration of the feasibility of functional imaging without surgery and of chronic imaging are true breakthroughs that will allow novel investigations of how the brain senses and interprets information over time to guide behavior. As we will describe in our feedback to the authors, additional experiments or analyses will allow the authors to demonstrate the strengths and limits of head compression and 3-photon imaging vis-a-vis different kinds of neurons and parts of the brain.</p><p>Major points to be addressed through new experiments:</p><p>1– The authors show that 3-photon imaging generates sharper anatomic pictures of neurons deep in the brain than does 2-photon imaging, but for functional imaging, only compare 3p versus 2p in a superficial structure (mushroom body γ lobes, Figure 4H). As the paper focuses on the utility of these techniques for functional imaging, the authors should provide data on the performance of 2- versus 3-photon functional imaging in a deeper brain region. It would also be nice to provide more detail of the spatial resolution of 3p in Figure 4, as only temporal traces are shown.</p><p>2 – The authors demonstrate that head compression allows chronic functional imaging through the cuticle, without surgery, in a single test case--the mushroom body axonal γ lobes. This is a great advance, but as the authors know, this is the single easiest thing they could image and is not characteristic of the rest of the fly brain. First, the lobes are quite superficial. Second, they contain hundreds of parallel Kenyon cell axons that respond to odor in a temporally and spatially correlated manner. (A) The authors need to put their compression technique through its paces by showing us whether it can or cannot be used for functional imaging of sparser neuronal populations in more tangled areas of the brain. (B) We also need to know the depth in the brain that is feasible for 2-photon imaging through the cuticle, and with respect to point 1 above, at what depth it becomes preferable to switch to 3-photon for functional imaging. (C) Finally, because the γ lobe compartments are large and thus stay in view even when the preparation is moving somewhat, it's not clear what sort of stability the authors obtain in this preparation. We need to know whether things like cell somata or isolated neurites can be stably resolved over time, or whether the fly's motion prevents this.</p><p>3 – It is wonderful that the authors can image for hours using this technique, and critical to the breakthrough to know the extent to which smashing the head causes brain damage. We suggest repeating the elegant heat shock protein analysis (Figure 4 supplement 1) on flies chronically imaged by 2p and 3p. We also suggest testing whether flies removed from the imaging stage/preparation can mate and produce offspring, as this would be a simple demonstration that they are still capable of sensory perception, decision-making, and complex motor programs.</p><p>In all the points above, we don't require a particular result for publication. Rather, because this is a methods-focused paper, we need a fuller picture of both the possibilities and limits of this technical approach--what it can do, and what it still cannot do.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69094.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors develop a non-invasive multiphoton imaging method to observe neural structure and activity in vivo in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

New data and quantifications are now included in Figure 3—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5 figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, the reviewers had a number of other points where better characterization and reporting would strengthen the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this tools and resources paper, the authors demonstrate a way to record neuronal activity from flies without surgical removal of the head cuticle. It is valuable to be able to record from flies with minimal surgery. This means that the fly is less stressed, that the tissue is more healthy, and the recordings can go on for longer. The authors demonstrate optical recordings of odor responses through the cuticle, but not at the single-cell resolution that many readers would like. They also illustrate better imaging at greater depth using 3-photon illumination. The approach is potentially very useful, and the case for it would be even stronger were there a more complete comparison with conventional recordings with the cuticle removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Could the authors make a thorough comparison with cuticle-removed recordings? One would like to compare spatial resolution as well as signal-to-noise in the GCaMP recordings.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s point of view and agree that comparing spatial resolution obtained with cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed imaging preparations is important. We took the reviewers advice and quantified the spatial resolution in different regions of the fly brain using 2P and 3P imaging using the cuticle-removed and cuticle-intact preparations. We also imaged neural activity in response to electric shock in flies expressing GCaMP6s across the entire fly brain.</p><p>Our measurements showed that the cuticle-removed imaging preparation generated images with ~1.5X better axial resolution compared to cuticle-intact imaging preparations for both 2P and 3P imaging. These measurements were done using mushroom body Kenyon cells and central complex Ellipsoid body ring neurons. Signal attenuation for cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed preparations was also different for both 2P and 3P imaging. For cuticle-intact imaging 2P-EAL=45µm and 3P-EAL=61µm, while for cuticle-removed imaging 2P-EAL=72µm and 3P-EAL=99µm. These results indicate that cuticle intact imaging experiences a faster fluorescence signal decay for both 2P and 3P imaging. Based on the signal attenuation data, we estimated the imaging depth for 2P as 100µm and 3P as 150µm when imaging through intact cuticle. While imaging is still possible with 3P at the sub-esophageal zone (&gt;150µm), it shows an increase in the background signals that degrades image contrast when imaging beyond the esophagus (~150µm). When cuticle is removed, imaging depth limits increased. For the cuticle-removed preparation, 2P imaging depth was increased to 180µm, and 3P imaging depth was increased to ~300µm, reaching the bottom of the fly brain. The new data and quantifications are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1, Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3.</p><p>For the neural activity recordings using GCaMP6s, we found that deltaF/F<sub>o</sub> for 2P cuticle-removed imaging prep ranged between 0.2 to 0.4 and for cuticle-intact prep it ranged between 0.2 to 0.3. On the other hand, deltaF/F<sub>o</sub> for 3P cuticle-removed imaging prep ranged between 0.2 to 0.7, for cuticle-intact it ranged between 0.2 to 0.5. The new data and quantifications are shown in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Could the authors obtain single neuron data?

The new data is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2 and Figure 3—figure supplement 3.

However, ellipsoid body ring neurons are only clearly distinguishable with 3P excitation when imaging through the intact cuticle.

They achieve this by compression of air sacs to provide optical access to the brain while keeping the cuticle intact. Their results show that the through-cuticle preparation is compatible with 2- and 3-photon structural and functional imaging, with 3-photon imaging providing higher anatomic resolution in deeper brain regions. Through 2-photon calcium imaging of the mushroom body γ lobes, the authors demonstrate that odor-evoked responses can be studied short-term and long-term in behaving flies. The demonstration of the feasibility of functional imaging without surgery and of chronic imaging are true breakthroughs that will allow novel investigations of how the brain senses and interprets information over time to guide behavior. As we will describe in our feedback to the authors, additional experiments or analyses will allow the authors to demonstrate the strengths and limits of head compression and 3-photon imaging vis-a-vis different kinds of neurons and parts of the brain.</p><p>Major points to be addressed through new experiments:</p><p>1– The authors show that 3-photon imaging generates sharper anatomic pictures of neurons deep in the brain than does 2-photon imaging, but for functional imaging, only compare 3p versus 2p in a superficial structure (mushroom body γ lobes, Figure 4H). As the paper focuses on the utility of these techniques for functional imaging, the authors should provide data on the performance of 2- versus 3-photon functional imaging in a deeper brain region.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concerns. In our revised manuscript, we have conducted whole brain functional imaging experiments using cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed preparations with 2P and 3P excitation. New results are shown in Figure 4. Our data demonstrated that, similar to structural imaging, 3P outperforms 2P at deeper regions of the fly brain when imaging neural activity in both cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed imaging preparations. We have revised the text to explain our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be nice to provide more detail of the spatial resolution of 3p in Figure 4, as only temporal traces are shown.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version, we have done extensive analysis of 2P and 3P imaging using both cuticle-intact and cuticle-removed preparations (Please also see response to Reviewer 1 Point). The new results are shown in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 and 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – The authors demonstrate that head compression allows chronic functional imaging through the cuticle, without surgery, in a single test case--the mushroom body axonal γ lobes. This is a great advance, but as the authors know, this is the single easiest thing they could image and is not characteristic of the rest of the fly brain. First, the lobes are quite superficial. Second, they contain hundreds of parallel Kenyon cell axons that respond to odor in a temporally and spatially correlated manner. (A) The authors need to put their compression technique through its paces by showing us whether it can or cannot be used for functional imaging of sparser neuronal populations in more tangled areas of the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we have done new experiments and measurements to quantify the limits of cuticleintact imaging. For resolution measurements we have imaged Kenyon cell bodies and ellipsoid body ring neurons. These analyses were done using structural imaging since, it is not possible to always find a natural stimulus for neurons in the fly brain. In addition, we do not expect GFP and GCaMP to have different resolution properties with 2P or 3P imaging. We have also added Figure 5 —figure supplement 2 to show that functional imaging is possible at a single-cell level in a population of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(B) We also need to know the depth in the brain that is feasible for 2-photon imaging through the cuticle, and with respect to point 1 above, at what depth it becomes preferable to switch to 3-photon for functional imaging.</p></disp-quote><p>We have investigated the depth limit of 2P and 3P imaging. Our measurements suggests that the imaging depth for 2P is 100µm and 3P as 150µm when imaging through intact cuticle. When cuticle is removed, imaging depth limit increases. For the cuticle-removed preparation, 2P imaging depth is increased to 180µm, and 3P imaging depth is increased to ~300µm, reaching the bottom of the fly brain. So, one can argue, when imaging through the cuticle it is preferable to switch to 3P at~100µm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(C) Finally, because the γ lobe compartments are large and thus stay in view even when the preparation is moving somewhat, it's not clear what sort of stability the authors obtain in this preparation. We need to know whether things like cell somata or isolated neurites can be stably resolved over time, or whether the fly's motion prevents this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have imaged the ellipsoid body neurons for 150s and calculated motion and intensity fluctuation. New data is shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 4 and Video 4. We do not see major effects of motion on the fluorescence intensity. The reviewer is correct that when imaging for long periods of time z-drift is an issue. We have added a sentence to the text to mention this issue during chronic imaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – It is wonderful that the authors can image for hours using this technique, and critical to the breakthrough to know the extent to which smashing the head causes brain damage. We suggest repeating the elegant heat shock protein analysis (Figure 4 supplement 1) on flies chronically imaged by 2p and 3p.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words. We have repeated the HSP70 protein expression analysis for flies that were exposed to same amount of laser power as in chronic imaging experiments. Briefly, we exposed head-fixed flies to either 920nm or 1320nm laser wavelength for 6 minutes continuously under an objective lens. After the laser exposure flies were rested for 6 minutes then reimaged for another 6 minutes. We repeated the same procedure for 4 times, exposing the flies to in total 24 minutes of laser excitation as in chronically imaged flies. The control flies in these experiments were head-fixed but were not exposed to laser scanning under an objective lens. Our data suggests that there is no HSP70 protein expression when we use laser power 15mW, which is the upper limit of the laser power we used in all imaging experiments in this paper. These results are added to Figure 4—figure supplement 1 and mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also suggest testing whether flies removed from the imaging stage/preparation can mate and produce offspring, as this would be a simple demonstration that they are still capable of sensory perception, decision-making, and complex motor programs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. To investigate whether head compression causes behavior deficits in flies, we quantified the copulation success of male flies that were previously head compressed. We found that head compression does not impact male courtship behavior and head-compressed male flies are still able to court and mate with females. These results are added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and mentioned in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In all the points above, we don't require a particular result for publication. Rather, because this is a methods-focused paper, we need a fuller picture of both the possibilities and limits of this technical approach--what it can do, and what it still cannot do.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s points. We hope that we have provided valuable information during the revisions which demonstrate the advantages and the limits of through-cuticle 2P and 3P imaging.</p></body></sub-article></article>
