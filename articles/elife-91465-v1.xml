hippocampus play a critical role in learning and memory. However, the precise timing of LC-hippocampus communication during learning and which LC-derived neurotransmitters are important for memory formation in the hippocampus are currently unknown. Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus and other cortical regions. In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the hippocampus may be more important for memory than norepinephrine. Here, we extend these data by characterizing the phasic responses of the LC and its projections to the dorsal hippocampus during trace fear conditioning in mice. We find that the LC and its projections to the hippocampus respond to task-relevant stimuli and that amplifying these responses with optogenetic stimulation can enhance long-term memory formation. We also demonstrate that LC activity increases both norepinephrine and dopamine content in the dorsal hippocampus and that the timing of hippocampal dopamine release during trace fear conditioning is similar to the timing of LC activity. Finally, we show that hippocampal dopamine is important for trace fear memory formation, while norepinephrine is not.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our brains are more likely to remember activities or incidents that stand out from typical day-to-day experiences. For instance, if your phone is stolen on the way to work, you will have a stronger memory of this experience compared to other uneventful commutes. These are known as salient events and can be emotional, surprising, or even just out of the ordinary.</p><p>During salient events, an area of the brain known as the hippocampus receives chemicals called neuromodulators from other parts of the brain. These neuromodulators enhance the formation of the memory by modifying how neurons connect together in the hippocampus.</p><p>One of the regions that signals to the hippocampus – called the locus coeruleus – was thought to enhance memory by releasing the neuromodulator norepinephrine. Recent studies indicate that the locus coeruleus also releases a second neuromodulator called dopamine. However, it remained unclear what causes the locus coeruleus to release dopamine, and what effect this neuromodulator has on the hippocampus.</p><p>To investigate these questions, Wilmot et al. recorded and manipulated the activity of the locus coeruleus in the brains of mice experiencing salient, fearful events. The mice were exposed to a sound and, a few seconds later, a shock to the foot to illicit the formation of an aversive salient memory. If the next day, the mice responded to just the sound as if they were expecting a shock, this indicated they had remembered the aversive experience.</p><p>Wilmot et al. observed that neurons in the locus coeruleus were active during the salient event, resulting in increased dopamine in the hippocampus. When the activity of these neurons was forcefully increased during relatively non-salient events, such as a quiet tone and a very mild shock, the animals still showed strong memory formation. Finally, blocking the action of dopamine in the hippocampus substantially affected memory formation, whereas blocking the action of norepinephrine did not have the same effect.</p><p>These findings suggest that the locus coeruleus enhances the memory of salient events by increasing the levels of dopamine in the hippocampus not norepinephrine, as was previously thought. Developing a better understanding of how the locus coeruleus regulates memory may lead to improved treatments for various neurological disorders, like Alzheimer’s disease, which are associated with neuromodulators taking on different roles in the hippocampus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>locus coeruleus</kwd><kwd>dopamine</kwd><kwd>norepinephrine</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS129217</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiltgen</surname><given-names>Brian Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH126496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wiltgen</surname><given-names>Brian Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32MH112507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wilmot</surname><given-names>Jacob H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Locus coeruleus responses to salient environmental stimuli drive increases in hippocampal dopamine that are important for long-term memory formation during trace fear conditioning.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) supports an array of cognitive processes by modulating brain-wide arousal states and responding to salient events in the environment. LC neurons accomplish this via two distinct modes of activity: tonic and phasic. Changes in the frequency of tonic activity are associated with corresponding changes in psychological state. Low tonic activity (~0–2 Hz) is associated with drowsiness or sleep and increasing levels of tonic activity (~3–10 Hz) are associated with increased arousal, progressing from exploration and task engagement to agitation and anxiety states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>). Bouts of phasic activity (~10–20 Hz) are most often observed during intermediate levels of tonic activity in response to salient environmental events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aston-Jones et al., 1999</xref>). When locked to task-relevant events, these phasic responses are associated with improved cognitive performance across a variety of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref> for review).</p><p>A large body of research supports the idea that the LC is critically involved in memory formation. Monoamine depletion in the LC, noradrenergic and dopaminergic antagonism in multiple brain regions, and direct inhibition of the LC all impair memory across a number of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lisman and Grace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selden et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, LC stimulation as well as dopamine and norepinephrine agonism can enhance memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Packard and White, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Packard and White, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sara and Devauges, 1988</xref>). Although the LC is typically thought to modulate neural activity via the release of norepinephrine, several recent studies have suggested that it may also release dopamine into the hippocampus (HPC) and other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>). In some cases, it appears that dopamine release from LC into the HPC may be more important for memory than norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>However, studies examining the effect of LC on HPC-dependent memory have generally not distinguished between tonic and phasic LC activity or between dopamine and norepinephrine signaling. In some cases, this distinction is prevented by the use of temporally imprecise manipulations like lesions and drug infusions. In others, it is difficult to determine the importance of time-locked phasic firing because of the use of spatial memory tasks that are commonly used to assess hippocampus (HPC)-dependent memory. Because space is a temporally diffuse stimulus, it is difficult to know the exact moments during spatial learning when phasic responses might be important. This does not rule out the possibility that phasic LC activity and dopamine signaling is important for spatial learning, but the lack of experimental control over the animals’ sampling of the relevant stimuli makes this possibility opaque to examination. Studies that have used discrete reward learning tasks to examine dopamine function in the HPC have also not typically distinguished between tonic and phasic release.</p><p>To address these issues, we used a trace fear conditioning task in which animals learn an association between a neutral and aversive stimulus that are separated in time. Because trace fear conditioning (a) requires intact hippocampal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chowdhury et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raybuck and Lattal, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>) and (b) involves learning about discrete, well-controlled stimuli, it is ideally suited to characterize the rapid temporal dynamics of LC activity and LC-HPC communication during learning and examine their role in long term memory formation. Here, we used fiber photometry and optogenetics to make temporally precise observations and manipulations of LC activity during learning in a trace fear conditioning task. We extend this data by providing direct evidence that LC activity increases both dopamine and norepinephrine content in the HPC and by showing that dopamine release is important for trace fear memory formation, but the release of norepinephrine is not.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The locus coeruleus responds to neutral and aversive environmental stimuli</title><p>Before examining LC activity during learning, we sought to determine whether the LC exhibits phasic responses to the basic types of stimuli used in trace fear conditioning. Because previous research indicates LC activity may be modulated by the salience, or intensity, of environmental stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>), we began by examining the responses of the locus coeruleus to neutral auditory stimuli of varying intensities (55 dB-95dB).</p><p>To observe LC responses to auditory stimuli, we expressed the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s specifically in the LC of TH-Cre transgenic mice and implanted an optical fiber above the injection site to allow fiber photometric recordings of bulk LC activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After recovery from surgery, GCaMP fluorescence in LC was measured as the mice were exposed to five interleaved presentations of a 3000 Hz pure tone at each dB level (25 total presentations). Small phasic responses were seen at each dB level, but responses increased with tone intensity, with responses to the 95 dB tone most pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), confirming that the magnitude of the LC response to an auditory stimulus is modulated by its intensity.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Locus coeruleus responses to neutral and aversive stimuli.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of virus infusion and fiber implant in LC.

To determine whether LC responses are modulated by the intensity of an aversive stimulus, we recorded calcium activity in the LC while mice received foot shocks of varying intensity (0–0.8mA). Consistent with the idea that LC activity is modulated by the salience of environmental stimuli, we found that LC responses to foot shock were much larger than the previously observed responses to neutral auditory stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref>). Additionally, consistent with previous reports, the size of the LC response to footshock increased with foot shock intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen and Sara, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hirata and Aston-Jones, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). The results of these initial experiments demonstrate that the LC responds to both neutral and aversive stimuli and that LC response magnitude is positively correlated with the salience and/or valence of the stimulus.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Locus coeruleus activity is modulated by learning</title><p>Having demonstrated that the locus coeruleus is responsive to salient environmental events, we next sought to determine whether its responses are modulated by learning. Again, we began by using fiber photometry to monitor LC responses to a neutral auditory stimulus. If the LC responds to novelty or salience, we would expect the responses to diminish over repeated experiences with a stimulus as the animal habituates to its presence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Thompson and Spencer, 1966</xref>). To test this idea, we recorded activity in the LC over the course of 3 days as animals were repeatedly exposed to the same tone (85 dB, 3 KHz; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, LC responses to the tone were largest on the first day and gradually reduced in magnitude over the next 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The LC also responded to tone termination, and while this response also appeared to habituate across days, the effect did not reach significance (Main effect of day F(2,8) = 3.36, p=0.087). This finding is consistent with prior work showing that animals process the termination of an auditory CS as a distinct, salient event that itself can undergo conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sommer-Smith, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sommer-Smith et al., 1962</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Locus coeruleus responses are modified by learning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cre-dependent GCaMP6s was infused into the LC of Th-Cre mice (TFC, n=4; tone only, n=5) and a fiber optic was implanted above the injection site.

On the second and third days, mice underwent extinction trials in which no shocks were administered. Trace conditioning trials consisted of a 20 s tone followed by a 20 s stimulus free trace interval ending in a 2 s 0.2mA footshock. The LC responses in these animals followed a similar pattern to that observed in the tone only group, with activity on Day 1 being the largest and gradually decreasing across days as the mice extinguished. However, the magnitude of the LC responses was much larger in mice that underwent trace fear conditioning on Day 1 compared to tone alone presentations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also found that the response to tone termination significantly decreased across the extinction sessions. These data suggest that LC responses can be modified by associative learning – LC responses to an inherently neutral stimulus are larger when the stimulus is paired with an aversive outcome than when the stimulus is experienced in isolation. Additionally, as this association is extinguished and the tone becomes less predictive of an aversive outcome, the LC response is reduced – there was no significant difference between fear conditioned and tone only mice on the second or third days of behavior when neither group was receiving footshocks. These results are consistent with previous recording studies that found individual LC neurons can acquire a learned response to the conditional stimulus during training that disappears during extinction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rasmussen and Jacobs, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sara and Segal, 1991</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Locus coeruleus terminals in dorsal hippocampus exhibit phasic responses during trace fear conditioning</title><p>Taken together, the above data show that the LC exhibits large bursts of activity during trace fear conditioning at the tone onset, tone termination, and during the shock.

First, in all groups of animals, there was a small increase in fluorescence immediately after the injection likely produced by a LC response to the highly salient I.P. injection process (data not shown). However, after this increase subsided, fluorescence continued to decrease for the rest of the session in the vehicle and CNO +antagonist groups for both sensors. This continued decrease is likely the result of a reduction in the amount of dopamine and norepinephrine in the HPC (as the chamber becomes less novel and the animals explore less) in addition to any photobleaching that occurred over the session. In contrast, CNO-only injections in mice expressing either sensor produced prolonged increases in fluorescence relative to the vehicle groups beginning approximately 10 min after the injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>), indicating that stimulation of the LC increases both dopamine and norepinephrine concentrations in the dHPC.

Given their relatively short duration and the fact that they are elicited specifically by salient sensory stimuli, we refer to these responses as ‘phasic responses’. However, because of the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent sensors relative to electrophysiology, we cannot rule out the possibility that these responses are somehow different in nature from previously reported phasic LC responses. Thus, some care must be taken in conflating the characteristics and/or function of the relatively short-lasting responses presented here and the extremely fast phasic responses to very brief (μs to ms) sensory stimuli reported previously. Our data also demonstrate that the size of the LC phasic response is modulated by the intensity, or salience, of sensory stimuli. This relationship between salience and LC response magnitude was particularly pronounced for the aversive foot-shock. Across all intensities, LC responses were larger to the aversive stimuli than to neutral auditory stimuli, suggesting that the LC may encode some information about the emotional valence of stimuli in addition to the simple sensory salience – though to determine this conclusively would require equating the salience of stimuli across the somatosensory and auditory modalities while varying the emotional valence, which may not be possible, especially in a rodent model. These data are consistent with previous work suggesting a role for LC in signaling salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foote et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grant et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>) and extend them by providing a parametric characterization of LC responses to stimuli of varying intensities.</p><p>We also found that phasic LC responses change with learning. First, consistent with a role for LC in signaling salience or novelty, LC responses to a neutral auditory stimulus habituate across repeated exposure to a stimulus, as demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hervé-Minvielle and Sara, 1995</xref>). Additionally, we demonstrated that the LC response to the same auditory stimulus is larger when the stimulus is associated with an aversive outcome. Previous work has shown that LC neurons can respond more to conditioned than non-conditioned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aston-Jones et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>); however, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of increased LC responding to the CS in a trace conditioning task where the CS and US are separated by an extended interval. This may indicate some level of top-down influence over the LC by the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex, as both of these regions are required for learning in this task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilmartin and Helmstetter, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wilmot et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our results also confirmed that the direct projections from the LC to the dHPC are phasically activated by all learning-relevant stimuli during trace conditioning. This data provides support for the idea that phasic LC input to the hippocampus is involved in memory formation. We did not observe obvious changes in tonic LC-HPC activity in our data, although these changes may be more subtle and occur over longer time scales that would be difficult to detect using fiber photometry. The presence of the same responses in the LC-HPC axon terminals that were seen in LC cell bodies fits with the canonical view of the LC as a largely homogenous structure whose neurons’ axons are highly collateralized. However, it was important to test whether LC-HPC projections respond during trace conditioning directly, as more recent work suggests the LC may be composed of many distinct ‘modules’ of neurons that project to separate regions and it is not yet known whether these modules exhibit different response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schwarz and Luo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Uematsu et al., 2017</xref>). Because we only recorded from LC projections to the HPC, our data could be consistent with either a homogenous or modular LC organization. Future work could distinguish between these possibilities by recording LC projections in an array of downstream targets.</p><p>We also sought to determine whether LC stimulation results in the release of dopamine and/or norepinephrine into the HPC. Using DREADDs, we were able to show that direct LC stimulation drives increases in both dopamine and norepinephrine in the HPC, consistent with a number of recent studies indicating their co-release from LC terminals in the hippocampus and neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Devoto and Flore, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Smith and Greene, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). Due to the low number of VTA/SN fibers in dorsal HPC, it is likely that the large increase in dopamine during LC stimulation is due to direct release from LC terminals. However, it is also possible that HPC dopamine is increased indirectly via LC projections to dopaminergic midbrain regions, although there are several problems for this argument (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guiard et al., 2008</xref>). First, recent studies have shown that activation of LC terminals in the dorsal hippocampus induces the release of dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>). Second, inactivation of LC but not VTA terminals in the dorsal hippocampus decreases dopamine release in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gálvez-Márquez et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, while it is not possible to completely rule out increased hippocampal dopamine via a LC-midbrain-HPC circuit based on our studies, direct release of dopamine from LC terminals in HPC is more likely.</p><p>A wide body of evidence suggests that LC activation enhances memory acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>), consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">LaLumiere et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Novitskaya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>), and retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sara and Devauges, 1988</xref>). Here, we extended this data by showing that precisely timed phasic activation of the locus coeruleus enhances memory formation. Specifically, our data indicate that phasic LC activation can enhance memory formation when the relevant stimuli are not salient enough to produce significant learning on their own.</p><p>There are multiple possibilities as to the mechanism underlying this enhancement. First, both dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lisman et al., 2011</xref>) and norepinephrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bliss et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanton and Sarvey, 1985</xref>) enhance synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and in other structures important for trace fear conditioning, including the prefrontal cortex and amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bissière et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tully et al., 2007</xref>). Given our data showing that dopamine, and not norepinephrine, is required for trace fear memory formation, the most direct possibility is that the release of dopamine from the LC enhances learning-related plasticity in regions supporting trace fear conditioning. Our finding that systemic β-adrenergic receptor antagonism has no effect on trace fear memory formation was surprising in light of previous work demonstrating memory impairments after infusions of adrenergic antagonists into the hippocampus or amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Giustino and Maren, 2018</xref> for review). However, our data is consistent with recent findings from several other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kempadoo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Takeuchi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wagatsuma et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, the work of Thomas et al. used several different methods to demonstrate that β-adrenergic receptors in the dHPC are required for the retrieval of context fear but not learning or memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Murchison et al., 2004</xref>). Based on this previous work and our data showing learning-related activity in LC-HPC projections, we believe that LC release of dopamine into the hippocampus is at least partially responsible for our observed effects. However, future work manipulating this projection directly would be required to make this conclusion.</p><p>The LC may also assert its effect on memory formation indirectly via its influence over sensory processing, attention, or valence processing, all of which are affected by phasic LC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouret and Sara, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vazey et al., 2018</xref>). Under this hypothesis, the LC could facilitate memory by enhancing the responses of neural populations involved in processing, attending, or assigning valence to the learning-relevant stimuli. For example, in our optogenetic experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) phasic LC stimulation may have enhanced stimulus detection and allowed the relatively weak stimuli that were used to capture the animals’ attention and produce learning when they otherwise would not. Distinguishing between these plasticity and cognitive modulation accounts of LC-driven memory enhancements would be difficult as many of the same cellular mechanisms are likely involved in both processes. Indeed, it is likely that LC enhancements of plasticity and cognitive function both contribute to its effects on memory.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Subjects in this study were 2- to 4-month-old male and female F1 hybrids generated by breeding TH-Cre mice maintained on a C57BL/6 J background (Jackson Labs, Cat #008601) with 129S6 mice (Taconic).

The chamber consisted of a front-mounted scanning charge-coupled device video camera, stainless steel grid floor, a stainless steel drop pan, and overhead LED lighting capable of providing broad spectrum and infrared light. For context A, the conditioning chamber was lit with both broad spectrum and infrared light and scented with 95% ethanol. For context B, a smooth white plastic insert was placed over the grid floor and a curved white wall was inserted into the chamber. Additionally, the room lights were changed to red light, only infrared lighting was present in the conditioning chamber, and the chamber was cleaned and scented with disinfectant wipes (PDI Sani-Cloth Plus).

For optogenetics and pharmacology experiments, the animals then receive 3 trace conditioning trials. For photometry experiments, animals received 10 conditioning trials.

The intertrial interval (ITI) was 120 or 180 s. Mice were removed from the chamber 180 s after the last trial. Twenty-four hours later, the mice were placed in context B for a tone test consisting of a 2 or 3 min baseline period followed by 6 20 s tone presentations separated by a 180 s ITI for optogenetics and pharmacology experiments and 10 20 s tone presentations separated by a 140 s ITI for photometry experiments.

The fluorescence from neurons below the fiber tip was transmitted via this same cable back to the mini-cube, where it was passed through an emission filter, amplified, and focused onto a femtowatt photoreceiver (Newport).

It uses a variety of neural methods including fiber photometry as well as area-specific and pathway-silencing methods with the exquisite dissociation of norepinephrine and dopamine. The data show that neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) respond to auditory cue onset, offset, and shock. These responses are stronger if the cue is paired with shock in a trace procedure. Optogenetic stimulation similar to the neural response captured by fiber photometry enhances associative learning.

This has not been achieved in the present report, as an examination of Fig 1 C,D and 2 C,D shows. Previous reports in rats and monkeys, using unit recording in rats and monkeys clearly show that the latency of LC 'phasic' responses to salient or behaviorally relevant stimuli are in the range of tens of milliseconds, with a very short duration, often followed by a long-lasting inhibition. This kind of temporal precision concerning the phasic response cannot be gleaned from the time scale shown in the Figures (assuming the time scale is in seconds). We can discern a long-lasting increase in tonic firing level for the more salient stimuli (Fig 1C) (although the authors state in the discussion that &quot;we did not observe obvious changes in tonic LC-HPC activity). This calcium imaging methodology as used in the present experiments can give us a general idea of the temporal relation of LC response to the stimulus, but apparently does not afford the millisecond resolution necessary to capture a phasic response, at least as the data are presented in the Figures.</p></disp-quote><p>While we understand the reviewer’s concern with our use of the terms phasic and tonic, we believe we have represented them as accurately as possible given our data. Unfortunately, the distinction between tonic and phasic activity is somewhat arbitrary, in that there is no strict definition, to our knowledge, of the exact parameters that activity must fall into to be categorized as tonic or phasic. While it is true that phasic LC activity has typically been studied with electrophysiological approaches that afford millisecond resolution and that observed phasic responses are often extremely short, there are numerous differences between those studies and this one. Most prominently, the stimuli used to elicit a phasic response are generally extremely short (often 1ms or less) and therefore generate extremely short phasic responses (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981a; Aston-Jones and Cohen, 2005), but this is not to say that phasic responses might not be longer in response to a longer lasting stimulus. Moreover, tonic activity is reported to track with behavioral state on the order of dozens of seconds to minutes and is not reported in response to specific stimuli (Aston-Jones and Bloom, 1981b). The “phasic” responses we report generally decay in less than 5 seconds in our fluorescence signals. Given the slow time course of decay for GcAMP6s (a single action potential can generate a response that lasts 3 or more seconds (Chen et al., 2013)) and the GRAB sensors (GRAB-DA2h τoff = 7.2s (Sun et al., 2020)), the underlying neural responses would have lasted for a significantly shorter period. Therefore, we believe the responses we observed are much more consistent with phasic responses to long-lasting sensory stimuli (20-second tone, 1-2 second shock), than with increases in tonic activity associated with a change in behavioral state. Finally, regardless of whether these responses are exactly the same as previously reported phasic responses, our photometry and optogenetics studies provide insight about a form of LC activity that is fundamentally different than what can be gleaned from much slower dialysis, lesion, and pharmacology studies. Nonetheless, we added the following to the discussion section to clarify the limitations of our interpretation:</p><p>“…given their relatively short duration and the fact that they are elicited specifically by salient sensory stimuli, we refer to these responses as “phasic responses.” However, because of the comparatively slow dynamics of fluorescent sensors relative to electrophysiology, we cannot rule out the possibility that these responses are somehow different in nature to previously reported phasic LC responses. Thus, some care must be taken in conflating the characteristics and/or function of the relatively short-lasting responses presented here and the extremely fast phasic responses to very brief (μs to ms) sensory stimuli reported previously.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Much of the data presented here can be regarded as 'proof of concept' i.e. demonstrating that Photometric imaging of calcium signalling yields similar results concerning LC responses to salient or behaviorally relevant stimuli as has been previously reported using electrophysiological unit recording. The role of dopamine as the principal player in hippocampaldependent learning also corroborates previous reports.</p></disp-quote><p>Although some of the data presented in this study could be seen as “proof of concept” or “confirmatory” of previous results, we believe this work extends previous results by showing (1) the importance of hippocampal dopamine to aversive hippocampus-dependent learning and trace fear conditioning specifically, (2) that LC responses are important at the specific times of learning (i.e. CS/US onset/termination), and (3) that dopamine in the hippocampus is likely important for learning in a way that is not tied to prediction error or memory consolidation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>No attempt was made to address the important current question of the modular organisation of Locus Coeruleus, although the authors recognize the importance of this question and propose future experiments using their methodology to record simultaneously in several LC projection sites.</p></disp-quote><p>While we do recognize the importance of this modular organization, which is addressed in the discussion as the reviewer mentions, experiments addressing this organization are beyond the scope of the present study. Future work will address the possibility that LC projections to different regions show differential responses during learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The phasic-tonic issue has not been resolved by these experiments. Phasic responses of LC single units are short-latency, short-lived (just 3-4 action potentials), and followed by a relatively long refraction period. Multiunit responses will have a more jittery latency and longer-lasting response (but still only tens to hundreds of milliseconds). Your figures clearly show long-lasting increases in tonic firing levels, even though you state the contrary in the discussion. Therefore, I strongly recommend removing the word 'phasic' from the title.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Yohimbine, the Alpha 2 antagonist, administered systemically, induces a massive increase in the rate of firing of LC cells (through blockade of autoinhibition at the cell body level at terminals). I guess its effect on the receptor 'backbones' overrides the massive release of NE and/or DA, but you might want to mention this; also include the dose of all drug treatments.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, yohimbine’s effect on the GRAB-NE signal is somewhat counter-intuitive given the known effect of yohimbine on norepinephrine levels. However, our result is consistent with previous reports (Feng et al., 2019). We have added the following to the results section to clarify:</p><p>“Thus, even though yohimbine is known to increase NE levels in the hippocampus (Abercrombie et al., 1988), its blockade effect on the GRAB-NE sensor should result in a decrease in fluorescence after administration.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Include time scale units on all figures (I assume it is seconds in Figs 1 &amp;2).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this issue, we have added units on all figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Is it possible to have a better quality example of staining? Fig 1 B in particular is very blurry. Is the yellow double staining? Please indicate. Most of the GCaMP seems to be outside the main area of TH staining. Fig 4 B is much nicer--and it looks morphologically, like LC.</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the GcAMP6s staining was very dim in our hands and resulted in relatively blurry images. Yes, in this case, yellow is double staining. Regarding the morphology, the GCaMP image is taken from a sagittal section and the shape of expression is consistent with images of LC in the sagittal plane. However, given the quality of our ChR2 images, we are confident in the specificity of expression in these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p><p>The claim that dopamine release in dHPC is caused by LC neurons is not directly tested. Unfortunately, the most critical experiment for the claims that dopamine release comes from LC during conditioning is not tested. A lack of dopamine signal in dHPC caused by inhibition of LC during TFC would show this. It is indeed an interesting observation that chemoegenetic activation of LC causes dopamine release in the dHPC. However, in the absence of concurrent VTA inhibition or lesion, it remains a possibility that the dopamine release is mediated through indirect actions on other dopamine-expressing neurons. The authors do a good job of arguing against this interpretation in the discussion, and the literature seems appropriate for this. However, the title is still an overstatement of the data presented in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comments. As indicated in the discussion, it is possible that hippocampal dopamine is increased indirectly via LC projections to dopaminergic midbrain regions. We believe that our title is consistent with this possibility. When phasic stimulation was delivered to the LC, dopamine levels increased in the hippocampus and trace fear conditioning was enhanced. The observed increase in dopamine could be direct or indirect. As the reviewer notes, we argue for the former in the discussion section. A number of experiments would be needed to show this directly (record dopamine while: inhibiting the LC, inhibiting the VTA, stimulating LC while simultaneously inhibiting the VTA etc.) and we are planning to do these in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The primary alternative interpretations of the phasic activation experiment are whether only stimulation to the cue events (both on and off), or whether only stimulation to the shock. Thus this experiment would benefit from additional data showing either a no shock control, to show that enhanced activity of the LC to the tone is not inherently aversive, or manipulations to the tone but not to the shock.</p></disp-quote><p>Future work will explore whether the contribution of LC to learning is primarily due to its activation during the CS or the US. However, this is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specificity of the GRAB-NE and GRAB-DA sensors should be either justified through additional experiments testing the alternative antagonist (i.e. GRAB-NE CNO+eticloprode / GRAB-DA CNO+yohimbine) or additional citations that have tested this already. It is critical for the claims of the paper to show that these sensors are specific to dopamine or norepinephrine.</p><p>Although sensitivity is a potential concern, these sensors have been thoroughly vetted and used by many groups since their generation. In particular, the creators of these sensors provided extensive data showing their specificity. The GRAB-DA sensor is ~10 fold more sensitive to DA than to NE (Sun et al., 2020, cited 239 times) and the GRAB-NE sensor is ~37 fold more sensitive to NE than to DA (Feng et al., 2019, cited 371 times).</p><p>The role of dopamine in prediction error was tested through a series of conditions whereby the shock was presented either signaled (i.e. predicted), or not. However, another way that prediction error is signaled is through the absence of an expected outcome. Admittedly it might not be possible to observe a decrease in dopamine signaling with this methodology.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this is a strong point, given that the study is not primarily focused on error prediction and the low likelihood of observing the typically small decrease in signaling during expected outcome omission, we feel that additional error prediction studies are beyond the scope of this manuscript. However, further experiments as suggested by the reviewer could prove interesting in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The difference between Fig. 6E and 6H needs to be clarified. What is shown in Fig. 6E is that the response to the shock decreases through experience (i.e. by the 10th trial). However in Fig 6H, there is no difference between signaled and signaled shock, but this is during conditioning, and not after learning (based on my understanding of the methods, line 482).</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure we fully understand what point of clarification the reviewer is asking for. However, we have clarified in the methods that the signaled vs unsignaled shock experiment took place in animals that had already been trained on TFC. Thus, all of the trials took place after the animals had learned the tone-shock association. Therefore, although the drop in shock-response could be taken as an indicator of a prediction-error like signal, all the other data points to this not being the case (no change in tone response over training, no difference in signaled vs. unsignaled responses after training).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unless I missed it, at no point in the manuscript is the number of subjects described. Please add the n per experiment within each section describing each experiment in the methods (Behavioral procedures). Some more details in the photometry statistical analysis would be helpful. For example, what is the n per group for every data set that is presented? How many trials per analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. Animal numbers have been added in the methods section in the Behavioral Procedures, Optogenetics, and Drugs sub-sections and in the figure legends. Trial numbers are included in these sections and all trials were used for analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What is the difference in experimental procedure between Fig. 2D and Fig. 3B? It seems that they are the same, and yet the LC response to the conditioned CS is not.</p></disp-quote><p>Fig. 3B is simply the Day 1 data from Fig 2D presented at a different scale because the shock response is included in Fig. 3B which necessitates a larger scale on both axes. Close inspection of the figures will show that the shapes of these two curves and the error around them is the same, but the different scaling obfuscates this slightly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Typo in the legend of Figure 2 - D should be E.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we have corrected this.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Anatomical localization of the virus injections, and more importantly the fiber placements, is not shown. Including this information helps with replication and understanding where exactly the observations were made in dHPC to contrast with prior studies.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative examples are included in the manuscript in figure 1B, 3F, 4B, and 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p><p>While the optogenetic study was lovely, a control using the same stimulation but delivered at different time points would have been a good addition to show how critical the neural signal at tone onset, tone offset, and shock is.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it would be interesting in future studies to delineate the specific times when LC stimulation produces a learning enhancement. It could be that LC activity is most important during one specific time period (eg. just during shock) or that all three periods of activation are required. It would also be useful to know whether stimulation at other times during learning can produce an enhancement given the potentially long-lasting effects of dopamine on HPC plasticity and learning.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Justification for the focus on D1 receptors was lacking.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose to focus on D1 receptors because previous studies have shown that these receptors are critical for memory formation or consolidation in the hippocampus. We have added a sentence justifying this in the results section.</p><p>“To test whether dopamine is required for trace fear memory formation, we administered the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 (0.1mg/kg) 30 minutes before training, as D1/D5 receptors have previously been shown to be critical for other types of hippocampus dependent memory and plasticity (Frey et al., 1990; Huang and Kandel, 1995; O’Carroll et al., 2006; Wagatsuma et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript provides convincing evidence that the neural signal is not an error- correcting one by including a predicted (by a tone) and unpredicted shock. One possibility is that perhaps the unpredicted shock could be predicted by the context. Some clarification on the behavioural procedures would help understand if indeed the unsignaled shock could be predicted by the context or not.</p></disp-quote><p>Mice always exhibit freezing in the training environment, so the context is definitely a predictor of shock. However, the tone is a much better predictor because it is always followed by shock while the mice spend a large amount of time in the context without being shocked. This is demonstrated by the fact that the same procedure used in the current experiments consistently produces more tone fear than context fear (Wilmot et al., 2019). While we did not do long-term memory tests here, we assume the same dissociation occurred as it has been observed very consistently across studies (Chowdhury et al., 2005; Kitamura et al., 2014; Wilmot et al., 2019). Nonetheless, it is possible that a difference between signaled and unsignaled groups was obscured by the context. We should note however, that differences between dopaminergic responses to cued and uncued rewards and aversive outcomes has been observed and these animals were also trained in the same context (Eshel et al., 2016; Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009; Pan et al., 2005; Schultz, 1998). Therefore, we believe this experiment does differentiate the observed dopamine response in the hippocampus from previously reported VTA dopamine prediction error signaling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 - tone termination in Tone only group - no change? Stats?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out this omission. We have added the stats to the figure legend. Although the response to tone termination decreased numerically, it did not change significantly across days. This is one point we may seek to clarify in future studies, as the difference between tone onset and termination responses is unexpected. Given the relatively small responses, it’s possible future studies with stronger signal (eg. GcAMP8) may find differences in the tone termination response across training days. This is one of the reasons we focused primarily on the responses to tone onset and shock in the rest of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 4 data - stimulation at time incongruent with the signal as a control for the timing of stim.</p></disp-quote><p>This is addressed above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig 5 - GRAB-NE - yohimbine seems to suppress the signal below the vehicle. Not the case for GRAB-DA. Is this sig? post-hoc stats?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, this does appear to be the case for GRAB-NE, and would not be entirely surprising given that there is likely a baseline level of NE (and dopamine) in the hippocampus that produces some degree of baseline fluorescence in the vehicle group. This signal could be reduced/abolished by blocking the sensor and preventing this baseline level of NE from binding and producing fluorescence. This may not be the same for the GRAB-DA for a variety of reasons – different sensor binding affinities, different baseline neurotransmitter levels, potentially non-equivalent drug doses, etc. Because of the large number of pairwise comparisons in this data (18), we did not make post-hoc pairwise comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Shock response curve - lines 466-474 - some explanation of what the pseudorandom order of shock presentation means.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following explanation to this section:</p><p>“…pseudorandom order, such that the shocks did not occur in ascending or descending order or follow the same pattern in each block,…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 126 - the extinction came out of the blue, it needs some introduction such as a statement that the animals were exposed to extinction training following conditioning.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following earlier in that same paragraph:</p><p>“On the second and third days, mice underwent extinction trials in which no shocks were administered.”</p><p>References in Response</p><p>Abercrombie ED, Keller RW, Zigmond MJ. 1988.
