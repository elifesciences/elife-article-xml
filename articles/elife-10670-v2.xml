arises slowly, if at all. The probability of resistance should be controlled by the rate of generation of resistance mutations. If many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously, then adaptation proceeds by soft selective sweeps in which multiple adaptive mutations spread concomitantly, but if adaptive mutations occur rarely in the population, then a single adaptive mutation should spread alone in a hard selective sweep. Here, we use 6717 HIV-1 consensus sequences from patients treated with first-line therapies between 1989 and 2013 to confirm that the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed accompanied with the expected transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. This suggests more generally that evolution proceeds via hard sweeps if resistance is unlikely and via soft sweeps if it is likely.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10670.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10670.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10670.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In the early days of HIV therapy, the strains of the virus that infected patients frequently evolved drug resistance and the therapies would often eventually fail. These treatments generally involved using a single anti-viral drug. Nowadays, better therapies involving combinations of several anti-viral drugs are available and drug resistance in HIV is a much rarer occurrence. This means that now a particular therapy may be an effective treatment for an HIV-infected individual over much longer periods of time.</p><p>A theory of population genetics predicts that when it is easy for a population to acquire a beneficial genetic mutation – like one that provides drug resistance – multiple versions of that mutation may spread in the population at the same time. This is called a soft selective sweep. However, when beneficial mutations occur only rarely, it is expected that only one version of that mutation will take over in a population, which is known as a hard selective sweep.</p><p>Here, Feder et al. test this theory using data from 6717 patients with HIV who were treated between 1989 and 2013 using a variety of different drug therapies. The experiments aimed to find out whether the transition from the older drug therapies –where the virus frequently acquired resistance – to the newer, more effective drugs was associated with a transition from soft to hard sweeps.</p><p>Feder et al. find that HIV more often evolved drug resistance via soft sweeps in patients treated with the less effective drug combinations (like those given in the early days of HIV treatment), while hard sweeps were more common with the more effective drug combinations. This suggests that good drug combinations may allow fewer drug resistance mutations to occur in the HIV population within a patient. This may be because there are fewer virus particles in these patients, or because the specific combinations of mutations that provide resistance occur less often. Feder et al.’s findings are a step towards understanding why modern HIV treatments work so well, which will ultimately help us find better treatments for other infectious diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10670.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10670.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Soft Sweeps</kwd><kwd>Drug Resistance</kwd><kwd>Within-host evolutionary</kwd><kwd>Evolutionary Dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI068581</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rhee</surname><given-names>Soo-Yon</given-names></name><name><surname>Holmes</surname><given-names>Susan P</given-names></name><name><surname>Shafer</surname><given-names>Robert W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSF GRFP, DGE-114747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Feder</surname><given-names>Alison F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM100366</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrov</surname><given-names>Dmitri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM097415</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petrov</surname><given-names>Dmitri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transition from bad to good treatments for HIV was accompanied by a shift from soft sweeps of many drug resistance mutations spreading simultaneously to harder sweeps of one drug resistant genotype at a time.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the first two decades of the HIV epidemic, HIV became a prime example of fast evolutionary change, especially because of the evolution of drug resistance quickly after initiation of treatment. Nowadays, HIV treatments are more clinically effective and the evolution of drug resistance has become much slower and often does not occur for years if at all. The rate at which evolution occurs has been the subject of considerable recent interest in the evolutionary biology community. Although traditionally evolution was thought to be slow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Darwin, 1859</xref>), there are a growing number of examples of fast evolution to selective pressures such as pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lopes et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Daborn et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Karasov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palumbi, 2001</xref>), industrialization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cook et al., 2012</xref>), or antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laehnemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nair et al., 2007</xref>). HIV represents an interesting case because its evolutionary speed in treated patients has changed drastically over time.</p><p>Population genetic theory suggests that whether populations evolve slowly or quickly is driven by the availability of adaptive mutations. In a large population with a high mutation rate, mutations may be available as standing genetic variation (pre-existing variation) or be generated anew every generation, allowing the population to adapt to its environment rapidly. If adaptive mutations are rare, because the population is small, the mutation rate is low, or only few specific mutations (or combinations of mutations) can help a population adapt, the population will likely adapt to its environment much more slowly.</p><p>The availability of adaptive mutations does not only change the rate of adaptation, it also changes how adaptation affects genetic diversity in a population. If adaptive mutations are rare, i.e., less than one adaptive mutation occurs per generation in the population, the first successful mutation is likely to rise to high frequency before any subsequent adaptive mutations reach appreciable frequencies (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This results in a hard selective sweep, in which the single adaptive mutation and the nearby linked mutations becomes fixed in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Hard selective sweeps sharply reduce genetic diversity in the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kaplan et al., 1989</xref>) in a similar manner to a strong genetic bottleneck.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10670.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Prediction of drug resistance acquisition with more and less effective treatments.</title><p>Among patients treated with more effective treatments (top), we predict HIV populations to have a lower probability of acquiring resistance per generation. As a result, the population must wait a long time for a beneficial genotype, so when resistance does occur, it will spread through the population in a hard selective sweep before other resistant genotypes emerge (<bold>A</bold>). Since resistance only occurs on a single genetic background (background mutations in grey), all sequences with resistance will be similar (<bold>B</bold>) and diversity following this type of selective sweep will be reduced (<bold>C</bold>). We can use the reduction of diversity to determine that a selective sweep is hard. In patients treated with less effective treatments (bottom), we predict HIV populations should have a higher probability of acquiring resistance per generation, so resistance will be acquired more quickly and selective sweeps of drug resistance mutations will be soft (<bold>D</bold>). We can detect these soft selective sweeps, because diversity remains high when resistance mutations on different genetic backgrounds rise in frequency simultaneously (<bold>E,F</bold>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10670.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10670.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-10670-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>In contrast, when adaptive mutations are common, i.e., more than one occurs per generation in the population, the same adaptive mutation may occur several times in a very short time span on different genetic backgrounds. These adaptive mutations can increase in frequency virtually simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>) and multiple genetic backgrounds are therefore expected to reach substantial frequencies with no single genetic background dominating the population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This pattern is known as a soft selective sweep and is expected to lead to almost no reduction of genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pennings and Hermisson, 2006</xref>), comparable to a mild bottleneck.</p><p>In HIV, the evolution of drug resistance was fast in patients on early anti-retroviral therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larder et al., 1989</xref>), but current multi-drug regimens have substantially slowed the rate of evolution of resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Martin et al., 2008</xref>). Although clinically effective drugs have decreased the rate of emergence of drug resistance, it is not clear what effect that they have had on the evolutionary dynamics of within-patient HIV populations. Specifically, population genetic theory predicts that populations should evolve primarily by soft sweeps when resistance is likely and by hard sweeps when resistance is rare. In essence, soft sweeps should mark cases of resistance that arise deterministically through many origins while hard sweeps mark cases of rare, 'unlucky' resistance.</p><p>However, these predictions have not been tested in HIV or, in fact, in any natural population. In this study, we ask whether the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed associated with a transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. If true, then in general, treatments in which resistance arises by soft sweeps might be predicted to have high rates of failure even before the rates of failure can be measured explicitly.</p><p>To test whether a transition from soft to hard sweeps has occurred, we look at the relationship between fixed drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and genetic diversity across 29 common anti-retroviral drug regimens. The expectation is that when hard selective sweeps predominate, we will find a negative correlation between the number of DRMs and genetic diversity in a population. On the other hand, when soft selective sweeps predominate, we expect to find no such correlation. We use 6717 HIV sequences from the same number of patients from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee et al., 2003</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://hivdb.stanford.edu/">https://hivdb.stanford.edu/</ext-link>). These sequences contain information about the number of DRMs and, as we will further explain in the next paragraph, they also contain information about genetic diversity in the viral population.</p><p>Most sequencing of HIV populations in patients is done with the intent to discover DRMs for diagnostic and therapeutic reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dunn et al., 2011</xref>). As such, in standard clinical practice, a sample from a patient’s entire HIV population is amplified via PCR and then sequenced using the traditional Sanger method resulting in a single consensus sequence. Genetic diversity may result in ambiguous calls (also referred to as mixtures) in the reported sequence, so that a signal of within-patient genetic diversity is retained even though this sequencing approach generates only a single sequence per patient. We use the ambiguous calls to quantify within-patient genetic diversity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, E</xref>, grey box), following several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouyos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poon et al., 2007</xref>). Although ambiguous calls are an imperfect measure of diversity, it has been shown that the signal from ambiguous calls can be reproduced between laboratories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shafer et al., 2001</xref>). By using ambiguous calls as a proxy for diversity, we are able to take advantage of a large number of HIV-1 sequences, allowing us to study the evolutionary dynamics of HIV drug resistance evolution in a historical perspective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Through examining HIV sequences of 6717 patients over the past two and a half decades in the presence of many different drug regimens, all sequenced using Sanger sequencing technology, we leverage ambiguous sequence calls to understand how the fixation of drug resistance mutations affects diversity. We find that, across all sequences, the presence of drug resistance mutations is associated with lower within-patient genetic diversity, marking the occurrence of selective sweeps. Second, we find that the extent of diversity reduction associated with drug resistance mutations varies with the clinical effectiveness of the treatment - effective drug treatments with low rates of virologic failure (such as NNRTI-based and boosted PI-based regimens) show strong reductions in diversity associated with each additional resistance mutation, a pattern more consistent with hard selective sweeps, whereas treatments that fail more often (such as regimens based only on NRTIs) show no reduction in diversity, a pattern consistent with soft selective sweeps. Although our results do not explain mechanistically how effective treatments lead to harder sweeps of drug resistance mutations, they suggest a more general principle: a lower rate of the production of adaptive mutations should be accompanied by harder sweeps.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequences and patients</title><p>We collected sequences of reverse transcriptase and/or protease genes from 6717 patients from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee et al., 2003</xref>). The sequences come from 120 different studies that were performed between 1989 and 2013. The 6717 patients represent all individuals in the database who were treated with exactly one drug regimen, usually comprising a combination therapy of multiple drugs (see Materials and methods: Data collection &amp; filtering). The patients’ viral populations were sequenced after at least some period of treatment, although treatment may or may not have ceased at the time of sequencing and treatment may or may not have failed. This virus from a patient was amplified via PCR, sequenced using the Sanger method and then was reported to the database as a single nucleotide sequence. We call this dataset the D-PCR dataset, for direct PCR.</p><p>All 6717 patients received some type of therapy (between 1 and 4 drugs), with the majority (77%) receiving a regimen of three drugs. Nearly all patients received one or two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI), usually paired with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or a protease inhibitor (PI), which was boosted with a low dose of ritonavir in some patients. HIV subtypes were varied, with the majority being B (36%), C (34%) or CRF01_AE (13%). None of the remaining subtypes contributed more than 5% of the total sample.</p><p>An additional dataset, which we call the clonal dataset, consisted of 11,653 sequences from 740 patients with multiple sequences per patient isolated through clonal amplification and subsequent Sanger sequencing. The clonal dataset was used for validation purposes only.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ambiguous calls are a good proxy for genetic diversity</title><p>We are interested in the effect of drug resistance evolution on within-patient genetic diversity, but in our main dataset, we only have one sequence per patient. To use this large dataset for our purposes, we therefore use ambiguous nucleotide calls as a proxy for within-patient genetic diversity. Although results from previous studies suggest that this approach is valid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouyos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shafer et al., 2001</xref>), we independently validate this measure through comparing the D-PCR and clonal datasets. Using the clonal sequences, within-patient diversity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) can be computed directly, giving an estimate of genetic diversity per site that does not rely on ambiguous calls. We compared the proportion of sequences with ambiguous calls at a site in the D-PCR dataset to the within-patient diversity (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>) at that site in the clonal dataset (see Materials and methods: Validation of ambiguous calls as genetic diversity measure). We find that clonal within-host nucleotide diversity has a high positive correlation with the percentage of nucleotide calls ambiguous in the D-PCR dataset (<italic>r</italic> = 0.91, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). A similar pattern holds at the amino acid level (<italic>r</italic> = 0.85, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). We therefore conclude that ambiguous calls are a reliable proxy for within-patient genetic diversity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Drug resistance mutations (DRMs) lower within-patient diversity</title><p>We ask whether across all sequences, the presence of a drug resistance mutation (DRM) is associated with lower within-patient diversity, the classical signature of a selective sweep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith and Haigh, 1974</xref>).

Among reverse transcriptase and protease DRMs, sequences with the DRM have lower diversity than those with the ancestral state in 14 of 16 cases, with 7 of the 16 being significantly lower at the 95% confidence level.

This could result from sequential selective sweeps of single DRMs each reducing diversity, or from a single selective sweep that fixes multiple DRMs. Indeed, we find that for sequences that have between 0 and 4 DRMs, additional DRMs are associated with reduced genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, p-value for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-test between diversity among sequences with 0 versus 1 is 7.2 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, between 1 and 2 is 1.6 × 10<sup>−5</sup>, between 2 and 3 is 1.1× 10<sup>−2</sup>, between 3 and 4 is 2.5 × 10<sup>−3</sup>). After 4 DRMs, subsequent DRMs do not significantly reduce diversity further. The observed pattern of DRMs associated with reduced diversity is mainly driven by the patients receiving NNRTI or boosted PI-based treatments, as can be seen when separating the above analysis by drug treatment category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Among patients treated with NRTIs alone or with unboosted PIs, this pattern is much less clear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). The observed pattern holds across the each of the most common subtypes separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Clinical effectiveness of anti-retroviral regimens</title><p>We have now shown that in general, each additional DRM is associated with reduced diversity, which is consistent with expectations of selective sweeps. We want to assess how this effect depends on the clinical effectiveness of the treatment. For the most common drugs in our dataset, we assess clinical drug treatment effectiveness categorically and quantitatively.</p><p>As a categorical approach, we separated regimens based on general clinical HIV-treatment recommendations where NNRTI-based treatments are preferred to NRTI-based treatments, and treatments based on ritonavir-boosted PIs (PI/r) are preferred to treatments based on unboosted PIs. These more and less effective groupings are the basis of comparisons in our parametric approach described below.</p><p>To measure effectiveness quantitatively, we conducted a literature search to determine the percentage of patients who have remained virologically suppressed after one year of treatment (see Materials and methods: Clinical effectiveness of antiretroviral treatments, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">3</xref>) for 21 different treatments with at least 50 sequences per treatment in our D-PCR dataset (see description of abundant treatment dataset in Materials and methods: Data collection &amp; filtering for more information.)

Less effective treatments on the other hand (such as those containing only NRTIs or unboosted PIs) likely allow replication of fairly large HIV populations so that adaptation is not limited by the generation of mutations. They should thus experience soft selective sweeps and little or no reduction of diversity with each additional DRM. Below we test this hypothesis by assessing the reduction of diversity associated with the presence of a DRM among treatments that vary in clinical effectiveness.</p><p>Before we are able to test this hypothesis, we have to deal with a peculiarity of our data. We found that even for sequences that carried no resistance mutations, more ambiguous calls were reported over time. This is likely due to increased awareness of genetic diversity in the HIV community, and not because diversity actually increased. We therefore employed a p-thinning routine to repeatedly subsample the data so that diversity measures would be comparable across years (see Materials and methods: p-thinning to adjust for the effect of year).</p><p>To determine whether the effect of DRMs on within-patient diversity depends on clinical treatment effectiveness, we first fit a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using the number of DRMs and sequence length to predict diversity as measured by the number of ambiguous calls. Because we found the subsampled number of ambiguous calls to be distributed according to a negative binomial distribution, we used a negative binomial error distribution (see Materials and Methods: Quantifying the relationship between clinical effectiveness and diversity reduction).

This is likely because the half-life of most unboosted PIs is sufficiently short that missed doses create conditions in which the virus is not suppressed. It is therefore possible that resistance is primarily found in patients with poor adherence, and in these patients, resistance could arise deterministically via soft sweeps. In addition, we may underestimate the number of DRMs for PIs, as some DRMs are likely to be outside of the sequenced regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Juno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rabi et al., 2013</xref>).

Whereas early antiretroviral treatments were associated with fast evolution of drug resistance and high rates of treatment failure, there are currently many combinations of drugs that are successful at keeping HIV-1 at low or undetectable levels for many years, preventing the evolution of resistance and the progression to AIDS. Indeed, the evolution of drug resistance has become fairly uncommon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). In this paper, we have shown that this shift from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance has been accompanied by a corresponding shift from soft selective sweeps (in which the same DRM occurs on multiple genetic backgrounds) to hard selective sweeps (in which a DRM occurs only a single time). This suggests that modern treatments have brought HIV into a regime where the viral population must wait until the correct mutation or combination of mutations is generated. This also means that for any given patient the acquisition of drug resistance has become at least partly an unlucky occurrence, in sharp contrast to the early days of HIV treatment in which all patients predictably failed treatment. Harder sweeps within well-treated patients are also consistent with the overall decrease in the rate of resistance.</p><p>We want to study how the evolutionary dynamics of selective sweeps have changed in the evolution of drug resistance over the past two and a half decades. Because it would be unethical to give subpar treatment to HIV infected patients, we can only investigate this question using historical data. The only type of data that is available for a wide range of treatments and time points is Sanger sequencing data, due to its importance in HIV research and diagnostic testing. Although we often have only one sequence per patient, it is important to note that there is still information present in these sequences about genetic diversity and selective sweeps. First, we used ambiguous nucleotide calls as a proxy for genetic diversity. Although we are not the first study to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kouyos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Poon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>), as far as we are aware, we are the first to use clonal sequences to validate its accuracy as a measure. Second, we can use the number of fixed drug resistance mutations to determine how much adaptation to treatment has taken place. We used a fairly conservative list of DRMs that are very unlikely to fix in the absence of the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mesplède et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gonzalez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cong et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, DRMs must have fixed as a result of strong positive selective pressure imposed by the drug, and are indicative of recent selective sweeps. We can then look at the correlation between the number of drug resistance mutations and genetic diversity and see if that relationship has changed across treatments and time. Because this approach relies only on widely-available Sanger sequences, we were able to compare 29 different treatments, from AZT monotherapy to treatments based on boosted PIs, sampled across more than two decades (1989–2013).</p><p>Examining the relationship between DRMs and diversity recapitulates expected results: we first find that across the entire dataset, sequences with a single DRM have lower genetic diversity than sequences without any DRMs. This result confirms a finding from a previous much smaller study looking at patients on NNRTI based treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pennings et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we find that having more DRMs is associated with a greater reduction in diversity. This pattern could be generated by successive selective sweeps, in which DRMs are fixed one by one and each selective sweep lowers the diversity further. Alternatively, multiple DRMs may have fixed simultaneously in a single selective sweep.</p><p>The key result of this paper (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is that drug resistance mutations are associated with reduced diversity in patients on effective treatments, whereas this pattern is not seen among patients on older treatments with low clinical effectiveness. For example, among patients given treatments with 50% effectiveness, sequences with 3 DRMs are predicted to have approximately the same number of ambiguous calls as those with 0 DRMs. In contrast, among those patients given treatments with 80% effectiveness, sequences with 3 DRMs are predicted to have over 50% fewer ambiguous calls than those with 0 DRMs, a substantial decrease in genetic diversity. Thus, the higher the treatment effectiveness, the more DRMs are associated with low genetic diversity. This is consistent with drug resistance evolution dominated by soft selective sweeps when failure rates were high, transitioning over time to evolution dominated by hard selective sweeps as treatments improved and failure rates became much lower. Clinically effective treatments are thus characterized by a more frequent occurrence of hard selective sweeps.</p><p>It is of interest to compare our new results to a previous study by one of us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pennings et al., 2014</xref>). Sequences in that study came from patients who were mostly treated with EFV + IDV, a combination that never became common and is not represented here, but which has an estimated effectiveness of 75% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staszewski et al., 1999</xref>). The study examined selective sweeps in those patients by looking at the fixation of a particular DRM, at amino acid 103 in RT, which changes from Lysine (K, wild type) to Asparagine (N, resistant). K103N is special because it can be caused by two different mutations, as the wild type codon AAA can mutate to AAT or AAC, both of which encode Asparagine. When focusing on patients whose virus acquired the K103N mutation, the study found that in some patients, both the AAT and AAC codons were found (which is clear evidence that a soft sweep has happened, see Figure 1 in the original paper), whereas in other cases only one of the two was there (which suggests that a hard sweep may have happened, see Figure 2 in the original paper). Because of the detailed data available for these patients, it was shown that both soft and hard sweeps were occurring almost equally often. Placing the 75% effectiveness of EFV+IDV in the context of our above results, this is also what we would have predicted. Now we know that this result (hard and soft selective sweeps occur) is not necessarily something that will be generally true for HIV, but rather it is a function of the effectiveness of the treatment. Had Pennings et al. had data from a much worse or much better treatment, they might have concluded that hard sweeps or soft sweeps were the rule in HIV.</p><p>The transition to highly effective treatments and hard selective sweeps was not abrupt. As visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, treatment effectiveness and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf61"><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>M</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> do not cluster into distinct groups based solely on the number and type of component drugs. The incremental changes in effectiveness and the evolutionary dynamics are worth noting because a simplified narrative sometimes suggests that solving the drug resistance problem in HIV was achieved simply by using three drugs instead of two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stearns and Koella, 2007</xref>). According to this narrative, HIV can always easily evolve resistance when treatment is with one or two drugs, but it is virtually impossible for the virus to become resistant to three drugs. In truth, only some specific combinations seem to lead to more favorable evolutionary dynamics for patients (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>Several potential mechanisms could drive the observation that more effective drug combinations drive hard sweeps in within-patient populations of HIV-1. Better drugs may allow for a faster collapse of population size, decreasing the probability that one or more ‘escape’ DRMs occurs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2014</xref>], although see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moreno-Gamez et al., 2015</xref>]). Alternatively, suppressed HIV populations may continue replicating at small numbers, and better drugs may cause this replicating population to be smaller than among patients given inferior drugs. Similarly, a treated patient may retain a reservoir of HIV unreachable by the treatment, and better drugs may make this reservoir smaller. If newer drugs have fewer side effects and therefore improve adherence among patients, this too could result in a smaller within-patient population size among patients treated with better drugs, and contribute to the decreased production of resistant genotypes. The effect could also be driven by standing genetic variation, if worse drugs would allow pre-existing mutations to establish, whereas better drugs make this less likely, for example, if a pre-existing mutation could only establish if it occurred in a small and specific compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Moreno-Gamez et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, more effective drug combinations may simply require more mutations on the same background (i.e., a higher genetic barrier to resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tang and Shafer, 2012</xref>]), so the effective mutation rate to a fully resistant genotype is lower. Our data do not give us sufficient resolution to distinguish between these hypotheses, and the true dynamics may be a combination of all of these factors. However, all these potential mechanisms work to reduce the rate of production of resistant genotypes and the principle is more general: if the probability of acquiring resistance is low, rare resistance should be generated by hard selective sweeps.</p><p>It is notable that we can detect differences in relative changes in diversity, given the constraints of our data. Our data are cross-sectional, from different patients treated with different regimens from many studies over more than two decades. We have sequences from only one or two genes, and so it is possible that there are DRMs or other selected mutations driving population dynamics outside of the sequenced regions (particularly among patients treated with protease inhibitors). The DRMs that are observed may be associated with variable selection coefficients and may therefore differ in their rate of expansion in the population and thus the associated signature of the selective sweep. Additionally, DRMs occurring later in the course of an infection may have smaller beneficial effects as compared to early DRMs. Different patients may have varying profiles of diversity at the time of diagnosis, which could also effect whether sweeps will be hard or soft. All of these items could serve to obscure the relationship between DRM fixation and changes in diversity, but our results appear robust despite the substantial noise.</p><p>Although our results appear robust, certain systematic biases could also affect our results. First, we observe an increase in the number of ambiguous calls through our study period. This is likely due to a greater awareness of within-patient diversity and improvements in sequencing technology. Having more ambiguous reads called in later years gives us more power to detect large decreases in diversity as compared to earlier years. As effective treatments come from later in the study period, this could lead to more observed hard sweeps among effective treatments. However, we believe that our conclusion is robust to this systematic bias as we used a conservative <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf62"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>-thinning procedure that explictly equalized the power to detect hard and soft sweeps across years.</p><p>Time can also factor into our analysis in other ways that are harder to control. Improved disease monitoring may mean that modern patients have a shorter time between the appearance of a DRM and its sequencing and discovery. This could result in hard selective sweep signatures that are more pronounced in later years because they are detected before they have had time to erode. However, Pennings et al. estimate that sweep signatures require a substantial amount of time to erode (on the order of months) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pennings et al., 2014</xref>), so we do not believe that this effect alone can explain the pattern. Alternatively, if DRMs acquired in response to earlier treatments have lower selection coefficients than treatments given more recently, early selective sweeps would take longer. Recombination could move DRMs to multiple genetic backgrounds before the mutation fixes in the population. This would also also result in muted changes in diversity among early treatments that could not be readily distinguished from the signatures of soft sweeps. However, there is no evidence that selection coefficients of DRMs among early treatments are smaller.</p><p>Finally, because our primary measure to understand the effect of the fixation of a drug resistance mutation is an internal comparison with other patients on the same treatment, we do not believe that our results could be generated solely by data heterogeneity. Further, that our results are robust to different measurements and filtering approaches suggests DRMs do indeed sweep differently in HIV populations subject to more or less effective treatments.</p><p>Drug resistance evolution is no longer the threat to HIV patients it once was and treatments exist that almost never lead to resistance. However, our observation that effective drug combinations lead to hard selective sweeps could be useful for improving treatments for other pathogens. Even among relatively small samples, if patients who acquire drug resistance mutations do not have a significant decrease in diversity relative to those who did not acquire drug resistance mutations, this might suggest that the fixing mutations are occurring via soft selective sweeps, and the treatment brings patients into a dangerous regime for drug resistance. Alternatively, if patients acquire drug resistance mutations, but those patients also have very little diversity, it may be that this is a safer treatment and that the emergence and fixation of drug resistance mutations was a relatively uncommon occurrence.</p><p>Looking at changes in diversity following a sweep in order to assess the mode of adaptation could be particularly well-suited to looking at evolution of cancer. While single cell sequences isolated from tumors have yielded promising insights about evolutionary dynamics, the process is invasive and relatively difficult. Sequencing tumor-free cancerous cells circulating in the blood provides less information, but can be done serially and provides a good measure of tumor heterogeneity. Applying a method such as ours to monitor changes in cell-free DNA diversity over time may allow us to determine if certain treatments reproducibly lead to soft sweeps and thus are very likely to fail in general.</p><p>Comparing treatment effectiveness with the occurrence of soft and hard selective sweeps may also provide supplementary information about additional risk factors among patients. In the case of HIV, we find that high effectiveness is associated with hard selective sweeps, which suggests that the the virus has a hard time evolving drug resistance, and the patients in whom resistance evolved are merely the unlucky ones. However, there may be cases where failure is rare, but associated with soft selective sweeps. Such a situation thus reflects a discordance between what happens within patients and what we see at a population level. This, in turn, may be indicative of a behavioral, genetic or virologic difference among the groups of patients and efforts should be made to find out how failing patients are different from non-failing patients.</p><p>In conclusion, we find that the study of diversity in viral populations with resistance can show differences in evolutionary pathways of adapting pathogenic populations and provides a concrete example of how population genetics theory can make substantive predictions about medically relevant problems. Next generation and single molecule sequencing have the capacity to bring much more precision in determining the dynamics of within-patient populations. However, we also urge researchers and clinicians to report more information concerning the diversity of pathogen populations, even in the form of minor allele frequency cut offs for calling ambiguous calls or raw sequencing data, as this might allow new insight from data that might be otherwise overlooked.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data collection and filtering</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Direct PCR (D-PCR) dataset</title><p>We collected one consensus sequence of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase gene per patient from 6717 patients across 120 different studies from the Stanford HIV Drug Resistance Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rhee et al., 2003</xref>).

Among patients receiving PIs, only patients with both protease and reverse transcriptase sequences were included.

The amino acid for that position would then be recorded K/N. All ambiguous calls at the nucleotide level were translated into ambiguous calls at the amino acid level, including if the ambiguous call reflected synonymous encodings (i.e., AAA and AAG are both Lysine, and the amino acid would be encoded K/K).

While all samples were Sanger sequenced, we do find that the number of recorded ambiguous calls increased over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>), possibly because the cut-off of calling a read as ambiguous became lower. This effect, taken on aggregate across all sequences was not significant (p=0.09, linear regression with year predicting the number of ambiguous calls). However, when examining only sequences with 0 DRMs, a strong positive correlation emerges, with each year associated with 0.56 more ambiguous calls per sequence (p=4.9 × 10<sup>−8</sup>). That the difference in effect can be seen in the zero DRM class but not among sequences with any number of DRMs underscores the strong interaction between low diversity and multiple DRMs among modern treatments.</p><p>Because the probability of calling a nucleotide as ambiguous has increased over time, we have potentially greater power to detect changes in the number of ambiguous reads with increasing number of DRMs. To account for this change in power, we used a p-thinning procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grandell, 1997</xref>) to control for the effect of year on the number of ambiguous calls.

We subsampled our data using these probabilities so that late and early years had comparable numbers of ambiguous calls. For example, in 2000, nearly twice as many ambiguous calls were reported as compared to 1989. Therefore, for each ambiguous call observed in a sequence from 2000, we include it in our sample with probability ∼1/2. Intuitively, this translates observations from later years into units of ambiguous calls that are comparable to those observed in 1989.

We therefore also performed subsampling using only data after and including 1995, which retained more ambiguous calls. This particular cutoff was chosen for two reasons. First, ambiguous calls were not reliably recorded until several landmark papers studying within-patient diversity were published in 1993 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Larder et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piatak et al., 1993</xref>). Second, before 1995, we have &lt;20 sequences/year, so we have much lower resolution to determine the rates of ambiguous read calling. This excluded only 45 sequences, and changed the linear model fit only slightly (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">N</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">m</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1995</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>465.96</mml:mn><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.24</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Using data only after and including 1995, the subsample effect for year <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf81"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf82"><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn id="XM24">1995</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi id="XM25">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) is calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf83"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn id="XM26">1995</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi id="XM27">i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1995</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn id="XM28">1995</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mn>1995</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi id="XM29">i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Although the linear fits are similar, the effect of the subsampling is less severe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

We found that the subsampled data visually fit a negative binomial distribution much more closely than a Poisson distribution, which is often used for count data (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>). In this model, length, the number of DRMs and an intercept term are fit as fixed effects, and the number of DRMs by treatment is fit as a random effect. This allows us to assess the relationship between diversity and the number of ambiguous reads separately for each treatment.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, it is shown that the presence of drug-resistant mutations result in lower in-patient diversity of the virus, suggesting that sweeps are occurring. It is also shown that more effective HIV treatments (according to several related definitions) lead to an increased anticorrelation between diversity and the number of drug resistance mutations (DRMs). This is interpreted as evidence that more efficacious drugs lead to harder selective sweeps and hence greater reductions in diversity per DRM. Overall this is an interesting manuscript that does its best to use data collected for another purpose to study an interesting issue in evolutionary dynamics.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>The following points need to be addressed, however, before the paper can be considered for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The Introduction would benefit from emphasizing the following points more carefully. The motivation for distinguishing between soft and hard selective sweeps is not described adequately (the discussion contains most of the salient points). It is also important to note in the very first paragraph that this paper is restricted to drug resistance mutations in treated populations. In untreated populations, the story is very different. The fact that more efficacious treatments lead to fewer resistant mutations is almost tautological. The connection between this effectiveness and a signature of the evolutionary dynamics of resistance is nice, and that is the point that needs to be emphasized.</p><p>2) Ambiguous calls from Sanger sequencing are used as a proxy for diversity because this is the best that can be done given the available data. A convincing argument is made suggesting that the ambiguous calls are at least a reasonable proxy, based on earlier work and analysis of data from multiple clones sequenced from individual patients. However, there could be additional factors correlated with treatment efficacy that also affect the fraction of ambiguous calls. For example, there may be an effect of the timing of the sample relative to the progression of the disease (e.g. relative to treatment failure). Since there is only one sample per individual, it is easy to imagine that sampling is done more often at treatment failure for less efficacious drugs, but not for more efficacious drugs. This doesn't necessarily confound the analysis, but it could potentially lead to a correlation between efficacy and ambiguous calls that does not have to do with the hardness of the sweeps. These sorts of caveats are unavoidable in this kind of study, but the potential problems should be acknowledged.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, why is the y-intercept higher for more efficacious drugs (i.e. why is diversity higher for samples with 0 DRMs)? It seems that the opposite could be true, since the more efficacious drugs should maintain the virus at lower population sizes, leading to less diversity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10670.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The following points need to be addressed, however, before the paper can be considered for publication in</italic> eLife</p><p><italic>. 1) The Introduction would benefit from emphasizing the following points more carefully.

A convincing argument is made suggesting that the ambiguous calls are at least a reasonable proxy, based on earlier work and analysis of data from multiple clones sequenced from individual patients. However, there could be additional factors correlated with treatment efficacy that also affect the fraction of ambiguous calls. For example, there may be an effect of the timing of the sample relative to the progression of the disease (e.g. relative to treatment failure). Since there is only one sample per individual, it is easy to imagine that sampling is done more often at treatment failure for less efficacious drugs, but not for more efficacious drugs. This doesn't necessarily confound the analysis, but it could potentially lead to a correlation between efficacy and ambiguous calls that does not have to do with the hardness of the sweeps. These sorts of caveats are unavoidable in this kind of study, but the potential problems should be acknowledged.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that we are working with a very noisy dataset with many potential confounding factors and it is important to be direct about the ways in which they might influence our results. While much of the information concerning caution about our analysis was present in the original draft, we have consolidated the information into an expanded set of paragraphs in the Discussion. We have further grouped these caveats into separate categories: 1) data-specific noise factors that should obscure the signal, 2) properties of the data that might contribute to our observed signal that we control for within the analysis and 3) properties of the data that might contribute to our observed signal that are not possible to control. For each of these potential biases, we discuss why we do not believe that they generate the patterns seen in our data. The particular issue related to treatment monitoring described by the reviewers is included in this third category. We believe that this new format should make it more apparent to readers the types of factors that must be considered in interpreting our results.</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, why is the y-intercept higher for more efficacious drugs (i.e. why is diversity higher for samples with 0 DRMs)? It seems that the opposite could be true, since the more efficacious drugs should maintain the virus at lower population sizes, leading to less diversity.</italic> </p><p>In investigating this issue, we found that the y-intercept was indeed higher for these more efficacious treatments. This effect is caused by the positive relationship between year and the probability of calling ambiguous reads. Therefore, better treatments (from later years) have a higher 0 DRM category than worse treatments (from earlier years). We controlled for the effect of year in the model, but the particular way in which that graph was plotted did not (and cannot) properly display the effect of year across the different treatments (as each treatment is comprised of patients from across multiple years). The more parsimonious solution to display this effect would be to rescale the number of ambiguous reads so that they are comparable across years.</p><p>We therefore modified our analysis slightly in order to account for this effect through employing a <italic>p</italic>-thinning procedure, in which the number of ambiguous reads per sequence was subsampled so that year effect was controlled for explicitly. Switching to this approach did not change any of our results in a substantive manner, and offered several advantages over our original approach:</p><p>A) We now examine ambiguous read data as counts instead of proportions, which better preserves the variance structure inherent in our data;</p><p>B) Since the number of ambiguous calls does not increase over time, we have comparable power to detect changes in the number of ambiguous calls with different numbers of DRMs among early treatments and late treatments;</p><p>C) Confidence intervals and summary statistics can be constructed from the different datasets of subsampled ambiguous reads, which allows for the results to be more interpretable.</p><p>To ensure that this approach was statistically sound, we had extensive conversation with Susan P Holmes of the Department of Statistics at Stanford University. We further believe that her contributions to improving the work merits authorship, and the author list has been updated accordingly.</p><p>In our new updated version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> (and their corresponding supplemental figures), we now plot model fits separately for the four different treatment categories, as opposed to the specific slopes for each treatment, which, upon further reflection, we believe were adequately captured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>. This new figure shows how the intercepts within the model are set to have the same 0 DRM diversity. This can now be done because the diversity for treatment types from different years are rescaled to be comparable before the model is fit.</p><p>The majority of the updated text in our resubmitted manuscript describes the <italic>p</italic>-thinning process and updated analysis in full detail. Although <italic>p</italic>-thinning makes the manuscript slightly more complicated, we believe that this approach is the best way to account for year changing throughout our sample period, and ultimately the fairest way to compare early and late treatments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
