Many effectors harbor N-terminal <italic>t</italic>rans<italic>m</italic>embrane <italic>d</italic>omains (TMDs) implicated in effector translocation across target cell membranes. However, the distribution of these TMD-containing effectors remains unknown. Here, we discover prePAAR, a conserved motif found in over 6000 putative TMD-containing effectors encoded predominantly by 15 genera of Proteobacteria. Based on differing numbers of TMDs, effectors group into two distinct classes that both require a member of the Eag family of T6SS chaperones for export. Co-crystal structures of class I and class II effector TMD-chaperone complexes from <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, respectively, reveals that Eag chaperones mimic transmembrane helical packing to stabilize effector TMDs. In addition to participating in the chaperone-TMD interface, we find that prePAAR residues mediate effector-VgrG spike interactions. Taken together, our findings reveal mechanisms of chaperone-mediated stabilization and secretion of two distinct families of T6SS membrane protein effectors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular chaperones</kwd><kwd>type VI secretion system</kwd><kwd>x-ray crystallography</kwd><kwd>protein transport</kwd><kwd>Gram-negative bacteria</kwd><kwd>interbacterial competition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-156129</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitney</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2017-05350</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitney</surname><given-names>John C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2018-04968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prehna</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT156214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McArthur</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raunser</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>34531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McArthur</surname><given-names>Andrew G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>37841</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Prehna</surname><given-names>Gerd</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A widespread family of chaperones functions to stabilize membrane protein effectors by mimicking transmembrane helical environments and promotes effector export by the bacterial type VI secretion system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Bacteria secrete proteins to facilitate interactions with their surrounding environment. In Gram-negative bacteria, the transport of proteins across cellular membranes often requires the use of specialized secretion apparatuses found within the cell envelope. One such pathway is the type VI secretion system (T6SS), which in many bacterial species functions to deliver antibacterial effector proteins from the cytoplasm directly into an adjacent bacterial cell via a one-step secretion event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Russell et al., 2011</xref>). A critical step that precedes type VI secretion is the selective recruitment of effectors to the T6SS apparatus. Recent work has shown that for many effectors this process requires chaperone proteins, which are thought to maintain effectors in a ‘secretion-competent’ state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Unterweger et al., 2017</xref>). However, to-date, no molecular-level evidence exists to support this idea.</p><p>The T6SS is comprised of two main components: a cell envelope-spanning membrane complex and a cytoplasmic bacteriophage tail-like complex. The latter contains a tube structure formed by many stacked copies of hexameric ring-shaped <italic>h</italic>emolysin <italic>c</italic>o-regulated <italic>p</italic>rotein (Hcp) capped by a single homotrimer of <italic>v</italic>aline-<italic>g</italic>lycine <italic>r</italic>epeat protein <italic>G</italic> (VgrG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mougous et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spínola-Amilibia et al., 2016</xref>). Together, these proteins form an assembly that resembles the tail-tube and spike components of contractile bacteriophage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Renault et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, VgrG proteins interact with a single copy of a cone-shaped <italic>p</italic>roline-<italic>a</italic>lanine-<italic>a</italic>lanine-<italic>a</italic>rginine (PAAR) domain-containing protein that forms the tip of the VgrG spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). Altogether, PAAR, Hcp and VgrG are necessary for T6SS function, and during a secretion event these components are themselves delivered into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cianfanelli et al., 2016a</xref>). Prior to its export from the cell, the bacteriophage tail-like complex is loaded with toxic effector proteins. In contrast to proteins that are exported by the general secretory pathway, T6SS effectors do not contain linear signal sequences that facilitate their recognition by the T6SS apparatus. Instead, effectors transit the T6SS via physical association with Hcp, VgrG, or PAAR proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cianfanelli et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in effector export, Hcp also possesses chaperone-like properties that facilitate cytoplasmic accumulation of Hcp-interacting effectors prior to their secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>). This chaperone activity has been attributed to the interior of the ~4 nm pore formed by hexameric Hcp rings, which are wide enough to accommodate small, single-domain effectors. Individual Hcp rings appear to possess affinity toward multiple unrelated effectors. However, the molecular basis for this promiscuous substrate recognition is unknown.</p><p>In contrast to their Hcp-associated counterparts, VgrG-linked effectors are typically comprised of multiple domains and often require effector-specific chaperones for stability and/or to facilitate their interaction with the VgrG spike. Thus far, three effector-specific chaperone families belonging to the DUF1795, DUF2169, and DUF4123 protein families have been described. Studies on representative DUF2169 and DUF4123 proteins indicate that these chaperones minimally form ternary complexes with their cognate effector and a PAAR protein to facilitate the ‘loading’ of the PAAR domain and effector onto their cognate VgrG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkinshaw et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, DUF1795 proteins, also known as <italic>e</italic>ffector<italic>-a</italic>ssociated <italic>g</italic>ene (Eag) chaperones, interact with so-called ‘evolved’ PAAR proteins in which the PAAR and toxin domains are found as a single polypeptide chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcoforado Diniz and Coulthurst, 2015</xref>). Biochemical characterization of the Eag chaperone EagT6 from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> found that this chaperone interacts with TMDs found in the N-terminal loading and translocation region of its associated effector, Tse6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). In the presence of lipid vesicles, Tse6 spontaneously inserts into membranes causing EagT6 chaperones to be released suggesting that EagT6 maintains the N-terminal TMDs in a pre-insertion state prior to toxin domain delivery across the inner membrane of target bacteria. However, it is not known whether the ‘solubilization’ of TMDs in aqueous environments represents a general role for Eag chaperones and if so, it is unclear how they maintain effector TMDs in a pre-insertion state.</p><p>In this work, we report the identification of prePAAR, a highly conserved motif that enabled the identification of over 6000 putative T6SS effectors, all of which possess N-terminal TMDs and co-occur in genomes with Eag chaperones. Further informatics analyses found that these candidate effectors can be categorized into one of two broadly defined classes. Class I effectors belong to the Rhs family of proteins, are comprised of ~1200 amino acids, and possess a single region of N-terminal TMDs. Class II effectors are ~450 amino acids in length and possess two regions of N-terminal TMDs. We validate our informatics approach by showing that a representative member of each effector class requires a cognate Eag chaperone for T6SS-dependent delivery into susceptible bacteria. Crystal structures of Eag chaperones in complex with the TMDs of cognate class I and class II effectors reveal the conformation of effector TMDs prior to their secretion and insertion into target cell membranes. In addition to participating in chaperone-effector interactions, structure-guided mutagenesis of hydrophilic residues within prePAAR show that this motif also enables effector interaction with its cognate VgrG. Collectively, our data provide the first high-resolution structural snapshots of T6SS effector-chaperone interactions and define the molecular determinants for effector TMD stabilization and recruitment to the T6SS apparatus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>prePAAR is a motif found in TMD-containing effectors that interact with Eag chaperones</title><p>Characterization of Eag chaperones and their associated effectors has thus far been limited to the EagT6-Tse6 and EagR1-RhsA chaperone-effector pairs from <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Serratia marcescens</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cianfanelli et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>). In both cases, the chaperone gene is found upstream of genes encoding its cognate effector and an immunity protein that protects the toxin-producing bacterium from self-intoxication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We previously showed that EagT6 interacts with the N-terminal TMDs of Tse6, an observation that led us to hypothesize a general role for Eag chaperones in ‘solubilizing’ hydrophobic TMDs of effectors in the aqueous environment of the cytoplasm so they can be loaded into the T6SS apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). However, evidence supporting this general role is lacking because homology-based searches for additional Eag chaperones can yield difficult to interpret results due to a scarcity of conserved residues and homology of this protein family to the phage protein DcrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samsonov et al., 2002</xref>), which is widely distributed in both T6SS-positive and T6SS-negative organisms. Similarly, the identification of N-terminal TMD-containing PAAR effectors that might require Eag chaperones is also challenging because many PAAR domain-containing effectors lack TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>), and aside from being comprised of hydrophobic residues, the TMDs themselves are poorly conserved.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The prePAAR motif is conserved across multiple bacterial genera and is found in T6SS effectors that interact with Eag chaperones.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genomic arrangement of T6SS chaperone-effector-immunity genes for characterized <italic>e</italic>ffector-<italic>a</italic>ssociated <italic>g</italic>ene family members (<italic>eag</italic>; shown in purple), which encode DUF1795 domain-containing chaperones.

Remarkably, the HMM we obtained revealed a nearly invariant AARxxDxxxH motif, which in Tse6 is found in the first 15 residues of the protein and is immediately N-terminal to its first TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In total, our query identified over 2054 proteins containing this motif (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Among these candidate effectors, our search identified the recently characterized toxins Tre1, Tas1, and DddA as well as many toxins of unknown function indicating that our approach may have identified T6SS effectors with novel biochemical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mok et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, prior to any knowledge of PAAR domains or Eag chaperones being involved in T6SS function, Zhang and colleagues noted the existence of this N-terminal motif in PAAR-containing proteins through an informatics analysis of bacterial nucleic acid degrading toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Here, they refer to the motif and its adjacent TMD region as ‘prePAARTM’ because these sequence elements co-occur with one another and because they are both found N-terminal to PAAR domains. We have chosen to refer to the motif as ‘prePAAR’ because, as described below, our data indicate it has a function that is distinct from the TMD regions.</p><p>Examination of our putative effector sequences revealed that prePAAR is substantially enriched in bacterial genera with characterized T6SSs including <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Burkholderia</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Escherichia</italic>, <italic>Enterobacter</italic>, <italic>Yersinia</italic>, and <italic>Serratia</italic>. Interestingly, no prePAAR motifs were identified in <italic>Vibrio</italic> despite an abundance of species within this genus possessing highly active bacteria-targeting T6SSs. We next obtained all 56,324 available genomes from NCBI for the abovementioned genera and found that 26,327 genomes encode at least one prePAAR motif. After removing all redundant sequences, 6101 unique prePAAR-containing proteins present across 5584 genomes were used for further analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, List C). In these genomes, we determined that approximately 90% encode a single prePAAR motif, although instances where prePAAR is present up to six times within a single genome were also identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if these unique proteins are probable TMD-containing T6SS effectors that require Eag chaperones for secretion, we next examined each prePAAR-containing protein and its associated genome for the following three criteria: (1) the existence of an Eag chaperone encoded in the same genome, (2) the presence of a downstream PAAR domain, and (3) predicted TMDs in the first 300 amino acids of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Käll et al., 2007</xref>). The location restriction in our TMD search was used in order to exclude C-terminal toxin domains that possess TMDs, which differ from N-terminal translocation TMDs in that they may not require chaperones for secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mariano et al., 2019</xref>). We searched each genome for Eag proteins using an HMM for DUF1795 and found that 99.5% (5554/5584) of prePAAR-containing genomes also possessed at least one <italic>eag</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2014</xref>). In approximately 14% of the 5554 genomes analyzed, the number of prePAAR motifs matched the number of Eag homologues. In the remainder of cases, the number of Eag homologous proteins exceeded the number of prePAAR motifs, with a weighted average of 2.5 paralogues per genome. As is the case with <italic>eagT6-tse6</italic> and <italic>eagR1-rhsA</italic>, ~90% of the identified prePAAR-containing effector genes appear directly beside an <italic>eag</italic> gene, whereas the remaining ~10% are found in isolation suggesting that their putative chaperone is encoded elsewhere in the genome. We removed pre-PAAR-containing protein fragments (proteins less than 100 amino acids in length) and further reduced redundancy by clustering sequences with 95% identity. Remarkably, in all but two of the remaining 1166 prePAAR-containing proteins, we identified a PAAR domain, indicating a probable functional relationship between prePAAR and PAAR. The two prePAAR-containing proteins lacking a PAAR domain were either adjacent to a gene encoding a PAAR domain-containing protein or directly beside T6SS structural genes. Finally, we searched 1166 prePAAR-containing proteins for TMDs and found that all protein sequences contained predicted TMDs with 86% having one region of TMDs and 14% having two regions of TMDs. In sum, our prePAAR-based search procedure identified thousands of candidate effector proteins possessing properties consistent with the requirement for an Eag chaperone for T6SS-dependent export.</p><p>To further analyze our collection of prePAAR-containing effectors, we built a phylogenetic tree from 1166 non-redundant effector sequences that represent the diversity present in our collection of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Interestingly, two distinct sizes of proteins emerged from this analysis: large prePAAR effectors that are on average 1196 amino acids in length and small prePAAR effectors comprised of an average of 443 amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As noted previously, all effectors contained predicted TMDs; however, large effectors almost exclusively contained a single region of TMDs N-terminal to their PAAR domain, whereas most small effectors contained TMD regions N- and C-terminal to their PAAR domain. To distinguish between these two domain architectures, we hereafter refer to large, single TMD region-containing prePAAR effectors as class I and small, two TMD region-containing prePAAR effectors as class II. Notably, class I effectors also contain numerous YD repeat sequences, which are a hallmark of <italic>r</italic>earrangement <italic>h</italic>ot<italic>s</italic>pot (Rhs) proteins that function to encapsulate secreted toxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Busby et al., 2013</xref>). We also found a small subset of these effectors are encoded by two separate ORFs, the first encoding prePAAR-TMD-PAAR and the second encoding a protein containing Rhs repeats and a C-terminal toxin domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Conversely, class II effectors are distinguished by a GxxxxGxxLxGxxxD motif in addition to their second TMD region.</p><p>As a first step toward validating our informatics approach for identifying Eag chaperone-effector pairs, we assessed the ability of several newly identified Eag chaperones to interact with the prePAAR-containing effector encoded in the same genome. We previously demonstrated that the class II effector Tse6 interacts with EagT6 and we similarly found that when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, Eag chaperones from <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and <italic>Serratia proteamaculans</italic> co-purified with their predicted cognate effector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Collectively, these findings indicate that prePAAR proteins constitute two classes of TMD-containing T6SS effectors and that representative members from both classes interact with Eag chaperones.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Eag chaperones are specific for cognate prePAAR effectors</title><p>We next sought to examine the specificity of Eag chaperones towards prePAAR effectors in a biologically relevant context. To accomplish this, we inspected our list of prePAAR effectors and found that the soil bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas protegens</italic> Pf-5 possesses both a class I and class II effector, encoded by the previously described effector genes <italic>rhsA</italic> and <italic>tne2</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the genome of this bacterium encodes two putative Eag chaperones, PFL_6095 and PFL_6099, which have 25% sequence identity between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). PFL_6095 is found upstream of <italic>rhsA</italic> and is likely co-transcribed with this effector, whereas PFL_6099 is not found next to either effector gene. To examine the relationship between these genes, we generated strains bearing single deletions in each effector and chaperone gene and conducted intraspecific growth competition assays against <italic>P. protegens</italic> recipient strains lacking the <italic>rhsA-rhsI</italic> or <italic>tne2-tni2</italic> effector-immunity pairs. We noted that protein secretion by the T6SS of <italic>P. protegens</italic> is substantially inhibited by the threonine phosphorylation pathway, so we additionally inactivated the threonine phosphatase encoding gene <italic>pppA</italic> in recipients to induce a ‘tit-for-tat’ counterattack by wild-type donor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mougous et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basler et al., 2013</xref>).

We next examined the stability-enhancing properties of PFL_6095 and PFL_6099 when expressed at native levels in <italic>P. protegens</italic>. Due to challenges associated with detecting RhsA and Tne2 in unconcentrated cell lysates, we constructed chromosomally encoded N-terminal decahistidine-tagged (his<sub>10</sub>) fusions of RhsA and Tne2 to facilitate the enrichment of these proteins from <italic>P. protegens</italic> and confirmed that these fusions did not compromise the ability of these effectors to intoxicate recipients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Collectively, these data suggest that Eag chaperones exhibit a high degree of specificity for their cognate effectors. Based on our characterization of these genes, we propose to rename PFL_6095 and PFL_6099 to <italic>eagR1</italic> and <italic>eagT2</italic>, respectively, to reflect their newfound role as chaperones for the prePAAR-containing effectors RhsA and Tne2.</p><p>Previous biochemical studies on the class II prePAAR effector Tse6 and its cognate chaperone EagT6 demonstrated that the two TMD regions of this effector each require an EagT6 chaperone for stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). These findings suggest that there may exist a physical limitation to the number of TMDs that a single EagT6 chaperone can stabilize. Our finding that class I prePAAR effectors contain only one TMD region suggests that these proteins may only possess one Eag interaction site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test this, we constructed a RhsA variant lacking its N-terminal region (RhsA<sub>∆NT</sub>) and co-expressed this truncated protein with EagR1 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Consistent with our hypothesis, affinity purification of RhsA<sub>∆NT</sub> showed that this truncated variant does not co-purify with EagR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Additionally, expression of the 74 residue N-terminal fragment of RhsA in isolation was sufficient for EagR1 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our data also demonstrate that in contrast to wild-type RhsA, RhsA<sub>∆NT</sub> is stable in the absence of EagR1 when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> indicating that the N-terminus imparts instability on the protein in the absence of its cognate chaperone.

T6SS effectors encoded downstream of <italic>vgrG</italic> genes typically rely on the encoded VgrG protein for delivery into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Whitney et al., 2014</xref>).

Furthermore, using a <italic>P. protegens</italic> strain expressing His<sub>10</sub>-tagged RhsA and FLAG-tagged VgrG1 from their native loci, we found that these proteins physically interact to form a complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To test if the absence of the chaperone-bound N-terminus affects the formation of this complex, we used our <italic>E. coli</italic> co-expression system to purify RhsA-EagR1-VgrG1 complexes. These experiments show that RhsA<sub>∆NT</sub> is not able to interact with VgrG1, even though this truncated protein possesses its PAAR domain, which in T6SS effectors lacking prePAAR and TMDs in their N-terminus, is sufficient for VgrG interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondage et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To gain insight into how EagR1 binding facilitates RhsA interaction with VgrG1, we next performed negative-stain electron microscopy (EM) to examine the configuration of each subunit within this complex.

Lastly, the class-averages of RhsA-EagR1-VgrG1 complexes revealed a close association of EagR1 and RhsA with the tip of the VgrG spike, which is likely mediated by the PAAR domain of RhsA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

A comparison of the chaperone structures in their apo and effector-bound states shows that upon effector binding, both chaperones ‘grip’ the prePAAR-TMD region of their cognate effector in a claw-like manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). Although our biochemical data indicate that Eag chaperones exhibit a high degree of specificity for their associated effector, the internal surface of the claw-shaped dimer contains a number of conserved residues that make critical interactions with the TM helices in both complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–F</xref>). For example, I22 and I24 of EagT6 create a hydrophobic surface in the ‘palm’ of the claw, which is flanked on either side by symmetrical hydrophobic surfaces comprised of A62, L66, L98, F104, and I113 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). Furthermore, the conserved hydrophilic residues S37, S41, Q58, and Q102 also interact with the bound effectors by making bifurcated hydrogen bonds to amide or carbonyl groups in the peptide backbone of the TM helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). These polar interactions between chaperone and effector TM helices are striking because they are reminiscent of polar interactions seen within the helical packing of alpha helical transmembrane proteins, which often use serine and glutamine residues to mediate inter-helical interactions via bifurcated hydrogen bonds between side chain and main chain atoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adamian and Liang, 2002</xref>). Additionally, EagT6 and SciW provide ‘knob-hole-like’ interactions, which also feature prominently in membrane protein packing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curran and Engelman, 2003</xref>). Knob-hole interactions involve a large hydrophobic residue on one TM helix acting as a ‘knob’ to fill the hole provide by a small residue such as glycine or alanine on another TM-helix. TM holes are typically created by GxxxG/A motifs such as those found in G19-A24 (Rhs1) and G25-A30 (Tse6). In this case, the conserved Eag chaperone residue L66 provides a knob for the A24/30 hole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). Given that the Eag chaperone dimer creates a hydrophobic environment with complementary knob-hole interactions for its cognate effector TM helices, and interacts with TM helices via side chain to main chain hydrogen bonds, we conclude that Eag chaperones provide an environment that mimics transmembrane helical packing to stabilize prePAAR effector TMDs in the cytoplasm prior to effector export from the cell.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Eag chaperones interact with effector TMDs by mimicking interhelical interactions of alpha helical membrane proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Alignment of Eag chaperones that interact with class I (SciW, EagR1) or class II (EagT6 and EagT2) prePAAR effectors plotted with secondary structure elements.

Interestingly, despite the abovementioned similarities between the SciW and EagT6 structures, the conformation of the N-terminal fragment of their bound prePAAR effector differs significantly. In the SciW complex, Rhs1<sub>NT</sub> adopts an asymmetric binding mode whereby the effector fragment does not make equivalent molecular contacts with both chains of the two-fold symmetrical chaperone dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). The first TM helix (residues 19–33) binds to the hydrophobic cavity of one SciW protomer whereas the remaining hydrophobic region of Rhs1, which consists of two anti-parallel alpha-helices connected by a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix, occupies the remainder of the binding surface. Phenylalanine residues F20 and F43 likely play an important role in the asymmetric binding of Rhs1 to SciW because their hydrophobic side chains insert into equivalent hydrophobic pockets found in each SciW protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). By contrast, Tse6<sub>NT</sub> exhibits a pseudosymmetric binding mode with EagT6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). In this structure, two alpha-helices of Tse6 each occupy equivalent Eag binding pockets and run in the opposite direction to match the antiparallel arrangement of the EagT6 dimer. For example, A7 and A30 of Tse6 interact with equivalent sites in their respective chaperone protomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>). These two helices, which consist of prePAAR and a TM helix, flank a central TM helix whose C-terminus extends into the solvent, likely indicating the location of the downstream PAAR domain in the full-length effector.</p><p>A lack of interpretable electron density prevented modelling of Rhs1’s entire AARxxDxxxH prePAAR motif in our Rhs1<sub>NT</sub>-SciW co-crystal structure. However, the DxxxH portion of this motif is part of a short 3<sub>10</sub> helix that orients the aspartate and histidine side chains such that they face outward into solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E–G</xref>). By contrast, we were able to model the entire prePAAR motif of Tse6<sub>NT</sub> and in this case, the motif forms an alpha helix that binds the hydrophobic pocket of an EagT6 protomer. In this structure, the two conserved alanine residues of prePAAR make contact with the EagT6 chaperone, whereas the arginine, aspartate and histidine residues are solvent exposed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>). Remarkably, despite existing in different secondary structure elements, the D11 and H15 prePAAR residues of Tse6 are located in a similar 3D location as their D9 and H13 counterparts in Rhs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). It should be noted that the modelled conformation of Tse6<sub>NT</sub> appears to be locked into place by crystal packing, suggesting that in solution Tse6’s prePAAR motif may exhibit significant conformational flexibility and can dissociate from EagT6 as is observed for the prePAAR motif of Rhs1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1H–I</xref>). In support of this, we previously showed that addition of detergent disrupts the interaction between EagT6 and Tse6 suggesting that Eag chaperone-effector interactions are labile, likely because chaperone dissociation is required prior to effector delivery into target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). Intriguingly, docking our high-resolution EagT6-Tse6<sub>NT</sub> crystal structure into our previously determined lower resolution Tse6-EagT6-VgrG1 cryo-EM map orients the D11 and H15 prePAAR residues of Tse6 in a position that suggests they interact with its PAAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In sum, our structural analyses of prePAAR shows that this region is likely dynamic, and its mode of interaction varies for class I and class II prePAAR effectors. However, both Eag chaperones bind the N-terminus of their cognate effector such that the conserved aspartate and histidine residues of prePAAR are positioned to potentially be involved in interactions with the downstream PAAR domain, and thus may play a role in effector-VgrG interactions.</p><p>To test if prePAAR influences PAAR function, we next conducted mutagenesis analysis on Tse6 because its PAAR-dependent interaction with its cognate VgrG protein, VgrG1a, can be monitored in vivo by western blot. During denaturing electrophoresis, Tse6 appears in two forms: (1) a high-molecular-weight species corresponding to Tse6-VgrG1a complex and (2) a low-molecular-weight species indicative of free Tse6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>).

Using this readout, we engineered <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains expressing Tse6 D11A and H15A single amino acid substitutions and a D11A/H15A double substitution and examined the consequences of these prePAAR mutations on Tse6 interactions. In support of a role in promoting proper folding of PAAR, Tse6-VgrG1a complex formation was substantially reduced in a strain expressing the Tse6<sup>D11A</sup> variant and abolished in a strain expressing Tse6<sup>D11A, H15A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We next examined the effect of these mutations on T6SS-dependent delivery of Tse6 into target cells by subjecting these <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains to growth competition assays against Tse6-sensitive recipients. In agreement with our biochemical data, strains expressing Tse6 harboring a D11A mutation exhibited a substantial reduction in co-culture fitness consistent with an inability of these mutant proteins to form a complex with VgrG1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>prePAAR is required for PAAR domain interaction with the VgrG spike.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of Tse6 from cell fractions of the indicated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strains.

Interestingly, this analysis suggested that the PAAR domain of Tse6 lacks an N-terminal segment, which, based on the structure of c1882, is potentially important for the proper folding of this domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). We next extended this structural analysis to include all PAAR domains of the prePAAR effectors that we experimentally confirmed bind Eag chaperones. In all cases, the N-terminal segment of each PAAR domain was missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We also noted that the prePAAR motif possesses significant sequence homology to the N-terminal segment of c1882, suggesting that even though this stretch of amino acids exists on the opposite side of the first TMD region of Tse6, it may comprise the missing segment of Tse6’s PAAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Lending further support to this hypothesis, when we artificially fused Tse6’s prePAAR motif (residues 1–16) with its PAAR domain (residues 77–163) and generated a structural model, we found that the first 16 residues of Tse6 fill the missing structural elements of Tse6’s PAAR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Based on this information, we hypothesized that prePAAR is necessary for PAAR domain function and thus, facilitates VgrG binding. To explore this experimentally, we assessed the effect of prePAAR on VgrG binding in vivo and in vitro. We started by generating two Tse6 mutants expressed from their native locus in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. The first mutant lacks prePAAR, TMD1, and TMD2 (Tse6<sup>∆prePAAR, ∆TMDs</sup>), while the second contains prePAAR fused to PAAR and thus lacks only its TMDs (Tse6<sup>∆TMDs</sup>). We next assessed the ability of these truncated forms of Tse6 to form a complex with VgrG1a in vivo, as described above. In these experiments, we found that prePAAR and PAAR are together both necessary and sufficient for the formation of Tse6-VgrG1a complexes in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Of note, the amount of the complex formed by the Tse6<sup>∆TMDs</sup> mutant is less than the parent strain, which may be due to unstable structural elements that arose from suboptimal boundaries selected for truncating the effector. We next assessed the formation of this complex in vitro and found that co-incubation of Tse6, EagT6 and VgrG1a after overexpression in <italic>E. coli</italic> leads to the formation of SDS-resistant Tse6-VgrG1a complexes, whereas doing so with a strain expressing Tse6<sup>D11A, H15A</sup> does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Importantly, these mutations do not affect overall levels of Tse6 in cells or affect its ability to bind to EagT6, indicating that these mutations do not have a global destabilizing effect on Tse6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the PAAR domains of prePAAR effectors exist as ‘split PAAR’ due to the presence of N-terminal TMDs.</p><p>In orphan PAAR proteins, such as c1882, DxxxH motifs are necessary for Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordination and are therefore necessary for proper folding of this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). In agreement with this precedent, the conserved histidine residue in the DxxxH portion of Tse6’s prePAAR motif is predicted to be in the same 3D position as the first zinc-coordinating histidine residue of c1882 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To extend this comparison further, we conducted in silico analyses to examine the evolutionary relationship and potential Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues in 564 orphan PAARs and 1765 prePAAR effectors. We found that orphan PAAR sequences are ancestral to split PAAR domains and that while orphan PAAR proteins typically contain a total of four histidine and/or cysteine Zn<sup>2+</sup>-coordinating residues, prePAAR effectors only contain three in their PAAR domain with the fourth likely being provided by the prePAAR motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In support of this prediction, we found that Tse6-VgrG1a complexes formed by the D11A or H15A variants were susceptible to heat treatment under denaturing conditions whereas the wild-type complex remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F–G</xref>). Collectively, our experimental data and informatics analyses indicate that unlike orphan PAAR proteins, which contain all the necessary molecular determinants for proper folding, prePAAR effectors may contain inherently unstable PAAR domains that require a prePAAR motif to ensure their proper folding thus enabling their interaction with their cognate VgrG protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model depicting the role of Eag chaperones and prePAAR in type VI secretion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PAAR proteins exist with or without prePAAR domains. Those that lack prePAAR (orphan), can interact with VgrG and form a functional T6SS spike complex without any additional factors. By contrast, prePAAR-containing effectors contain multiple domains (evolved) and likely require the prePAAR motif for proper folding of the PAAR domain and thus, loading onto the T6SS apparatus. (<bold>B</bold>) prePAAR-containing effectors can be divided into two classes: class I effectors have a single TMD and contain a C-terminal toxin domain that is likely housed within a Rhs cage whereas class II effectors contain two TMDs and do not possess a Rhs cage. TMD-chaperone and prePAAR-PAAR interactions are required for effector stability and VgrG interaction, respectively, for both classes of prePAAR effectors.

The proper functioning of these pathways requires the precise recruitment of effector proteins among hundreds of cytoplasmic proteins. Here, we use a combination of genetic, biochemical and structural approaches to investigate the mechanism of recruitment for a widespread family of membrane protein effectors exported by the T6SS. Our work demonstrates that the N-terminal region of these effectors possesses two structural elements that are critical for their delivery between bacterial cells by the T6SS apparatus. First, this region contains TMDs, which interact with the Eag family of chaperones and are proposed to play a role in effector translocation across the inner membrane of recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, this region possesses prePAAR, which we show is required for the proper functioning of PAAR, thereby facilitating the interaction of this domain with its cognate VgrG protein and enabling effector export by the T6SS.</p><p>The prePAAR motif is present in Eag-binding effectors prePAAR effectors constitute a new family of T6SS effectors that are defined by the existence of a prePAAR motif, N-terminal TMDs, a PAAR domain and a C-terminal toxin domain. Most notably, we show that this group of effectors co-occurs with Eag chaperones and that chaperone interaction with prePAAR effector TMDs is a conserved property of this protein family. While previous work has relied on genetic context to identify the cognate effector of an Eag chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alcoforado Diniz and Coulthurst, 2015</xref>), our use of the prePAAR motif as an effector discovery tool enables the identification of these effectors in any genetic context. Other families of chaperones, such as the DUF4123 or DUF2169 protein families, have also been shown to affect the stability and/or export of their cognate effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burkinshaw et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bondage et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pei et al., 2020</xref>). However, little is known about the specificity of these chaperones for their effector targets, which do not contain predicted N-terminal TMDs. DUF4123 chaperones are encoded next to effectors with diverse domain architectures and studies on several members of this family have shown chaperone interactions occur with domains of effectors possessing no apparent shared sequence properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liang et al., 2015</xref>). A lack of structural information for these and DUF2169 chaperones has hindered an understanding of why certain T6SS effectors require members of these chaperone families for export from the cell.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of Eag chaperones in binding effector TMDs and prePAAR</title><p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, EagR1 and EagT2 from <italic>P. protegens</italic> interact with and stabilize RhsA and Tne2, respectively, but not vice versa. The inability of these chaperones to interact with non-cognate effectors can be explained by the two starkly contrasting binding modes observed in our co-crystal structures. The class I prePAAR effector and RhsA homolog Rhs1 interacts with its cognate chaperone SciW in an asymmetric manner, whereas the class II effector and Tne2 homolog Tse6 adopts a pseudosymmetric binding mode whereby two separate alpha helices interact with each EagT6 chaperone protomer in a similar location. Our structural analyses suggest that Rhs1 residues F20 and F43 play a critical role in its asymmetric binding mode because the aromatic side chains of these amino acids insert into hydrophobic pockets present in SciW that are lacking in EagT6. The backs of these hydrophobic binding pockets in SciW are formed by residue G108, whereas in EagT6 the equivalent space is occupied by the side chain of F104. As such, the F20 and F43 side chains of Rhs1’s TMD are able to insert into the hydrophobic pockets of SciW but are unable to do so with EagT6 due to a steric clash that would occur with F104. Conversely, the equivalent residue to F20 in the TMD of Tse6 is A26. The small side chain of alanine lacks the volume needed to fill the hydrophobic binding pocket of SciW and thus this interaction would likely contribute less free energy of binding with SciW. We expect that these same structural features contribute to the effector specificity observed for EagR1 and EagT2 as these chaperones also possess an alanine and phenylalanine at the corresponding positions in their hydrophobic pockets. Furthermore, the equivalent positions to Rhs1 in the TMD of RhsA has large hydrophobic residues (I23/L46), whereas the TMD of Tne2 has an alanine residue (A26) that aligns with A26 of Tse6. Although our structural models and bioinformatic analyses of chaperone-effector pairs suggest this pattern of Eag chaperone specificity is widespread, additional biochemical experimentation will be needed to demonstrate the generalizability of these findings.</p><p>Another important difference observed in the class I and class II chaperone-effector interactions is the position of the prePAAR region in each chaperone-effector pair. The asymmetric chaperone-TMD interaction allows SciW to ‘shield’ the hydrophobic regions of Rhs1’s N-terminus from the aqueous milieu while also positioning its prePAAR motif in such a way that would allow it to interact with PAAR. By contrast, the pseudosymmetric binding mode of Tse6 to EagT6 appears to be much more dynamic as interpretable electron density for bound Tse6 was only observed when the effector fragment was held in place by interactions with an adjacent complex in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. Consequently, we speculate that even though the Tse6’s prePAAR motif appears less accessible than that of Rhs1, it is likely highly dynamic in solution and thus may adopt a markedly different conformation when in complex with PAAR.</p><p>Despite containing a primarily beta-sheet secondary structure, Eag chaperones interact with effector TMDs by mimicking the interactions that occur between the helices of alpha-helical membrane proteins, which, to our knowledge, is a unique mechanism for a chaperone-effector interaction. Upon binding their cognate effector, we hypothesize that Eag chaperones not only shield effector TMDs from solvent but also distort their structure to prevent potential hairpin formation and erroneous insertion into the inner membrane of the effector-producing cell. Because Eag-interacting TMDs have likely evolved to insert into bacterial membranes, a mechanism to prevent self-insertion is probably necessary prior to export. Recent work studying the secretion of TMD-containing effectors of the bacterial type III and type IV secretion systems found that shielding TMDs to prevent inner membrane insertion is a critical step for proper targeting to the secretion apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krampen et al., 2018</xref>). However, membrane protein effectors of these secretion systems have evolved to target eukaryotic, not bacterial, membranes and thus may not require stringent control of TMD conformation prior to export. Indeed, unlike the Eag chaperones presented here, a previously studied T3SS chaperone was shown not to distort the conformation of effector TMDs, whose conformation remained similar before and after membrane insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Current evidence also suggests that Eag chaperones are not secreted by the T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cianfanelli et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). This leads to two important questions: (1) when do Eag chaperones dissociate from their cognate effector? (2) How do effector TMDs remain stable after their dissociation from the chaperone? Although no definitive answers exist for either of these questions, given that effector-chaperone interactions are maintained after effector-VgrG complex formation, chaperone dissociation presumably occurs immediately before or during a T6SS firing event. One way this could be accomplished is through chaperone interactions with components of the T6SS membrane and/or baseplate subcomplexes, which might induce chaperone-effector dissociation. The lumen of the T6SS apparatus may also serve to mitigate the susceptibility to degradation observed for prePAAR effectors in the absence of Eag chaperones because the inner chamber of the T6SS apparatus may shield effectors from the protein homeostasis machinery of the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>prePAAR-containing proteins contain C-terminal toxin domains that act in the cytoplasm</title><p>Studies conducted in several different bacteria suggest that many T6SSs export multiple effectors during a single firing event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cianfanelli et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hood et al., 2010</xref>). The precise subcellular location for effector delivery in recipient cells is not well understood; however, it is noteworthy that many effectors that interact with Hcp or C-terminal extensions of VgrG target periplasmic structures such as peptidoglycan or membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Flaugnatti et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silverman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brooks et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">LaCourse et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, all characterized prePAAR proteins act on cytoplasmic targets by mechanisms that include the hydrolysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADP<sup>+</sup>, ADP-ribosylation of FtsZ, pyrophosphorylation of ADP and ATP, and deamination of cytidine bases in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ting et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmad et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mok et al., 2020</xref>). This observation supports the proposal that the TMDs in prePAAR effectors function to promote toxin entry into the cytoplasm of target cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quentin et al., 2018</xref>). Two possibilities for how this occurs include a discrete toxin translocation event that takes place after the initial delivery of effectors into the target cell periplasm or that effectors are delivered directly into the target cell cytoplasm during a T6SS firing event. The large size of Rhs repeat-containing class I prePAAR effectors favors the latter model because it is unlikely that the 2–3 N-terminal TM helices found in these proteins could form a translocation pore for the C-terminal toxin domain. Instead, we propose that the TMDs of prePAAR effectors acts as molecular grease that coats the tip of the VgrG spike allowing it to effectively penetrate target cell membranes during a T6SS firing event. It should be noted that PAAR effectors with nuclease activity that lack N-terminal TMDs have been identified, suggesting that other cell entry mechanisms likely exist, and future work may address whether these proteins have important motifs or domains that permit an alternative translocation mechanism into recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pissaridou et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jana et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>prePAAR is required for PAAR function and effector export by the T6SS</title><p>Crystal structures of single domain PAAR proteins suggest that this domain folds independently and is highly modular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed in many instances, PAAR domains appear in isolation (orphan PAAR) and do not require additional binding partners to interact with VgrG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wood et al., 2019</xref>). The initial characterization of PAAR domains established seven groups of PAAR proteins, with the most abundant being orphan PAARs (55% of 1353 PAAR proteins) while the remaining groups represent PAAR proteins with N- and/or C-terminal extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shneider et al., 2013</xref>). Our data demonstrate that PAAR domains with N-terminal extensions possess prePAAR, which we predict may be required for the proper folding of the downstream PAAR domain. Based on our structural modelling and sequence alignments, the ability of prePAAR to assist with PAAR domain folding may in part be due to its participation in coordinating the zinc ion found near the tip of this cone-shaped protein. Our sequence analysis also suggests that while orphan PAARs contain four zinc-coordinating histidine and/or cysteine residues, the PAAR domain of prePAAR effectors contains only three, suggesting that the fourth ligand required for tetrahedrally coordinated Zn<sup>2+</sup> is provided by prePAAR. In this way, the PAAR domain of prePAAR effectors is split into two components, which likely come together to form a structure that can interact with VgrG and undergo T6SS-mediated export. One consequence of this ‘split PAAR’ domain arrangement is that the TMDs are tethered to PAAR via their N- and C-terminus, which would restrict the mobility of the TMDs and ensure their positioning on the surface of PAAR. We speculate that the proper arrangement of prePAAR effector TMDs on the surface of PAAR is likely critical for the ability of the T6SS spike complex to effectively penetrate target cell membranes during a T6SS firing event. Future studies focused on capturing high-resolution structural snapshots of assembled prePAAR-TMD-PAAR complexes will be needed to further support this proposed mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our mechanistic dissection of prePAAR effectors and their cognate chaperones has revealed fundamental new insights into bacterial toxin export and membrane protein trafficking.

We predicted the transmembrane (TM) helices in proteins first using TMHMM (v2.0), Phobius web server, and TMbase (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/">https://embnet.vital-it.ch/software/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Krogh et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Käll et al., 2007</xref>). Using TMHMM, we defined a TM region to include TM helices that were less than or equal to 25 amino acids apart. Therefore, any TM helix that was greater than 25 amino acids apart from another TM helix would be considered part of a new TM region. Any effector considered to have no TM or three TM regions were analyzed with Phobius with the same criteria as with TMHMM. Any effector considered to have no TM or three TM regions using Phobius, were analyzed with TMbase where we used the strongly preferred model and only interpreted TM helices with a score greater than 1450. In this model, any TM helices within the first 120 amino acids is one TM region and any number of TM helices between 200 and 300 amino acids were another region. MAFFT (v7.455) was used to align the sequences using the `--auto` option and the alignment was then trimmed to remove gaps using trimAl (v1.4) and the `-gt 0.8 -cons 80' options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>).

We then used the previously mentioned 2054 effector sequences from UniProtKB and filtered to only use 1765 sequences with an AARxxDxxxH motif.

To explore the relationship between the orphan PAAR sequences and the PAAR domain sequences of the prePAAR effector, we generated two phylogenetic trees. First, we truncated the prePAAR effector sequences to only the first 300 amino acids as an estimation of the PAAR domain location. Using the orphan PAAR sequences and the shortened prePAAR effector sequences, we created a phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) using previously described methods. Next, we wanted to determine the relationship between orphan PAAR sequences and PAAR domain sequences in the prePAAR effectors.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Rajan Sankaranarayanan as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.

Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript deals with the elucidation of the mechanism by which bacteria deliver a set of effectors using type VI secretion system to other bacteria. Using bioinformatics approaches, the authors have identified a prePAAR motif in a set of effectors and classified them into two major families. Using structural, biochemical and in vivo approaches, the authors show the importance of the motif in loading the effector molecule on to the type VI assembly using Eag chaperone. The results are also interesting in demonstrating that the chaperone-effector pairing is specific.

The authors have identified a prePAAR motif in Eag-dependent TMD containing effectors of T6SS and segregate them into two broad classes. Further, the authors provide in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that the effector and Eag binding is specific. Earlier, the same group has shown that TMD containing effectors require chaperone assistance for loading on to VgrG protein of the type VI assembly and for eventually getting delivered to the recipient bacteria. Here, the authors have also solved the crystal structure of both class I and class II effector molecules in complex with their cognate chaperones which revealed the atomic details of the interaction. Interestingly, the newly identified prePAAR motif is shown to be essential for loading the effector molecule onto VgrG and its delivery. Overall, the work is well done and I would recommend publication after addressing the concerns that are listed below.</p><p>a) The authors justify the use of &quot;prePAAR&quot; by quoting the earlier work by Zhang et al., 2011. However, it looks like the term prePAAR was not introduced then and the Zhang et al. work refers to the N-terminal region to PAAR domain, which includes the newly identified motif (current study) as well as the TMD. Therefore, the authors have to clearly define what exactly do they mean by prePAAR at the first instance and follow the same throughout. To provide better clarity, since “prePAAR” indicates everything N-terminal to PAAR domain therefore it may be better to use an alternative term for the newly identified motif.</p><p>b) Based on the data shown in Figure 6F, the authors conclude that prePAAR interacts with PAAR domain. However, this claim needs to be directly proven by including a pull-down of PAAR domain with an N-terminal construct having prePAAR point mutants (as in Figure 6A, B and G) or just prePAAR, instead of the N-terminal construct (prePAAR + TMD).</p><p>c) One interesting finding of the manuscript is the fidelity of the chaperone-effector pairing. However, the authors fail to comment on this fidelity based on the crystal structure information they have obtained. By attempting a simple modelling approach of cross-pairs, they may be able to provide a rationale in terms of the structural basis for this cognate pairing.</p><p>d) The authors have an interesting proposition that H15 of prePAAR motif participates in Zn+2 binding that eventually helps in PAAR domain folding. However, it is perplexing that the D11A mutant of the effector is compromised in VgrG binding and also inducing toxicity in the target bacteria, while the H15A mutant is similar to wild type (Figure 6A, B and G). Therefore, this proposition needs a reconsideration. Can the authors provide any evidence for the importance of Zn+2 binding in the folding of the PAAR domain?</p><p>e) The authors should consider the following suggestions for preparing a more coherent schematic of the entire finding depicted in Figure 7. (1) prePAAR can be depicted at the tip of PAAR domain as the current depiction is misleading where prePAAR is shown at the interface of PAAR domain and VgrG. However, the authors do not seem to have provided any evidence for prePAAR and VgrG interaction. (2) As per the structural knowledge (from this work and previous studies), it is clear that the chaperones are symmetric dimers and therefore the schematics should represent the same throughout the manuscript. (3) From the model (Figure 7B), it appears that binding of prePAAR to PAAR domain is dependent on TMD-chaperone binding. However, there is no experimental evidence for such sequential binding. (4) Authors should provide an explanation for their statement that split PAAR is an “evolved” version of PAAR domain and the same needs to be included in the Discussion. Why it cannot be the other way around? Also, it is worth considering the possibility that in split-PAARs the stabilization of PAAR domain with prePAAR may provide structural rigidity to the TMD for effective insertion into the membrane.</p><p>f) In the Abstract, the authors state &quot;…our findings define the mechanism of chaperone assisted secretion of a widespread family of T6SS membrane protein effectors&quot;. It appears that the significant part of this claim is already made in their earlier work (Quentin et al., 2018) and therefore the authors need to make a clear distinction.</p><p>g) The authors have shown that mutations in pre-PAAR affect the binding of the effector to VgrG. However, there is no evidence which shows that prePAAR has any direct role in PAAR domain folding and therefore the lines in the Abstract, &quot;…we find that prePAAR functions to facilitate proper folding of the downstream PAAR domain…&quot; needs to be looked at.</p><p>h) In the Abstract and Introduction, the author should also mention the number of genera which are spanned by these 6000 putative TMD containing effectors as this number does not directly signify the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The results presented by Ahmad et al. provide an in-depth molecular understanding and novel concepts on previously open questions in the T6SS field, especially those related to chaperone/adapter protein activity. The work is appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, and the authors provide a convincing body of evidence to support their claims. The work is solid, nicely presented and easy to follow. I note that I am not a structural biologist and therefore unable to provide an expert opinion on the structural portions of the work, although they seem reasonable. I have no major comments and no additional experiments are required.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62816.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The identification and the role of prePAAR motif is central to the manuscript.

As we describe in detail in our responses to reviewer #1, we were able to partially address this reviewer’s concern by generating new chromosomal mutations in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that show prePAAR is both necessary and sufficient for PAAR-dependent Tse6-VgrG interactions in vivo, even in the absence of effector TMDs and EagT6 (new Figure 6D). However, in contrast to our in vivo findings, we found that the Tse6<sup>D11A</sup> and Tse6<sup>D11A, H15A</sup> prePAAR mutants still interact with PAAR in vitro. These experiments using purified components have revealed the complexities associated with assessing interdomain effector interactions in vitro and a proper dissection of this interaction will require extensive structural and biophysical characterization that is beyond the scope of this work. In light of this, we have removed the data from Figure 6F in the original manuscript, readjusted the figure and added in a new Figure 6D that shows our new in vivo results.

Because our work demonstrates that prePAAR and the TMDs likely have distinct roles in T6S, we decided to refer to prePAAR and the TMD regions separately. We apologize for our lack of clarity with regards to our nomenclature and we have clarified this in our revised manuscript (subsection “prePAAR is a motif found in TMD-containing effectors that interact with Eag chaperones”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Based on the data shown in Figure 6F, the authors conclude that prePAAR interacts with PAAR domain. However, this claim needs to be directly proven by including a pull-down of PAAR domain with an N-terminal construct having prePAAR point mutants (as in Figure 6A, B and G) or just prePAAR, instead of the N-terminal construct (prePAAR + TMD).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up a good point. Over the past month, we conducted a set of experiments designed to address this concern and these experiments revealed two important insights. First, we found that a prePAAR-PAAR fusion can form stable Tse6-VgrG complexes in vivo in <italic>P. aeruginosa.</italic> Second, we found that the nature of the interaction between the prePAAR motif and the PAAR domain are more nuanced that previously appreciated and challenging to assess in vitro. We have summarized three separate experiments that were attempted to address the reviewer’s point and based on the data described below, we have removed the blot in Figure 6F, readjusted the figure by moving some panels to Figure 6—figure supplement 1 for clarity and adding a new Figure 6D, which contains our new in vivo findings. A comprehensive structural and biophysical characterization of prePAAR-PAAR interactions will be the subject of future work in our lab but we feel that this is beyond the scope of the current study. As is, we believe that the in vivo data shown in Figure 6A and D and the in vitro data shown in 6E is sufficient to highlight the importance of prePAAR in affecting the PAAR-dependent Tse6-VgrG interaction and have removed parts of the text that alluded to prePAAR having a direct role in PAAR folding.</p><p>Experiment 1: we generated a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> chromosomal mutant in <italic>tse6</italic> that results in prePAAR being fused directly to PAAR by deleting both effector TMDs and conducted a western blot to assess the formation of a PAAR-dependent Tse6-VgrG complex in vivo. As we have shown in this work and our previous work (Quentin et al., 2018), the formation of this complex allows us to determine if PAAR is functional in vivo and in the context of this work, can be used to determine if prePAAR influences PAAR function. We found that the SDS-resistant Tse6-VgrG complex forms in a manner that is dependent on the prePAAR motif. This suggests that in conjunction with PAAR, prePAAR alone is sufficient for VgrG interaction with Tse6 and therefore it likely affects PAAR folding.</p><p>Experiment 2: we co-expressed Eag-VSV-G and PAAR-FLAG with a double mutation-containing N-terminal fragment of Tse6 (NT-Tse6 <sup>D11A, H15A</sup>) and conducted a pull-down using the N-terminal Tse6 fragments as bait, as done for the wild-type fragment in Figure 6F. We found that both the wild-type and double mutant pulled-down PAAR. Based on these data, we concluded that studying these two purified protein fragments in vitro does not recapitulate the molecular interactions that we observe in cells (Figure 6A).</p><p>Experiment 3: we fused prePAAR to the C-terminus of maltose-binding protein (MBP). We used prePAAR sequences from Tse6 and Rhs1 and attempted pull-down experiments using the Tse6 or Rhs1 PAAR proteins. We used either His<sub>6</sub>-tagged MBP fusions or PAAR (the prey protein in either case was FLAG-tagged) for this experiment. The constructs were tested both when co-expressed or expressed separately and co-purified. We found that in all cases, the presence of the prePAAR motif did not affect the amount of PAAR or MBP-prePAAR recovered. As with experiment 2, these data also indicate that our in vitro system is not recapitulating what we observe in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>For experiment 1, it is important to note that we detected less Tse6-VgrG complex in a strain expressing the prePAAR-PAAR fusion compared to the parental background. This may be attributable to a miscalculation in determining the ideal boundaries to truncate the effector and suggests that the PAAR domain is sensitive to misfolding when the effector is truncated. Therefore, for experiments 2 and 3, it is possible that the boundaries we used to study the PAAR domain in isolation inadvertently exposed surfaces on this protein that promote promiscuous binding independent of the prePAAR motif. Our predictions for the PAAR domain boundaries are based on orphan PAAR sequences, which, as shown in the manuscript, differ from the PAAR sequences found in Tse6/Rhs1-like effectors. The cryo-EM density for the Tse6 PAAR domain from our previous work (Quentin et al., 2018) is also too low resolution to make an accurate prediction for domain boundaries. Further experimentation will be needed to identify the exact boundaries that produce stable variants of these domains that behave similar to the full-length proteins in vivo. We also realize we can further extend experiment 1 to include a D11A/H15A double mutation. However, we felt that the generation of this mutant in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> would be redundant with our point mutant data on the full-length effector shown in Figure 6A. Additionally, because the strain expressing the Tse6 prePAAR-PAAR fusion has significantly less detectable Tse6-VgrG complex, we would prefer to test multiple fusions of prePAAR-PAAR and subsequently generate the double mutant in those strains as well to conduct a more comprehensive analysis of prePAAR-PAAR binding both in vivo and in vitro.</p><p>Based on these experiments and the conclusions we have drawn from them, we have adjusted our manuscript in order to tone down our assertion that prePAAR plays a role in catalyzing the folding of PAAR domains. These changes were made to the Abstract, Introduction, Results and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) One interesting finding of the manuscript is the fidelity of the chaperone-effector pairing. However, the authors fail to comment on this fidelity based on the crystal structure information they have obtained. By attempting a simple modelling approach of cross-pairs, they may be able to provide a rationale in terms of the structural basis for this cognate pairing.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added additional discussion on how our co-crystal structures may provide a model for Eag-effector cognate pairing. We have added these points in the Discussion section entitled “Role of Eag chaperones in binding effector TMDs and prePAAR” Briefly, there are symmetrical hydrophobic pockets present in chaperones that interact with class I prePAAR effectors that allow for the insertion of large hydrophobic residues present in the effector TMD (F/I indicated by black arrow in the alignment below). These hydrophobic pockets are absent in chaperones that interact with class II effectors and thus we predict that a steric clash would occur that would prevent non-cognate pairing.</p><p>We have a provided a small figure of the TMD alignments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Figure showing the alignment of Class 1 (SciW and EagR1) and Class 2 (EagT6 and Tne2) prePAAR-TMD regions studied in this manuscript.</title><p>The black arrows indicate the residues that may contribute to asymmetric vs. pseudosymmetric binding.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-62816-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) The authors have an interesting proposition that H15 of prePAAR motif participates in Zn+2 binding that eventually helps in PAAR domain folding.

Therefore, this proposition needs a reconsideration. Can the authors provide any evidence for the importance of Zn+2 binding in the folding of the PAAR domain?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point about the role of Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding in PAAR domain folding. Our structural model of the Tse6 PAAR domain and its structural alignment with the orphan PAAR c1882 shows that the H15 residue in Tse6 structurally overlaps with the first histidine in c1882, which is known to coordinate Zn<sup>2+</sup> (shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B). These data, in addition to the informatics analysis showing the conservation of the H residue in prePAAR and orphan PAARs (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C), only suggest that H15 in Tse6 takes part in Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding. However, we show that mutation of this residue in the prePAAR motif of Tse6 does not affect the formation of a Tse6<sup>H15A</sup>-VgrG complex in vivo or in vitro but does sensitize this complex to denaturation by boiling (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E). Thus, the PAAR domain of the Tse6<sup>H15A</sup> complex may lack some structural integrity but maintains its overall architecture and its ability to bind VgrG.</p><p>In the initial characterization of PAAR proteins, it was found that Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding residues are conserved across homologs and always appear to be localized to the “tip” of the PAAR protein (Shneider et al., 2013). Because there are multiple residues that bind Zn<sup>2+</sup> and these residues are all located far away from the base of the protein, it could be that a single mutation at this site would not significantly alter the folding of the PAAR domain and thus abrogate its binding to VgrG. The D11 residue, however, is predicted to be localized near the base of the PAAR domain, where it potentially mediates important intramolecular interactions that are necessary to stabilize the folding of this region and mediate its interaction with VgrG. It is possible that the H15 residue tethers the prePAAR motif to the PAAR domain, whereas the D11 residue contributes important electrostatic interactions that are necessary for overall PAAR domain folding.</p><p>At this time, the question of whether Zn<sup>2+</sup> affects PAAR folding is out of the scope of this paper because we feel that the high-resolution structural characterization of an Eag chaperone in complex with the prePAAR-TMD-PAAR region of an effector is the most direct way to determine the specific interactions between prePAAR residues and the PAAR domain or its bound zinc ion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>e) The authors should consider the following suggestions for preparing a more coherent schematic of the entire finding depicted in Figure 7. (1) prePAAR can be depicted at the tip of PAAR domain as the current depiction is misleading where prePAAR is shown at the interface of PAAR domain and VgrG. However, the authors do not seem to have provided any evidence for prePAAR and VgrG interaction. (2) As per the structural knowledge (from this work and previous studies), it is clear that the chaperones are symmetric dimers and therefore the schematics should represent the same throughout the manuscript. (3) From the model (Figure 7B), it appears that binding of prePAAR to PAAR domain is dependent on TMD-chaperone binding. However, there is no experimental evidence for such sequential binding. (4) Authors should provide an explanation for their statement that split PAAR is an “evolved” version of PAAR domain and the same needs to be included in the Discussion. Why it cannot be the other way around? Also, it is worth considering the possibility that in split-PAARs the stabilization of PAAR domain with prePAAR may provide structural rigidity to the TMD for effective insertion into the membrane.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up several important points about the figure and we have addressed their concerns in sequence. (1) We have changed the position of prePAAR in the figure to depict an interaction solely with the PAAR domain and not VgrG. (2) We have changed the cartoon of the chaperone to be symmetric in both Figures 1B, 7B and C. (3) While the reviewer is correct in that there is no direct evidence to show that the chaperone must bind the TMD before prePAAR can bind PAAR, we believe that it is important to show this interaction in this way. The chaperone gene and effector gene are found in the same operon and co-transcribed, as shown in Figure 1A. Based on our current and previous work, we know that the TMDs of prePAAR effectors are unstable and must be stabilized by the chaperone. If the chaperone is translated first, it is likely that it will bind the TMDs as they are translated, rather than bind a fully translated prePAAR-TMD-PAAR effector. Binding prePAAR and the TMDs in this way may orient these regions to facilitate proper binding with PAAR (as suggested by Figure 5H). (4) We agree with the reviewer that an explanation of the relationship between orphan PAARs and split PAARs is required in the Results and in the Discussion. To understand the relationship between these PAAR proteins, we constructed a phylogram of orphan and split PAAR (prePAAR-TMD-PAAR) proteins. For this analysis, we used the 564 orphan PAAR and 1,765 split PAAR sequences from Figure 6—figure supplement 1C. The split PAAR sequences are significantly longer than the orphan PAAR sequences due to the presence of the TMD. To more accurately identify boundaries for the PAAR domain in the split PAAR sequences, we built a hidden Markov model using the representative PAAR proteins from our analysis in Figure 1G. We used the hidden Markov model established from this analysis to identify the PAAR domain across the 1,765 split PAAR sequences and constructed a phylogenetic tree using the same methods as done for analysis in Figure 1. We found that all orphan PAAR sequences grouped at the root of the tree suggesting that they are a common ancestor to the PAAR domain of prePAAR-containing effector sequences (added in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and updated Materials and methods).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>f) In the Abstract, the authors state &quot;…our findings define the mechanism of chaperone assisted secretion of a widespread family of T6SS membrane protein effectors&quot;. It appears that the significant part of this claim is already made in their earlier work (Quentin et al., 2018) and therefore the authors need to make a clear distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. To address this, we have changed the last sentence of the Abstract to the following: “Taken together, our findings reveal mechanisms of chaperone-mediated stabilization and secretion of two distinct families of T6SS membrane protein effectors.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>g) The authors have shown that mutations in pre-PAAR affect the binding of the effector to VgrG. However, there is no evidence which shows that prePAAR has any direct role in PAAR domain folding and therefore the lines in the Abstract, &quot;…we find that prePAAR functions to facilitate proper folding of the downstream PAAR domain…&quot; needs to be looked at.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence to the following: “In addition to participating in the chaperone-TMD interface, we find that prePAAR residues mediate effector-VgrG spike interactions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>h) In Abstract and Introduction, the author should also mention the number of genera which are spanned by these 6000 putative TMD containing effectors as this number does not directly signify the impact of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the number of effectors is only significant if we state the number of genera these are found in. Therefore, we have changed the Abstract to include the line “encoded predominantly by 15 genera of Proteobacteria” to better highlight the widespread distribution of these effectors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
