Detecting the absence of an expected threat is key for threat extinction learning and an essential process for the behavioural treatment of anxiety-related disorders. One possible mechanism underlying extinction learning is a dopaminergic mismatch signal that encodes the absence of an expected threat. Here we show that such a dopamine-related pathway underlies extinction learning in humans. Dopaminergic enhancement via administration of L-DOPA (vs. Placebo) was associated with reduced retention of differential psychophysiological threat responses at later test, which was mediated by activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex that was specific to extinction learning. L-DOPA administration enhanced signals at the time-point of an expected, but omitted threat in extinction learning within the nucleus accumbens, which were functionally coupled with the ventral tegmental area and the amygdala. Computational modelling of threat expectancies further revealed prediction error encoding in nucleus accumbens that was reduced when L-DOPA was administered. Our results thereby provide evidence that extinction learning is influenced by L-DOPA and provide a mechanistic perspective to augment extinction learning by dopaminergic enhancement in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nucleus accumbens</kwd><kwd>vmPFC</kwd><kwd>amygdala</kwd><kwd>Dopamine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project B10 (INST 211/755) of the Collaborative Research Center TRR58</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esser</surname><given-names>Roland</given-names></name><name><surname>Haaker</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA 7470/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haaker</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>collaborative research centre SFB TRR 169</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korn</surname><given-names>Christoph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emmy Noether Research Group (392443797)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Korn</surname><given-names>Christoph W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Encoding an expected, but absent, threat is modulated by dopaminergic neurotransmission that regulates success of extinction learning in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In order to thrive in dangerous environments, it is important to know when threats are disappearing and situations become safe. As such, safety learning is central for adaptive behaviour and deficits characterise symptoms in a wide range of anxiety-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duits et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fenster et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lissek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>). Yet, the neuropharmacological mechanism to augment safety learning by encoding the absence of potential threats or aversive outcomes in humans are not completely understood.</p><p>Safety learning is often investigated in laboratory protocols of extinction training. Here, a learned predictor (conditioned stimulus, CS) for an aversive outcome (unconditioned stimulus, US) is turning into a safety signal when the expected aversive outcome is omitted. This omission of the expected US after CS presentation is thought to drive extinction or safety learning. Extinction learning is held to involve learning of a new CSâno US association that inhibits the acquired CSâUS association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bouton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bouton and Nelson, 1994</xref>). However, it is only incompletely understood which neural system in humans detects the omission of the expected aversive outcome and, hence, initiates a shift from threat to safety. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsenberg et al., 2018</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mueller et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salinas-HernÃ¡ndez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aksoy-Aksel et al., 2021</xref>) revealed that the omission of an expected aversive outcomes depends on signals in the dopaminergic system. In rodents, this involved dopaminergic neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the medial prefrontal cortex, as well as projections between the VTA and nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, these neural regions were also found to underpin the processing of rewarding outcomes. When signalling rewards, this system does not simply detect a rewarding outcome, but codes a difference between the expected reward and the actual outcome in form of an expectancy violation or prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). In other words, reward-related response in the VTA, nucleus accumbens, and vmPFC reflect outcomes that are better than expected.</p><p>Similarly, the omission of an expected aversive US, which could be framed as âbetter than expectedâ, might well be under the influence of a dopaminergic signal: At the time-point of US omission, a dopaminergic system might encode an expectancy violation that signals the difference between the expected aversive US and the omitted aversive outcome (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kalisch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nasser and McNally, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sartori and Singewald, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Even though this idea has not been formally tested, it is supported by two functional neuroimaging study in humans. These studies provided initial evidence that computational modelling of an prediction error for the omitted aversive outcome during extinction training involves activity in the nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thiele et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raczka et al., 2011</xref>) and that this activity was modulated by a genetic variance of the dopamine transporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raczka et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, there is cross-species evidence for enhanced extinction memory consolidation by augmented dopaminergic transmission after extinction training (by administration of L-DOPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlicher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haaker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haaker et al., 2013</xref>]). These latter studies suggest that dopaminergic enhancement of extinction memory retrieval is mediated by augmenting activity in the ventral part of the medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), a structure that is central for extinction learning and memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Milad and Quirk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phelps et al., 2004</xref>). It is, however, not clear if enhancing of dopaminergic neurotransmission would strengthen extinction <italic>learning</italic> by modulating vmPFC activity.</p><p>In this study, we tested if extinction learning is associated with activity changes in the vmPFC and if such activity is modulated by administration of the dopaminergic precursor L-DOPA. We further tested if the unexpected omission of the US during extinction learning is coded in midbrain pathways that connect the VTA and the nucleus accumbens and if activity within this pathway is modulated by L-DOPA. Based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlicher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haaker et al., 2013</xref>), we hypothesised that L-DOPA administration before extinction training would decrease threat responses at retention tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioural and physiological outcome measures</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Acquisition of CSâUS contingencies on day 1</title><p>Participants in both groups learned CSâUS contingencies during acquisition training, which was indicated by a CS-type main effect that consisted of enhanced responses to the CS+ as compared to the CSâ in all dependent measurements, namely binary (yes/no), trial-wise US expectancy ratings (CS-type main effect in rmANOVAs: US expectancy F(1,44) = 203.9, p&lt;0.001, Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.823, mean difference: 0.578 Â± 0.660/0.496 [95% CI], see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), SCR (F(1,43) = 41.7, p&lt;0.001, Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.493, mean difference: 0.088 Â± 0.115/0.061 [95% CI], see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and fear ratings: (F(1,44) = 116.0, p&lt;0.001, Î·<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.725, mean difference: 0.361 Â± 0.428/0.294 [95% CI]; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref> for full statistics, means and CI.

In accordance with our hypothesis, we found lower differential ratings of fear (CS+ â CSâ) at the beginning of day two in the L-DOPA group when compared to placebo controls, but this difference was not supported when correcting for multiple comparisons (one-sided, post hoc independent t-test: L-DOPA &lt; Placebo, t(41)=1.911, p(uncorr)=0.032, p(FWE-corr)=0.064, Cohenâs d: â0.583, L-DOPA mean: 0.430 Â± 0.523 [SD], Placebo mean: 0.682 Â± 0.322 [SD], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Exploratory analyses suggested that this effect might be driven by lower ratings to the CS+ and the extinction context (presented as the ITI) in the L-DOPA group, but none of these comparisons survived correction for multiple testing (p-values (FWE) &gt; 0.256, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>, see supplementary results for fear ratings without range-correction). Hence, we found no statistical support for reduced differential fear appraisal of the CSs in the L-DOPA group, as compared to the Placebo group.

To this end, we examined brain regions that increased their activity to a decrease of US expectation. In order to examine extinction learning by decreasing US expectancy, we contrasted responses during extinction training to CS+ trials when participants expected no US against CS+ trials in which participants expected an US (i.e., expectation of no US &gt; expectation of a US). We found that decreasing US expectancy was accompanied by more pronounced signalling in the right vmPFC in the L-DOPA group as compared to the placebo group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

(<bold>c</bold>) The effect of L-DOPA treatment on conditioned responses (SCR CS+ &gt; CSâ) during retrieval test was fully mediated via the activity of the vmPFC in extinction learning.

There was further evidence for a full mediation of drug treatment (L-DOPA vs. Placebo) on conditioned responses by an indirect effect of vmPFC activity within a mediation model using quasi-bayesian procedures (Î² = 0.0563, 95% confidence intervals = 0.007â0.12, p=0.038, N = 40,1000 samples, N = 40); bootstrapping yielded comparable results (Î² = 0.056, 95% confidence intervals = 0.007â0.14, p=0.044). a.u. = arbitrary units, vmPFC = ventromedial prefrontalcortex, CS = conditioned stimulus, US = unconditioned stimulus, SCR = skin conductance responses.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65280-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Next, we tested if this difference in the right vmPFC activity was related to individual differences in the retrieval of conditioned threat responses. A previous study indicated that vmPFC activation during extinction learning was associated with retention of extinction memory (measured as differential SCR) 24 hr later (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlicher et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, we found that higher vmPFC activation is associated with reduced differential SCR, which could indicate better individual extinction memory retention, 24 hr later (two-sided Pearson correlation: t(38) = â2.18, p-value=0.035, r = â0.3273302 [95% CI: â0.58 to 0.018, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>]). Hence, vmPFC responses during extinction learning were elevated after L-DOPA administration, and such enhanced vmPFC activity is associated with reduced retrieval of differential threat responses (measured as SCR) 24 hr later. Importantly, there was no difference between groups detectable in SCRs during retrieval test, which might have biased this correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Makin and Orban de Xivry, 2019</xref>). However, it might be possible that L-DOPA treatment has an indirect effect on SCR during retrieval test, which was mediated by vmPFC activity during extinction learning. Indeed, we found support for a treatment effect of L-DOPA on SCRs during retrieval test, which was indirectly mediated by vmPFC activity during extinction learning (average causal mediation effect: Î² = 0.0563, 95% confidence intervals = 0.007â0.12, p=0.038, quasi-Bayesian estimation of confidence intervals with 1000 iterations, N = 40, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for detailed statistics).</p><p>As such, L-DOPA strengthens vmPFC activation that accompanies decreasing expectation of the US (i.e., extinction learning), and this enhancement of vmPFC activity mediates reduced differential SCR 24 hr later (i.e., better extinction memory retrieval). Our results thereby reveal an effect of L-DOPA on memory retrieval that is meditated by augmentation of vmPFC activity, which was specific for the individual time course of decreasing expectancy of the aversive outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Omission of an expected aversive outcome is coded in the nucleus accumbens and modulated by L-DOPA</title><p>In the next step, we examined if decreasing US expectancy during extinction learning is driven by the omission of the US in form of an expectancy violation (i.e., prediction error) and if this process is modulated by dopamine. To this end, we used the modelled US expectancy ratings from the Rescorla-WagnerâPearce-Hall hybrid model that has previously been used to describe computational processes in associative threat learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LindstrÃ¶m et al., 2018</xref>). In order to test for signals that reflect expectancy violation, we examined responses at the time-point of US omission that correlated with the modelled prediction error term (parametric modulator). We found that activation in the right nucleus accumbens in the Placebo group reflected the time course of the modelled prediction error term, but not in the L-DOPA group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). This suggests that the nucleus accumbens in the Placebo group was responsive towards US omissions, only if an aversive outcome was still expected, which reflects the violation of the expected, yet omitted, value. This was supported by an exploratory follow-up analysis, revealing a cluster in the right nucleus accumbens that reflected the expected value at the time-point of US omission (MNI xyz: 9, 18, â4; <italic>Z</italic> = 3.04; p<sub>FWE-SVC</sub>=0.040). Of course, prediction error and value are closely related, since the outcome during extinction training was the same for all trials. Next, we tested, if the L-DOPA group might show responses within the nucleus accumbens at the time-point of US omission that are independent of the prediction error (i.e., categorical responses). We found that categorical responses at the time-point of US were higher in the L-DOPA group, compared to Placebo group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In fact, responses in the Placebo group were negative, which would be in line with our finding of expectancy violation coding in the nucleus accumbens: Expectancy violation would be characterised by positive responses in early trials of extinction training (when US expectancy is high) and decreases rapidly with decreasing US expectancy, which could lead to negative responses when averaging a whole time course. Enhancing dopaminergic transmission (i.e., in the L-DOPA group), in contrast, seems to sustain responses to the omitted outcomes in the nucleus accumbens, irrespectively of expectancy of the US or value caching. Hence, our results imply a dopaminergic modulation of expectancy violation in the nucleus accumbens when expected aversive outcomes are omitted during extinction training. Note that within exploratory analyses that were suggested by the reviewers we found no activity in the nucleus accumbens to CS+ presentations during extinction (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>), which might suggest that the nucleus accumbens might rather be involved in processing of expectancy violation coding when expected USs are omitted. During acquisition training, however, we found activity in the nucleus accumbens to presentations of the CS+ (as well as in the contrast CS+ &gt; CSâ) and the US (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>), which resembles salience encoding, as reported in a recent study in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Omission of expected aversive outcomes in the NAcc is modulated by L-DOPA during extinction training on day 2.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) At the time-point of US omission, the Placebo group exhibited expectancy violation coding (fitted prediction error term) in the right NAcc, which was not observed in participants that received L-DOPA (one-sided independent t-test Placebo &gt; L-DOPA, MNI xyz: 9, 18,â4; <italic>Z</italic> = 3.02; p<sub>FWE-SVC</sub>=0.043).

Dopaminergic enhancement during extinction learning augmented extinction memory at a later test, which was mediated by extinctio-learnin-specific vmPFC responses (i.e., reflecting decreasing US expectancy). Decreased US expectancy in extinction learning was further driven by dopaminergic activity within the nucleus accumbens that signalled the omission of expected aversive outcomes. This activity in the nucleus accumbens, when the US was omitted, was functionally coupled with the midbrain SN/VTA complex, as well as the amygdala. Additionally, we found reduced differential SCRs (CS+ &gt; CSâ, without strong support for a reduction in CS+ responses, only) in the L-DOPA group when compared with Placebo after the reinstatement one day after extinction learning. Hence, our results suggest that the activity of the nucleus accumbens, but not the vmPFC, encoded absent threats (prediction error) during extinction learning. Decreasing expectancy of threats in extinction learning was reflected by vmPFC activity, which was further enhanced by L-DOPA. These results corroborate findings from reinforcement learning in which outcome and prediction error signals were encoded in the striatum, whereas value was reflected by prefrontal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jocham et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The main finding is that L-DOPA reduced retrieval of conditioned threat responses (SCR) by a mediation through enhanced vmPFC activity. In detail, we found that enhancement of dopaminergic transmission by the administration of L-DOPA (as compared to Placebo) during extinction learning enhanced individual neural signalling in the vmPFC that reflected the reduction of US expectation (i.e., extinction learning). These enhanced vmPFC responses were found to mediate the effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retention, measured as reduced differential SCRs 24 hr later. Besides the implication of the vmPFC in safety signal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2017</xref>) and threat extinction in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kalisch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milad et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Phelps et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ball et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Merz et al., 2018</xref>), our results align specifically with a previous finding of vmPFC activity pattern during extinction memory consolidation that mediates the effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerlicher et al., 2018</xref>). Our results extend this finding on memory consolidation by providing a link between dopaminergic effects on vmPFC activity that are specific for individual extinction <italic>learning</italic> (i.e., decreasing US expectancy) and augmentation of extinction <italic>memory</italic>. L-DOPA might have the potential to improve (otherwise low, see parameter estimates in the Placebo group, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) vmPFC activity during extinction learning. Hence, rather than enhancing extinction learning per se, L-DOPA administration seems to augment vmPFC responses that accompany decreased US expectancy. This suggests a benefit of L-DOPA for extinction <italic>learning</italic> processes. Our findings would fit to previous results that link the benefit of neuropharmacological intervention in extinction learning to decreasing threat expectancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sartori and Singewald, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerlicher et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hofmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smits et al., 2013</xref>). Thereby, L-DOPA might have the potential for a psychopharmacological treatment that augments threat extinction learning instead of dampening overall threat responses, like classic anxiolytics. Additionally, we found that L-DOPA administration during extinction training reduced differential SCRs after reinstatement, which aligns with a finding of decreased SCRs after reinstatement by L-DOPA administration that followed extinction training in women diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cisler et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>A second set of our results implicate that decrement of US expectancy in extinction training involves a dopaminergic coding of expectancy violation in form of a prediction error at the time-point of US omission. In detail, administration of L-DOPA enhanced general (categorical) activity during omitted US, which was paralleled by reduced prediction error signals that we found in the placebo group. The enhanced general activity in the nucleus accumbens to omitted outcomes might results from enhanced activity in dopaminergic projections from midbrain, which would be in line with L-DOPA-induced dopamine release in the midbrain in humans at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Black et al., 2015</xref>). L-DOPA has further been found to activate otherwise silent dopaminergic neurons in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grace, 2008</xref>), which thereby might enhance activity in the nucleus accumbens in general. In parallel, L-DOPA could have induced inhibitory signals (via dopamine D2-receptors) that limit phasic burst-firing and thereby reduce the pattern of prediction error encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>). Such a shift in striatal activity by L-DOPA would fit to the observation of an opposite effect by blockade of dopamine D2 receptors (using haloperidol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">WÃ¤chtler et al., 2020</xref>]): reduced categorical activity during (rewarding) outcomes and enhanced prediction error signals. Our findings furthermore align with a negative association between striatal dopamine synthesis capacity (measured by radiolabelled L-DOPA during positron emission tomography) and BOLD responses related to reward prediction errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schlagenhauf et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, higher dopamine synthesis capacity (indicated by uptake of L-DOPA in the striatum) was associated with lower prediction error related BOLD activity.</p><p>Our study was intentionally not designed to disentangle details of expectancy violation coding of omitted USs, but rather to provide a scenario of safety learning. While we cannot disentangle encoding of salience and expectancy violation in the nucleus accumbens within our experiment, we conducted additional analyses in order to differentiate activity to the omitted US from other salient events like the CS+ or the US. During extinction training, we found no involvement of the nucleus accumbens during presentations of the CS+, which is more in line with coding of expectancy violation rather than salience (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>). During acquisition training, however, the nucleus accumbens was associated with salience encoding, since we found activation to presentations of the CS+ (and in the contrast CS+ &gt; CSâ), as well as the US (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1n</xref>). Additionally, we found during acquisition training a connectivity between the nucleus accumbens and the VTA during CS+ presentations, albeit less statistical support (p(FWE) = 0.064, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1o</xref>). A recent study in rodents could disentangle encoding of salience and expectancy violation during extinction learning in lateral and medial part of the VTA, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cai et al., 2020</xref>). While we cannot examine such fine-grained processes in the VTA with fMRI in humans, we nevertheless provide evidence for a role of the nucleus accumbens in processing of US omissions, which is in line with a function of the nucleus accumbens in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Badrinarayan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oleson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Budygin et al., 2012</xref>) in particular during extinction learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Correia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Holtzman-Assif et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rodriguez-Romaguera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Whittle et al., 2013</xref>).

Our results point moreover to a dopaminergic modulation of surprise in the amygdala that is evoked by US omission, which fits well to previous reports of associability coding in the amygdala during threat learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boll et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">LindstrÃ¶m et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We further show that signals in nucleus accumbens at the time-point of US omission were functionally coupled with activation in the amygdala and the SN/VTA, which were enhanced by administration of the dopaminergic precursor L-DOPA.

The corresponding image reconstruction algorithm was provided by the University of Minnesota Center for Magnetic Resonance Research. Echo planar multiband images were acquired with 42 continuous axial slices (1.5 mm thickness, 0.5 mm gap) in a T2*-sensitive sequence (TR = 1493 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 60Â°, field of view = 225 Ã 225 mm<sup>2</sup>). Selection of slice arrangement was individually adjusted (to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex as an orienting point) in order to cover the following areas: ventral medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and midbrain SN/VTA. Moreover, high-resolution T1-weighted structural brain image (MP-RAGE sequence, 1 mm isotropic voxel size, 240 slices) were obtained. For task-relevant functional data of day 2 (extinction training), preprocessing and statistical analysis was carried out using SPM12 (Statistical Parametric Mapping, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm">http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm</ext-link>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link>) running under Matlab2017a (The MathWorks, Inc, Natick, MA).

Subsequent statistical analyses were performed by using a standard approach for fMRI implemented in the SPM software, involving a general linear convolution model (GLM) at the single-subject level and a random-effects analysis on group level.

Furthermore, CS+ regressors included a parametric modulation of individual US expectancy ratings in order to examine dopamine-dependent differences in neural representation in decreasing US expectancy during extinction learning. Additionally, parametrical modulation of the omitted US was applied to examine neural responses that are related to changes in expectancy violation over trials. Therefore, the modelled prediction error term (as a measure of expectancy violation, averaged across the whole sample) and the orthogonalised associability term (as a measure of prediction error-guided surprise, averaged across the whole sample) were entered trial-wise.</p><p>In a next step, subject- and regressor-specific parameter estimate images of interest were normalised to a sample-customised DARTEL template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner, 2007</xref>) smoothed with an isotropic full-width at half-maximum Gaussian kernel of 4 mm.

Model factors for the respective analysis were CS+*US expectancy ratings (extinction learning), omitted US*mean prediction error and omitted US*associability (expectancy violation), always including the factor group (Placebo, L-DOPA). Analyses main objective was to reveal dopamine-specific effects (L-DOPA vs Placebo) during extinction learning depending on time-point related changes in US expectation. Significance of effects was tested by using voxel-wise one-tailed t tests. According to our hypotheses, we expected enhanced signalling in the L-DOPA group as compared to the Placebo group in CS+*US expectancy ratings (extinction learning) in the vmPFC (L-DOPA &gt; Placebo). We further expected a modulation of omitted US signals by L-DOPA administration and examined all contrast for the time-point of US omission (omitted US*mean prediction error, omitted US*associability, categorical omitted US) in both directions (L-DOPA &gt; Placebo and Placebo &gt; L-DOPA).</p><p>Regions of interest (ROI) were the defined as (1) dopaminergic key structures, such as the nucleus accumbens and the VTA/SN and (2) key structures in extinction learning, such as the amygdala and the vmPFC.

Parameter estimates of the omitted US-PPI were then contrasted between groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Mediation analysis</title><p>To test whether the effect of L-DOPA vs Placebo on differential SCRs at retrieval test on day 3 was mediated by the activity in the vmPFC that aligned with decreasing US expectancy, we employed a mediation analysis (R Studio, Version 1.2.1335, package âmediationâ; R Project for statistical computing RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_1905">SCR_1905</ext-link>).

The dopamine precursor, L-DOPA, or placebo was administered to fear conditioned healthy volunteers and fMRI was used to quantify brain activity during extinction training. Behavioral rating and skin-conductance responses serve to validate fear acquisition, extinction learning, and extinction retrieval. Results indicated that L-DOPA improved fear extinction as indexed by lower fear responses during tests for fear relapse, and this was associated with enhanced activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Authors also observed increased functional connectivity with SN/VTA and amygdala.</p><p>The reviewers expressed some enthusiasm for the manuscript:</p><p>â The study is of interest to a broad community and may have as well impact on societies by improving exposure-based psychotherapies for the treatment of anxiety disorder.</p><p>â This paper will be of high interest for neuroscientists, both human and animal researchers, in particular in the area of learning and memory and its translational âclinical application.</p><p>â The manuscript is well-written and addresses an important and timely topic with clinical relevance and hence is of general interest to the scientific community.</p><p>â These are interesting and important questions to be dealt with in human studies, and important for basic conditioning research and application (e.g. suggesting the use as an adjunct of pharmacological treatment in behavioral therapy of conditioning based anxiety disorders).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Nevertheless, all 3 reviewers expressed some significant concerns.</p><p>â¢ The reviewers highlighted some major concerns regarding the framing and interpretation of the results (as described below, and in the specific comments on the Results/Discussion, below)</p><p>o Title â The title &quot;Dopaminergic signals in the Nucleus Accumbens, VTA and vmPFC underpin extinction learning from omitted threats&quot; seems misleading and unsuitable. First, this manuscript does not measure dopaminergic signals in these structures. In this study, L-DOPA is administered systemically before fear extinction and changes in BOLD signals are examined in the Nucleus Accumbens, VTA and vmPFC during extinction learning. Finding a difference in the BOLD signal in these brain structures between the L-DOPA and placebo groups does not necessarily mean that these differences are due to the direct action of L-DOPA on dopaminergic signaling in these structures. The changes in the BOLD signal in these structures can be driven indirectly by the effect of L-DOPA in another brain structure. Secondly, &quot;underpin&quot; which almost suggests a causal role sounds too strong considering the methods used in this manuscript and also the lack of behavioral effect of the L-DOPA treatment on extinction learning. Finally, the title emphasizes extinction learning from omitted threats and hence the reader expects that the study finds omitted threat (US omission) related activity in all the structures mentioned (nucleus accumbens, VTA and vmPFC); however, the BOLD signal in the vmPFC in the L-DOPA group increases during the CS+ in the late trials of extinction when conditioned fear responding to CS+ is significantly decreased (indicating successful extinction learning); and not during the time period of US omission. Considering these points, it would be good to change the title to more accurately reflect the results of this manuscript.</p><p>o A key concern is the lack of behavioral and psychophysiological effects of L-DOPA on extinction learning and memory. At minimum, this has serious consequences for the interpretation of the results.</p><p>â In Figure 1, L-DOPA administration does not have any significant effects during extinction learning and retention test in any of the measures examined.</p><p>â In addition, when US expectancy ratings were fitted with a Rescorla-Wager-Pearce-Hall-Hybrid model, the fitted prediction error (as a measure of expectancy violation), associability (as a measure of prediction error-guided surprise) and extinction learning rate also did not differ between the two groups indicating a lack of significant effect of L-DOPA on any of the measures.</p><p>â If there is no significant effect during extinction learning and also during the extinction retention test measuring extinction memory, I fail to see how the authors relate the changes observed in BOLD activity to extinction learning and memory. The only significant behavioral effect observed in the L-DOPA group is the decrease in the differential SCRs following reinstatement (see Figure 2). This finding serves to argue that there is a behavioral effect of L-DOPA treatment on extinction learning. However, looking at Figure S1, I do not agree with this interpretation of the reinstatement results. Although L-DOPA group shows slightly lower SCRs to CS+ following reinstatement, there seems to have no significant difference between the L-DOPA and placebo groups in their responding to CS+. One would expect to observe a significant difference in SCRs to CS+ if there is a significant effect on the strength of extinction memory. Rather, the decrease in the difference between the SCRs to CS+ and CS- in L-DOPA group seems largely due to an increase in the SCRs to CS-, as well. Therefore, it seems like the L-DOPA treatment prior to extinction learning actually resulted in decreased discrimination between the CS+ and CS- following reinstatement. This finding suggests that, contrary to expectations, the L-DOPA treatment somehow resulted in fear generalization (hence decreased safety learning) after reinstatement when measured with threat and safety discrimination. In addition, the neural mechanisms underlying differences in the fear responding of the two groups following reinstatement are also not clear. Decreased conditioned fear responses after reinstatement might also reflect an effect of L-DOPA on the strength of fear memory rather than extinction memory. To state that L-DOPA treatment enhances extinction memory, we should see a significant decrease in SCRs to CS+ during the extinction retention test in the L-DOPA group, which we fail to see in this manuscript.</p><p>â¢ The reviewers highlighted some major concerns regarding the framing and experimental design</p><p>o There seems to be a major problem with the design of the behavioral part of the experiments. The subjects are fear conditioned in context A on day 1 and receive an extinction learning session in context B on day 2. On day 3, they receive a retention test to measure extinction memory however this test is performed not in the extinction context (context B) but rather in a new context (mix of contexts A and B). I fail to see the rationale of using a new context (particularly having parts of context A) during the retention test if the aim is to measure retention of extinction memory. It is well established that extinction is a context dependent learning. If subjects receive extinction learning in context B, they should be tested again in context B to test for retention of extinction memory. By changing the context on day 3 (and particularly by adding parts of context A), the authors are actually testing fear renewal but not retention of extinction memory. This might partly explain why they do not find a significant effect of L-DOPA treatment on extinction memory during retention test compared to previous studies that found significant enhancement of consolidation and retention of extinction memories following L-DOPA administration.</p><p>o Since the test on day 3 is measuring fear renewal rather than retrieval of extinction memory, it is not clear to me what the correlation between the vmPFC activity during extinction learning on day 2 and conditioned fear responses on day 3 reflects in Figure 3b.</p><p>â¢ Key methodological details are lacking.</p><p>â¢ The authors need to implement a consistent strategy for mitigating alpha inflation (i.e. correcting for multiple comparisons).</p><p>â¢ The Discussion needs a sober and frank evaluation of the study limitations and the strength of the observed statistical effects, many of which were quite modest.</p><p>â¢ The manuscript needs to be much more carefully copyedited.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;L-DOPA modulates activity in the vmPFC, Nucleus Accumbens and VTA during threat extinction learning in humans&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Dr. Frank as the Senior Editor, and Dr. Shackman as the Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1 underscores the importance of further tempering the claims, and providing a more comprehensive discussion of alternative explanations for the results.</p><p>Reviewer #2 highlights one additional analysis to be performed.</p><p>Both reviewers make some small but important additional suggestions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors addressed the points previously raised be the reviewers. The major concerns still remain despite elaborate arguments by the authors that are, in part, supported with some additional statistical arguments. Specifically, they try to circumvent the lack of behavioural and psychophysiological effects during extinction training and retrieval by focusing on a decrease in the differential SCRs following reinstatement. As outlined previously by the reviewers, this effect, however, is also not very convincing because this effect seems to be due to a small increase in the SCRs to the CS- and a small decrease in the SCR to the CS+ (see Figure S1) pointing towards reduced CS discrimination (i.e. enhanced fear generalisation) which is opposite of what is reported so far for L-DOPA induced faciliation of fear exitnction(e.g. Haaker et al., 2013, Gerlicher et al., 2019). Therefore, in the present study the observed activity changes in key brain areas of the extinction neurocircuitry during extinction training do not seem to relate to facilitation of fear extinction (see all previous comments). Along these lines, the final conclusion that the authors provide a mechanistic perspective to augment extinction learning by dopaminergic enhancement in humans is not supported by the data. Please deamphasize. However, what the authors show is that neuronal activation in key brain areas of the extinction neurocircuitry is modulated by systemic L-DOPA which has been previously shown to facilitate fear extinction in healthy subjects. Please revise the abstract, results, discussion and final conclusions accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their revised manuscript, the authors provide careful responses to the majority of the points that I addressed in my previous review, and also to the compiled objections of the reviewer group:</p><p>The authors now mainly restrict the arguments to the role of L-DOPA administration instead of a &quot;dopaminergic transmission&quot;.</p><p>Also some of the previously reported results are restricted now.

First, this manuscript does not measure dopaminergic signals in these structures. In this study, L-DOPA is administered systemically before fear extinction and changes in BOLD signals are examined in the Nucleus Accumbens, VTA and vmPFC during extinction learning. Finding a difference in the BOLD signal in these brain structures between the L-DOPA and placebo groups does not necessarily mean that these differences are due to the direct action of L-DOPA on dopaminergic signaling in these structures. The changes in the BOLD signal in these structures can be driven indirectly by the effect of L-DOPA in another brain structure. Secondly, &quot;underpin&quot; which almost suggests a causal role sounds too strong considering the methods used in this manuscript and also the lack of behavioral effect of the L-DOPA treatment on extinction learning. Finally, the title emphasizes extinction learning from omitted threats and hence the reader expects that the study finds omitted threat (US omission) related activity in all the structures mentioned (nucleus accumbens, VTA and vmPFC); however, the BOLD signal in the vmPFC in the L-DOPA group increases during the CS+ in the late trials of extinction when conditioned fear responding to CS+ is significantly decreased (indicating successful extinction learning); and not during the time period of US omission. Considering these points, it would be good to change the title to more accurately reflect the results of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewersâ suggestions to change the title, even though âdopaminergicâ describes dopamine-related signals (and not dopamine release itself).

This result is in line with a previously reported mediation effect of vmPFC activity (after extinction learning) by L-DOPA onto lower conditioned threat responses (measured as differential SCRs) during retrieval test (Gerlicher et al. 2018 Nature Communications). We, however, understand the reviewersâ comment that administration of L-DOPA in our study does not result in an (expected) univariate decrease, but a multivariate (see mediation analysis) effect of L-DOPA on behavioral and psychophysiological threat responses. Hence, we have phrased the interpretation of our results more carefully and explicitly state the absence of univariate effects in the retrieval test (for example page 20ff, discussion):</p><p>âThe behavioural effects of pre-extinction administration of L-DOPA in our study were weaker when compared to studies that employed post-extinction administration [25â27, 41].

As we outlined above, it might well be that the effect of post extinction administration of LDOPA (i.e. targeting consolidation) exerts stronger effects. Furthermore, we also found that L-DOPA enhances individual extinction learning success (see mediation analysis), which means that univariate effects of L-DOPA might not characterize the mechanisms by which L-DOPA works. (as we state on page 18: âL-DOPA might have the potential to improve (otherwise low, see parameter estimates in the Placebo group, figure 3 B)) vmPFC activity during extinction learning.

Our data suggest that L-DOPA enhances BOLD responses in the vmPFC, which mediates diminished retrieval of conditioned threat. This mediation effect is based on a previously reported effect of L-DOPA that is administered after extinction learning (Gerlicher et al. 2018 Nature Communications). Hence, we present in fact an association between L-DOPA administration and differences in BOLD signal between groups, which is linked to psychophysiological changes during retrieval test.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The only significant behavioral effect observed in the L-DOPA group is the decrease in the differential SCRs following reinstatement (see Figure 2). This finding serves to argue that there is a behavioral effect of L-DOPA treatment on extinction learning. However, looking at Figure S1, I do not agree with this interpretation of the reinstatement results. Although L-DOPA group shows slightly lower SCRs to CS+ following reinstatement, there seems to have no significant difference between the L-DOPA and placebo groups in their responding to CS+. One would expect to observe a significant difference in SCRs to CS+ if there is a significant effect on the strength of extinction memory. Rather, the decrease in the difference between the SCRs to CS+ and CS- in L-DOPA group seems largely due to an increase in the SCRs to CS-, as well. Therefore, it seems like the L-DOPA treatment prior to extinction learning actually resulted in decreased discrimination between the CS+ and CS- following reinstatement. This finding suggests that, contrary to expectations, the L-DOPA treatment somehow resulted in fear generalization (hence decreased safety learning) after reinstatement when measured with threat and safety discrimination. In addition, the neural mechanisms underlying differences in the fear responding of the two groups following reinstatement are also not clear. Decreased conditioned fear responses after reinstatement might also reflect an effect of L-DOPA on the strength of fear memory rather than extinction memory. To state that L-DOPA treatment enhances extinction memory, we should see a significant decrease in SCRs to CS+ during the extinction retention test in the L-DOPA group, which we fail to see in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not fully agree with this comment.</p><p>1. The effect of L-DOPA on the conditioned responses after reinstatement is an additional effect to the aforementioned mediation by vmPFC responses. Hence, we argue that the effect of L-DOPA is based on the mediation effect in addition to the difference after reinstatement.</p><p>2. Based on our statistical comparisons of responses after reinstatement, we state in the manuscript that we found lower <italic>differential</italic> CS responses (i.e., difference between CS+ and CS-) after reinstatement (page 9: ââ¦indicating lower CS discrimination in the L-DOPA group when compared to the Placebo controls after the reinstatement procedure.â) The reviewer is right that we found nominally lower responses to the CS+ and nominally higher responses to the CS- in the L-DOPA group when compared to the Placebo group. The nominal difference between both groups are larger for the decrease in CS+ (difference 0.048) when compared to the increase in CS- responses (the difference is 0.044). But importantly these nominal differences between groups in response to the CS+ or the CS- are not supported by two-sided unpaired t-tests (CS+ t=1.4, p=0.185; CS- t=1.2, p=0.205). Hence, the idea that L-DOPA might foster generalization of responses or decreased safety learning is not supported by our data.</p><p>We however understand the comment of the reviewers that we should include additional data and analyses that underline that the effect after reinstatement is based on lower differential responses in the L-DOPA group (when compared to Placebo). We now explicitly state in the revised manuscript on page 9: âPost-hoc comparisons of CS+ and CS- responses between groups did not support a difference between L-DOPA and Placebo (p&gt;0.19, see Table S11). [â¦] our analyses suggest that L-DOPA administration during extinction training reduced differential threat responses after reinstatement.â</p><p>In addition, we have added Table S11 with two-sided unpaired comparisons of CS+ and CS- responses after reinstatement between groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ The reviewers highlighted some major concerns regarding the framing and experimental design.</p><p>o There seems to be a major problem with the design of the behavioral part of the experiments. The subjects are fear conditioned in context A on day 1 and receive an extinction learning session in context B on day 2. On day 3, they receive a retention test to measure extinction memory however this test is performed not in the extinction context (context B) but rather in a new context (mix of contexts A and B). I fail to see the rationale of using a new context (particularly having parts of context A) during the retention test if the aim is to measure retention of extinction memory. It is well established that extinction is a context dependent learning. If subjects receive extinction learning in context B, they should be tested again in context B to test for retention of extinction memory. By changing the context on day 3 (and particularly by adding parts of context A), the authors are actually testing fear renewal but not retention of extinction memory. This might partly explain why they do not find a significant effect of L-DOPA treatment on extinction memory during retention test compared to previous studies that found significant enhancement of consolidation and retention of extinction memories following L-DOPA administration.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are right that renewal phenomena contribute to the responses during the retrieval test on day3. This design (including renewal) builds upon previously reported effects of L-DOPA. L-DOPA (administered after extinction learning) has been found to decrease responses when participants were tested in both, the acquisition context (i.e., ABA renewal, Haaker et al. 2013 PNAS), as well as within the extinction context (ABB design, Gerlicher et al. 2018 Nature Communications). Hence, the employment of a mixture of context A and B during the retrieval test (which is based on a previous publication by Andreatta et al. Behavior Therapy 2015) allows to test if L-DOPA reduces threat responses in an ambiguous generalization context. The reviewers are right that we thereby probe process that underlie renewal, namely contextual generalization (see Vervliet et al. 2013 Biol Psychol). And we apologize that we have not stated this explicitly. We state this in the revised Results section (page 8): âRetrieval was tested on day 3 within an generalization context that consisted of a mixture of the acquisition (context A) and extinction context (context B) [34], which also involves contextual renewal of conditioned threat responses [35]â and the methods description on page 22: âRetrieval test (including reinstatement procedure) was conducted in a 50/50-mixture of context A and B in order to examine contextual generalization [34], which also involves contextual renewal of conditioned threat responses[35].â.</p><p>Theories and experimental studies on renewal (and in particular contextual generalization) provide evidence that renewal is not a differential (i.e. âall or nothingâ) situation in which either fear or extinction memories are retrieved. Rather, retrieval of both, acquisition and extinction memory play a role during renewal (see Vervliet et al. 2013 Biol Psychol, Bouton Biol Psychiatry 2002). In line with this theoretical account is the finding that the vmPFC plays a role in renewal situations, even when the behavioural output of conditioned responses is stronger than their inhibition. For example, renewal (ABA) and extinction retrieval (ABB) both involve projections from the ventral hippocampus to the infralimbic cortex (rodents vmPFC homologue, Wang, Jin and Maren Neuobiol Learn Mem 2016). Pathway specific activation of projections from the hippocampus to the infralimbic cortex (rodents vmPFC homologue) diminishes behavioral renewal outside the extinction context (Vasquez Neuobiol Learn Mem 2019). Furthermore, ABC renewal (which might be probed in our design) is not as strong as ABA renewal (e.g., Harris et al. 2000), which further indicates that inhibition of conditioned responses plays a role in contextual renewal. We however see the reviewers point that the retrieval test probes threat, as well as extinction memories. In order to make this clear, we have explicitly termed the test phase on day 3 âretrieval testâ (instead of âextinction retrieval testâ). In order to follow the reviewersâ suggestion, we have further replaced âextinction retrievalâ with âretrievalâ at several parts in the manuscript, for example page 11 (results): â[â¦] we tested if this difference in the right vmPFC activity is related to individual differences in the retrieval of conditioned threat responses.â and â[â¦] enhanced vmPFC activity is associated with reduced retrieval of differential threat responses (measured as SCR) 24 hours laterâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>o Since the test on day 3 is measuring fear renewal rather than retrieval of extinction memory, it is not clear to me what the correlation between the vmPFC activity during extinction learning on day 2 and conditioned fear responses on day 3 reflects in Figure 3b.</p></disp-quote><p>The mediation analysis in our results is actually based on a study that employed extinction memory retrieval (i.e. ABB design, Gerlicher et al. Nature Communications 2018). The authors found an effect of L-DOPA on extinction memory retrieval that is mediated by vmPFC activity. As the reviewers pointed out, the design initially used by Gerlicher allows to unambitiously examine extinction memory retrieval. We found the same association between responses within the retrieval test in our design. Hence, the same mediation effect of LDOPA onto conditioned responses by the vmPFC in both studies further suggests that L-DOPA affects extinction memory retrieval in our design.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ Key methodological details are lacking.</p><p>â¢ The authors need to implement a consistent strategy for mitigating alpha inflation (i.e. correcting for multiple comparisons).</p></disp-quote><p>We understand this and we have added to the already applied strategy to mitigate alpha inflation the correction of exploratory control analyses. For example, we could thereby clarify the results on fear ratings on page 7: âExploratory analyses suggested that this effect might be driven by lower ratings to the CS+ and the extinction context (presented as the ITI) in the L-DOPA group, but none of these comparisons survived correction for multiple testing (p-values (FWE)&gt; 0.256â).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>â¢ The Discussion needs a sober and frank evaluation of the study limitations and the strength of the observed statistical effects, many of which were quite modest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have adjusted the interpretation of our results (Results section and discussion) to address this comment and rephrased the limitations of our study (within a new paragraph in the discussion).</p><p>âLimitations of this study</p><p>This pharmacological fMRI study in human volunteers is only suited to draw inferences on blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals as a function of L-DOPA administration.

We have mentioned in the previous revision that our mediation analysis actually provides evidence on how âactivity changes in key brain areas of the extinction neurocircuitry during extinction training [â¦] relate to facilitation of fear extinctionâ, to quote what the reviewer misses in our manuscript. Namely, we found that the activity in the vmPFC mediates the effect of LDOPA on reduced SCR in the retrieval test, which is similar to the effect as reported by Gerlicher et al. 2019. This effect is highlighted in the manuscript (and not merely the effect found after reinstatement).</p><p>Additionally, our finding of reduced differential CS response in the L-DOPA group relative to the Placebo group after reinstatement is not contrary to what has been found in Gerlicher et al. 2019 or Haaker et al. 2013. For example, in Haaker et al. 2013, we found that âThe placebo group showed significantly larger differential SCRs (CS+ &gt; CSâ) in context A (test 2) than in context B (test 1) on day 2 [â¦] This pronounced renewal effect was significantly attenuated in the L-dopa group (cue by context by group interaction: F1,31 = 5.23, P = 0.029). Further inspection suggested that the interaction was mainly due to relatively decreased responding to the CS+ in context A (post hoc t test: t1,31 = 1.81, P = 0.082â. Hence, there is a differential effect on the SCR between groups, similar to what we find after reinstatement (Gerlicher et al. also report a stimulus * group interaction)). In our current study, we report a similar stimulus*group interaction and if we would compare CS+ responses between groups, there would be a trend for lower responses in the L-DOPA group (one sided t-test t(40)=1,348 p=0.093).
