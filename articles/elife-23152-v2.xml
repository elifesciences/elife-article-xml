fundamental mechanisms behind cellular self-organization. By focusing on the stabilizing protein tropomyosin Cdc8, bundling protein fimbrin Fim1, and severing protein coffin Adf1, we examined how their pairwise and collective interactions with actin filaments regulate their activity and segregation to functionally diverse F-actin networks. Utilizing multi-color TIRF microscopy of in vitro reconstituted F-actin networks, we observed and characterized two distinct Cdc8 cables loading and spreading cooperatively on individual actin filaments. Furthermore, Cdc8, Fim1, and Adf1 all compete for association with F-actin by different mechanisms, and their cooperative association with actin filaments affects their ability to compete. Finally, competition between Fim1 and Adf1 for F-actin synergizes their activities, promoting rapid displacement of Cdc8 from a dense F-actin network. Our findings reveal that competitive and cooperative interactions between actin binding proteins help define their associations with different F-actin networks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23152.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23152.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use a protein called actin to provide shape, to generate the forces needed for cells to divide, and for many other essential processes. Inside a cell, individual actin proteins join up to form long filaments. These actin filaments are organized in different ways to make networks that have distinct properties, each tailored for a specific process. For instance, bundles of straight actin filaments help a cell to divide, whereas a network of branched actin filaments allows cells to move.</p><p>The different proteins that bind to actin filaments influence how quickly actin filaments are assembled and organized into networks. Therefore, many of the properties of an actin filament network are due to the actin binding proteins that are associated with it. Two actin binding proteins called fimbrin and cofilin associate with a type of actin filament network known as the actin patch. A third actin binding protein called tropomyosin associates with a different network that forms a ring. It is not known how particular actin binding proteins choose to associate with one actin network instead of another.</p><p>Christensen et al. used a fluorescence microscopy technique to study how fimbrin, cofilin and tropomyosin associate with different actin networks in a single-celled organism called fission yeast. This technique involved incubating actin and actin binding proteins together in a microscope chamber. The experiments show that some actin binding proteins, like tropomyosin, cooperate to bind to actin. Individual tropomyosin molecules find it difficult to bind actin filaments on their own, but once one tropomyosin molecule is attached to the filament, others rapidly join to coat the filament.</p><p>On the other hand, some actin-binding proteins compete for binding to filaments. For example, the binding of fimbrin to actin filaments causes tropomyosin to be removed from the actin network. Further experiments revealed that fimbrin and cofilin work with each other to rapidly generate a dense actin network and displace tropomyosin. Together, the findings of Christensen et al. suggest that competitions between actin binding proteins determine which actin binding proteins are associated with an actin network.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand how the most competitive actin-binding proteins are kept off actin networks where they do not belong. Further studies will shed light on how these interactions cause large changes in how the cell is organized.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23152.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23152.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>tropomyosin</kwd><kwd>cofilin</kwd><kwd>fimbrin</kwd><kwd>actin depolymerizing factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM079265</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RSG-11-126-01-CSM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1144082</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>Jenna R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM0071832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christensen</surname><given-names>Jenna R</given-names></name><name><surname>Homa</surname><given-names>Kaitlin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 GM113415-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hocky</surname><given-names>Glen M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM093965</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hitchcock-DeGregori</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DMR-1420709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voth</surname><given-names>Gregory A</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovar</surname><given-names>David R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Both cooperative and competitive associations of actin binding proteins with actin filaments help drive the self-organization of functionally diverse F-actin networks in fission yeast.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The self-organization of complex structures from interactions between basic components is a general phenomenon of chemistry and material sciences, as well as more complicated biological systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Karsenti, 2008</xref>). Examples include the generation of self-segregating PAR domains in the developing <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hoege and Hyman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Goldstein and Macara, 2007</xref>) and the organization of a mitotic spindle around DNA-coated microspheres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heald et al., 1996</xref>). How individual interactions within the cell coalesce to generate complex patterns or structures remains a fundamental biological question. The actin cytoskeleton is an ideal system to study complex cellular self-organization. Multiple functionally diverse F-actin networks, each with a distinct architecture and dynamics, assemble at the correct time and place within a single crowded cytoplasm. Distinct sets of actin binding proteins (ABPs) help to define the characteristics of each F-actin network by performing tasks such as actin filament (F-actin) nucleation, bundling, severing, and capping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pollard, 2016</xref>). Therefore, proper localization of ABPs to the correct network is crucial to generate F-actin networks defined for specific processes. The biochemical activity and cellular functions of many individual ABPs have been well-studied. However, we are only beginning to understand how ABPs function in concert, how they compete with each other for association with individual actin filaments, and how these interactions contribute to the proper sorting of ABPs to diverse F-actin networks on a whole-cell scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Michelot and Drubin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jégou and Romet-Lemonne, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Fission yeast is an ideal simplified system in which to study the underlying molecular mechanisms behind F-actin network self-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kovar et al., 2011</xref>). Fission yeast has three primary actin cytoskeleton networks, in which all of the actin filaments are assembled by a distinct actin assembly factor: endocytic actin patches (Arp2/3 complex), polarizing actin cables (formin For3), and the cytokinetic contractile ring (formin Cdc12). Moreover, each of these F-actin networks contains a distinct set of ABPs. We hypothesize that ABP competition for association with actin filaments is critical for their proper sorting to distinct F-actin networks. We previously discovered that competition between ABPs tropomyosin Cdc8, fimbrin Fim1, and ADF/cofilin Adf1 results in the exclusion of tropomyosin from actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). Here, we use a combination of multi-color TIRF microscopy (TIRFM) of reconstituted F-actin networks and mathematical modeling to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms behind this series of competitive ABP interactions in fission yeast. By understanding ABP competition at a mechanistic level, we can gain insight into how an ABP’s intrinsic physical properties help dictate its interactions with other ABPs and its association with specific F-actin networks. In this study, we have found that different modes of active and passive competition exist between different ABPs. Furthermore, we have determined that cooperativity affects ABP competition by defining the ability of ABPs to both associate and be dissociated from an F-actin network. Finally, we have found that the combination of cooperative and competitive interactions between a set of ABPs defines the ABP composition and F-actin organization of the associated F-actin network.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direct visualization of tropomyosin Cdc8 cooperative loading onto actin filaments</title><p>Tropomyosin has been implicated in ABP sorting and F-actin network organization in many organisms including fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gunning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>). Tropomyosin is a two-chained, parallel coiled-coil composed of two polypeptide chains with a characteristic heptad-repeat of hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Individual tropomyosin coiled coils associate end-to-end to form continuous tropomyosin cables that extend along both sides of the helical actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanson and Lowy, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skoumpla et al., 2007</xref>). Vertebrate tropomyosins span six or seven actin subunits in the filament. Yeast tropomyosins are shorter: the two <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> tropomyosin isoforms span four or five actins, while <italic>S. pombe</italic> tropomyosin Cdc8 (hereafter called Cdc8) spans four actin subunits. Although Cdc8, like other tropomyosins, has been purified and characterized in steady state bulk assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cranz-Mileva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Skau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skoumpla et al., 2007</xref>), our general mechanistic understanding of how tropomyosins load onto actin filaments and are affected by other ABPs is unclear. Multi-color TIRFM has been successfully utilized as a sensitive probe to study the detailed interactions between multiple ABPs and F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bombardier et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winkelman et al., 2016</xref>). However, fluorescently labeling tropomyosins is generally problematic as mutations or insertions within the protein can potentially disrupt its coiled-coil structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Greenfield and Hitchcock-DeGregori, 1995</xref>). Additionally, tropomyosins labeled on the N- or C-terminus are not fully functional, as the presence of a label blocks end-to-end associations between tropomyosin molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brooker et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we created three distinct Cdc8 mutants, each containing an engineered cysteine mutation that could be labeled for visualization by TIRFM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Methods). We examined the functionality of each Cdc8 mutant in vitro and in vivo to identify the mutant most similar to wild-type Cdc8. Two mutants, Cdc8(I76C) and Cdc8(D142C), bound F-actin similarly to wild type Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>), were able to be labeled and visualized by TIRFM (100% of actin filaments associated with tropomyosin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and caused only very mild cytokinesis defects as the sole copy of Cdc8 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). Therefore, we chose one of these mutants, Cdc8(I76C), for further study in TIRFM experiments.</p><p>We utilized two-color TIRFM to examine the loading characteristics of Cy5-labeled Cdc8 on assembling Alexa 488-labeled actin filaments over a range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). At concentrations below 1 μM, Cdc8 was not observed to bind F-actin. However, at 1 μM Cdc8, short stretches of Cdc8 were observed to load on actin filaments. These dynamic stretches varied in size over time, but could be as small as the observable limit of ~100 nm and generally remained within the constraints of ~0.5–2 μm (~2% of total actin filament coverage) over time. At 1.25 μM Cdc8, spreading of Cdc8 cables from initial ‘seeds’ was observed, with ~40% of actin filament sites coated with Cdc8. At concentrations of 2 μM Cdc8 and higher, ~98% of F-actin was coated with Cdc8. This rapid shift in actin filament occupancy over a small Cdc8 concentration range indicates a high degree of cooperativity. One possibility is that Cdc8’s high cooperativity is a result of the previously demonstrated end-to-end associations between tropomyosin molecules (‘end-to-end cooperativity’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caspar et al., 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greenfield et al., 2006</xref>). However, the cooperativity of muscle tropomyosin on F-actin has been found to not directly correlate with its end-to-end binding ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willadsen et al., 1992</xref>), suggesting that other interactions may also influence tropomyosin’s cooperativity on F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tobacman, 2008</xref>). We therefore considered whether indirect interactions between Cdc8 cables on opposing sides of an actin filament or via long-range interactions along the length of the F-actin lattice (‘indirect cooperativity’) also contribute to Cdc8’s high cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We focused on investigating a potential role for indirect cooperativity in Cdc8 loading onto an actin filament by observing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and quantifying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) Cdc8 loading events in detail under conditions near the inflection point of Cdc8’s cooperativity (1.25 μM Cdc8).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Tropomyosin Cdc8 loads cooperatively onto actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two-color TIRFM of 1.5 μM Mg-ATP actin (15% Alexa 488 labeled) with a range of concentrations of tropomyosin Cdc8 (Cy5-labeled).

Cdc8 loading is complex and characterized by several initial ‘seed’ events, followed by Cdc8 cable extension along the actin filament toward both the barbed and pointed ends, interrupted by frequent stops and starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Sites of initial Cdc8 seed association were identified by an increase in Cdc8 fluorescence at the site of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ci</xref>). Unlike <italic>Drosophila</italic> tropomyosin Tm1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsiao et al., 2015</xref>), which favors association near the actin filament pointed end, initial Cdc8 loading events had no preference for the barbed or pointed end of the actin filament, with binding patterns consistent with stochastic association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Once an initial Cdc8 site was initiated, spreading of Cdc8 occurred toward both the barbed and pointed ends at similar rates (3.2 and 2.4 Cdc8 molecules sec<sup>−1</sup> μM<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, p-value=0.037). However, there was considerable variation in spreading rates in both directions, between ~1–6 Cdc8 molecules sec<sup>−1</sup> μM<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). As the majority of Cdc8 molecules associated adjacent to a previously-bound Cdc8, these findings suggest that end-to-end binding is one key feature contributing to the high cooperativity of tropomyosin.</p><p>A cryo-electron microscopy structure of mammalian tropomyosin, as well as negative-stain electron microscopy of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Cdc8 has shown that a single actin filament accommodates two tropomyosin cables, one on each side of the helical actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hanson and Lowy, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Skoumpla et al., 2007</xref>).

A second Cdc8 cable loading event was evident by a doubling in fluorescence intensity at sites of previously loaded Cdc8 cable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right panels). The single pixel resolution in our TIRFM experiments is 100 nm, or a continuous stretch of ~5 Cdc8 molecules bound end-to-end. We assume that Cdc8 spreading events are the result of end-to-end binding between Cdc8 molecules. However, this resolution does not allow us to rule out the possibility of unconnected Cdc8 molecules binding near, but not immediately next to, previously loaded Cdc8 molecules. The doubling in Cdc8 fluorescence intensity upon association of the second Cdc8 cable allows us to explore the possibility of actin filament-mediated cooperative Cdc8 interactions.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-23152-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.010</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Two distinct cables of Tropomyosin Cdc8 load onto a single actin filament, related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</title><p>Two-color TIRF microscopy of 1.5 μM actin (Alexa-488 labeled) with 1.25 μM tropomyosin Cdc8 (Cy5-labeled).

In an initial Cdc8 loading event, a Cdc8 ‘seed’ forms and elongates along one face of the actin filament. Second Cdc8 loading events can occur on the actin face opposite the first Cdc8 cable or on either face at a stretch of the actin filament free of Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected, if the first Cdc8 cable covered a higher fraction of the actin filament face, the second Cdc8 binding event was more likely to occur across from it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, purple bars). However, comparisons to a model of stochastic binding suggested that the observed binding opposite a first Cdc8 cable was higher than what was predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, c = 1X circles). The addition of an indirect cooperativity factor of 2 (doubling the likelihood of binding opposite a first Cdc8 cable) more closely replicated the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, c = 2X circles). These findings suggest that although initial Cdc8 molecules bind stochastically on the actin filament, there is a bias for subsequent Cdc8 molecules to bind opposite previously-established Cdc8 stretches, indicating a potential role for indirect cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Modeling of tropomyosin Cdc8 loading onto growing actin filaments</title><p>The preference of second Cdc8 loading events for already Cdc8-occupied regions described above is based on a statistical calculation from a limited number of second Cdc8 binding events (n = 37). To further address whether indirect cooperativity plays a role in tropomyosin Cdc8 loading, we created two variations of a lattice simulation describing Cdc8 loading onto a growing actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The first model described Cdc8 loading with only end-to-end cooperativity (w) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>), while the second described Cdc8 loading with both end-to-end (w) and indirect cooperativity (c) across the actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>). We sought to determine whether either model was sufficient to reproduce the complex behavior observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ai–iii</xref>). To select values of w, c and k<sub>off</sub>, we first fixed c, and varied k<sub>off</sub> and w until generating (1) the best match to the experimental data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as k<sub>on</sub> is varied, (2) a similar k<sub>off</sub> to single molecule experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), and (3) a similar initial Cdc8 binding time to experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the first model, cooperativity occurred only via end-to-end binding (w) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>). A kymograph generated using those parameters replicated many of the observed Cdc8 loading characteristics, specifically the frequent starts and stops and variation in spreading rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii</xref>). However, a much lower fraction of F-actin was doubly coated with Cdc8 in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Biii</xref>) compared to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aiii</xref>). Therefore, end-to-end cooperative binding alone does not fully account for the experimentally observed Cdc8 loading behavior. We therefore added a factor of positive indirect cooperativity (c) to the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>). An indirect cooperativity (c) value of 1.25 most closely replicated our experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This model replicated the observed dynamics of Cdc8 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Cii</xref>), and also replicated the observed bias towards double-coating of actin filaments by Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ciii</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aiii</xref>). These findings, along with the second Cdc8 binding event data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), are consistent with a role for indirect cooperativity in the high overall cooperativity of Cdc8.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Modeling of Tropomyosin Cdc8 dynamics on growing actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>Ai-iii</bold>) Two-color TIRFM of 1.5 μM Mg-ATP actin (15% Alexa 488) with 1.25 μM tropomyosin Cdc8 dimer (Cy5-labeled).

This property could be physiologically important as it allows tropomyosins to quickly define the functional composition of an F-actin network by associating with F-actin and influencing the subsequent association of other ABPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gunning et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tojkander et al., 2011</xref>). In fission yeast, Cdc8 inhibits several actin patch ABPs from binding F-actin, including ADF/cofilin Adf1 and myosin-I Myo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clayton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). Though Cdc8's presence at the contractile ring and actin cables likely prevents the unwanted association of several types of ABPs at those F-actin networks, opposing mechanisms must be in place to prevent Cdc8 from associating with actin patches. Cdc8’s association with actin patches is regulated by competition with the F-actin crosslinking protein fimbrin Fim1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>), which localizes predominantly to actin patches in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nakano et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). Though Cdc8 does not associate with actin patches normally, Cdc8 localizes to actin patches in the absence of fimbrin (<italic>fim1-1</italic>Δ cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). In addition, Fim1 prevents Cdc8 from binding F-actin in steady state in vitro bulk sedimentation assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Fim1 prevents the association of Cdc8 with F-actin is unclear. We suspected that Fim1 could inhibit the initial ability of Cdc8 to load onto F-actin. Alternatively, Fim1 could actively facilitate the dissociation of Cdc8 from actin filaments.</p><p>To differentiate between these and other potential mechanisms, we utilized three-color TIRFM to follow the assembly of labeled actin in the presence of labeled Fim1 and Cdc8 to simultaneously observe their associations with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Cdc8 initially coated individual actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, first panel), with loading and spreading patterns similar to those observed in the absence of Fim1. However, as actin filaments became bundled by Fim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>), the amount of Fim1 associated with the actin filaments increased and Cdc8 was actively removed from the bundled region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). We observed Cdc8 displacement to some extent from every Fim1-mediated bundle formed. Kymographs of elongating actin filaments bundled by Fim1 showed that Cdc8 displacement occurred in a cooperative manner at the bundled site, where Cdc8 cables appeared to be ‘stripped’ away from initial sites of dissociation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Fim1 fluorescence intensity increased at F-actin bundles compared to single actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), while Cdc8 intensity decreased at F-actin bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that Cdc8 displacement by Fim1 occurred preferentially at sites of F-actin bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). These findings demonstrate that Fim1-mediated bundling displaces Cdc8 from the actin network. Additionally, as Cdc8 appears to be rapidly ‘stripped’ from a few initial dissociation points, it is possible that the cooperativity of Cdc8 assists not only its assembly onto filaments but also its rapid displacement specifically from F-actin networks bundled by Fim1.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.013</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Fimbrin Fim1-mediated bundling induces cooperative removal of Tropomyosin Cdc8.</title><p>(<bold>A–E</bold>) Timelapse of three-color TIRFM of 1.5 μM Mg-ATP actin (15% Alexa 488-labeled) with 2.5 μM tropomyosin Cdc8 (Cy5-labeled) and 250 nM fimbrin Fim1 (TMR-labeled).

In fission yeast, Adf1-mediated severing is decreased in the presence of Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). We used multi-color TIRFM to investigate whether Cdc8 inhibits Adf1-mediated severing by decreasing the initial association of Adf1 with F-actin, or by another mechanism. Wild-type Adf1 labeled with a cysteine-reactive dye was not observed to associate with F-actin (data not shown). We therefore engineered an Adf1 labeling mutant (C12S, C62A, D34C) for use in TIRFM, based on a similar strategy used for budding yeast ADF/cofilin Cof1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, Methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). The TMR-labeled Adf1 mutant is less active than wild-type Adf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but was observed to bind F-actin in a cooperative manner and sever actin filaments at boundaries of Adf1 bound/unbound regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>), characteristics previously observed for ADF/cofilins from a variety of organisms including fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hayakawa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">De La Cruz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Michelot et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>At high Adf1 concentrations (5 μM), the majority of F-actin was rapidly coated with Adf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, in the presence of Cdc8, little Adf1 was observed to initially associate with actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Over time, Adf1 began to load near the pointed end of Cdc8-associated actin filaments in small ‘clusters’ that then spread cooperatively along the filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, though Cdc8 affected the initial association (k<sub>on</sub>) of Adf1 with actin filaments, the dissociation rate (k<sub>off</sub>) of Adf1 from F-actin was unaffected by Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These findings are supported by three-color TIRFM imaging of the assembly of labeled actin in the presence of labeled Adf1 and Cdc8. Labeled Cdc8 and Adf1 show mutually exclusive localization on actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Initially, the majority of actin filaments are coated with Cdc8. Over time, Adf1 puncta arise and displace Cdc8 from those regions. Adf1 domains then spread in a cooperative manner, further displacing Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Cdc8 continues to associate with the elongating actin filament barbed end, where Adf1 is not yet associated, but is ultimately displaced by Adf1 over time. As Adf1 preferentially associates with ADP-F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianantoandro and Pollard, 2006</xref>), we suspect that the transition from ADP-Pi- to ADP-actin increases the k<sub>on</sub> of Adf1 for ADP-bound F-actin, allowing a few Adf1 molecules to associate with the actin filament. Adf1 then cooperatively spreads from these regions of association, and displaces Cdc8. Collectively, these data suggest that while Cdc8 inhibits the initial binding of Adf1 to actin filaments, Adf1 is capable of associating and ultimately displacing segments of Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Tropomyosin Cdc8 inhibits initial binding of ADF/cofilin Adf1 to actin filaments.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Two-color TIRFM of 1.5 μM Mg-ATP actin (15% Alexa 488 labeled) with 5 μM ADF/cofilin Adf1 (TMR-labeled) in the presence or absence of 2.5 μM tropomyosin Cdc8 (unlabeled).

We previously postulated that fimbrin Fim1 may be required for proper actin patch motility indirectly, by inhibiting tropomyosin Cdc8 association and therefore allowing ADF/cofilin Adf1-mediated severing to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Skau and Kovar, 2010</xref>). However, a separation of function Fim1 mutant that can bind but not bundle F-actin, and retains the ability to displace Cdc8 from F-actin, still shows abnormal actin patch dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Skau et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore Fim1 has additional roles aside from protecting actin patches from Cdc8. Therefore, we examined the relationship between Fim1 and Adf1 utilizing multi-color TIRFM with labeled proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Unlike the mutually-exclusive localization of Cdc8 and Adf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), Fim1 and Adf1 co-localized at both single actin filaments and multi-filament bundles throughout the TIRF chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). However, distinct Fim1 or Adf1 domains could still be observed, and severing often occurred at these interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, yellow line), likely because of sharp changes in Adf1 density and/or actin filament flexibility between those two regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McCullough et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suarez et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this finding, the Adf1 severing rate was increased in the presence of Fim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). As the severing rate could only be directly observed on single actin filaments and two-filament bundles, our measured severing rate in the presence of Fim1 is likely underreported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, indicated by #). Severed filaments were quickly incorporated into nearby bundles, resulting in an increase in Fim1-mediated bundling in the presence of Adf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Fim1-mediated bundles became extremely large and dense in the presence of Adf1 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> to 7A), as each severing event resulted in the formation of a new elongating barbed end. This rapid generation of barbed ends yielded a ~11 fold change in actin fluorescence after 300 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, solid lines), compared to a ~2 fold change in experiments lacking Adf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, dashed lines). Together, these findings support a potential role for Adf1 as both a disassembly factor (via severing) and an assembly factor (via generation of new barbed ends). We speculate that the presence of Fim1 on actin patches may be important not only for exclusion of Cdc8 from the network but also for enhancement of Adf1-mediated severing via generation of single filament/bundle interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23152.018</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fimbrin Fim1 and ADF/cofilin Adf1 competition generates a dense F-actin network.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timelapse of two-color TIRFM of 1.5 μM Mg-ATP actin (15% Alexa 488-labeled) with 500 nM fimbrin Fim1 (Cy5-labeled).

We tested this possibility using four-color TIRFM to examine how Fim1, Adf1, and Cdc8 collectively affect each other’s interactions with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

We show that fission yeast tropomyosin Cdc8 binds extremely cooperatively to F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Though tropomyosins from other organisms have been labeled for use in TIRFM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hsiao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmidt et al., 2015</xref>), ours is the first study to observe two distinct tropomyosin cables associating with a single actin filament (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This high degree of resolution has provided us the unique opportunity to differentiate between the contributions of (1) end-to-end association and (2) indirect interactions via the actin filament in tropomyosin's cooperative binding to F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>End-to-end binding has been considered to be the primary source of tropomyosin’s cooperativity. Mutations in the N- or C-terminal domains of Cdc8 affect its ability to bind cooperatively and polymerize on an actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">East et al., 2011</xref>). However, it has been suggested that other interactions between tropomyosin and the actin filament may also be involved in tropomyosin cooperativity as end-to-end attachments between tropomyosin molecules tend to be rather weak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sousa and Farah, 2002</xref>) and muscle tropomyosin with impaired ability to associate end-to-end is still cooperative on actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Willadsen et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tobacman, 2008</xref>). Our findings suggest that, though end-to-end binding is a key factor in tropomyosin cooperativity, indirect interactions via the actin filament may also be important for enhancing tropomyosin coating of F-actin. Our results suggest that a small increase in indirect cooperativity (increase in binding affinity of Cdc8 by a factor of ~2) is sufficient to account for Cdc8's high cooperativity and observed loading characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The precise interactions within the actin filament that allow for this cooperativity remain to be determined. However, due to the logarithmic relationship between free energy differences and equilibrium constants, a factor of 2 increase in binding affinity corresponds to a very small increase in free-energy stabilization of -k<sub>B</sub>Tln(2)=~0.4 kcal/mol. Hence, if this indirect cooperativity is due to a structural change in the actin filament, we expect that change to be quite subtle.</p><p>Tropomyosin is known to increase the persistence length of F-actin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fujime and Ishiwata, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Isambert et al., 1995</xref>). As a result, the stabilizing effect of an initial Cdc8 binding to one side of the actin filament may favor binding of a second Cdc8 to the opposing side. Additionally, if the rigidity provided by initial Cdc8 binding is propagated slightly further up or down the actin filament, more tropomyosin molecules could associate with the actin filament as a result of an increase in F-actin rigidity. More complex mammalian cells express &gt;40 tropomyosin isoforms that vary in affinity for F-actin and degree of cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pittenger et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schevzov et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that these characteristics may differentially affect their distinct cellular roles and ability to sort to different F-actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gunning et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Tropomyosin cooperativity and ABP sorting</title><p>How does this high degree of cooperativity affect tropomyosin’s influence on the activity of other ABPs?

Individual tropomyosin Cdc8 molecules associate poorly with actin filaments. However, once a Cdc8 ‘seed’ has been initiated, end-to-end binding and potential indirect interactions promote Cdc8’s rapid coating of F-actin.

In addition, this large number of interactions between a Cdc8 cable and the actin filament could allow a Cdc8 cable to remain associated despite perturbations along the actin filament that may result from the association of other ABPs with the actin filament. However, these same cooperative characteristics also make Cdc8 easily removable from actin filaments once a threshold of perturbations has been bypassed. For example, at regions of high fimbrin Fim1 association (F-actin bundles), Cdc8's end-to-end associations allow it to rapidly peel away from those actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition, the poor ability of individual Cdc8 molecules to bind to an actin filament makes it unlikely to be able to displace other ABPs once they’re bound to an actin filament, resulting in Cdc8's complete exclusion from certain F-actin networks, such as actin patches. We suspect that Fim1’s long residence time on F-actin bundles enhance its ability to create regions of high Fim1 occupancy that displace Cdc8, suggesting that ABP dynamics (on-/off-rate) may partially dictate the ability of an ABP to compete. An ABP’s dynamics could be driven by its intrinsic biochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Winkelman et al., 2016</xref>), post-translational modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Miao et al., 2016</xref>), or mechanical stresses within the F-actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Srivastava and Robinson, 2015</xref>), resulting in the fine-tuning of ABP sorting by many factors.</p><p>Another impact of Cdc8’s high cooperativity may be that only a slight bias toward certain actin filaments could generate an ‘all-or-nothing’ sorting toward those networks. Several studies have suggested that the actin assembly factor may be the key to generating this initial bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kovar et al., 2011</xref>). In fission yeast, altering formin localization in the cell results in the relocalization of both acetylated and unacetylated forms of Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Johnson et al., 2014</xref>). This bias may be the result of formin-induced conformational changes that could be propagated down the actin filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugyi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Papp et al., 2006</xref>). Future work will involve deciphering potential ‘initiating’ signals for ABP sorting and their effects on ABP cooperativity and competition.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Competition and boundary generation</title><p>Our work also addresses the importance of ABP competition in network organization and ABP sorting. An outstanding question is how ADF/cofilin, a protein that severs at low concentrations, can be present at high concentrations in the cell and yet still rapidly disassemble F-actin networks. Other ABPs, such as Aip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gressin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nadkarni and Brieher, 2014</xref>), Coronin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>), and Twinfilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Johnston et al., 2015</xref>) have been found to enhance ADF/cofilin-mediated severing via multiple mechanisms, including potential side-binding by Aip1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). Our study additionally implicates side-binding ABPs not involved in severing (fimbrin Fim1) as important for the enhancement of ADF/cofilin Adf1 severing, likely by generating ADF/cofilin boundaries or changes in flexibility that result from Fim1-mediated bundle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The idea of competition between ADF/cofilin and other factors as important for enhancing ADF/cofilin-mediated severing is an exciting area of investigation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Elam et al., 2013</xref>), and future work remains to determine how different ABPs regulate ADF/cofilin severing to different extents on different F-actin networks.</p><p>In addition, our study suggests an important role for ADF/cofilin not only as a disassembly factor, but also as a potent F-actin network assembly factor through the creation of new barbed ends as in the model of dendritic nucleation within the lamellipodia of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DesMarais et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ichetovkin et al., 2002</xref>). The combination of Fim1 and Adf1 generates dense F-actin bundles composed of many more actin filaments than Fim1 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Skau et al., 2011</xref>) It was previously shown that expression of an ADF/cofilin mutant deficient in severing results in delayed actin patch assembly in fission yeast, as a lack of severing prevents the creation of new mother filaments for actin patch initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Pollard, 2013</xref>). Our findings also potentially implicate Adf1 involvement in increasing the number of barbed ends within the dense actin patch network. The creation of barbed ends via severing takes advantage of the inherent polarity of an actin filament, as the newly created barbed end at the severed site is automatically oriented in the same direction as the original barbed end. This type of mechanism could be ideal for force-generating networks such as those at endocytic actin patches or the lamellipodia of migrating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ghosh et al., 2004</xref>). However, the proper balance of assembly vs. disassembly must be achieved for proper actin patch dynamics, and likely involves the concerted effort of many ABPs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Competition and ABP sorting</title><p>Finally, our work highlights that the collective efforts of multiple ABPs can enhance or modulate the effects of individual ABPs on F-actin. There are many examples of multiple ABPs working together to create F-actin networks of defined organization and dynamics, including those within <italic>Listeria</italic> comet tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Loisel et al., 1999</xref>), the leading edge of motile cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanchoin et al., 2000</xref>), contractile F-actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ennomani et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reymann et al., 2012</xref>), and disassembling actin patches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jansen et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that a similar idea holds true for competition-mediated ABP segregation. Tropomyosin Cdc8 is rapidly displaced from F-actin networks due to the combined activities of fimbrin Fim1 and ADF/cofilin Adf1. Though Cdc8 alone is capable of preventing association of Adf1 with F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), Fim1 rapidly displaces Cdc8 from actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), allowing Adf1-mediated severing to occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Adf1-mediated severing feeds back on Fim1's F-actin bundling activity by creating small, severed filaments that are easily incorporated into bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), facilitating further bundling by Fim1 and increased Cdc8 displacement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Our work has implications not only for ABP sorting, but for the formation of any organized F-actin network that contains multiple components competing for the same binding substrate. Our lab has previously shown that competition for F-actin monomer is important for regulating the density and size of F-actin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Suarez et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, competitive interactions between DNA methylation and surrounding transcription factors mediate transcription factor association with certain regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Domcke et al., 2015</xref>), and competition for membrane or receptor binding has been suggested to be involved in cargo sorting in a number of contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Soza et al., 2004</xref>). Overall, our work and the work of others suggest that competitive interactions between individual components can have large-scale effects on cellular organization in many contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tropomyosin Cdc8 mutagenesis</title><p>All plasmid design and construction were performed using SnapGene software (from GSL Biotech; available at snapgene.com).

The actin ROIs were then applied to the Cdc8 (647) channel and adjusted slightly if necessary to account for movement of the actin filament during channel switching. A kymograph of the Cdc8 647 channel was created from the ROIs using an adapted version of Kymograph - Time Space Plot ImageJ plugin (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/kymograph.html">http://www.embl.de/eamnet/html/kymograph.html</ext-link>). Spreading rates were determined from kymographs by identifying examples of constant growth over at least 15 s (three frames). The distance of growth over time was calculated to determine a rate of spreading.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Site of second tropomyosin Cdc8 binding event</title><p>To determine whether the two tropomyosin Cdc8 cables on each side of the actin filament are influenced by each other, we first quantified whether a second Cdc8 binding event on an actin filament was more or less likely to bind at a site that is already bound by Cdc8 on one side. First Cdc8 binding events were determined as stated above, and those actin filaments were observed until a second Cdc8 binding event occurred, and whether or not the binding occurred at a site already occupied by Cdc8 or not was determined. At that frame, the length of the actin filament as well as the total Cdc8 cable length was calculated to determine the current percent occupancy of Cdc8 on the actin filament. These ‘current occupancies’ were then binned into 0–12.5%, 12.5–25% or 25–50% occupancy. Initial occupancy cannot exceed 50% as one Cdc8 binding event could at most cover one side of the actin filament, or half of the available binding sites.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Second binding probability analysis</title><p>To determine whether the proportion of observed second binding events that bind opposite a tropomyosin Cdc8-bound segment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) would be expected in the absence of indirect cooperativity, or whether they are more likely given inclusion of some positive or negative indirect cooperativity factor, we performed a bootstrapping-type analysis on the n = 37 observed events. For this analysis we asked, given experimental data, what is the probability that the second binding events are binding randomly vs binding in a biased fashion towards or against being across from a Cdc8-coated segment? For an actin filament of length L<sub>a</sub> and a first Cdc8 cable of length L<sub>1</sub> starting at position x<sub>1</sub> (in the range 0 to L<sub>a</sub>-L<sub>1</sub>) along the actin filament, we determined the probability of a second Cdc8 cable of length L<sub>2</sub> binding across from the first Cdc8 cable. We then compared the probability generated from different models with our experimental results. To account for experimental resolution, we divided the actin filament into a grid of 100 nm segments. In order to compute the probability of the second binding event overlapping with the first Cdc8 cable, we counted the number of places the second cable could bind that overlaps with the first cable of length L<sub>1</sub>, and divided by the total number of potential places a second Cdc8 cable of length L<sub>2</sub> could bind. As a helical actin filament has two grooves, there are twice as many potential binding sites on F-actin unoccupied by Cdc8 as those occupied by a single Cdc8 cable. However, if there is any overlap of second Cdc8 cable binding with the first Cdc8 cable, we assumed that there was only one potential binding face. For random binding, Cdc8 binding to each actin site was given an equivalent likelihood. To account for potential indirect cooperativity, we performed a weighted sum, where the second Cdc8 cable binding is proportionally more or less likely by a factor of <italic>c</italic> at all sites overlapping with the first cable of Cdc8. The probability of an overlapping binding was therefore given by the following three expressions:<disp-formula id="equ13"><mml:math id="m13"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"

Finally, we performed a bootstrapping analysis.

Binning these events similar to the experimental data, we computed the values shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Lattice model of tropomyosin Cdc8 loading and spreading</title><p>To probe the microscopic origins of the high cooperativity observed for tropomyosin Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we distinguished between two potential cooperative mechanisms: (1) end-to-end cooperativity and (2) indirect cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We distinguished between these two models by modeling the binding kinetics of Cdc8 to a growing actin filament using a lattice model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>, 4 Ci). As two distinct Cdc8 cables can bind to an actin filament (one on the surface of each groove of the helical actin filament), we represented the actin filament as a lattice with two rows representing the two actin surfaces potentially bound by Cdc8. Each Cdc8 molecule interacts across four actin monomers, meaning that a bound Cdc8 extends over the length of 8 actin monomers total. Therefore, as each Cdc8 cable is represented separately, we ascribed to each lattice site a length <italic>l</italic> of approximately 21.6 nm (assuming an approximate actin spacing of 2.7 nm). The dynamics of Cdc8 molecules associating with this lattice were then simulated using a kinetic Monte Carlo procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newman and Barkema, 1999</xref>).</p><p>First, we considered the case for a non-elongating actin filament, represented by a fixed lattice of length N. Each potential Cdc8 binding site can either be occupied (1) or unoccupied (0) by Cdc8. We described binding site site <italic>i</italic> in row <italic>j</italic> as <italic>x<sub>ij</sub></italic>. Every unoccupied site had a base on-rate k<sub>on</sub> (0→1) and a base off-rate k<sub>off</sub> (1→0). To include the effect of end-to-end cooperativity, the on-rate for unoccupied site <italic>ij</italic> was multiplied by a factor of w and the off-rate for occupied site <italic>ij</italic> was divided by a factor of w for each occupied immediate neighbor in the same row (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bi</xref>). Using these parameters, we ran a model describing Cdc8 binding with end-to-end cooperativity as the sole form of cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In order to additionally probe the potential role of indirect cooperativity, we adjusted the same model to include additional parameters for indirect cooperativity. In this model, on-rates were multiplied by a factor c and off-rates were divided by a factor c for each occupied site in the opposite row (row 1-j) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Ci</xref>). For a lattice size 2xN sites, there were precisely 2xN possible events. The dynamics were then solved using kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Newman and Barkema, 1999</xref>) up to a chosen time <italic>max_time</italic> or until the lattice was completely filled. In order to factor in an elongating actin filament, an additional type of event representing actin filament growth was included, with a rate equal to the input growth rate of actin, <italic>v<sub>grow</sub></italic>. In this case, whenever that event was selected by the algorithm, time was advanced and N was set equal to</p><p>N = floor(new_time*site_extension_rate)</p><p>To make kymographs and to compute the occupancy of Cdc8 as accurately as possible, we processed the output raw simulation data in three ways:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>In TIRFM experiments, ~20% of Cdc8 molecules were labeled.

To approximate this, each remaining occupied site was broadened by filling in adjacent sites in the same row within a radius of 100 nm (±4 sites), the experimental resolution.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The two rows were summed together to give fluorescence values of 0, 1, or two at each site along the actin filament.</p></list-item></list><p>The coverage data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Biii and 4Ciii</xref> as computed by averaging this fluorescence level over the filament at the time when the filament had length 6 μm over 24 such simulations. 6 μm was the average length of the actin filaments at the frame used for quantification of Cdc8 coverage in TIRFM experiments (4Aiii). In order to choose the values of w, c and k<sub>off</sub>, we first fixed c, and tried combinations of k<sub>off</sub> and w that gave (a) the best match to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as k<sub>on</sub> is scanned, and (b) gave kymographs whose first time for observed binding was similar to what was observed experimentally. Due to cooperative binding effects, modeling is required to find a value for k<sub>on</sub> that is commensurate with experimental data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, k<sub>off</sub> was measured from single molecule Cdc8 events on an actin filament fully coated by Cdc8. In our model, the microscopic k<sub>off</sub> corresponding to this situation was k<sub>off</sub><sup>measured</sup> = k<sub>off</sub><sup>model</sup>/w<sup>2</sup>/c. Using k<sub>off</sub><sup>model</sup> values far from those measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> did not give a good agreement with the data. Constraining k<sub>off</sub> to the value measured experimentally results in a single value of w that best matched the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, parameters k<sub>off</sub> = 116.8 sec<sup>−1</sup>, w = 40, c = 1, K<sub>d </sub>= 0.08 sec<sup>-1</sup>), with the results from these simulations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. However, these simulations did not match the experimental single/double coverage data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aiii</xref>). Relaxing the restraint on k<sub>off</sub> did not alleviate this problem. For a fixed value of c &gt; 1, there is a single w that best matched the experimental data. For c = 1.25, while these simulations matched the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), they over-stabilized double cable association. Hence, we slightly relaxed the restriction on k<sub>off</sub> and the simulations with parameters (k<sub>off</sub> = 300 sec<sup>−1</sup>, w = 125, c = 1.25, K<sub>d </sub>= 0.02 sec<sup>-1</sup>) matched the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) very closely as well as qualitatively reproducing many of the aspects we observed for Cdc8 loading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>We note that a limitation of this model is that it did not allow for any ‘frame shifts’ in the Cdc8 binding. Hence there cannot be defects in Cdc8 occupancy on a cable that are smaller than four actin monomers in these representations, and we did not allow the Cdc8 to ‘slide’ except by binding and unbinding. The first part of this could be addressed by using a lattice of 4x higher resolution. However, since we did not know how to account for the end-to-end cooperativity in this case, or how to represent the sliding dynamics, we chose the simpler representation for the purposes of this study.</p><p>The rates of a lattice with these w and c parameters fixed can be written in terms of energies for a two-row Ising model in a field. Since this system is still one dimensional in nature, for the infinite-length case any equilibrium properties of the system can be derived using a transfer matrix approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tsuchiya and Szabo, 1982</xref>) in the same way as for a standard Ising model (except that the transfer matrix is 4 × 4). However, given that the growth of the actin filament and the way that the data is analyzed play significant roles in the coverage fractions computed, we have found the simulations useful since they are able to replicate the full dynamics as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Bii and 4Cii</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Bundling quantification</title><p>The percentage of actin filaments bundled was quantified at similar F-actin densities (between 800 and 1100 μm per field) for each experiment.

Indirect Cooperativity of Tropomyosin:</p><p>The authors propose that Tropomyosin engages in both end to end binding and therefore direct cooperative along with an ill-defined indirect cooperativity that facilitates preferential loading of tropomyosin on the opposing actin surface.

Tropomyosin mediated actin stabilisation can, in principle, lead to increased probability of tropomyosin loading based on an increased lifetime of a stabilised actin filament. Also the initial loading event whether across or along the filament gives rise to a spike in intensity (taken as the seed of the loading event), that seems to become uniform over time.

The authors have the tools and can easily address potential competition between Ain1 / Fim1/ Cdc8. This becomes particularly important if one considers some of the work of Doug Robinson and colleagues who have investigated micro and nanosecond occupancies of Fimbrin, A-actinin, and cortexilin on actin (Experiment or discussion).</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an extremely interesting and important question, which is a major area of investigation that we have been actively pursuing. In fact, we are preparing a new manuscript describing this work that we will soon be submitting to <italic>eLife</italic> as an accompanying 'Research Advance' article that is tentatively entitled &quot;Cooperation between Tropomyosin Cdc8 and α-actinin Ain1 prevents fimbrin Fim1 association with contractile ring F-actin.&quot; In brief, we have discovered that the competitive relationship is specific to Fim1 and Cdc8.</p><p>Conversely, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) Ain1 and Cdc8 do not compete with each other, and instead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) Cdc8 actually enhances Ain1-mediated bundling, which (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) allows Ain1 and Cdc8 to collectively compete effectively for actin filaments with Fim1. Our 'Research Advance&quot; manuscript also focuses on the importance of occupancy time of these ABPs in their sorting to distinct F-actin networks in fission yeast.</p><p>We also agree that it is important to reference work from the Robinson lab and the importance of dynamics in mediating ABP sorting, and have added a new section to the Discussion: “We suspect that Fim1’s long residence time on F-actin bundles enhance its ability to create regions of high Fim1 occupancy that displace Cdc8, suggesting that ABP dynamics (on-/off-rate) may partially dictate the ability of an ABP to compete. An ABP’s dynamics could be driven by its intrinsic biochemical properties (Winkelman et al., 2016), post- translational modifications (Miao et al., 2016), or mechanical stresses within the F-actin network (Srivastaya and Robinson, 2015), resulting in the fine-tuning of ABP sorting by many factors.”</p><p><italic>2) East et al. (Biochem J) have described tropomyosin mutants that lack the ability for dimer formation. The authors could test use mutant protein as a control to demonstrate Cdc8 cooperativity. This paper was not referred and I hope the authors will rectify this (This is essential).</italic> </p><p>The mutants referred to in this paper are still capable of forming Cdc8 dimers, but have mutations in the end-to-end binding regions that inhibit or enhance the ability of Cdc8 to polymerize into cables. Due to the unusual binding dynamics of Cdc8 on F-actin, it is difficult to assess our model of Cdc8 indirect cooperativity using these mutants. An ideal experiment would enhance the ability of Cdc8 to bind to F-actin while inhibiting its end-to-end binding. However, a mutant that is able to strongly associate with actin without being able to polymerize has not been identified. Therefore, though these mutants are certainly interesting, it would be difficult to address our model of indirect cooperativity with use of these mutants, as they only inhibit or enhance ability of Cdc8 to polymerize. We agree that this is an important paper to refer to and have included the following new statement: “Mutations in the N- or C-terminal domains of Cdc8 affect its ability to bind cooperatively and polymerize on an actin filament (East et al., 2011).”</p><p><italic>3) Adf1 preferentially binds to ADP-F-actin and Cdc8 has no preference for the ATP/ADP state of F-actin. How about Fim1? This can be informative on mechanisms of competition to load key binding proteins onto actin filaments. (Experiment or discussion).</italic> </p><p>Our lab has previously determined that fimbrin Fim1 has no preference for the ATP/ADP state of F-actin (Skau et al., 2011). We agree that the mechanisms of initial loading of key ABPs is particularly interesting and is the subject of current research in our lab.</p><p><italic>4) Indirect Cooperativity of Tropomyosin:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors propose that Tropomyosin engages in both end to end binding and therefore direct cooperative along with an ill-defined indirect cooperativity that facilitates preferential loading of tropomyosin on the opposing actin surface. This is evidenced by an increased Fluorescence intensity of tropomyosin along actin filament. This mechanism of such cooperativity merits some discussion. Tropomyosin mediated actin stabilisation can, in principle, lead to increased probability of tropomyosin loading based on an increased lifetime of a stabilised actin filament.

Does the seed lose its structure? Does it unload after initiating the reaction? Or is it an artefact of photo-bleaching? (discussion).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the mechanism of indirect cooperativity merits further discussion, and have also thought that this may be a result of stabilization of the actin filament, particularly as it is known that Cdc8 enhances the persistence length of F-actin. We have added new additional discussion:</p><p>“Tropomyosin is known to increase the persistence length of F-actin (Fujime and Ishiwata, 1971; Isambert et al., 1995). As a result, the stabilizing effect of an initial Cdc8 binding to one side of the actin filament may favor binding of a second Cdc8 to the opposing side. Additionally, if the rigidity provided by initial Cdc8 binding is propagated slightly further up or down the actin filament, more tropomyosin molecules could associate with the actin filament as a result of an increase in F-actin rigidity.”</p><p>The uniformity over time in fluorescence appears to be an artifact of photobleaching, as it happens faster when we image more frequently. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that tropomyosin molecules are leaving the cable, potentially at ‘gap’ regions. The longer cables appear to remain intact, though we do observe small seeds (especially at lower concentrations of tropomyosin) that do grow and shrink more frequently.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>:a) From text (Results section) it appears that the authors suggest that the Cdc8 (I76C) more closely resembles the wild type tropomyosin than either L38C or D142C. In the figures however, D142C seems strikingly identical to I76C, if not marginally better (1E, 1F: Quantification of cytokinesis abnormality). Therefore it is not clear to me why I76C was chosen over D142C. (explanation/discussion).</italic> </p><p>The I76C and D142C Cdc8 mutants are both suitable for TIRF microscopy experiments, and in fact, we use both in the lab. However, we have found that I76C has been easier to label well consistently, for reasons that are unclear. Additionally, our updated analysis both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>) show that I76C and D142C are very similar and both are viable options for experiments. We have added new additional characterization that further informs our decision on which mutant to use: “We examined the functionality of each Cdc8 mutant in vitro and in vivo to identify the mutant most similar to wild-type Cdc8. Two mutants, Cdc8(I76C) and Cdc8(D142C), bound F-actin similarly to wild type Cdc8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>), were able to be labeled and visualized by TIRFM (100% of actin filaments associated with tropomyosin, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and caused only very mild cytokinesis defects as the sole copy of Cdc8 in fission yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>). Therefore, we chose one of these mutants, Cdc8(I76C) for further study in TIRFM experiments.”</p><p> <italic>b) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>:</italic> </p><p><italic>The Y-axis reads &quot;Cdc8 pellet normalised to highest value&quot;</italic> </p><p><italic>It's not clear to the reader what highest value is it normalised to. Is it the highest cdc8 pellet recovered or the actin amount. Either case I think it's better to plot cdc8 (pellet) normalised to its associated actin amount. (figure modification).</italic> </p><p>These plots were normalized to the highest Cdc8 recovered. When we plot Cdc8 in the pellet normalized to its associated actin, all mutants appear to bind F-actin similarly. We have changed the graph to show Cdc8 pellet normalized to associated actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) Subsection “Tropomyosin Cdc8 is actively displaced from F-actin bundled by fim1.”a) The authors make a strong closing argument in this section –</italic> </p><p><italic>&quot;These findings suggest that the cooperativity of Cdc8 assists not only its assembly onto filaments but also its rapid displacement specifically from F-actin networks bundled by Fim1.&quot; However all the evidence strictly points to a fim1 mediated displacement of cdc8 and not any involvement of cdc8's cooperativity in this unloading.

The stripping of Cdc8 cables from initial sites of removal is what led us to this conclusion, but we agree that we have overstated the claim. We have toned down our conclusions and it now reads “These findings demonstrate that Fim1-mediated bundling displaces Cdc8 from the actin network. Additionally, as Cdc8 appears to be rapidly ‘stripped’ from a few initial dissociation points, it is possible that the cooperativity of Cdc8 assists not only its assembly onto filaments but also its rapid displacement specifically from F-actin networks bundled by Fim1.”</p><p><italic>b) The authors, although not explicitly, seem to wrongly indicate the contractile ring is devoid of cofillin. (clarify this point).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the wording is confusing and have clarified the point to now read “Though Cdc8's presence at the contractile ring and actin cables likely prevents the unwanted association of several types of ABPs at those F-actin networks, opposing mechanisms must be in place to prevent Cdc8 from associating with actin patches“.</p></body></sub-article></article>
