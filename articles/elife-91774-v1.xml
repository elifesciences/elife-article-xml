of many highly damaging crop pests. Resurgence can result from pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction; however, the molecular mechanisms mediating this process remain unresolved. Here we show that brown planthopper (BPH) resurgence in rice crops following exposure to sublethal doses of the pesticide emamectin benzoate (EB) results from the coordinated action of a suite of genes that regulate juvenile hormone (JH) levels, resulting in increased JH titer in adult females and enhanced fecundity. We demonstrate that EB treatment at sublethal levels results in profound changes in female BPH fitness, including increased egg maturation and oviposition. This enhanced reproductive fitness results from the EB-mediated upregulation of key genes involved in the regulation of JH, including <italic>JHAMT and Kr-h1</italic> and the downregulation of allatostatin (<italic>AstA</italic>) and allatostatin receptor (<italic>AstAR</italic>) expression. AstA signaling is known to inhibit the production of JH in the corpora allata and hence EB exposure diminishes this inhibitory action. We find that the changes in gene expression following EB exposure are caused by the allosteric action of this insecticide on its molecular target, the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluClα). Collectively, these results provide mechanistic insights into the regulation of negative pesticide-induced responses in insects and reveal some key actors involved in the JH-signaling pathway that underpin pesticide resurgence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>resurgence</kwd><kwd>reproduction</kwd><kwd>pesticide</kwd><kwd>brown planthopper</kwd><kwd>allatostatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFD1700200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shun-Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32472542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Shun-Fan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sublethal emamectin benzoate alters juvenile hormone-regulating genes to boost brown planthopper fecundity and cause resurgence.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemical pesticides remain the primary means of controlling many of the world’s most damaging arthropod crop pests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Janssen and van Rijn, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>). However, pesticide applications can result in pest resurgence, increases in pest insect populations that exceed natural, untreated population sizes, following an initial reduction of the pest population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gandara et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guedes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Two mechanisms have been implicated in pest resurgence—the loss of beneficial insects including natural enemies and pesticide-enhanced reproduction in the pest insect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In the case of the latter, several pesticides, such as the insecticides triazophos, deltamethrin, and the fungicide jinggangmycin, have been reported to stimulate reproduction in pest insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Pesticide-enhanced pest reproduction has been linked to changes in the physiology and biochemistry of pest organisms after exposure to pesticides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guedes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying enhanced reproduction associated with pest resurgence remain poorly resolved.</p><p>The brown planthopper (BPH), <italic>Nilaparvata lugens</italic> (Stål), is a notorious pest of rice crops throughout Asia causing annual losses of ~300 million dollars across major rice-producing countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>). BPH inhibits the growth of rice plants by feeding on the phloem and also transmits highly damaging plant viruses including rice grassy stunt virus and rice ragged stunt virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sōgawa, 1982</xref>). Currently, chemical insecticides play an indispensable role in the control of BPH due to their efficiency, rapid effect, and low cost. However, due to the widespread and intensive use of chemical insecticides, BPH has developed resistance to the majority of compounds used for control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zeng et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Emamectin benzoate (EB) and abamectin are avermectin pesticides and act as allosteric modulators of insect glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluClα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolstenholme, 2012</xref>), thereby inhibiting muscle contractions that lead to the cessation of insect feeding and subsequent death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ishaaya et al., 2002</xref>). These insecticides exhibit particularly strong effects against Lepidoptera such as the rice leaffolder, <italic>Cnaphalocrocis medinalis</italic> Guénee, an important foliage-feeding insect that attacks rice during the vegetative stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chintalapati et al., 2016</xref>). Both BPH and the rice leaffolder are migratory pests with overlapping migratory paths; however, their occurrence period in the field differs by approximately 1 month, with leaffolders appearing earlier than BPH. Therefore, the use of EB to control rice leaffolder has the potential to impact BPH arriving later via exposure to sublethal concentrations of this compound. It has been observed that when farmers use EB and abamectin to control leaffolders on rice crops in China, BPH outbreaks frequently occur in the same field. While sublethal doses of certain pesticides have been shown to enhance fecundity in BPH, including the insecticides triazophos and deltamethrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Zhang et al., 2022b</xref>) and the fungicides carbendazim and jinggangmycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2018a</xref>), whether avermectins trigger resurgence in BPH via insecticide-enhanced reproduction remains unclear.</p><p>Reproduction in insects is influenced by external factors such as light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2021</xref>), temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meiselman et al., 2022</xref>), humidity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Roy et al., 2015</xref>), and nutrition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smykal and Raikhel, 2015</xref>), as well as endogenous factors such as juvenile hormone (JH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2019</xref>), ecdysone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hun et al., 2022</xref>), insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ling and Raikhel, 2018</xref>), and target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badisco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lu et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, JH has been particularly implicated in insecticide-induced enhanced fecundity, with triazophos and deltamethrin treatments leading to increased circulating JH III titers in BPH females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). JH is synthesized and secreted by the corpora allata in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Luo et al., 2021</xref>), and promotes reproduction by regulating the biosynthesis and secretion of vitellogenin (Vg) in the female fat body, and stimulating the absorption of Vg by the developing oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). However, the regulation of JH is complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riddiford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2019</xref>) and the key actors involved in JH-mediated pesticide-enhanced reproduction remain to be resolved. Previous findings reported that the GluCl receptor is involved in JH biosynthesis in cockroaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiang et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether insecticides that target the GluClα can increase reproduction in pest insects and the mechanisms by which GluClα receptors regulate JH production remain to be unraveled.</p><p>In this study, we used a range of approaches to investigate the impact of sublethal doses of avermectins on BPH fecundity and unravel the molecular mechanisms mediating enhanced reproduction following exposure to this insecticide class. We show that avermectin exposure results in profound changes in the expression of a key suite of genes that in combination regulate JH, which results in increased JH titer in adult females, which promotes fecundity. Interestingly, we found that EB, known as an allosteric GluClα channel modulator, can downregulate AstA/AstAR expression and thereby promote JH production.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Allosteric modulators (emamectin benzoate and abamectin) of the GluClα channel stimulate fecundity of female <italic>N. lugens</italic></title><p>To investigate whether GluClα modulators affect fecundity in BPH, we first determined the sublethal and median lethal doses of EB on fourth-instar nymphs, as well as on newly emerged males and females of BPH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For this, we employed two different bioassay methods, the rice seedling dip bioassay method and topical application bioassay method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yao et al., 2017</xref>), in order to assess both the systemic and contact toxicity of these insecticides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then systematically treated fourth-instar nymphs of BPH, newly emerged males and females with the estimated LC<sub>15</sub> or LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB and examined the fecundity of BPH after these individuals mated with treated or untreated individuals. We use the term ‘t’ to represent individuals treated with EB and ‘ck’ to indicate control individuals that were treated with insecticide diluent minus insecticide. First, we tested whether treatment of BPH with EB in the nymphal stage impairs the fecundity of BPH at the adult stage and thus exposed fourth-instar BPH nymphs to the pesticide. After exposure to the LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB, the number of eggs laid per female of BPH in ♀t × ♂t crosses increased by 1.48- and 1.40-fold compared with control ♀ck × ♂ck crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); the number of eggs laid per female of BPH in ♀t × ♂ck crosses increased by 1.53- and 2.07-fold compared with control crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the number of eggs laid per female of BPH in ♀ck × ♂t crosses did not increase significantly compared to control ♀ck × ♂ck crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fecundity of brown planthopper (BPH) following exposure to sublethal (LC<sub>15</sub>) and median lethal (LC<sub>50</sub>) concentrations of emamectin benzoate following systemic application bioassays (A: ♀t ×♂t; B: ♀t ×♂ck; C: ♀ck ×♂t) and topical application bioassays (D: ♀t ×♂t; E: ♀t ×♂ck; F: ♀ck ×♂t), respectively.</title><p>The letter ‘t’ represents treatment with insecticide, while ‘ck’ indicates controls that were not treated with insecticide.

Indeed, treating newly emerged adults with the LD<sub>15</sub> and LD<sub>50</sub> concentrations of EB significantly stimulated the number of eggs laid per female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Furthermore, sublethal exposure of fourth-instar BPH nymphs to another allosteric modulator of GluClα, abamectin (LC<sub>15</sub> and LC<sub>50</sub> concentrations), was also found to significantly enhance oviposition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether EB administered during the fourth-instar larval stage persists as residues in the adult stage, we used HPLC-MS/MS to quantify the amount of EB present at the adult stage after exposing fourth-instar nymphs to this compound. However, we found no detectable EB residues in the adult stage following fourth-instar nymphal treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggests that the mechanism underlying the increased fecundity of female adults induced by EB treatment of nymphs may differ from that caused by direct EB treatment of female adults. Combined with our previous observation that EB treatment significantly increased the body weight of adult females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E and F</xref>), a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that EB may enhance food intake in BPH, potentially leading to elevated production of insulin-like peptides and thus increased growth. Increased insulin signaling could potentially also stimulate JH biosynthesis during the adult stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badisco et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To examine if EB also stimulates egg-laying in other insect species, we conducted bioassays on the small BPH, <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic>, the white-backed planthopper, <italic>Sogatella furcifera,</italic> and vinegar flies, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

Stage 1: connected to the germarium, the egg is trapezoidal. Stage 2: the egg is larger than in stage 1 and is square to rectangular. Stage 3: the egg begins to elongate toward both poles, taking on an oval shape. Stage 4: the egg continues to enlarge and elongate, becoming spindle-shaped. Due to rapid growth, follicle cells on the egg surface start dividing, indicating nuclear division. Stage 5: the egg further enlarges, and most follicle cells display binucleation, the most notable feature of this stage. Small amounts of lipids start entering the egg. Stage 5 is the final stage before maturation, after which the egg enters the pedicel, a structure primarily formed by muscle fibers. The expanded mature egg stretches the muscle fibers in the pedicel, increasing the spacing between them. Stage 6: this is the mature egg stage, which occurs after the egg passes through the pedicel. During this stage, the egg undergoes rapid growth, continuously absorbing vitellogenin and lipids (Nile red staining confirmed that Stage 6 has the highest lipid content). This absorption causes the egg’s surface color to transition from the transparency seen in Stage 5 to mature eggs' dark, opaque appearance. Once the egg enters the pedicel and becomes completely opaque, it reaches full maturity. The mature egg then moves into the lateral oviduct for oviposition, completing the egg-laying process.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91774-fig2-figsupp2-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Amounts of glycogen (<bold>A</bold>), TAG (<bold>B</bold>), total protein content (<bold>C</bold>), cholesterol (<bold>D</bold>), and four circulating sugars including sucrose, glucose, fructose, and trehalose (<bold>E–H</bold>) after brown planthopper (BPH) exposure to emamectin benzoate (EB).</title><p>N = 3 for each point.

Thus, it is possible that other factors (indirect effects) induced by EB treatment cause the increase in the mRNA expression level of <italic>Met</italic>.</p><p>Krüppel homolog 1 (<italic>Kr-h1</italic>), a transcriptional target of JH signaling, is reported to be sensitive to levels of JH, and its expression levels are directly correlated with JH titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gospocic et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2022a</xref>). We found that <italic>Kr-h1</italic> was significantly upregulated in the adults of EB-treated BPH at the 5M, 5L nymph and 4–5 DAE stages (4.7-fold to 27.2-fold) when fourth-instar nymph or female adults were treated with EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D</xref>).</p><p>Similarly, the expression level of <italic>vitellogenin</italic> (<italic>Vg</italic>), a key downstream component of JH signaling that triggers ovarian development in insects, including BPH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shen et al., 2019</xref>), was markedly increased in females at 2–5 DAE by EB (1.7-fold to 5.5-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). During the maturation process, eggs require uptake of vg, and an increase in vg content can accelerate egg maturation, producing more mature eggs. Since our molecular data suggest that EB treatment leads to an upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> expression, we propose that the increase in egg-laying caused by EB treatment is at least in part due to the upregulation of <italic>vg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), which elevates Vg content, leading to increased uptake of Vg by maturing eggs and resulting in the production of more mature eggs.</p><p>Juvenile hormone esterase (JHE) is the primary JH-specific degradation enzyme that plays a key role in regulating JH titers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kamita et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we observed a significant upregulation of JHE mRNA levels in the early and middle fifth-instar nymph stage, followed by downregulation in 5L instar nymphs of EB-treated BPH (1.3-fold to 2.6-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that EB has a profound impact on the expression of key genes involved in the biosynthesis of JH or genes in the downstream signaling pathway genes that might promote egg development and female fecundity. However, our data do not allow us to conclude whether the effect of EB on the genes regulating the JH titer is direct or indirect.</p><p>To further understand whether these JH pathway-related genes are involved in egg-laying behavior in BPH, we performed RNAi experiments to downregulate the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We found that silencing of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> diminished <italic>vg</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Importantly, RNAi-induced diminishment of <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met,</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> genes in female BPH was also found to suppress egg-laying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>). However, this phenotype was rescued by EB treatment, which restored egg-laying to normal levels in BPH injected with <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>Met,</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> dsRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K–M</xref>). Note that this rescue is possible since knockdown of the genes is incomplete when using dsRNA injection (and residual gene expression allows for EB action). Together these results provide a mechanistic understanding of how EB enhances fecundity in BPH by modulating the expression of key genes involved in JH synthesis.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether EB treatment could rescue the dsRNA-mediated gene silencing effect. To address this, we selected the <italic>Kr-h1</italic> gene and analyzed its expression levels after EB treatment. Our results showed that <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression was suppressed by ~70% at 72 h post-dsRNA injection. However, EB treatment did not significantly rescue <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression in gene knockdown insects (*<italic>p</italic>* &gt; 0.05 compared with <italic>dsKr-h1</italic> treatment) at 24 h post-EB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). While dsRNA-mediated <italic>Kr-h1</italic> suppression was robust initially, its efficacy may decline during prolonged experiments. This aligns with reports in BPH, where effects of RNAi gradually diminish beyond 7 days post-injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2010a</xref>). The late-phase fecundity increase might reflect partial <italic>Kr-h1</italic> recovery due to RNAi degradation, allowing residual EB to weakly stimulate reproduction. In addition, the physiological impact of EB (e.g., neurotoxicity, hormonal modulation) could manifest via compensatory feedback loops or metabolic remodeling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>EB induces JH biosynthesis through the peptidergic AstA/AstAR signaling pathway</title><p>In many insect species, the timing and level of JH biosynthesis can be precisely regulated by neuropeptides, such as stimulatory allatotropins (ATs) and inhibitory allatostatins (Asts), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bellés et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kataoka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lorenz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stay and Tobe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verlinden et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wegener and Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodhead et al., 1989</xref>).

However, the mechanisms underpinning pesticide-enhanced reproduction in insects remain poorly understood. Here we reveal that a suite of molecular actors underlie this trait that, in combination, mediate profound physiological changes in the reproductive fitness of female BPH. Our data provide fundamental insights into the molecular mechanisms by which xenobiotics modify insect reproduction and have implications for devising strategies for the control of a highly damaging crop pest.

Although this is the first report of sublethal doses of avermectins enhancing insect fecundity, our findings are consistent with previous studies, which have shown that certain other insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides stimulate BPH reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ge et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>). Intriguingly, we show that EB only induces fecundity in female adults and is specific to BPH, with EB exposure failing to enhance reproduction in two related species, the small BPH, <italic>L. striatellus</italic> and the white-backed planthopper, <italic>S. furcifera</italic>, or the model insect <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Thus, the mechanisms underpinning this trait appear to act exclusively on female BPH and may be specific to this species. Nevertheless, our findings are of general interest since they link the molecular EB target, the GluCl channel, and JH signaling to fecundity. Furthermore, our preliminary experiments suggest that EB diminishes fecundity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>), a finding worth pursuing in this genetically tractable insect. It can be noted that the GluCl channels were first identified and cloned in the nematode worm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where they were also found to be targets of avermectins and involved in reproduction and fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wolstenholme, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Pesticides may stimulate insect reproduction through a variety of physiological and molecular mechanisms. Our data reveal that exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of EB results in profound changes to female BPH fitness, leading to increases in female weight, contents of total protein, cholesterol, and sugars, as well as egg production and decreases in duration of the preoviposition period. Some of these findings exhibit parallels with previous studies, which demonstrated that treating third-instar BPH nymphs with either deltamethrin, triazophos, or imidacloprid led to increased soluble sugar levels in the corresponding adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yin et al., 2008</xref>). Such metabolites provide the energy that drives BPH reproduction and hence resurgence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, together with prior work, our results suggest that pesticides associated with resurgence stimulate nutritional intake in BPH to fuel enhanced energy-intensive reproduction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The JH signaling pathway plays an essential role in EB-induced fecundity in BPH</title><p>JH is a pleiotropic hormone, which plays important roles in development and reproduction in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jindra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Riddiford, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). Circulating JH titers are regulated by factors that control JH production in the corpora allata including biosynthetic enzymes and catabolic enzymes that regulate JH levels. Our results show that EB exposure is associated with increased circulating JH III titers in BPH females over 2–4 DAE and promotes ovarian development. Previous studies have reported that triazophos and deltamethrin treatments also lead to increased circulating JH III titers in BPH females over 1–3 days post emergence. Similarly, jinggangmycin treatments were found to lead to increased JH titers (by approximately 45–50%) in BPH females over 2 days post emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, our findings, in combination with these previous studies, demonstrate that insecticide treatments can have dramatic effects on the regulation of key insect hormones involved in pest reproduction, which can in turn drive pesticide resurgence.</p><p>Although increased JH titers following pesticide exposure have been correlated with reduced levels of active JH esterase during the first 3 days PE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ge et al., 2010</xref>), the types and numbers of mechanisms mediating the observed increase in hormone titer have remained an open question. Our data reveal that the elevated JH titer in EB-exposed BPH is associated with the upregulation of a gene that encodes a biosynthetic enzyme for JH (<italic>JHAMT</italic>) and a downstream signaling gene that can induce <italic>vg</italic> gene expression (<italic>kr-h1</italic>). Using RNAi, we provide experimental evidence of the role of these genes in the regulation of JH III and fecundity of female BPH and demonstrate that EB can restore the reduction in egg production resulting from the partial RNAi knockdown of <italic>JHAMT</italic>, <italic>met,</italic> and <italic>kr-h1</italic> expression.</p><p>JHMAT is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of inactive precursors of JH to active JH in the final stages of JH biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nouzova et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shinoda and Itoyama, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, while it has not been previously implicated in pesticide resurgence, treatment of the stored product pest <italic>Sitotroga cerealella</italic> with diallyl trisulfide, an insecticidal compound in garlic essential oil, was found to increase JHAMT mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Shah et al., 2022</xref>). Because JHMAT is the key rate-limiting enzyme in the regulation of JH titer, our results suggest that its enhanced expression is a key molecular mechanism of pesticide resurgence in BPH.</p><p>Met is a ligand-activated member of the basic helix–loop–helix Per/Arnt/Sim (bHLH-PAS) transcription factors and is the intracellular receptor for JH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charles et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jindra et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Riddiford, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhu et al., 2019</xref>). Kr-h1 is a zinc finger protein that acts downstream of Met and is expressed in response to JH signaling. Although the genes encoding these proteins have not been previously linked to pesticide resurgence, our finding that they are upregulated following EB exposure and demonstration of their role in promoting fecundity is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Santos et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, treatment of BPH with JH III or the insecticidal analogs methoprene or pyriproxyfen was found to induce the expression of <italic>Kr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> in brachypterous BPH females was found to result in delayed ovariole maturation, and this was significantly more pronounced than the response observed in BPH treated separately with ds<italic>NlMet</italic> or ds<italic>NlKr-h1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2015</xref>). This finding provides evidence of a possible interaction between <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> and, in combination with our data, suggests that <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>Kr-h1</italic> may act in concert to mediate EB-enhanced fecundity. However, our results showed that EB treatment can weakly increase (about twofold) expression of the <italic>Met</italic> gene in BPH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Our data furthermore indicates that <italic>Met</italic> and <italic>FAMeT</italic> expression levels were not drastically influenced by EB compared with <italic>kr-h1</italic> and <italic>vg</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). It should be mentioned that JH action does not directly result in the increase of <italic>Met</italic>. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that other factors (indirect effects), induced by EB treatment, increase the mRNA expression level of <italic>Met</italic>. One recent paper reported that downregulation of transcription factor <italic>CncC</italic> increases met expression in beetles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> in the reference; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>).

This transcriptome reprogramming is dependent on the allosteric action of EB on its molecular target the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) receptor. Note that the mechanism of action on the GluCl is unknown in BPH, but likely the channel conformation changes and renders the receptor dysfunctional. Importantly, we do not suggest that the GluCl upregulation is due to direct action of EB on the channel. The resulting increased JH titer promotes vitellogenin (vg) biosynthesis and increased fecundity in EB-exposed insects.

This finding indicates that the EB-induced increase in adult fecundity is initiated during the nymphal stage and manifests in adulthood—a mechanism distinct from the direct fecundity enhancement of fecundity observed when EB is applied to adults. We propose that sublethal EB exposure during critical nymphal stages may reprogram metabolic or endocrine pathways, potentially via insulin/JH crosstalk. For instance, increased nutrient storage (e.g., proteins, sugars; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) could enhance insulin signaling, which in turn promotes JH biosynthesis in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ling and Raikhel, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirth et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sheng et al., 2011</xref>).

These include the inhibitory allatostatins: FGLamides (FGLa; AstA), the W(X)6Wamides (AstB), and the PISCFs (AstC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nässel, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stay et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stay and Tobe, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wegener and Chen, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>).

We provide evidence for the functional impact of this on JH synthesis and BPH fecundity by (i) demonstrating that RNAi knockdown of <italic>AstAR</italic> expression results in increased JH titer and enhanced egg production, and (ii) showing that injection of female BPH with synthetic AstA peptide reduces the JH titer and decreases egg production. Thus, our data provide unequivocal evidence that AstA is a key inhibitor of JH production in BPH. This finding is consistent with previous work that has shown that FGLa/ASTs (AstA) inhibit JH biosynthesis in cockroaches and termites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woodhead et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yagi et al., 2005</xref>).

Together with our findings, this demonstrates that AstA receptors may modulate the expression of numerous downstream genes involved in metabolism, energy storage, and reproduction.

Our findings provide the foundation for further work to understand how these genes interact and the mechanisms by which their expression is activated or repressed by EB. Furthermore, our findings provide fundamental insights into the molecular response in insects to xenobiotic stress and illustrate that pesticides can have unexpected and positive impacts on pest populations. In this regard, our findings also have applied implications for the control of a highly damaging crop pest. Previous studies have reported that avermectins such as abamectin are toxic to the wolf spider <italic>Pardosa pseudoannulata</italic>, which is the main predator of BPH in rice crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sogawa, 2015</xref>). Thus, these insecticides both stimulate reproduction in BPH and kill their natural enemies, providing a ‘perfect storm’ for inducing damaging BPH outbreaks. Based on these findings, to avoid BPH resurgence, we suggest that the agents, EB and abamectin, should not be (or rarely be) applied to rice plants at growth stages when BPH are present. On a more optimistic note, our findings have identified numerous genes that play key roles in BPH reproduction and thus represent promising targets for the development of novel controls against this important pest.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p>BPH was initially collected from Wanan, Jiangxi Province, in 2020, reared on ‘Taichung Native 1’ (TN1) rice seedlings in the laboratory without exposure to any insecticides.

In its current form, how the authors have approached the review is hard to follow, in my opinion. Although the authors have taken a lot of effort in answering the questions posed by reviewers, parallel changes in the manuscript are not clearly mentioned. In many cases, the authors have acknowledged the criticism in response to the reviewer, but have not changed their narrative, particularly in the results section.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully acknowledge your concern regarding the narrative linking EB-induced GluCl expression to JH biosynthesis and fecundity enhancement, particularly the need to address alternative interpretations of the data. Below, we outline the specific revisions made to address your feedback and ensure the manuscript’s narrative aligns more precisely with the experimental evidence:</p><p>(1) Revised Wording in the Results Section</p><p>To avoid overinterpretation of causality, we have modified the language in key sections of the Results (e.g., Figure 5 and related text):</p><p>Original phrasing:</p><p>“These results suggest that EB activates GluCl which induces JH biosynthesis and release, which in turn stimulates reproduction in BPH (Figure 5J).”</p><p>Revised phrasing:</p><p>“We also examined whether silencing Gluclα impacts the AstA/AstAR signaling pathway in female adults. Knock-down of Gluclα in female adults was found to have no impact on the expression of AT, AstA, AstB, AstCC, AstAR, and AstBR. However, the expression of AstCCC and AstCR was significantly upregulated in dsGluclα-injected insects (Figure 5-figure supplement 2A-H). Further studies are required to delineate the direct or indirect mechanisms underlying this effect of Gluclα-knockdown.” (line 643-649). And we have removed Figure 5J in the revised manuscript.</p><p>(2) Expanded Discussion of Alternative Mechanisms</p><p>In the Discussion section, we have incorporated a dedicated paragraph to explore alternative pathways and compensatory mechanisms:</p><p>Key additions:</p><p>“This EB action on GluClα expression is likely indirect, and we do not consider EB as transcriptional regulator of GluClα. Thus, the mechanism behind EB-mediated induction of GluClα remains to be determined. It is possible that prolonged EB exposure triggers feedback mechanisms (e.g. cellular stress responses) to counteract EB-induced GluClα dysfunction, leading to transcriptional upregulation of the channel. Hence, considering that EB exposure in our experiments lasts several days, these findings might represent indirect (or secondary) effects caused by other factors downstream of GluCl signaling that affect channel expression.” (line 837-845).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In the response to reviewers, the authors have mentioned line numbers in the main text where changes were made. But very frequently, those lines do not refer to the changes or mention just a subsection of changes done. As an example please see point 1 of Specific Points below. The problem is throughout the document making it very difficult to follow the revision and contributing to the point mentioned above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this critical oversight. We sincerely apologize for the inconsistency in referencing line numbers and incomplete descriptions of revisions, which undoubtedly hindered your ability to track changes effectively. We have eliminated all vague or incomplete line number references from the response letter. Instead, revisions are now explicitly tied to specific sections, figures, or paragraphs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors need to infer the performed experiments rationally without over interpretation. Currently, many of the claims that the authors are making are unsubstantiated. As a result of the first review process, the authors have acknowledged the discrepancies, but they have failed to alter their interpretations accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that overinterpretation of data undermines scientific rigor. In response to your feedback, we have systematically revised the manuscript to align claims strictly with experimental evidence and to eliminate unsubstantiated assertions. We sincerely apologize for the earlier overinterpretations and appreciate your insistence on precision. The revised manuscript now rigorously distinguishes between observations (e.g., EB-GluCl-JH correlations) and hypotheses (e.g., GluCl’s mechanistic role). By tempering causal language and integrating competing explanations, we aimed to present a more accurate and defensible narrative.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SPECIFIC POINTS (to each question initially raised and their rebuttals)</p><p>(1a) &quot;Actually, there are many studies showing that insects treated with insecticides can increase the expression of target genes&quot;. Please note what is asked for is that the ligand itself induces the expression of its receptor. Of course, insecticide treatment will result in the changes expression of targets. Of all the evidences furnished in rebuttal, only Peng et al. 2017 fits the above definition. Even in this case, the accepted mode of action of chlorantraniliprole is by inducing structural change in ryanodine receptor. The observed induction of ryanodine receptor chlorantraniliprole can best be described as secondary effect. All others references do not really suffice the point asked for.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions for improving the manuscript. First, we have supplemented additional studies supporting the notion that &quot; There are several studies showing that insects treated with insecticides display increases in the expression of target genes. For example, the relative expression level of the ryanodine receptor gene of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis was increased 10-fold after treatment with chlorantraniliprole, an insecticide which targets the ryanodine receptor (Peng et al., 2017). In Drosophila, starvation (and low insulin) elevates the transcription level of the receptors of the neuropeptides short neuropeptide F and tachykinin (Ko et al., 2015; Root et al., 2011). In BPH, reduction in mRNA and protein expression of a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor α8 subunit is associated with resistance to imidacloprid (Zhang et al., 2015). Knockdown of the α8 gene by RNA interference decreased the sensitivity of N. lugens to imidacloprid (Zhang et al., 2015). Hence, the expression of receptor genes may be regulated by diverse factors, including insecticide exposure.” We have inserted text in lines 846-857 to elaborate on these possibilities.</p><p>Second, we would like to reiterate our position: we have merely described this phenomenon, specifically that EB treatment increases GluClα expression. “This EB action on GluClα expression is likely indirect, and we do not consider EB as transcriptional regulator of GluClα. Thus, the mechanism behind EB-mediated induction of GluClα remains to be determined. It is possible that prolonged EB exposure triggers feedback mechanisms (e.g. cellular stress responses) to counteract EB-induced GluClα dysfunction, leading to transcriptional upregulation of the channel. Hence, considering that EB exposure in our experiments lasts several days, these findings might represent indirect (or secondary) effects caused by other factors downstream of GluCl signaling that affect channel expression.” We have inserted text in lines 837-845 to elaborate on these possibilities.</p><p>Once again, we sincerely appreciate this discussion, which has provided us with a deeper understanding of this phenomenon.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. The authors in their rebuttal accepts that they do not consider EB to a transcriptional regulator of Gluclα and the induction of Gluclα as a result of EB can best be considered as a secondary effect. But that is not reflected in the manuscript, particularly in the result section. Current state of writing implies EB up regulation of Gluclα to an important event that contributes majorly to the hypothesis. So much so that they have retained the schematic diagram (Fig. 5J) where EB -&gt; Gluclα is drawn. Even the heading of the subsection says &quot;EB-enhanced fecundity in BPHs is dependent on its molecular target protein, the Gluclα channel&quot;. As mentioned in the general points, it is not enough to have a good rebuttal written to the reviewer, the parent manuscript needs to reflect on the changes asked for.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. We have carefully addressed your suggestions and made corresponding revisions to the manuscript.</p><p>We fully acknowledge the reviewer's valid concern. In this revised manuscript, “However, we do not propose that EB is a direct transcriptional regulator of Gluclα, since EB and other avermectins are known to alter the channel conformation and thus their function (Wolstenholme, 2012; Wu et al., 2017). Thus, it is likely that the observed increase in Gluclα transcipt is a secondary effect downstream of EB signaling.” (Line 625-629). We agree that the original presentation in the manuscript, particularly within the Results section, did not adequately reflect this nuance and could be misinterpreted as suggesting a direct regulatory role for EB on Gluclα transcription.</p><p>Regarding Fig. 5J, we have removed the figure and all mentions of Fig. 5J and its legend in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c. &quot;We have inserted text on lines 738 - 757 to explain these possibilities.&quot; Not a single line in the section mentioned above discussed the topic in hand. This is serious undermining of the review process or carelessness to the extreme level.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Results section, we have now added descriptions “Taken together, these results reveal that EB exposure is associated with an increase in JH titer and that this elevated JH signaling contributes to enhanced fecundity in BPH.” (line 375-377).</p><p>For the figures, we have removed Fig. 4N and all mentions of Fig. 4N and its legend in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Lastly, regarding the issue of locating specific lines, we deeply regret any inconvenience caused. Due to the track changes mode used during revisions, line numbers may have shifted, resulting in incorrect references. We sincerely apologize for this and have now corrected the line numbers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The section written in rebuttal should be included in the discussion as well, explaining why authors think a nymphal treatment with JH may work in increasing fecundity of the adults. Also, the authors accept that EBs effect on JH titer in Indirect. The text of the manuscript, results section and figures should be reflective of that. It is NOT ok to accept that EB impacts JH titer indirectly in a rebuttal letter while still continuing to portray EB direct effect on JH titer. In terms of diagrams, authors cannot put a -&gt; sign until and unless the effect is direct. This is an accepted norm in biological publications.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s valuable suggestions here. We have now carefully revised the manuscript to address all concerns, particularly regarding the mechanism linking nymphal EB exposure to adult fecundity and the indirect nature of EB’s effect on JH titers. Below are our point-by-point responses and corresponding manuscript changes. Revised text is clearly marked in the resubmitted manuscript.</p><p>(1) Clarifying the mechanism linking nymphal EB treatment to adult fecundity:</p><p>Reviewer concern: Explain why nymphal EB treatment increases adult fecundity despite undetectable EB residues in adults.</p><p>Response &amp; Actions Taken:</p><p>We agree this requires explicit discussion. We now propose that nymphal EB exposure triggers developmental reprogramming (e.g., metabolic/epigenetic changes) that persist into adulthood, indirectly enhancing JH synthesis and fecundity. This is supported by two key findings:</p><p>(1) No detectable EB residues in adults after nymphal treatment (new Figure 1–figure supplement 1C).</p><p>(2) Increased adult weight and nutrient reserves (Figure 1–figure supplement 3E,F), suggesting altered resource allocation.</p><p>Added to Discussion (Lines 793–803): Notably, after exposing fourth-instar BPH nymphs to EB, no EB residues were detected in the subsequent adult stage. This finding indicates that the EB-induced increase in adult fecundity is initiated during the nymphal stage and s manifests in adulthood - a mechanism distinct from the direct fecundity enhancement of fecundity observed when EB is applied to adults. We propose that sublethal EB exposure during critical nymphal stages may reprogram metabolic or endocrine pathways, potentially via insulin/JH crosstalk. For instance, increased nutrient storage (e.g., proteins, sugars; Figure 2–figure supplement 2) could enhance insulin signaling, which in turn promotes JH biosynthesis in adults (Ling and Raikhel, 2021; Mirth et al., 2014; Sheng et al., 2011). Future studies should test whether EB alters insulin-like peptide expression or signaling during development.</p><p>(3) Emphasizing EB’s indirect effect on JH titers:Reviewer concern: The manuscript overstated EB’s direct effect on JH. Arrows in figures implied causality where only correlation exists.</p><p>Response &amp; Actions</p><p>Taken:We fully agree.

Thus, the mechanism behind EB-mediated induction of GluClα remains to be determined. It is possible that prolonged EB exposure triggers feedback mechanisms (e.g. cellular stress responses) to counteract EB-induced GluClα dysfunction, leading to transcriptional upregulation of the channel. Hence, considering that EB exposure in our experiments lasts several days, these findings might represent indirect (or secondary) effects caused by other factors downstream of GluCl signaling that affect channel expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a.

Although now discussed extensively in discussion section, the nuances of indirect effect and minimal change in expression should also be reflected in the result section text. This is to ensure that readers have clear idea about content of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected. To ensure readers gain a clear understanding of our data, we have briefly presented these discussions in the Results section. Please see line 397-402: The levels of met mRNA slightly increased in EB-treated BPH at the 5M and 5L instar nymph and 1 to 5 DAE adult stages compared to controls (1.7-fold to 2.9-fold) (Figure 3G). However, it should be mentioned that JH action does not result in an increase of Met. Thus, it is possible that other factors (indirect effects), induced by EB treatment cause the increase in the mRNA expression level of Met.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) As per the author's interpretation, it becomes critical to quantitate the amount of EB present at the adult stages after a 4th instar exposure to it. Only this experiment will unambiguously proof the authors claim. Also, since they have done adult insect exposure to EB, such experiments should be systematically performed for as many sections as possible. Don't just focus on few instances where reviewers have pointed out the issue.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this critical point. To address this concern, we have conducted new supplementary experiments. The new experimental results demonstrate that residual levels of emamectin benzoate (EB) in adult-stage brown planthoppers (BPH) were below the instrument detection limit following treatment of 4th instar nymphs with EB. Line 172-184: “To determine whether EB administered during the fourth-instar larval stage persists as residues in the adult stage, we used HPLC-MS/MS to quantify the amount of EB present at the adult stage after exposing 4th-instar nymphs to this compound. However, we found no detectable EB residues in the adult stage following fourth-instar nymphal treatment (Figure 1-figure supplement 1C). This suggests that the mechanism underlying the increased fecundity of female adults induced by EB treatment of nymphs may differ from that caused by direct EB treatment of female adults. Combined with our previous observation that EB treatment significantly increased the body weight of adult females (Figure 1—figure supplement 3E and F), a possible explanation for this phenomenon is that EB may enhance food intake in BPH, potentially leading to elevated production of insulin-like peptides and thus increased growth. Increased insulin signaling could potentially also stimulate juvenile hormone (JH) biosynthesis during the adult stage (Badisco et al., 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Thank you for the revision.

I suggest the authors to measure the level of the target genes by qPCR in KD insects before and after EB treatment to clear the confusion and unambiguously demonstrate the results. Please Note- such quantifications should be done for all the KD+EB experiments. Additionally, citing few papers where such a rescue effect has been demonstrated in closely related insect will help in building confidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to clarify the interaction between RNAi-mediated gene knockdown (KD) and EB treatment. To address this, we performed additional experiments measuring <italic>Kr-h1</italic> expression via qPCR in <italic>dsKr-h1</italic>-injected insects before and after EB exposure.</p><p>The results (now Figure 3–figure supplement 4) show that:</p><p>(1) EB did not rescue *Kr-h1* suppression at 24h post-treatment (*p* &gt; 0.05).</p><p>(2) Partial recovery of fecundity occurred later (Figure 3M), likely due to:</p><p>a) Degradation of dsRNA over time, reducing KD efficacy (Liu et al., 2010).</p><p>b) Indirect effects of EB (e.g., hormonal/metabolic reprogramming) compensating for residual Kr-h1 suppression.</p><p>Please see line 441-453: “Next, we investigated whether EB treatment could rescue the dsRNA-mediated gene silencing effect. To address this, we selected the Kr-h1 gene and analyzed its expression levels after EB treatment. Our results showed that Kr-h1 expression was suppressed by ~70% at 72 h post-dsRNA injection. However, EB treatment did not significantly rescue Kr-h1 expression in gene knock down insects (*p* &gt; 0.05) at 24h post-EB treatment (Figure 3-figure supplement 4). While dsRNA-mediated Kr-h1 suppression was robust initially, its efficacy may decline during prolonged experiments. This aligns with reports in BPH, where effects of RNAi gradually diminish beyond 7 days post-injection (Liu et al., 2010a). The late-phase fecundity increase might reflect partial Kr-h1 recovery due to RNAi degradation, allowing residual EB to weakly stimulate reproduction. In addition, the physiological impact of EB (e.g., neurotoxicity, hormonal modulation) could manifest via compensatory feedback loops or metabolic remodeling.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Not a very convincing argument. Besides without a scale bar, it is hard for the reviewers to judge the size of the organism. Whole body measurements of JH synthesis enzymes will remain as a quite a drawback for the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to your suggestion, we have also included images with scale bars (see next Figure 1). The images show that the head region is difficult to separate from the brown thoracic sclerite region. Furthermore, the anatomical position of the Corpora Allata in brown planthoppers has never been reported, making dissection uncertain and highly challenging. To address this, we are now attempting to use Drosophila as a model to investigate how EB regulates JH synthesis and reproduction.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>This illustration provides a visual representation of the brown planthopper (BPH), a major rice pest.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91774-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Figure 1.

We hope that this study will inspire further research into the mechanisms underlying similar phenomena in other insects, thereby broadening our understanding of insect biology.

However, we respectfully request to retain these results for the following reasons:</p><p>Class-Specific Mechanism Validation:</p><p>Abamectin and emamectin benzoate (EB) are both macrocyclic lactones targeting glutamate-gated chloride channels (GluCls). The observed similarity in their effects on BPH fecundity (e.g., Figure 1—figure supplement 1B) supports the hypothesis that GluCl modulation, rather than compound-specific off-target effects, drives the reproductive enhancement. This consistency strengthens the mechanistic argument central to our study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The section &quot;The impact of EB treatment on BPH reproductive fitness&quot; is poorly described. This needs elaboration. A line or two should be included to describe why the parameters chosen to decide reproductive fitness were selected in the first place. I see that the definition of brachypterism has undergone a change from the first version of the manuscript. Can you provide an explanation for that? Also, there is no rationale behind inclusion of statements on insulin at this stage. The authors have not investigated insulin. Including that here will confuse readers. This can be added in the discussion though.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. We have added an explanation regarding the primary consideration of evaluating reproductive fitness<bold>.</bold> In the interaction between sublethal doses of insecticides and pests, reproductive fitness is a key factor, as it accurately reflects the potential impact of insecticides on pest control in the field. Among the reproductive fitness parameters, factors such as female Nilaparvata lugens body weight, lifespan, and brachypterous ratio (as short-winged N. lugens exhibit higher oviposition rates than long-winged individuals) are critical determinants of reproductive success. Therefore, we comprehensively assessed the effects of EB on these parameters to elucidate the primary mechanism by which EB influences reproduction.
