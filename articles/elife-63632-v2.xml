characteristics have been instrumental in understanding the heterogeneous pathways that drive differentiation, cellular responses to signals, and human disease. Recent advances have allowed paired capture of protein abundance and transcriptomic state, but a lack of epigenetic information in these assays has left a missing link to gene regulation. Using the heterogeneous mixture of cells in human peripheral blood as a test case, we developed a novel scATAC-seq workflow that increases signal-to-noise and allows paired measurement of cell surface markers and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes, called ICICLE-seq. We extended this approach using a droplet-based multiomics platform to develop a trimodal assay that simultaneously measures transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), epitopes, and chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) from thousands of single cells, which we term TEA-seq. Together, these multimodal single-cell assays provide a novel toolkit to identify type-specific gene regulation and expression grounded in phenotypically defined cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>epitopes</kwd><kwd>sequencing</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>multiomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simultaneous multimodal measurement of chromatin accessibility, gene expression, and protein expression provides a unified view of the molecular underpinnings of immune cell state in health and disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) purified using gradient centrifugation are a major source of clinically relevant cells for the study of human immune health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böyum, 1968</xref>). Like most other human tissues, PBMCs are a complex, heterogeneous mixture of cell types derived from common stem cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laurenti and Göttgens, 2018</xref>). Despite the genome being mostly invariant between different PBMC cell types, each immune cell type performs an important and distinct function. Understanding the genomic regulatory landscape that controls lineage specification, cellular maturation, activation state, and functional diversity in response to intra- and extracellular signals is key to understanding the immune system in both health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Satpathy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zheng et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recent improvements in single-cell genomic methods have enabled profiling of the regulatory chromatin landscape of complex cell-type mixtures. In particular, droplet-based single-nucleus or single-cell assays for transposase-accessible chromatin (snATAC-seq, scATAC-seq, dscATAC-seq, mtscATAC-seq) allow profiling of open chromatin at single-cell resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lareau et al., 2019</xref>). Promising new methods have combined scATAC-seq with simultaneous measurement of nuclear mRNAs (e.g., sci-CAR, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; SNARE-seq, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; SHARE-seq, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) or in combination with cell surface epitopes (ASAP-seq, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mimitou et al., 2020</xref>). However, a unifying approach for all three modalities that can be applied to highly specified functional immune cell types has yet to emerge in the landscape of single-cell methods. We systematically tested whole cell and nuclear purification and preparation methods for PBMCs to overcome limitations that restricted previous assays to measurement of only nuclear components (ATAC and nuclear RNAs) or proteins on the cell surface. We found that intact, permeabilized cells perform extremely well for scATAC-seq, exceeding conventional scATAC-seq on nuclei by some measures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). This insight enables a new protocol analogous to Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes (CITE-seq; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>) to measure both surface protein abundance and chromatin accessibility: integrated cellular indexing of chromatin landscape and epitopes (ICICLE-seq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1a</xref> and 3). Finally, we demonstrate that our optimized permeable cell approach can be combined with a droplet-based multiomics platform to enable the simultaneous measurement of three different molecular compartments of the cell: mRNA (by scRNA-seq), protein (using oligo-tagged antibodies), and DNA (by scATAC-seq), which we term TEA-seq after Transcription, Epitopes, and Accessibility (Figure 4). These assays enable a new, more unified view into the molecular underpinnings of gene regulation and expression at the single-cell level.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Improvements to scATAC-seq methods to enable permeabilized cell profiling.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of major steps in snATAC, scATAC, and ICICLE-seq methods.

This single-nucleus assay utilizes a combination of hypotonic lysis, detergents, and a saponin to isolate nuclei without retaining mitochondrial DNA. After performing snATAC-seq using this method, sequencing, and tabulating data quality metrics (Materials and methods), we identified two major populations of cell barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left panel): (1) a large number of barcodes, shown in gray, that have a low number of unique fragments and a low fraction of reads in peaks (FRIP). These barcodes contain little useful information but consume 80% of total sequenced reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, non-cell barcodes) at a sequencing depth of 200 million reads per library (20,000 reads per expected barcode). (2) Barcodes with higher quality as measured by FRIP (red points) that contain enough information to attempt downstream analysis.</p><p>The loss of 80% of sequenced reads to non-cell barcodes is costly. Previous studies of scRNA-seq data have shown that cellular lysis can release ambient RNA that increases the abundance of low-quality barcodes and contaminates droplets, yielding barcodes with both cellular and ambient RNAs that reduces the accuracy of the transcriptional readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marquina-Sanchez et al., 2020</xref>). We reasoned that nuclear isolation protocols may cause the release of ambient DNA, causing a similar effect in scATAC-seq datasets. Optimization of nuclear lysis protocols, especially changing to less stringent detergents, provided increased FRIP and decreased non-cell barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Hypotonic lysis conditions used in these protocols may also be a biophysical stressor to the native chromatin state, as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lima et al., 2018</xref>). To reduce perturbation of chromatin and retain the cell surface for multimodal assays, we performed cell membrane permeabilization under isotonic conditions to allow access to the nuclear DNA without isolating nuclei through hypotonic lysis. The saponin digitonin was used to cause concentration-dependent selective permeabilization of cholesterol-containing membranes while leaving inner mitochondrial membranes intact, preventing high levels of Tn5 transposition in mitochondrial DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colbeau et al., 1971</xref>). Digitonin has previously been used for ATAC-seq assays under hypotonic conditions in Fast-ATAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Corces et al., 2016</xref>) and plate-based scATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018b</xref>) protocols. Permeabilization of intact cells under isotonic conditions greatly reduced the number of non-cell barcodes and their contribution to sequencing libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Removal of neutrophils greatly increases PBMC scATAC-seq quality</title><p>We observed that PBMCs purified by leukapheresis rather than Ficoll gradient centrifugation had consistently higher FRIP scores and fewer non-cell barcodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>). A major difference between Ficoll-purified PBMCs and leukapheresis-purified PBMCs was the presence of residual neutrophils in Ficoll-purified samples. We tested removal of dead cells and debris with and without removal of neutrophils using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) from PBMC samples with high neutrophil content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). When applied to either nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, left panels) or permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, right panels), there was a large increase in FRIP and reduction in non-cell barcodes in our scATAC-seq libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Removal of neutrophils did not have an adverse effect on leukapheresis-purified PBMC data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c</xref>, right panel). Depletion of neutrophils using anti-CD15 magnetic beads also improved data quality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), though not to the same extent as FACS-based depletion. Staining and flow cytometry using an eight-antibody panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) on Ficoll- and leukapheresis-purified PBMCs showed minimal effect of the magnetic bead treatment on non-neutrophil cell-type abundance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Comparing single-cell and single-nucleus ATAC characteristics</title><p>We assessed the quantitative and qualitative differences between nuclei and permeabilized cell protocols with and without sorting by performing both protocols on a single set of input cells. To fairly compare data quality across methods, we equally downsampled raw data at the level of raw sequenced reads per well for each sample that we compare directly (see Materials and methods for details). We then utilized a uniform set of transcription start site (TSS) regions (TSS ± 2 kb) and a previously published PBMC peak set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lareau et al., 2019</xref>, Materials and methods) as reference regions for computation of fraction of reads in TSS (FRITSS) and FRIP, respectively. Permeabilized cells yielded many more high-quality cell barcodes than nuclear preps using equal loading of cells or nuclei (15,000 loaded, expected 10,000 captured, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). scATAC-seq libraries prepared from nuclei contained many more reads originating from nucleosomal DNA fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, lower panels), and non-cell barcodes from nuclei (gray lines) contained more of these fragments than cell barcodes. Thus, an overabundance of mononucleosomal fragments may indicate non-cell fragment contamination. Libraries from permeabilized cells consisted almost entirely of short fragments, suggesting that permeabilization under isotonic conditions did not loosen or release native chromatin structure at the time of tagmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, lower panels). Previous bulk ATAC-seq studies have shown that differing nuclear isolation protocols lead to varying amounts of mononucleosomal fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2019a</xref>). In agreement with in vitro experiments studying the effects of low salt on nucleosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allahverdi et al., 2015</xref>), this further suggests that hypotonic lysis leads to alteration of chromatin structure, raising the possibility of artifactual measurements of accessibility in nuclei-based ATAC-seq. To assess the effect that this difference has on the data obtained by each method, we overlaid Tn5 footprints near TSS ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) and CTCF transcription factor binding sites (TFBS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). The signal at TSS was retained in permeabilized cells, but positions flanking the TSS (occupied by neighboring nucleosomes) had reduced signal compared to isolated nuclei (examined in detail in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). At CTCF motifs, we observed nearly identical patterns of accessibility in both nuclei and permeabilized cells, suggesting that scATAC-seq signal at regulatory TFBS is retained in permeabilized cells. Neutrophil and dead cell removal improved the quality of nuclear scATAC-seq libraries, which yielded the highest number of unique fragments, reads in TSS, and reads in peaks, though at the cost of fewer high-quality barcodes captured when compared to permeabilized cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Overall, permeabilized intact cells obtained by FACS had the highest FRIP and FRITSS scores, fewest non-cell barcodes, and greatest cell capture efficiency with only a modest increase in mitochondrial reads (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e, f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Improved label transfer and differential analysis</title><p>We next examined the effect of methodological differences on downstream biological analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Removal of neutrophils greatly improved the ability to separate various cell types in uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) projections of both nuclei and cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a, b</xref>). To provide ground truth for label transfer, we performed flow cytometry on an aliquot of the same PBMC sample used for scATAC-seq above. A panel of 25 antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) was used to determine the proportion of each of the 12 cell types used to label the scATAC-seq cells in the PBMC sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Label transfer was performed using the ArchR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granja et al., 2020</xref>) to generate gene scores that enabled label transfer from a reference scRNA-seq dataset using the method provided in the Seurat package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>) (Materials and methods). Using these tools, removal of neutrophils improved label transfer scores, and permeabilized cells yielded more cells with high label transfer scores than nuclei-based approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b, c</xref>). In addition, permeabilized cells provided labels most similar to the cell-type proportions identified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), with identification of CD8 effector cells only observed in scATAC-seq with permeabilized cells. All methods yielded fewer CD16+ monocytes than observed by flow cytometry, suggesting that CD16+ monocytes may be lost during scATAC-seq using either nuclei or permeabilized cells, or that label transfer methods were not conducive to identifying this cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). After labeling cell types, we used ArchR to call peaks for each cell type and perform pairwise tests of differential accessibility between each pair of cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We found many more differentially accessible sites in both cells and nuclei after removal of neutrophils. Differential accessibility was also used to identify differentially enriched TFBS motifs in each cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Without neutrophil removal (nuclei unsorted, top panel), we were unable to identify significantly enriched motifs in B cells and NK cells that were readily apparent in data from clean nuclei or permeabilized cells (bottom two panels). Together, these results demonstrate that neutrophil removal and the use of permeabilized cells allow for identification of specific cell types and TFBS motifs that are involved in regulation of gene expression.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Improvements to 2D projection and label transfer for scATAC-seq data.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) projection plots for corresponding datasets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

To test our ability to measure cell surface proteins and chromatin state simultaneously on permeabilized cells, we modified our optimized permeabilized cell scATAC-seq methodology to incorporate measurements using commercially available barcoded antibody reagents, and we term this new method ICICLE-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Materials and methods). The ICICLE-seq protocol utilizes a custom Tn5 transposome complex with capture sequences compatible with the 10x Genomics 3' scRNA-seq gel bead capture reaction for simultaneous capture of ATAC fragments and polyadenylated antibody barcode sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). Antibody-derived tags (ADTs) from oligo-antibody conjugates and ATAC-seq fragments can then be selectively amplified by PCR to generate separate libraries for sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Due to the nature of fragment capture in this system, we obtain both a cell barcode and a single-end scATAC-seq read from the two ends of the paired-end sequencing reaction. We performed ICICLE-seq on a leukapheresis-purified PBMC sample using a 46-antibody panel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>) and were able to obtain 10,227 single cells with both scATAC-seq and ADT data from three capture wells that passed adjusted QC criteria: &gt;500 unique ATAC fragments (median = 761), FRIP &gt;0.65 (median = 0.725). Cells passing ATAC QC had a median of 3871 ADT unique molecule indexes (UMIs) per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2b</xref>). UMAP projection and ATAC label transfer on ICICLE-seq data had resolution similar to scATAC-seq on intact permeabilized cells after dead cell and debris removal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, the data quality was limited by the poly-A-based capture method and the single-end readout of transposed fragments. Nonetheless, the ICICLE-seq results demonstrated that permeabilized cells enabled simultaneous capture of chromatin accessibility in the nucleus and high-quality cell surface epitope quantification. We were able to leverage the additional ADT data to cluster and identify cell types based on their cell surface antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) UMAP based on ADT data, and Jaccard–Louvain clustering allowed identification of cell-type-specific clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>) based on clear association of cell-type-specific markers with clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2c</xref>).

After trials and optimization of key steps, we were able to obtain libraries on the 10x Genomics Multiome ATAC plus Gene Expression platform that combined all three of these measurements for thousands of single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>) using a panel of 46 oligo-tagged antibodies (Supp Table 6).

However, these views do not leverage the strength of linked multimodal measurements. To begin to take advantage of our tri-modal measurements, we extended a method recently described by Hao and Hao et al. for paired weighted nearest-neighbors (WNN) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hao et al., 2020</xref>) to allow an arbitrary number of simultaneously measured modalities to contribute to the WNN network (Materials and methods). After applying this three-way WNN, we could generate a UMAP embedding with contributions from all three simultaneously measured modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), which enhanced cell-type separation. We found that marker expression is consistent across all three modalities for some markers, such as CD8A, though we found that consistency across all modalities is not a universal characteristic of functional markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). In agreement with observations by Hao and Hao et al. on two-modality data, the weights contributed by different modalities to the WNN analyses vary by cell type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Expanding cis-regulatory module identification with TEA-seq</title><p>Identification of putative cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) that control the functional state of cells is a distinct advantage of directly linked measurements of chromatin accessibility and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2020</xref>). This linkage is dependent on reliable detection of gene (or protein) expression, which is greatly enhanced by the high sensitivity of epitope detection in methods like CITE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stoeckius et al., 2017</xref>), and now TEA-seq. Because TEA-seq allows direct linkage of chromatin accessibility to both gene expression and protein detection, we used these complementary modalities to investigate peak-to-gene (and peak-to-protein) correlations among the proteins we measured in our TEA-seq epitope panel. We leveraged the analytical capabilities of the ArchR package to compute peak-to-gene correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granja et al., 2020</xref>), then substituted the more sensitive measurements afforded by ADT counts to compute peak-to-protein correlations. In cases where both gene and protein expression were reliably detected, these comparisons were confirmatory – many of the same putative CRMs that were identified in each comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). For some targets, however, more sensitive protein abundance measures allowed detection of many additional correlated CRMs. We present two examples – one of CCR2/CD192 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g, h</xref>), a chemokine receptor expressed on monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tsou et al., 2007</xref>), and CD38 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i, j</xref>), a glycoprotein expressed on the surface of multiple immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ferrero and Malavasi, 2002</xref>), and a target of therapies for multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dima et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanchez et al., 2016</xref>). In both cases, peak-to-protein correlations identified many CRMs were missed with peak-to-gene correlation alone. The converse is also observed in our experiment: reliably detected genes may enable detection of some regulatory regions that are not identified using protein detection alone – and peak-to-gene links based on scRNA-seq can be generated genome-wide for all expressed genes, whether or not they are targeted by the epitope panel.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Comparisons of TEA-seq to CITE-seq and scATAC-seq</title><p>To perform a direct assessment of TEA-seq data quality relative to previously published assays, we performed a comparison to standalone 10x scATAC-seq on permeabilized cells, CITE-seq using the 10x 3′ scRNA-seq kit, and both unstained nuclei and unstained permeabilized cells on the 10x Multiome kit (RNA + ATAC). All samples originated from the same pool of thawed and FACS sorted PBMCs (with dead cells, debris, and neutrophils removed). Separate aliquots were taken for scATAC-seq and the two unstained Multiome kit preps, while CITE-seq and TEA-seq samples were taken from the same pool of ADT-stained PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4a</xref>). In each case, 15,000 cells were used as input, and we downsampled a single well from the resulting libraries to equal sequencing depth for a fair comparison (200 × 10<sup>6</sup> total fragments per well for RNA and ATAC libraries; 48 × 10<sup>6</sup> for ADT libraries). We performed four wells of TEA-seq to generate a large reference dataset (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and one well for each other assay. For all comparisons presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, we used a single well of TEA-seq. In these direct comparisons, we found that TEA-seq results appeared qualitatively similar to CITE-seq and scATAC-seq across assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4b, e, i</xref>). The alignment method used for these datasets allowed us to quantify the number of RNA UMIs that aligned to intronic vs. exonic regions of the transcriptome. We found that the fraction of reads mapping to exons was lower than that found in whole-cell CITE-seq data, similar to that seen using a lysed-cell nuclei preparation (median fraction of reads with exonic mapping: TEA-seq, 51.8%, Nuclei Multiome, 52.2%; CITE-seq, 69.5% <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4c</xref>), suggesting the primary source of RNAs in TEA-seq is intron-containing nuclear transcripts. We assessed gene detection by calculating the fraction of cells with UMIs &gt; 0 for each gene and plotted comparisons between TEA-seq and 10x Multiome nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4d</xref>) as well as CITE-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4g</xref>). We found that gene detection was most like nuclei and lower in many cases than CITE-seq. One group of genes stands out as particularly low, originating from ribosomal gene transcripts (with gene symbols starting with RPL and RPS, highlighted in blue). In comparisons of scATAC-seq metrics, we found that TEA-seq performed comparably to standalone permeabilized cell scATAC-seq or Multiome RNA + ATAC using permeabilized cells, with higher FRIP than purified nuclei used for the same assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4e, f</xref>). Finally, in comparisons of protein detection by ADTs, we found that antibody performance in TEA-seq varied by target. Many bimodal distributions were retained (e.g., CD4, CD8a, CD86), while some separations were less apparent (e.g., CD45RO and CD45RA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4h</xref>), resulting in reduced separation in UMAP analysis for some types (i.e., naïve vs. mature CD4 cells), though most major cell types were able to be separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4i</xref>). Together, these results show that TEA-seq data is of high quality but may not always be the method of choice if a particular modality is of greatest interest to researchers. The strength of TEA-seq is its ability to measure all three aspects – transcription, epitopes, and accessibility – simultaneously on each cell, enabling deeper insights into the connections between regulation, expression, and function as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multimodal data collection from permeabilized PBMCs will be of use to many researchers in the immunology field and beyond who seek to get the most high-quality data from precious clinical samples and to facilitate cross-datastream integration with flow cytometry. We found that isotonic cell permeabilization allows the generation of scATAC-seq libraries with high quality as measured by FRIP and low nucleosomal content, suggesting that chromatin state in the nucleus is unperturbed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). While a previous study utilized FACS followed by scATAC on individually sorted cells (Pi-ATAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2018c</xref>), the use of permeabilized cells enables simultaneous interrogation of chromatin accessibility state in the nucleus and the functional state of cells based on their cell surface proteins (ICICLE-seq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) together with mRNA (TEA-seq, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) at unprecedented scale for the first time. Our methods utilize permeabilized cells to allow the addition of protein measurements that provide a direct link between high-quality scRNA-seq data and scATAC-seq data using truly paired methods extending beyond SNARE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2019</xref>) and SHARE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ma et al., 2020</xref>) by taking advantage of 10x Genomics Single Cell Multiome sequencing reagents as a platform for nucleic acid capture. The use of a droplet-based method allows multimodal measurements at a much higher scale by capturing thousands of single cells at a time. We expect that the datasets generated by our study will be useful beyond researchers studying PBMC biology, including those seeking to develop new analytical tools to remove background noise from existing sn/scATAC-seq data (e.g., SCALE, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiong et al., 2019</xref>, or scOpen, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2019b</xref>) and tools to accurately identify links across modalities (e.g., AI-TAC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tasaki et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have focused on PBMCs during this initial development and demonstration of the utility of TEA-seq. PBMCs are a widely used source of clinically relevant heterogeneous cell populations for monitoring clinical disease status and research. As such, TEA-seq optimized for PBMCs will provide unprecedented biological insight into the molecular underpinnings of human immune health and disease. It is likely that the use of TEA-seq in other cell types will require sample-specific optimization. For example, the requirement for neutrophil depletion may be limited to studies related to the immune system or immune-infiltrated tissues. However, the value of debris and dead cell removal is likely to be applicable to disaggregated tissue samples from biopsies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Donlin et al., 2018</xref>). Likewise, researchers should take care when assessing fragment length distributions as a quality control metric. In PBMCs, we found that high abundance of mononucleosomal fragments may indicate neutrophil-driven background, but this indicator of poor data quality may not be observed in other cell types or tissues. Early versions of nuclei-based ATAC-seq suffered issues high levels of mitochondrial reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corces et al., 2017</xref>), which may be used to profile clonal populations based on their mitochondrial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lareau et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we have used low concentrations of digitonin to selectively permeabilize cholesterol-containing membranes, thereby leaving the inner mitochondrial membrane intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Colbeau et al., 1971</xref>). Different cell types have been shown to have differing sensitivity to digitonin concentrations, perhaps reflecting natural variance in membrane cholesterol composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Holden and Horton, 2009</xref>). As such, cell permeabilization for TEA-seq may need to be optimized for other cell types. This can be readily tested using bulk ATAC-seq and by measuring library complexity, FRIP score, and mitochondrial contamination to determine data quality.</p><p>In addition to the Methods presented in this article, we are maintaining an online protocol to aid the research community in further development and adoption of TEA-seq on the Protocols.io platform (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bqagmsbw">https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bqagmsbw</ext-link>). Additional development could allow simultaneous measurement of additional aspects of cell biology (e.g., CpG sequencing methods, scCUT&amp;Tag; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartosovic et al., 2020</xref>), as well as improvements to the modalities in the TEA-seq trio (e.g., s3-ATAC, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mulqueen et al., 2021</xref>). In direct comparisons of TEA-seq to existing methods (CITE-seq and scATAC-seq), we found that the sensitivity of gene detection was lower and distributions of antibody detections were altered relative to CITE-seq; however, ATAC-seq data quality remained comparable to the standalone assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). We anticipate that simultaneous, truly multimodal measurement across molecular compartments will be an essential tool to expand our view of the full picture of immune cell state in health and disease,

were purchased from BioIVT as cryopreserved PBMCs and Bloodworks NW as freshly drawn whole blood. All sample collections were conducted by BioIVT and Bloodworks NW under IRB-approved protocols, and all donors signed informed consent forms. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref> for a list of sources and samples used for data displayed in each figure.</p><p>PBMCs sourced from BioIVT were isolated using either Ficoll-Paque or leukapheresis. Following isolation, PBMCs were subjected to RBC lysis, washing, and counting. PBMC aliquots were cryopreserved in Cryostor CS10 (StemCell Technologies, 07930) and stored in vapor phase liquid nitrogen.</p><p>For fresh blood samples from Bloodworks NW, PBMC processing occurred in-house. Blood tubes were pooled, gently swirled until fully mixed, about 30 times, and diluted with an equivalent volume of room temperature PBS (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 14190235). PBMCs were isolated using one or more Leucosep tubes (Greiner Bio-One, 227290) loaded with 15 mL of Ficoll Premium (GE Healthcare, 17-5442-03) to which a 3 mL cushion of PBS had been slowly added on top of the Leucosep barrier. Diluted whole blood (24–30 mL) was slowly added to each tube and spun at 1000×<italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 20°C with no brake (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-15RIVD with JS4.750 swinging bucket, B99516). PBMCs were recovered from the Leucosep tube by quickly pouring all volume above the barrier into a sterile 50 mL conical tube (Corning, 352098). A 15 mL cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) +0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma, A9576; ‘PBS+BSA’) was added and the cells were pelleted at 400×<italic>g</italic> for 5–10 min at 4–10°C. The supernatant was quickly decanted, the pellet dispersed by flicking the tube, and the cells washed with 25–50 mL cold PBS+BSA. Cell pellets were combined as needed, the cells were pelleted as before, supernatant quickly decanted, and residual volume was carefully aspirated. PBMCs were resuspended in 1 mL cold PBS+BSA per 15 mL whole blood processed and counted with a ViCell (Beckman Coulter) using VersaLyse reagent (Beckman Coulter, A09777) or with a Cellometer Spectrum Cell Counter (Nexcelom) using ViaStain acridine orange/propidium iodide solution (Nexcelom, C52-0106-5). PBMCs were cryopreserved in Cryostor10 (StemCell Technologies, 07930) or 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 10438026)/10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Fisher Scientific, D12345) at 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL by slow freezing in a Coolcell LX (VWR, 75779-720) overnight in a −80°C freezer followed by transfer to liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-2"><title>Cell thawing</title><p>Cryopreserved PBMCs were removed from liquid nitrogen storage and thawed in a 37°C water bath for 3–5 min until no ice was visible. Cells were diluted to 10 mL in 37°C AIM V medium (Gibco, 12055091) with the first 3 mL added dropwise. Cells were then washed once with 10 mL DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, 21-031 CM) supplemented with 0.2% w/v BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2934). Cells were counted on a Cellometer Spectrum Cell Counter (Nexcelom) using ViaStain acridine orange/propidium iodide solution (Nexcelom, C52-0106-5) and stored on ice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-3"><title>FACS neutrophil depletion</title><p>To remove dead cells, debris, and neutrophils, PBMC samples were sorted by FACS prior to nuclei isolation or cell permeabilization. Cells were incubated with Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD, 564406) for 15 min at room temperature and washed with AIM V medium (Gibco, 12055091) plus 25 mM HEPES before incubating with TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) for 5 min on ice, followed by staining with anti-CD45 (BioLegend, 304038) and anti-CD15 (BD, 562371) antibodies for 20 min on ice. Cells were washed with AIM V medium plus 25 mM HEPES and sorted on a BD FACSAria Fusion. A standard viable CD45+ cell gating scheme was employed; FSC-A vs. SSC-A (to exclude sub-cellular debris), two FSC-A doublet exclusion gates (FSC-W followed by FSC-H), dead cell exclusion gate (BV510 LIVE/DEAD negative) followed by CD45+ inclusion gate. Neutrophils (defined as SSC<sup>high</sup>, CD15+) were then excluded in the final sort gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). An aliquot of each post-sort population was used to collect 50,000 events to assess post-sort purity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-4"><title>Magnetic bead neutrophil depletion</title><p>Bead-based neutrophil depletion was performed using a biotin conjugated monoclonal anti-CD15 antibody in combination with streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. A high neutrophil content (approximately 1.1%) Ficoll-isolated PBMC sample was processed to evaluate efficacy, and a low neutrophil leukapheresis-isolated PBMC sample was processed to control for off-target effects. Briefly, 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> PBMCs were resuspended in 100 μL of chilled DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, 21-031 CM) supplemented with 0.2% w/v BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2934). A 10 µL TruStain FcX (BioLegend 422302) was added to the cell suspension, mixed by pipette, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Anti-CD15 antibody (BioLegend, 301913) was added to the cell suspension, mixed by pipette, and incubated on ice for 30 min. Following antibody binding, 25 µL of Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1 magnetic beads (Invitrogen, 65601) was added to the cell suspension, mixed by pipette, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The cell suspension was then diluted with 900 µL of room temperature Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) +0.2% w/v BSA and placed on an EasySep magnet (Stemcell Technologies, 18103) for 3 min. The supernatant (approximately 1 mL) was transferred to a new tube and stored on ice until further processing.</p><p>Non-depleted and neutrophil-depleted PBMCs from each sample were analyzed by flow cytometry using an eight-color panel to assess the effects of the bead-based depletion on major PBMC populations. For each sample and condition, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were centrifuged (750×<italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C) using a swinging bucket rotor (Beckman Coulter Avanti J-15RIVD with JS4.750 swinging bucket, B99516), the supernatant was removed using a vacuum aspirator pipette, and the cell pellet was resuspended in 100 µL of DPBS without calcium and magnesium (Corning, 21-031 CM) supplemented with 0.2% w/v BSA (Sigma-Aldrich, A2934). Cells were incubated with Fixable Viability Stain 510 (BD, 564406) and TruStain FcX (BioLegend, 422302) for 30 min on ice, and washed in chilled FACS buffer (DPBS, 0.2% w/v BSA, 0.1% sodium azide; VWR, BDH7465-2). Cells were stained with a cocktail of antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) including 10 µL of Brilliant Stain Buffer Plus (BD, 566385) at a staining volume of 100 µL for 30 min on ice, then washed twice with chilled FACS buffer. Cells were passed through 35 µm Falcon Cell Strainers (Corning, 352235) and analyzed on a BD FACS Symphony flow cytometer. Gating analysis was performed using FlowJo cytometry software (version 10.7).</p><p>A sequential gating scheme was used to identify viable singlet CD45+/CD15+/CD16+ neutrophils: (1) a time vs. SSC-A gate (to confirm that no abnormalities occurred in the fluidics), (2) a FSC-A vs. SSC-A gate (to exclude sub-cellular debris), (3) two FSC-A doublet exclusion gates (FSC-W followed by FSC-H), (3) a dead cell exclusion gate (BV510 LIVE/DEAD negative), and (4) a CD45+ inclusion gate. Neutrophils were defined as either SSC-A<sup>high</sup>/CD15+ or CD15+/CD16+. The neutrophil population defined by SSC-A<sup>high</sup>/CD15+ was larger than that defined by CD15+/CD16+ due to the presence of some contaminating CD15<sup>low</sup> monocytes. Therefore, we used the CD45+/CD15+/CD16+ gate for subsequent analysis including summary statistics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Standard nuclei isolation</title><p>Isolation of nuclei suspensions was performed according to the Demonstrated Protocol: Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell ATAC Sequencing (10x Genomics, CG000169 Rev C).

Barcode sequences were compared against the 10x Genomics v3 3′ GEX barcode whitelist (3M-february-2018.txt.gz). Sequences not included in the whitelist were corrected to a valid whitelist barcode by allowing a single base mismatch (Hamming distance of 1).

BarCounter was used for single-cell ADT counting as follows: firstly, barcode sequences were compared against the 10x Genomics v3 3′ GEX barcode whitelist (3M-february-2018.txt.gz). Sequences not included in the whitelist were corrected to a valid whitelist barcode by allowing a single base mismatch (hamming distance of 1) at a low-quality basecall (sequencing quality score &lt;20). Reads with barcodes that could not be corrected were excluded from further analysis. Next, ADT barcode sequences were compared against a CSV taglist containing ADT barcode/antibody associations. Antibody barcodes in the current TotalSeq-A catalog (BioLegend) have a Hamming distance from all other barcodes of at least 3. Therefore, a single base mismatch (Hamming distance of 1) was allowed. Reads containing ADT sequences that could not be assigned to an antibody in the taglist were excluded. Finally, UMI sequences that were unique within their assigned ADT for their assigned cell barcode were counted. Final ADT UMI counts were written by cell barcode to a CSV file for use in downstream analysis.</p><p>ADT features were filtered by comparison to the mouse IgG1κ isotype control, which should not bind to human cell surface proteins.

In the specific case of TEA-seq integration, we used scRNA-seq PCA dimensions 1:30, ATAC Peak LSI dimensions 1:30, and all normalized and scaled ADT features passing QC criteria (1:38).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Peak linkage analysis</title><p>To identify peak-to-RNA and peak-to-protein correlations in TEA-seq data, we first generated low-dimensional embeddings based on joint analysis for RNA and ATAC data using Archr. We generated an ArchR project using all four of the TEA-seq wells generated and filtered, above. We used the 500 bp tile matrix generated by ArchR to perform LSI for ATAC data using addIterativeLSI. We then imported the RNA-seq data using import10xFeatureMatrix, added the matched RNA data to the project using addGeneExpressionMatrix, and reduced dimensions with addIterativeLSI with modified parameters (clusterParams = list(resolution = 0.2, sampleCells = 1e4, n.start = 10, varFeatures = 2500, firstSelection = ‘variable’, binarize = FALSE)). We then integrated LSI results using addCombinedDims, then clustered cells using the combined LSI dimensions using addClusters. We then called peaks for each cluster using addGroupCoverages and addReproduciblePeakSet, before generating a per-cell peak matrix using addPeakMatrix. Next, we recomputed the ATAC-seq LSI based on the peak matrix with addIterativeLSI and generated a refined set of joint reduced dimensions in combination with the RNA LSI results with addCombinedDims. These combined, peak-based dimensions were used to identify peak-to-RNA correlations using addPeak2GeneLinks. For loop visualizations, we filtered the peak-to-RNA correlations using getPeak2GeneLinks with adjusted parameters (corCutOff = 0.05, FDRCutOff = 0.01, resolution = 1000, returnLoops = TRUE), and results were filtered for epitope antibody targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). To compute peak-to-Protein correlations, we substituted the ADT count matrix for the RNA matrix by using the ADT matrix as an input for addGeneExpressionMatrix, then re-ran the addPeak2Gene links and getPeak2GeneLinks functions with the same parameters listed, above. For comparisons shown in scatter plots, we used the base-specific (non-binned) findPeak2GeneLinks results stored in the ArchR object, and selected all peak-to-RNA or peak-to-Protein links identified for each gene with the same corCutOff and FDRCutOff parameters shown above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cross-modal comparison of TEA-seq, CITE-seq, and scATAC-seq</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Joint sample processing and aliquots</title><p>To allow direct comparison of TEA-seq data to CITE-seq, scATAC-seq, and 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC performed on unstained nuclei and permeabilized cells, we thawed leukapheresis-purified PBMCs and performed dead cell, debris, and neutrophil removal by FACS as described above. We then separated this pool into separate aliquots for antibody staining (for CITE-seq and TEA-seq), nuclei isolation (for 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC), and two separate cell permeabilization aliquots (for scATAC-seq and 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC). scATAC-seq was performed using 0.01% digitonin permeabilization as described above. We then stained the CITE-seq and TEA-seq aliquot using the same 46 antibody panel as described above for ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq, and divided this stained pool for whole-cell CITE-seq (described below) and TEA-seq. Finally, we permeabilized the TEA-seq portion of this aliquot to perform TEA-seq as described above. For 10x Multiome RNA + ATAC libraries, we either permeabilized cells with 0.01% digitonin as describe above or purified nuclei as described by the 10x Genomics Nuclei Isolation for Single Cell Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression Sequencing Demonstrated Protocol (CG000365 Rev B). Protocol steps following sample preparation for TEA-seq or Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression were performed as described above. For Multiome ATAC + Gene Expression on nuclei or permeabilized cells, we excluded steps for ADT processing.

Briefly, a Chromium Next GEM Chip G (10x Genomics, 2000177) was placed in a Chromium Next GEM Secondary Holder and 50% glycerol was dispensed into all unused wells. A barcoding master mix was prepared, which consisted of RT Reagent B (10x Genomics, 2000165), Template Switch Oligo (10x Genomics, 3000228), Reducing Agent B (10x Genomics, 2000087), and RT Enzyme C (10x Genomics, 2000085). The master mix was added to the sample well, pipette-mixed, and loaded into row 1 of the chip. Chromium Single Cell 3’ v3.1 Gel Beads (10x Genomics, 2000164) were vortexed for 30 s and loaded into row 2 of the chip, along with Partitioning Oil (10x Genomics, 2000190) in row 3. A 10x Gasket (10x Genomics, 370017) was placed over the chip and attached to the Secondary Holder. The chip was loaded into a Chromium Single Cell Controller instrument for GEM generation. GEMs were separated into a biphasic mixture through addition of Recovery Agent (10x Genomics, 220016), the aqueous phase was retained and removed of barcoding reagents using Dynabeads MyOne SILANE beads. cDNA amplification was performed using the 10x Genomics cDNA Primers (2000089) on a C1000 Touch thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module: 53°C for 45 min, 85°C for 5 min, followed by a hold at 4°C.</p><p>To separate ADT and cDNA libraries, we performed a 0.6× bead:sample SPRIselect reagent size selection. The bead fraction from this separation was retained as the cDNA fraction, and supernatant separation was retained as the ADT-containing fraction. To further process ADTs, we added an additional 1.4× SPRI volumes to the ADT-containing supernatant to a final ratio of 2× SPRI:sample, then retained the bead fraction of this second step. We then repeated a fresh 2× bead:sample cleanup, retaining the bead fraction as the ADT library. ADTs were amplified in a 100 µL reaction consisting of Buffer EB, KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix, SI-PCR-Oligo primer (10 µM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>), and ADT i7 primer (10 µM, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). ADT PCR was performed in a C1000 Touch thermal cycler with 96-Deep Well Reaction Module: 95°C for 3 min, 12 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 20 s, followed by a final extension of 72°C for 5 min. SPRIselect reagent cleanups were performed with a 1.6× bead:sample ratio to generate final ADT libraries.</p><p>cDNA Fragmentation, End-Repair, A-tailing, and indexed amplification were performed as described in the 10 × 3′ Gene Expression Library Construction Guide. These steps match the 10x Multiome guide and are described above in the TEA-seq library construction methods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6-3"><title>10x Multiome and TEA-seq library preparation</title><p>As described above, unstained FACS-sorted PBMCs were used as input to nuclei and permeabilized cell Multiome ATAC plus Gene Expression library preparation.

Following sequencing, read lengths were adjusted to the applicable length for each datatype (ATAC, gene expression, ADT) during demultiplexing. Demultiplexing of raw base call files into FASTQ files was performed using bcl2fastq2 (Illumina v2.20.0.422, parameters: <monospace>--create-fastq-for-index-reads</monospace>, <monospace>--minimum-trimmed-read-length</monospace>=8, <monospace>--mask-short-adapter-reads</monospace>=8, <monospace>--ignore-missing-positions</monospace>, <monospace>-ignore-missing-filter</monospace>, <monospace>--ignore-missing-bcls</monospace>, -r 24 w 24 p 80). The <monospace>--use-bases-mask</monospace> option was used to adjust the read lengths for each library type as follows: Y28n*,I10,I10n*,Y90n* for Gene Expression, Y50n*,I8n*,Y16,Y50n* for ATAC, and Y28n*,I8n*,n*,Y90n* for ADT.</p><p>CITE-seq libraries were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq platform using a high-output flowcell with the following read lengths: 28 bp read 1, 8 bp i7 index, 91 bp read 2.

Demultiplexing of raw base call files into FASTQ files was performed using 10x cellranger-atac mkfastq (10x Genomics v.1.1.0).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Data analysis</title><p>To perform comparisons between these methodologies, all scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq libraries were downsampled to 200 million FASTQ entries (200 million of each sequenced read; ~20,000 reads per expected cell recovered at ~10,000 cell expected recovery), and all ADT libraries were downsampled to 48 million reads (limited by the available read count for one experiment; ~4,800reads per expected cell recovered). For scATAC-seq data, we used cellranger-atac (v 1.2.0) to align the data to 10x Genomics reference refdata-cellranger-atac-GRCh38-1.2.0. For CITE-seq data, RNA alignment was performed using cellranger (v5.0.0) with the –include-introns parameter against 10x Genomics reference refdata-gex-GRCh38-2020-A. For 10x Multiome and TEA-seq, we aligned RNA and ATAC data using cellranger-arc (v1.0.0) against 10x Genomics reference refdata-cellranger-arc-GRCh38-2020-A. To analyze CITE-seq and TEA-seq ADT libraries, we used BarCounter to compute the counts of ADT barcodes for each 10x cell barcode, as described for ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq, above.</p><p>After alignment or tabulation of each dataset, cell barcodes were filtered using modality and method-specific criteria based on inspection of the distribution of QC data for each library. Filtering was performed to remove low-quality barcodes and putative doublets. For transcription (RNA-seq data), we filtered barcodes based on number of genes detected per barcode: TEA-seq: &gt;500 genes, &lt;2,750 genes, 7098 barcodes retained; nuclei on 10x Multiome: &gt;300 genes, &lt;4,000 genes, 6717 barcodes retained; permeabilized cells on 10x Multiome: &gt;300 genes, &lt;2,750 genes, 8334 barcodes retained; CITE-seq: &gt;500 genes, &lt;5,000 genes, 7399 barcodes retained. For epitopes (ADT data), both TEA-seq and CITE-seq were filtered based on number of UMIs (&gt;300 UMIs and &lt;5000 UMIs): TEA-seq, 7661 barcodes retained; CITE-seq, 7493 barcodes retained. For accessibility (ATAC-seq data), barcodes were filtered using the same criteria as other scATAC-seq libraries, above (&gt;1,000 unique fragments, FRIP &gt; 0.2, FRITSS &gt; 0.2, Fraction ENCODE overlap &gt; 0.5), and doublets were removed using the ArchR package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Granja et al., 2020</xref>): TEA-seq: 6725 barcodes retained; nuclei on 10x Multiome: 6541 barcodes retained; permeabilized cells on 10x Multiome: 7238 barcodes retained; standalone scATAC-seq: 11,963 barcodes retained.</p><p>After filtering, we performed modality-specific analyses to compare the performance of each method in each separate modality. For transcription, scRNA-seq datasets were analyzed using the Seurat package (v.4.0-beta, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Data was normalized using the NormalizeData function, features were selected using the FindVariableFeatures function, and data was then scaled using the ScaleData function. Scaled data for selected features was used as input for PCA to reduce dimensionality, then projected to two dimensions using the RunUMAP function on the first 30 principal component dimensions. All parameters were defaults. To label cells with PBMC cell types, we utilized the same scRNA-seq reference from the Satija lab that was used for scATAC-seq analysis, above. Label transfer was performed using FindTransferAnchors function (with the parameter reduction = ‘cca’), followed by the TransferData function. Canonical correlation analysis was used instead of a PCA-based transfer because the scRNA-seq datasets were aligned using introns, while the reference was aligned using exons only. To compare gene detection across experimental methods, we computed the fraction of filtered cell barcodes with ≥1 UMI for each gene.</p><p>For epitope (ADT) data from filtered cell barcodes, we filtered features to remove antibodies that were similar to the Mouse IgG1κ Isotype background control. For each cell barcode, we divided the UMI counts for each feature by the number of UMI counts for the control, and flagged features with ≤16-fold enrichment relative to the control. We then removed the following features that were flagged in &gt;0.5% of cells in the CITE-seq dataset: CD269 (TNFRSF17), CD304 (NRP-1), CD66b (CEACAM8), CD80, and TCR Va24-Ja18. The TEA-seq dataset was filtered to remove these features to allow comparison between TEA-seq and CITE-seq data. After feature filtering, each cell barcode was normalized by dividing the UMI counts by the total UMI count, and multiplying by 10,000.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Andrew C Adey (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our policy on revisions we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Swanson et al. present two novel methods, ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq, which both benefit from an optimized lysis protocol that retains cellular membranes but allows for the capture of high quality chromatin accessibility data. This enables the simultaneous profiling of chromatin accessibility and cellular epitopes (ICICLE-seq) and can be used in conjunction with the 10x Genomics Multiome kit to additionally acquire cellular epitopes. The strengths of the manuscript are the attention to detail, the clarity of the methods, and the availability of all data. The primary weakness is in the presentation of ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq as related methods and in the lack of analytical exploration of the TEA-seq data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differences and similarities between ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq are confusing and their presentation in a single paper seems convoluted. These are two different methods that are enabled by a specific lysis protocol. Given that the title exclusively focuses on TEA-seq but TEA-seq occupies a very small percentage of the manuscript's real estate and innovation, we think the manuscript could benefit from a clearer presentation of TEA-seq.</p><p>2) Extension of TEA-seq to samples beyond PBMC. The reported optimizations are highly specific to PBMCs and this could be made clearer. There are many reasons to think that these same optimizations might not hold up in other cell types. The authors should either (a) perform the same comparisons on different cell lines or cell types that have proven to be troublesome in previous ATAC-seq experiments or (b) at least make it more explicit that these optimizations may not hold for other cell types. A good example of the former is K562 cells which had very high mitochondrial DNA contamination and very low signal to noise in the original ATAC-seq protocol.</p><p>3) Deeper analysis leveraging the 3-way single cell data in TEA-seq. Some additional analysis as to the improvement of separation and identification of cell types using the 3-way manifold should be explored. i.e. perform clustering and cell type ID on each independently and then identify overlap / which cell types are poorly separated in one modality but not another and then how the 3-way manifold performs as a comparison. Overall it looks like the RNA performs fine for cell type ID when compared to the 3-way with the other modalities performing worse (though that is form UMAP visualizations which are not able to be quantitatively interpreted for these purposes). In addition,, given the tri-modal data derived from TEA-seq, the authors should have the ability to assess how well scATAC-seq or scRNA-seq correlate with protein levels, albeit for a small set of proteins biased for cell surface proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63632.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The differences and similarities between ICICLE-seq and TEA-seq are confusing and their presentation in a single paper seems convoluted.

We have updated the Abstract, Introduction, and Results sections to better frame the focus of the manuscript on TEA-seq, and demonstrate the role of ICICLE-seq as part of the progression towards the trimodal assay, rather than a truly standalone method. To better emphasize TEA-seq, we have expanded both the experimental and analytical results related to TEA-seq by the inclusion of a direct comparison between TEA-seq, CITE-seq, and scATAC-seq on the same set of samples, now presented as Figure 4—figure supplement 4.</p><p>Because ICICLE-seq was the first proof of concept that we could co-capture surface protein and nuclear chromatin state information (not demonstrated in the literature prior to the nearly simultaneous release of our preprint and the ASAP-seq preprint by Mimitou, Leareau, and Chen, et al. on bioRxiv), and our approach to this co-assay using poly-A tagged Tn5 complexes remains novel, we feel that ICICLE-seq still warrants placement within this article. However, we have worked to streamline the presentation of both the scATAC-seq improvements and ICICLE-seq results with the following modifications:</p><p>a) Figure 2 has been divided into a smaller main figure, retaining panels A-D, and an additional figure supplement, containing panels E-F, to streamline the presentation of scATAC-seq results.</p><p>b) Results and Figure 3 for ICICLE-seq data have been reduced and refocused to better emphasize the role of ICICLE-seq as a proof-of-concept for simultaneous capture of chromatin and cell surface epitopes. We have removed panels F and G from Figure 3 to avoid overreaching the results on this limited dataset.</p><p>c) We have updated the text to emphasize the role of ICICLE-seq as a proof of concept, rather than a standalone assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Extension of TEA-seq to samples beyond PBMC.

The Introduction and Discussion sections both begin with a description of the use of PBMCs as critical, medically relevant samples, and PBMCs are the only cell type used throughout the manuscript. A critical step in our scATAC-seq improvements is the removal of neutrophils, which may not be present in other tissues, except in the case of tissue invasion in response to an insult.</p><p>To address this, we have expanded the Discussion section to provide a prospectus on the use of TEA-seq and the applicability of the scATAC-seq methods improvements we have presented in the manuscript to other cell types and tissues:</p><p>&quot;It is likely that the use of TEA-seq in other cell types will require sample-specific optimization. […] This can be readily tested using bulk ATAC-seq and by measuring library complexity, FRIP score and mitochondrial contamination to determine data quality.&quot;</p><p>We hope that the additional discussion of applications and caveats for other cell types and tissues are helpful to the reviewers and readers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Deeper analysis leveraging the 3-way single cell data in TEA-seq.

To address this feedback, we have added additional TEA-seq experiments across multiple wells, and have performed additional analysis of the data with a focus on identifying putative regulatory elements that would be missed through the use of a paired RNA-ATAC assay alone:</p><p>a) We utilized the ArchR package to perform Peak-To-Protein linkage analysis, now described in the new Results section titled &quot;Expanding cis-regulatory module identification with TEA-seq.&quot; In addition to panels that compare correlation scores using peaks vs. genes for each epitope in our TEA-seq antibody panel, we include in-depth views of an expanded cis-regulatory repertoire identified for two targets: CD192/CCR2 and CD38 in new panels Figure 4G-J. This new analysis shows the strength of linked measurements – one is able to take advantage of measurement of both protein and RNA to identify putative regulatory regions that may be critical for cell function.</p><p>b) Using aliquots of exactly the same PBMC sample vial as the expanded TEA-seq dataset, we performed whole-cell CITE-seq, permeabilized cell scATAC-seq, and 10x Multiome (RNA + ATAC) sequencing (both for purified nuclei and permeabilized cells) to provide a comprehensive set of comparisons to previous methodology. This expanded set of direct methodological comparisons allows us to present the strengths and weaknesses of the TEA-seq protocol, including better insight into the loss of cytosolic RNAs. We provide these comparisons in a new Figure 4—figure supplement 5 that demonstrates that TEA-seq ATAC and ADT data quality remain high after permeabilization and the RNA data is most directly comparable to single nucleus preparations.</p><p>We hope that these major new additions to the manuscript will be satisfactory to address the reviewers' comments, and that reviewers will support the publication and release of these comprehensive comparative datasets, which should allow analysis-focused researchers to develop more comprehensive analytical approaches for trimodal directly linked datasets.</p><p>In the future, we hope to provide a Research Advance to investigate cell hashing and methods to improve cytoplasmic RNA retention as we continue to optimize and develop methods around the core platform of TEA-seq. However, these advances and optimizations will take additional time as we work around COVID-19 restrictions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
