NK cells express NKG2D, an activating receptor that directly recognizes NKG2D ligands. These are expressed at low level on healthy cells, but are induced by stresses like infection and transformation. The physiological events that drive NKG2D ligand expression during infection are still poorly understood. We observed that the mouse cytomegalovirus encoded protein m18 is necessary and sufficient to drive expression of the RAE-1 family of NKG2D ligands. We demonstrate that RAE-1 is transcriptionally repressed by histone deacetylase inhibitor 3 (HDAC3) in healthy cells, and m18 relieves this repression by directly interacting with Casein Kinase II and preventing it from activating HDAC3. Accordingly, we found that HDAC inhibiting proteins from human herpesviruses induce human NKG2D ligand ULBP-1. Thus our findings indicate that virally mediated HDAC inhibition can act as a signal for the host to activate NK-cell recognition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14749.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14749.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>NK cells</kwd><kwd>NKG2D</kwd><kwd>histone deacetylase</kwd><kwd>herpesviruses</kwd><kwd>NKG2D ligands</kwd><kwd>CK2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI 100829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Greene</surname><given-names>Trever T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI113041</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raulet</surname><given-names>David H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Viral infection can induce NKG2D ligand expression through the action of virally encoded histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, which release HDAC mediated repression of NKG2D ligands.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are an important part of the immune system, particularly to control viral infections and cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raulet and Guerra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lodoen and Lanier, 2006</xref>). NK cells recognize and lyse cells undergoing infection or transformation as well as secrete pro-inflammatory molecules that activate the adaptive immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smyth et al., 2005a</xref>).</p><p>The activating receptor NKG2D is expressed on NK cells and provides one mechanism by which NK cells (as well as NK T cells, γδT cells, and CD8 and CD4 T cells) recognize their targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raulet, 2003</xref>). Ligands for NKG2D are absent or expressed at low levels on normal cells, but their expression is increased in response to infection or transformation, enabling NKG2D recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Raulet and Guerra, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lodoen and Lanier, 2006</xref>). NKG2D surveillance protects mice from several models of induced or spontaneous cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smyth et al., 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guerra et al., 2008</xref>). In humans, a polymorphism predicted to reduce NKG2D signaling is linked to both increased cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roszak et al., 2012</xref>) and susceptibility to viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taniguchi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The ligands for NKG2D are diverse, and include two families in humans (ULBP1-6 and MICA-B). In mice, the MICA-B family is not represented and the ULBP family is subdivided into RAE-1α-ε, MULT-1, and H60a-c subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raulet et al., 2013</xref>). Each of these ligands binds NKG2D with a different affinity, but expression of a single family member is sufficient to stimulate killing by NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Champsaur and Lanier, 2010</xref>). Thus, expression of these ligands are tightly controlled and nearly absent on healthy cells. It is still not well understood how the majority of NKG2D ligands are silenced in healthy tissue, but work by López-Soto and colleagues have shown that silencing by histone deacetylases (HDACs) is involved, at least for ULBP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Soto et al., 2009</xref>). Most work on NKG2D ligand regulation has focused on their induction in cancer models. In this regard, several stimuli leading to ligand expression have been identified, these include: DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>), hyper-proliferation (though the transcription factor E2F) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung et al., 2012</xref>), and PI3K/Ras signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tokuyama et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Understanding the exact mechanism of NKG2D ligand induction in various contexts remains an active area of research.</p><p>NKG2D activation and evasion play particularly important roles during herpesvirus infection. Over 90% of the population is infected with one or more of these double stranded DNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wald and Corey, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Staras et al., 2006</xref>), which include cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex viruses (HSV), and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Co-evolution between herpesviruses and their hosts has resulted in a complex network of host-virus interactions that allows the host to sustain a life-long infection; the majority of infections are asymptomatic in immunocompetent individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taniguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biron et al., 1989</xref>). Herpesvirus infection causes a transcriptional upregulation of NKG2D ligand expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lodoen et al., 2003</xref>), yet these viruses apply multiple strategies to avoid NKG2D recognition by reducing NKG2D ligand expression at the surface of infected cells (Reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonjić et al., 2008</xref>). This creates a balance between NK cell activation and viral evasion, and disruption of this balance can impact the outcome of infection. Hosts deficient in NK cell responses, including those with mutations that are predicted to specifically reduce NKG2D signaling, are especially prone to pathogenic herpesvirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Taniguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biron et al., 1989</xref>). Conversely, growth of herpesviruses with a defect NKG2D ligand evasion are attenuated in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonjić et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms governing NKG2D ligand regulation appear to be conserved between viral and non-viral stresses. For example, Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling is required for NKG2D ligand expression in transformed cells as well as during mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tokuyama et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, DNA damage signaling can mediate NKG2D ligand induction in both cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gasser et al., 2005</xref>) and Kaposi’s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bekerman et al., 2013</xref>). Understanding how cells regulate NKG2D ligands in the context of herpesvirus infection should therefore provide insight into ligand regulation and NK cell activation in systems beyond herpesvirus infection.</p><p>Here, we show that in healthy cells, the expression of the RAE-1 family is repressed by the action of HDAC3 and describe a novel mechanism of ligand regulation during viral infection. We identified a single MCMV protein, m18, which is necessary and sufficient to induce expression of the RAE-1 family of mouse NKG2D ligands, and to induce NKG2D-dependent NK-cell killing in vitro. We found that m18 is a virally encoded HDAC inhibitor, and that it de-represses transcription of the <italic>Raet1</italic> gene. The m18 protein directly interacts with Casein Kinase II (CK2) and prevents it from activating HDAC3. Notably, we also demonstrated that other viral HDAC inhibitors encoded by human herpesviruses similarly drive NKG2D ligand expression. Thus we propose a model in which constitutive HDAC activity suppresses NKG2D ligand expression in healthy tissue. During infection herpesviruses express proteins that inhibit HDAC activity, directly or indirectly, and this drives NKG2D ligand expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RAE-1 induction during MCMV infection requires the m18 ORF</title><p>Mouse fibroblasts normally express low levels of <italic>Raet1</italic> mRNA and protein, but RAE-1 expression is upregulated in response to cell stress, including viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lodoen et al., 2003</xref>). Previously, we showed that MCMV gene expression was necessary to induce RAE-1 expression during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tokuyama et al., 2011</xref>). To identify the MCMV gene(s) responsible for this phenotype, we screened a panel of MCMV mutants (provided by Dr. Hidde Ploegh, Whitehead Institute) lacking genomic regions not essential for viral replication in vitro. We infected mouse fibroblasts with wild type (WT) or mutant MCMV and measured <italic>Raet1</italic> mRNA expression by RT-qPCR 24 hr post-infection (h.p.i).

As m19 is immediately adjacent to the transcriptional start site of m18 it is likely that ∆19 MCMV disrupts production of m18. This idea is bolstered by our data showing m18, but not m19, expression vector rescues RAE-1 expression in cells infected with ∆m19 virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus we focused the rest of our study on the functional role of m18.</p><p>We next measured the ability of m18 to trigger NK-mediated killing using a chromium release assay. Fibroblasts transduced with m18 or an empty vector control were labeled with <sup>51</sup>Cr, then incubated with IL-2 activated NK cells derived from WT or NKG2D knockout (KO) littermates at varying effector to target ratios. We observed that WT NK cells lysed m18-expressing fibroblasts in an NKG2D dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have identified a CTL epitope produced from the m18 ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holtappels et al., 2002</xref>), and peptides that correspond to this ORF have been identified in mass spectrometric analysis of MCMV virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kattenhorn et al., 2004</xref>). Otherwise little is known about m18 or its function. To characterize m18 we assessed the expression of m18 over the course of infection by harvesting RNA of MCMV infected fibroblasts at 2,4,8,12, and 24 hr post infection and amplifying the full length (3 kB) m18 mRNA by reverse transcription followed by semi quantitative PCR. In accordance with previous studies we observed this was mRNA produced as early as 2 hr post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lacaze et al., 2011</xref>). To characterize the m18 polypeptide we expressed a C-terminal hemagglutanin (HA)-tagged m18 protein in mouse fibroblasts and NIH 3T3s and analyzed cell lysates by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We observed a band at a size of ~180 KDa, well above the predicted size of 110 KDa, suggesting m18 is post-translationally modified. To evaluate m18 localization we expressed a C-terminal GFP m18 fusion protein in NIH 3T3s and analyzed localization of GFP by fluorescent microscopy. We found that the m18-GFP fusion protein localized mostly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

CK2 is a constitutively active kinase that phosphorylates HDAC3 at serine 424 (S424) activating it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>). The activation of HDAC3 by CK2 has previously been demonstrated to help drive chromatin condensation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Patil et al., 2016</xref>) and has been shown to repress expression of genes during beige fat thermogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shinoda et al., 2015</xref>) indicating that this interaction can functionally regulate both chromatin structure and gene expression.

This repression is maintained by constitutive phosphorylation and activation of HDAC3 by CK2. However, during MCMV infection, m18 reduces phosphorylation of HDAC3 by directly interacting with CK2 an activator of HDAC3. As a result, HDAC3 becomes less activated and the chromatin around the <italic>Raet1</italic> locus becomes acetylated and accessible. Sp3 is then able to recruit the general transcriptional machinery to transcribe <italic>Raet1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). These findings reveal how the chromatin environment contributes to silencing of <italic>Raet1</italic> in unstressed cells, as well as how a single viral protein relieves this repression.</p><p>It is notable that HDAC inhibition is a feature common to a number of herpesviruses. Many of the known HDAC inhibiting proteins from herpesviruses are crucial to viral fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nevels et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gu et al., 2005</xref>). Our work demonstrated that for viruses, encoding HDAC inhibiting proteins comes at the cost of inducing NKG2D ligand transcription. It is thus tempting to speculate that viruses being unable to replicate efficiently without inhibiting HDACs have had to evolve a plethora of proteins that reduce NKG2D ligand expression at the protein level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jonjić et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>While it is appreciated that viral HDAC inhibitors can improve viral fitness, the precise significance of virally encoded HDAC inhibitors in herpesvirus pathogenesis is still not well understood. Cellular HDAC enzymes have been shown to repress viral gene expression and, in some cases replication. In the context of lytic infection herpes viruses must overcome this repression using viral HDAC inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nevels et al., 2004</xref>), in fact chemical HDAC inhibition can rescue a defect in viral replication caused by HCMV IE1 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nevels et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, viral gene repression by HDACs also promotes viral latency. HDACs have been shown to occupy the promoters of the immediate early genes that drive reactivation in HCMV and MCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Murphy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu et al., 2010</xref>), and have been shown to repress KSHV reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2014</xref>). In fact, inhibition of HDACs is sufficient to drive reactivation in latently infected KSHV cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Miller et al., 1997</xref>). In these cases viral HDAC inhibitors may provide a way for the virus to promote its own reactivation from latency. Importantly, these proteins have been described in human viruses and their function in vivo has not been well established. We do not observe a role for m18 early in MCMV infection in vivo but it is possible that m18 inhibits HDACs in order to benefit the virus during later stages of infection such as during establishment of MCMV latency or reactivation from latency similar to KSHV. Thus, it will be interesting in the future to determine if m18 has alternative functions that contribute to viral fitness during later stages of infection.</p><p>Our data provide the first evidence for the role of CK2 in NKG2D regulation. Given that CK2 activity can be modulated by many stress pathways, it will be of interest to assess whether CK2 contributes to NKG2D ligand regulation in situations such as DNA damage. Furthermore, CK2 is broadly involved in many cellular processes. Thus m18 inhibition of CK2 is likely to have additional effects on the cell. Chemical CK2 inhibitors enhance the anti-viral effect of Type I interferon signaling during HSV-1 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smith et al., 2011</xref>), implicating CK2 as a key factor in host response to viral infection. It will be interesting in the future to elucidate how manipulation of CK2 by m18 impacts the host during viral infection.</p><p>In addition to their role in viral infection, HDACs are also important for the control of cancer. Expression of Class I HDAC enzymes (including HDAC3) is increased in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glozak and Seto, 2007</xref>). Increased HDAC expression promotes carcinogenesis through down regulation of tumor suppressors such as p21 in an Sp1/Sp3 dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). As NKG2D ligand ULBP-1 is suppressed by HDAC3, it has been proposed that increased HDAC expression also contributes cancer’s ability to evade NKG2D recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Soto et al., 2009</xref>). Several chemical HDAC inhibitors, including some used in this study, are being developed as anti-cancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">West and Johnstone, 2014</xref>). While these drugs act in multiple ways, one effect may be to induce expression of NKG2D ligands leading to increased NK cell recognition and NK cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">López-Soto et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">West and Johnstone, 2014</xref>). Our study suggests that HDAC3-specific inhibitors may be particularly adept at leveraging this aspect of anti-cancer activity. CK2 is also highly upregulated in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González et al., 2008</xref>), and one intriguing possibility is that this may contribute to NKG2D ligand repression and NK cell evasion.</p><p>The regulation of NKG2D ligands is an important pivot point in immune regulation. Active repression of NKG2D ligand transcription by HDACs provides a way for the host to repress NKG2D ligand expression in the absence of stress while allowing for the possibility of expression when experiencing stress. Our study suggests that this system may also provide a strategy for hosts to recognize and respond to viral infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p>All cells cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (Invitrogen, Carlsbad CA) and 100 μ/mL Penicillin/Streptomycin (Invitrogen) unless otherwise noted.

To this end, the annotated m18 orf was cloned into the pcDNA4TO expression vector encoding either an N-terminal or C-terminal 2X-StrepTag (m18-NS or m18-CS) for affinity purification and peptide sequencing by tandem liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using methods identical to those previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greninger et al., 2012</xref>) Briefly, 10 μg of vector were transfected into 15 cm cultures of HEK293T cells using a Transit-LT1 reagent (Mirus Bio, Madison, WI) at a 3:1 vol to mg plasmid, and the cells were grown for 48 hr. Lysates were prepared in 0.1% NP40, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA. The M18 protein was captured on StrepTactin Sepharose, and then eluted with 1X desthiobiotin (IBA Technology, Gottingen Germany) as reported. To identify captured proteins by proteomic analysis, the protein samples were reduced with DTT, alkylated with iodoacetamide, and digested in solution with sequencing grade porcine trypsin (Promega) following an identical protocol to that reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greninger et al., 2012</xref>). The resulting peptides were subjected to LC-MS/MS on an LTQ-FT mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) equipped with a Nano-Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography system (Waters) for reversed-phase chromatography with a C18 column (BEH130; 1.7 μm bead size, 100 μm by 100 μm), using identical acquisition parameters as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greninger et al., 2012</xref>). MS data were searched using Protein Prospector software v. 5.10.17 (54) against the sequence of the m18 protein constructs and the NCBI Refseq human + virus database (downloaded Jan. 14, 2012) containing 131,459 sequences, concatenated with 131,459 additional randomized decoy sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalkley et al., 2008</xref>). A false discovery rate of &lt;1% was obtained using protein score of 22, peptide score 15, protein expectation value 0.05 and a peptide expectation value of 0.001. Modifications allowed in the protein identification search were: fixed carbamidomethylation of Cys and the following variable modifications: oxidation of Met, start-Met cleavage, oxidation of the N-terminus, acetylation of the N-terminus, and pyroglutamate formation from Gln. HEK293T cells were chosen for these experiments to allow for identification of frequent background proteins and for specificity scoring, by comparison with a background dataset of unrelated picornavirus-host APMS experiments assayed in the same experimental system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greninger et al., 2012</xref>, PMC4332878). Specificity scoring by Z-score was calculated using N = 3 m18 APMS experiments, which included one m18-NS and two biological replicate m18-CS experiments, and a background dataset of 598 unrelated picornavirus-host APMS experiments. Additional peptides for the m18 protein constructs were identified by allowing additional missed cleavages and Ser/Thr phosphorylation. Phosphorylation sites are reported with a site localization (SLIP) score, where SLIP ≥6 corresponds to &gt;95% confident site assignment (PMC3134073).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates were separated as above for EMSA analysis.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Herpesviral induction of RAE-1 NKG2D ligand expression occurs through release of HDAC mediated repression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a well written and scholarly study describing that the RAE-1 family of NKG2D ligands expression pattern is repressed by phosphorylation and activation of HDAC3. The kinase has been identified as Casein Kinase 2. The study extends the known role of HDAC inhibiting virally encoded molecules. HDAC3 has been previously identified as a deacetylase target of DNA virus genes. Parts of this story have been previously described by the authors and other kinases have been known to modify the activity of deacetylases. The authors correctly refer to previous studies that document similar elements of the theme of regulation of enzymes that control expression of NK type ligands. However, they should cite and comment on a recent study {Mitotic Activation of a Novel Histone Deacetylase 3-Linker Histone H1.3 Protein Complex by Protein Kinase CK2. Patil H, et al. J Biol Chem. 2016 Feb 12;291(7):3158-72. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M115.643874. Epub 2015 Dec 9} which identified CK as a modifier of HDAC3 function and which affects chromatin structure similar to that proposed in this work.</p><p>There was some overall concern that the paper is too specialized for <italic>eLife</italic> because many of the elements (HDAC inhibitors in viruses, HDAC in regulation of NKG2D ligands, etc.) have been previously described, albeit in different contexts. However, the discovery of a specific inhibitor encoded by a DNA virus that affects NKG2D ligand expression through the specific mechanism described appears to be novel enough to sway the reviewers and editors positively at this point. That said, the reviewers had some major concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns dealt with the in vivo relevance of the finding, the characterization of m18 protein and the mass spec data.</p><p>1) The authors should infect mice with the δ-m18 virus to examine if the absence of m18 affects viral virulence in an NKG2D-dependent manner. They should discuss such findings with respect to previous studies regarding NKG2D, NKG2D ligands, inhibitors, and MCMV virulence.</p><p>2) Insufficient characterization of m18 protein. The authors did not show the presence of the m18 protein in WB in spite of the fact that they have made numerous m18 constructs (m18-RFP, m18-GFP, m18-FLAG, m18-strep tag) and transfectants. Here are some examples: why were mouse fibroblasts, which are stably expressing m18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), analysed for the H3 and AcH3 protein expression and not for m18 in the same WB analysis? The same applies to the mouse carcinoma cells MCA-205 expressing m18. In addition, the authors used FLAG pull down from the lysates of cells expressing 3xFlag-m18 and tested for the presence of CK2β by WB, but again the m18 protein was not included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The only example where m18 protein has been shown is the m18-RFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). There is no information about the m18 construct used for the m18 IF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Based on the nuclear localization and the term 'RFP-tagged', I assume that the construct was generated to produce a RFP/m18 fusion protein. Also, it would be important to address which of the fusion partners were positioned N terminally.</p><p>3) The mass spec analysis was not sufficiently elaborated. There was no information about the samples being analysed in the Results section. Also, as stated in the sentence: 'All reported m18 peptides were manually validated' it is unclear whether they were able to validate all predicted m18 peptides. When it comes to the native, virally derived, m18 protein so far only the m18 peptides have been confirmed (Holtappels et al., J Gen Virol, 2001; Kattenhorn et al., J. Virol, 2004).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14749.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Major concerns dealt with the in vivo relevance of the finding, the characterization of m18 protein and the mass spec data.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should infect mice with the δ-m18 virus to examine if the absence of m18 affects viral virulence in an NKG2D-dependent manner.

Because the ∆m18 MCMV used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> contains a kanamycin cassette and has the potential to produce confounding T cell epitopes in vivo, we generated and characterized an additional MCMV mutant to specifically eliminate the production of the m18 protein with minimal disruption of other viral genes. We accomplished this by inserting two stop codons into the m18 ORF near the 5’ end. This virus we referred to as MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup>. We then had to characterize MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> in vitrobefore the work could be</p><p>moved in vivo. As predicted, this virus failed to induce the expression of <italic>Raet1</italic> in vitro, and did not demonstrate any obvious defects in growth in vitrorecapitulating our original data using ∆m18. (This data is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Using this virus we answered two questions about m18 in MCMV biology in vivo.</p><p>Does m18 make MCMV more susceptible to NK cell control?</p><p>Is m18 required for growth of MCMV in vivo<italic>?</italic></p><p>To answer these questions we infected MCMV susceptible BALB/c mice with this MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> virus and measured viral titers at five days post infection, as this is a time where NK surveillance significantly contributes MCMV replication in vivo. We performed this experiment three separate times with 5-7 mice per group to achieve significance and confidence in the results. Interestingly, we did not see any difference in MCMV levels in the lungs, liver or spleens of mice infected with MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> as compared to wild type MCMV. This suggests that m18 is not required for NK cell control or for MCMV replication in vivo at this time point.</p><p>We then sought to assess the growth of MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> in a system without surveillance by NK cells and other immune cells. To test this we infected RAG<sup>-/-</sup>RAG<sup>-/-</sup> yC<sup>-/-</sup> mice lacking NK cells, T cells, and B cells with MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> and measured viral titers at five days post-infection in the lungs, livers, and spleens. Again we did not see any difference in MCMV titers between wild type and mutant viruses in any of these organs.</p><p>Overall these data are in line with studies showing that viruses are competent for evasion of RAE-1 recognition by NKG2D (through m152) do not see a large increase in titers when NK cells are depleted, as this evasion is very efficient. Our model figure has been changed to clearly reflect this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the analysis described above, we have preliminary data showing a large defect in MCMV<sup>m18stop</sup> growth at five days in the salivary gland. These data do suggest that m18 is important for either trafficking of MCMV to the salivary glands or establishment within them. While this is very interesting it is highly likely that this phenotype is independent of RAE-1 induction by m18, as control of MCMV in the salivary glands is mostly dependent on CD4 &amp; CD8 T cells. Thus, these data will be better served in a future study of m18’s function in the MCMV pathogenesis. In addition, it remains possible that m18 plays a role in additional aspects of MCMV pathogenesis that were not investigating here such as latency establishment, reactivation or transmission. This will be an interesting avenue to pursue in the future.</p><p><italic>2) Insufficient characterization of m18 protein. The authors did not show the presence of the m18 protein in WB in spite of the fact that they have made numerous m18 constructs (m18-RFP, m18-GFP, m18-FLAG, m18-strep tag) and transfectants. Here are some examples: why were mouse fibroblasts, which are stably expressing m18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), analysed for the H3 and AcH3 protein expression and not for m18 in the same WB analysis? The same applies to the mouse carcinoma cells MCA-205 expressing m18. In addition, the authors used FLAG pull down from the lysates of cells expressing 3xFlag-m18 and tested for the presence of CK2β by WB, but again the m18 protein was not included in the analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The only example where m18 protein has been shown is the m18-RFP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). There is no information about the m18 construct used for the m18 IF in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. Based on the nuclear localization and the term 'RFP-tagged', I assume that the construct was generated to produce a RFP/m18 fusion protein. Also, it would be important to address which of the fusion partners were positioned N terminally.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns about our characterization of the m18 protein we have included a western blot demonstrating m18 protein expression in mouse fibroblasts and NIH-3T3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Additionally, we have included an image of a fibroblast expressing a C-Terminal GFP m18 fusion protein illustrating that m18 localizes mostly to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We have also added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> showing our characterization of the other constructs used in the manuscript. This includes western blot analysis of m18-3xFlag and m18-GFP, as well as flow cytometric analysis demonstrating that m18-3xFlag, m18-GFP, and m18-RFP all induce the expression of RAE-1. We have also included analysis correlating the levels m18-GFP to the levels of RAE-1 expression.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we did not have an epitope tag in that construct, and there is no antibody for native m18 protein. We did however analyze the transduced populations for RAE-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and show that m18 transduced cells express high levels of RAE-1, similar to the effect of other m18 constructs used in the manuscript. Thus we are confident that these cells are expressing m18.</p><p>The lack of data illustrating m18 protein expression in our IP-WB experiment, was an oversight on our part. In the revised manuscript, we have included western blot analysis of m18Flag expression in the lysates of these fibroblasts <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. We also include a new and extensive analysis of m18 peptides identified during our AP-MS purification demonstrating that the m18 protein was present in these samples. These data also indicate that m18 undergoes extensive post-translational modification as 45% of peptides identified contained some type of modification.</p><p>Additionally, we have revised the manuscript to clearly indicate which terminus each epitope tag or fluorescent protein was fused to for each individual experiment.</p><p><italic>3) The mass spec analysis was not sufficiently elaborated. There was no information about the samples being analysed in the Results section. Also, as stated in the sentence: 'All reported m18 peptides were manually validated' it is unclear whether they were able to validate all predicted m18 peptides. When it comes to the native, virally derived, m18 protein so far only the m18 peptides have been confirmed (Holtappels et al., J Gen Virol, 2001; Kattenhorn et al., J. Virol, 2004).</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s concerns we have extensively elaborated upon our mass spec analysis in both the Results and Methods. The Results section has been improved to indicate that AP-MS was performed using N- or C-terminally Strep-tagged m18 was transiently expressed in HEK293T cells to allow for direct comparison with similar virus-host AP-MS samples. This allowed for high frequency background proteins to be identified. We also indicate that this experiment was repeated multiple times.</p><p>We have included four new supplementary files tabulating our MS results (Figure 6—figure supplements 1-4). This includes specific interacting proteins identified in the APMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), high frequency background proteins identified in the APMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), Z scores for ranking the most specific interacting proteins identified in the APMS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), and a list of all identified peptides (including post translational modifications) sequences derived from the annotated m18 ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The phrase “manually validated” was not meant to be confusing, and is a term used often in proteomic groups to indicate that peptide spectra were inspected for the quality of the matched peptide sequen, but more importantly here we have provided detailed explanation of the scoring used for peptide sequence identifications by LC-MS/MS.</p><p>In our Methods we have changed our wording to indicate that the <italic>reported</italic>peptides referenced in the original manuscript were identified by searching a database that contained the predicted annotated m18 ORF. For the interest of the reviewer we did identify an m18-derived peptide that overlaps the immunogenic peptide identified in Holtapples et al. 2001 (QKAASAASSSSSASSSGPSR), but we were unable to confirm how our peptides related to those identified in Kattenhorn et al. 2004, as the identity of the peptides identified for m18 in this study were not publicly available.</p></body></sub-article></article>
