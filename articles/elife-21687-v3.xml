Pathway choice is made at the level of DNA end resection, a nucleolytic processing step, which primes DSBs for repair by recombination. Resection is thus under cell cycle control, but additionally regulated by chromatin and nucleosome remodellers. Here, we show that both layers of control converge in the regulation of resection by the evolutionarily conserved Fun30/SMARCAD1 remodeller. Budding yeast Fun30 and human SMARCAD1 are cell cycle-regulated by interaction with the DSB-localized scaffold protein Dpb11/TOPBP1, respectively. In yeast, this protein assembly additionally comprises the 9-1-1 damage sensor, is involved in localizing Fun30 to damaged chromatin, and thus is required for efficient long-range resection of DSBs. Notably, artificial targeting of Fun30 to DSBs is sufficient to bypass the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection, indicating that chromatin remodelling during resection is underlying DSB repair pathway choice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21687.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21687.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21687.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA is continually exposed to chemicals and radiation that cause various forms of DNA damage. One of the most toxic forms of DNA damage is the double strand break, in which both strands of the double helix are broken. These breaks can be mended in two ways: by directly joining the broken ends together, or via a process called homologous recombination. In homologous recombination, a duplicate DNA molecule is used as a template to repair the broken DNA strands. These duplicates only form during particular phases of the cell division cycle, which limits when homologous recombination can take place.</p><p>A cell can choose which pathway it uses to repair double strand breaks. However, the first step of homologous recombination – trimming the broken DNA ends in a process called resection – commits a cell to the homologous recombination repair pathway. Cell cycle kinases regulate the cell division cycle and control DNA end resection. This control takes two forms: on the one hand by regulating whether the enzymes that trim the DNA ends are active; and on the other hand by regulating the remodelling of the structure into which DNA is packaged, which is called chromatin. However, it is not known which of these two targets is the limiting factor that determines whether homologous recombination occurs.</p><p>A protein called Fun30 that remodels chromatin had been found to be important for promoting resection in budding yeast. Bantele et al. now reveal how the activity of Fun30 is regulated by the cell cycle to limit extensive resection to certain cell cycle phases, where homologous recombination is wanted. During those stages, cell cycle kinases add phosphate groups to Fun30. This enables Fun30 to engage in a protein complex that directs Fun30 to the site of a double strand break to facilitate the resection process.</p><p>Bantele et al. also studied artificial versions of Fun30 that were directly fused to components of the protein complex, and so bypassed the controls that limit homologous recombination to particular phases of the cell cycle. These forms of Fun30 enabled resection to take place in phases of the cell cycle where it does not normally occur. This suggests that the remodelling of chromatin by Fun30 is a critical step at which resection is regulated by the cell cycle.</p><p>Further experiments showed that the cell cycle regulation of human proteins that are equivalent to Fun30 and another protein in the resection complex is similar to that seen for the yeast proteins. In the future, knowing how these proteins are regulated during resection could help researchers to develop new gene editing methods based on homologous recombination that can be used in cells at any stage of the cell cycle.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21687.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21687.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>DNA recombination</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>double strand breaks</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project Grant, PF794/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pfander</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fonds der Chemischen Industrie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bantele</surname><given-names>Susanne CS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NRW Rueckkehrerprogramm from the state of North-Rhine-Westphalia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Boos</surname><given-names>Dominik</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Chromatin remodelling is a key bottleneck to DNA end resection, the first and committed step of homologous recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA end resection – the nucleolytic digestion of the 5’ strands of a DSB – is essential for the initiation of homologous recombination (HR) or related recombination-based mechanisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cejka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Symington, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>]). At the same time, resection interferes with ligation-based repair (non-homologous end-joining, NHEJ) and thus is the critical step for repair pathway choice. In mitotically dividing cells, recombination-based repair critically depends on the presence of a sister-chromatid. DSB repair pathway choice and accordingly DNA end resection are therefore highly regulated during the cell cycle: in G1 phase, little resection occurs and NHEJ is therefore favoured. Conversely, in S, G2 and M phase, resection is up-regulated and HR becomes more prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cejka, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ira et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Symington, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Symington and Gautier, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The nucleases that mediate resection can be subdivided into resection initiation (by Mre11-Rad50-Xrs2 and Sae2 in budding yeast) and long-range resection (by Exo1 or Dna2 with Sgs1-Top3-Rmi1 in budding yeast) pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cejka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mimitou and Symington, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Niu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). So far, Sae2 and Dna2 were shown to be cell cycle - controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huertas et al., 2008</xref>) and EXO1 in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomimatsu et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, however, a bypass of this control is not sufficient to allow efficient end resection to occur in G1, suggesting that other factors may be involved in the cell cycle control of DNA end resection.</p><p>Resection is also influenced by the surrounding chromatin. Nucleosomes themselves can be inhibitory to resection enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adkins et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, nucleosome-associated proteins such as budding yeast Rad9 or its functional ortholog in humans, 53BP1, can inhibit resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bunting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lazzaro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trovesi et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with a barrier function of chromatin and/or Rad9, nucleosome remodellers are recruited to DSBs and promote resection, although the mechanism is poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bennett and Peterson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morrison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Attikum et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">2004</xref>). The Swr1-like family remodeller Fun30 (SMARCAD1 in humans) was found to be a critical regulator of resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>). Fun30 localizes to chromatin surrounding DSBs and <italic>fun30△</italic> mutant cells show a pronounced defect in long-range resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>). Importantly, also SMARCAD1 promotes DNA end resection in human cells, suggesting evolutionary conservation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>). Fun30 itself is a substrate for CDK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ubersax et al., 2003</xref>), but it has remained unclear by which mechanism Fun30 function is regulated during the cell cycle, how Fun30 is targeted to DNA lesions and if this regulation imposes a bottleneck in the regulation of DNA end resection.</p><p>Here, we show that CDK phosphorylation enables Fun30 to form a complex with the phospho-protein-binding scaffold protein Dpb11 and the DNA damage sensor 9-1-1. Formation of this complex is required for proper localization of Fun30 and for efficient long-range resection in M phase cells. Notably, when we bypass the CDK requirement by directly fusing Fun30 to a subunit of the 9-1-1 complex, we observe long-range resection even in G1–arrested cells. This suggests that the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection can be bypassed solely by artificially targeting Fun30 to DSBs. Finally, we show that also human SMARCAD1 binds to TOPBP1 (human ortholog of Dpb11) in a CDK phosphorylation-dependent manner that involves conserved interaction surfaces, suggesting that the formation of a Fun30-Dpb11 complex is a conserved mechanism of cell cycle regulation that could control DNA end resection and repair pathway choice throughout eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell cycle-dependent targeting of Fun30 by Dpb11</title><p>We identified Fun30 in a two-hybrid screen for interactors of the scaffold protein Dpb11. Dpb11 is a critical regulator of genome stability in budding yeast and as such is found in several distinct protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gritenaite et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohouo et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puddu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>). Crucial for the formation of these complexes are the two tandem BRCT domains of Dpb11, which are phospho-protein binding modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Leung and Glover, 2011</xref>) specific for discrete sets of phosphorylation-dependent interactors. In case of Fun30, the interaction is mediated by BRCT1+2, but not BRCT3+4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using Dpb11 expressed from the strong GPD promoter, we also observed an interaction between Fun30<sup>3FLAG</sup> and Dpb11 in co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Thus, we tested the interaction between Dpb11 and Fun30 from cells at different cell cycle stages.

Indeed, upon CDK inhibition (using the <italic>cdc28-as1</italic> allele and 1-NMPP1 inhibition) Dpb11 binding to Fun30 was strongly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Accordingly, purified Fun30<sup>3FLAG</sup> was able to interact with <sup>GST</sup>Dpb11-BRCT1+2 in vitro but only after pre-phosphorylation by CDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), suggesting that the Fun30-Dpb11 interaction as well as its regulation by CDK phosphorylation are direct. Therefore, we sought to identify the CDK phosphorylation sites on Fun30, which are relevant for Dpb11 binding. Interaction mapping using truncated constructs placed the Dpb11 interaction site close to the N-terminus of Fun30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Within this region, we identified S20 as well as S28 as critical residues for the Fun30-Dpb11 interaction by two-hybrid and Co-IP binding assays using non-phosphorylatable versions of Fun30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that phosphorylation of both residues may create a composite binding surface for Dpb11 BRCT1+2, perhaps similar to the Dpb11-binding surfaces on Rad9 and Sld3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zegerman and Diffley, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zegerman et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It seemed likely that Dpb11 is involved in targeting Fun30 to DNA lesions. We therefore tested recruitment of <italic>WT</italic> Fun30<sup>3FLAG</sup> or the corresponding <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> variant to a site-specific, non-repairable DSB using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Indeed, we observed that Fun30-SSAA binding to regions distal of the DSB was reduced compared to <italic>WT</italic> (8–20 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), while both versions bound similarly to the immediate vicinity of the DSB (1–3 kb, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This result thus confirms recent observations showing a DSB recruitment defect of <italic>fun30-S20A</italic> and <italic>fun30-S28A</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, we could expand these data by generating an experimental tool, which restores the Fun30-Dpb11 interaction in a phosphorylation-independent manner. Since conventional phospho-mimetic mutations failed to promote binding (data not shown), we generated a covalent fusion of the Fun30-SSAA protein directly to Dpb11△N lacking BRCT1+2 (<italic>FUN30-AA-DPB11-276-C</italic> expressed as the only copy of Fun30 from the endogenous promoter, referred to as <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion in the following). Importantly, the fusion protein localized efficiently to damaged chromatin and thus restored the defect of the <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). This finding suggests that the interaction with Dpb11 is indeed involved in targeting Fun30 to DSBs and that the covalent fusion is sufficient to bypass the CDK regulation of Fun30. Notably, DSB recruitment of the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion protein was stronger than Fun30 consistent with the replacement of a transient, PTM-dependent interaction by a covalent interaction. Therefore, we reason that the <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion deregulates Fun30 in two ways: first, it uncouples Fun30 from its cell cycle regulation. Second, it leads to enhanced DSB localization to DSBs, thus potentially enhancing Fun30 activity at damaged chromatin.</p><p>We also note that the apparently normal recruitment of Fun30-SSAA to the immediate vicinity of the DSB could be explained by an additional CDK phosphorylation-independent, but resection-dependent recruitment mechanism, such as via binding to RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Our data thus suggest the existence of two Fun30–targeting mechanisms: one that is Dpb11-dependent and recruits Fun30 to sites of ongoing resection, and a second that is Dpb11-independent and tethers Fun30 to DNA that has already been resected.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Fun30-Dpb11 complex is required for efficient long-range resection</title><p>We utilized our system of abolishing and constitutively forcing Fun30 binding to Dpb11 in order to investigate the biological function of the Dpb11-dependent Fun30 targeting mechanism and its role in regulating DNA end resection. We measured resection at an HO-induced, non-repairable DSB in M phase-arrested cells using the combined read-out of (a) the accumulation of the ssDNA-binding protein RPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper panel) around the DSB by ChIP and (b) the specific DNA loss (occurring due to ssDNA formation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel). Indeed, compared to <italic>WT</italic> cells, <italic>fun30△</italic> mutants showed a pronounced defect in long-range resection, visible by a reduced spreading of both RPA-ChIP and DNA loss, to regions greater than 10 kb away from the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), confirming previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costelloe et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eapen et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, the same defect in long-range resection was also observed in the Dpb11-binding deficient <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> mutant and was fully restored by the <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To corroborate these findings, we also analysed resection-dependent DSB repair in a single-strand annealing (SSA) assay, where cellular survival upon an HO-induced DSB in the absence of Rad51 critically depends on the efficient resection of 25 kb of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vaze et al., 2002</xref>]). In fact, Dpb11-binding deficient <italic>fun30</italic> mutants were deficient in SSA-mediated survival and this defect was completely rescued by covalent fusion of Fun30-SSAA to Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Similar to what has been described for the <italic>fun30△</italic> mutant, we observed that the CPT-hypersensitivity of the <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> was suppressed by an additional <italic>rad9 </italic>deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that the Fun30-Dpb11 complex antagonizes Rad9. Interestingly, Rad9 also binds to Dpb11, and Fun30 and Rad9 share the same interaction site on Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>). While it is currently unknown whether Dpb11-associated Rad9 (in contrast to nucleosome-associated Rad9) contributes to the inhibition of DNA end resection, the overlapping binding site raised the possibility that Fun30 may interfere with Rad9 function via competition. Therefore, in order to exclude that the <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion rescues resection simply by blocking the Rad9-Dpb11 interaction, we inactivated the ATPase activity of Fun30 by a Walker A motif mutation (K603R) in the context of the <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion and found the K603R mutant fusion did not restore <italic>WT</italic> resistance to CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Therefore, competition does not explain the effects of the <italic>FUN30-DPB11</italic> fusion and the catalytic activity of Fun30 is required for the resection-promoting function of the Fun30-Dpb11 complex. Overall, these data thus suggest that cell cycle-regulated targeting of Fun30 by Dpb11 is required for efficient DNA end resection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The 9-1-1 complex targets Fun30 to DSBs and – as artificial fusion with Fun30 - can be utilized to promote long-range resection in G1</title><p>In several organisms, recruitment of Dpb11 and its orthologs to DSBs has been shown to be facilitated by the 9-1-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delacroix et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furuya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Puddu et al., 2008</xref>), a signalling platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Parrilla-Castellar et al., 2004</xref>) which is loaded at DNA damage sites.

Previous efforts to bypass this regulation have focussed on nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huertas et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, we tested if the CDK-regulation of Fun30 may contribute to the cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection or may even be a limiting factor for this regulation. We used the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion, which in contrast to <italic>WT</italic> Fun30 efficiently localized to a DSB in G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This indicates that the fusion may in principle allow Fun30 to act on damaged chromatin in G1, consistent with 9-1-1 being loaded to damaged chromatin in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barlow et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janke et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, the <italic>DDC1</italic>-<italic>FUN30</italic> fusion protein promoted resection in G1 to a significantly larger reach compared to <italic>WT</italic> Fun30, since RPA recruitment could be observed up to 25 kb distance from the DSB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, the spreading of resection under the <italic>DDC1</italic>-<italic>FUN30</italic> conditions was even more pronounced than in <italic>WT</italic> cells arrested in M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). This effect is thus consistent with the very efficient targeting of Fun30 to DNA damage sites by the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion. This hyperactivation of resection thus indicates that forced tethering of Fun30 to DSB sites is able to bypass the bottleneck that limits long-range resection in G1.</p><p>It needs to be pointed out that within the resected region the fold enrichment of RPA recruitment and the extent of DNA loss was not restored to similar levels as observed in M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Moreover, precise ligation of a cut plasmid by NHEJ did not appear to be influenced by the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These data thus suggest that the overall cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection was not bypassed completely, presumably because other resection proteins and in particular resection initiation are additional targets of cell cycle regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albuquerque et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huertas et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). We therefore compared G1 resection in the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> strain to another mutant – <italic>sae2-S267E</italic> – that is thought to at least partially bypass the CDK regulation of resection initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huertas, 2010</xref>). Notably, the <italic>sae2-S267E</italic> mutant showed no increase in the reach of resection and only led to a slight increase in the fold enrichment of the RPA ChIP, both in <italic>WT</italic> and <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Overall, these data are thus consistent with a model, whereby <italic>sae2-S267E</italic> partially bypasses the cell cycle regulation of resection initiation, while the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion bypasses the cell cycle regulation of long-range resection. This highlights that chromatin has a barrier function towards resection and that formation of the Fun30-Dpb11 complex is the limiting step that needs to be up-regulated during recombination-permissive cell cycle phases in order to overcome this barrier.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21687.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion does not significantly inhibit non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ).</title><p>Precise re-ligation of BamHI-cut pRS316 as measured by cell viability on SC-Ura plates and subsequent sequencing of single colonies was dependent on Ku70 but not significantly affected in <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> of <italic>fun30∆</italic> mutant cells.

Strikingly, in an independent screen we identified an N-terminal fragment of SMARCAD1 (aa 55–274) as interactor of TOPBP1 (using a TOPBP1 BRCT0-2 construct), the human ortholog of Dpb11. Furthermore, we found this interaction to require the phospho-protein binding sites of TOPBP1 BRCT1+2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). We verified the SMARCAD1-TOPBP1 interaction in a pulldown approach using purified GST-TOPBP1-BRCT0/1/2 fragments and in vitro phosphorylation of cell extracts with purified CDK. GFP-SMARCAD1-55-445 bound efficiently to GST-TOPBP1-BRCT0/1/2, but only after addition of active CDK to the cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This suggests that CDK phosphorylation promotes the interaction, similar to the regulation in yeast. We therefore queried for the TOPBP1 interaction site on SMARCAD1 using mutagenesis of CDK consensus motifs. Using this approach, we found that the T71A variant, but none of the other S/TP site mutants tested caused strongly reduced TOPBP1 binding in two-hybrid and Co-IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data therefore suggest that SMARCAD1 interacts with TOPBP1 via the CDK-site T71. To our surprise, we observed in two-hybrid experiments that human SMARCAD1 also interacted with yeast Dpb11 and in a manner that was dependent on the T71 phosphorylation site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3</xref>), despite low sequence conservation. This raised the possibility that SMARCAD1 and FUN30 could also functionally complement each other. Expression of SMARCAD1 from the inducible GAL-promoter lead only to a slight suppression of the CPT sensitivity of a <italic>fun30△</italic> strain (data not shown), suggesting that there is an aspect of Fun30 function or regulation that is not recapitulated by SMARCAD1. In contrast, when we generated a SMARCAD1-Fun30 chimera lacking the Dpb11-binding region of Fun30 but containing the TOPBP1-binding region of SMARCAD1 (SMARCAD1-1-300-FUN30-30-C), this chimera was largely able to rescue the CPT sensitivity of the <italic>fun30△</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">Figure 9—figure supplement 5</xref>). In contrast, the Fun30-30-C fragment alone was unable to provide a rescue and showed reduced protein stability as well (without tag or GFP-tagged, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s4">Figure 9—figure supplements 4</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s6">6</xref>). This experiment may thus indicate that the TOPBP1-binding region of SMARCAD1 could replace the Dpb11-binding region of Fun30 in vivo. Overall, we therefore conclude from the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> that the Fun30/SMARCAD1 interaction with Dpb11/TOPBP1, its regulation by CDK phosphorylation and the corresponding interaction surfaces show a remarkable conservation over more than a billion years of eukaryotic evolution.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21687.024</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Yeast Fun30 and human SMARCAD1 underlie a conserved regulation.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) SMARCAD1 and TOPBP1 interact and their interaction depends on functional phospho-binding pockets in BRCT1 and BRCT2 of TOPBP1. lexA-BD TOPBP1 1–360 (harbouring BRCT0/1/2) or lexA-BD TOPBP1 1–766 (harbouring BRCT0-5) were tested as <italic>WT</italic> versions or as <italic>K155E, KK154,155AM</italic> (affecting BRCT1) or <italic>K250E</italic> (affecting BRCT2) mutant derivatives.

In budding yeast, this interaction seems to facilitate localization of Fun30 to damaged chromatin in a manner that depends on the 9-1-1 complex. Notably, other interactions may also contribute to Fun30 targeting or function, given that Fun30 was shown to interact with RPA and nucleases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>) and that SMARCAD1 was recently shown to interact with H2A-ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Densham et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, however, our data suggests that the interaction with Dpb11 and 9-1-1 is essential for the resection function of Fun30 during the cell cycle. In contrast to the Fun30-Dpb11 complex, the other interactions are seemingly cell cycle-independent and future research will need to show whether they are at all critical for Fun30/SMARCAD1 function.</p><p>Once recruited to a lesion, Fun30 will then promote the action of the long-range resection machinery by generating resection-permissive chromatin. It seems clear that Fun30 antagonizes the resection inhibitor Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), but different, non-exclusive mechanisms remain possible. For example, Fun30 could directly remove Rad9 from DNA damage sites or render Rad9-containing chromatin resection-permissive, but also could interfere with Rad9 recruitment by changing chromatin composition. We predict that our system of forced targeting Fun30 to damaged chromatin will be useful to discriminate between these possibilities in the future.</p><p>It is furthermore possible that a direct competition for Dpb11 binding between Fun30 and Rad9 contributes to the functional antagonism, similar to what has been suggested for Slx4 and Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cussiol et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dibitetto et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohouo et al., 2013</xref>). Dpb11 thus interacts with pro- and anti-resection factors, and the same is true for TOPBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cescutti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Moudry et al., 2016</xref>). It will thus be interesting to figure out in the future, how binding of potential antagonizing factors is balanced.</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that at least two layers of cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection can be distinguished. First, nucleases and nuclease-associated factors are substrate for CDK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huertas et al., 2008</xref>) and this may directly activate these enzymes, as has for example been shown for the endonuclease activity of MRX-Sae2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannavo and Cejka, 2014</xref>). Second, chromatin and nucleosome remodellers may be regulated in a way that generates resection-permissive chromatin at damage sites in cell cycle phases when resection is favoured. The Fun30-Dpb11 complex clearly falls in this second category, as does perhaps Rad9/53BP1, the cell cycle regulation of which we are only beginning to understand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cescutti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pfander and Diffley, 2011</xref>). Notably, deregulation of the second layer such as in the experiments with the <italic>DDC1-FUN30</italic> fusion has so far been the most successful strategy to bypass the cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This emphasizes the importance of resection regulation by its chromatin substrate and suggests that chromatin (more specifically the Fun30 target on chromatin) is the factor that limits long-range resection in G1 phase cells.</p><p>Experimentally manipulating DSB repair pathway choice is a key challenge for future research, because it may allow gene targeting in G1/post-mitotic cells, which are currently refractory to this type of approach, since HR is inefficient under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Orthwein et al., 2015</xref>). Notwithstanding the overall complexity of DSB repair pathway choice, our results suggest that modification of the DSB-surrounding chromatin by Fun30/SMARCAD1 should be explored further – particularly in higher eukaryotes – as a tool to experimentally channel DSBs into the HR pathway independently of cell cycle stage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, cell lines and plasmids</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study derive from W303 MATa (strains listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>) and were constructed using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janke et al., 2004</xref>).

We found that the majority of cells had precisely re-joined the BamHI overhangs, with a subset having added a single G-C basepair at the cutsite (shown as rate in %). <italic>yku70∆</italic> cells are NHEJ-deficient and showed very low NHEJ rates with exclusively precisely re-joined plasmid sequences, indicating that this number represents the background of uncut plasmid in the reactions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank U Kagerer for technical assistance, J Willmann for early contributions to the project, J Diffley for support of the initial TopBP1 two hybrid screen, J Diffley, J Haber, P Huertas, S Jackson, K-U Reusswig, L Symington for antibodies, plasmid constructs and strains, P Becker, S Gruber, S Jentsch and members of the Jentsch and Pfander labs for stimulating discussion and critical reading of the manuscript.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Gregory Ira (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jo Morris (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors identify a cell cycle-dependent interaction between Fun30 and Dpb11-BRCT domains that depends on CDK-mediated phosphorylation at Fun30 S20 and S28. This complex, together with 9-1-1 is important for long range resection in S-M phase. Fusion of Fun30 to a component of 9-1-1 complex or Dpb11 substitutes the need for Fun30 phosphorylation and even restores resection in G1 blocked cells. Evidence for a similar cell cycle control of resection and interaction between human orthologues (SMARCAD1:TOPBP1) is provided. Together this report uncovers new mechanism of cell cycle regulation of DSB ends resection and proposes a possible strategy to optimize gene targeting in G1/post-mitotic cells. The report is well written, timely and interesting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the observations are interesting and important, the collective major comments that need to be addressed prior to publication are:</p><p>1) The role of Fun30 phosphorylation by Cdk1 in the interaction with Dpb11 is clear. It is also entirely convincing that Dpb11-Fun30 or Ddc1-Fun30 fusion proteins can substitute the need for the Cdk1 dependent Fun30 phosphorylation. However, the strain carrying any of these fused proteins has several phenotypes that indicate hyperactivity of Fun30. These include better growth/faster recovery upon SSA when compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), surprisingly efficient resection in G1 cells, hyper-resistance to CPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), higher recruitment at DSBs than wild type Fun30. Thus, the major concern is that Fun30 fused to Dpb11 has higher and/or even possibly different activity than the phosphorylated form of the Fun30. Testing phosphomimic mutants would address this question and complement shortcomings of fusion protein analysis. It is occasionally observed that phosphomimic mutants do not restore the activity of protein; if this is the case here the conclusions would need to be toned down. Considering surprisingly efficient resection of Fun30-Dpb11 cells in G1 cells (previously observed only in ku mutants) it would be good to test the efficiency of precise NHEJ in cells carrying Fun30-Dpb11 and Fun30-Ddc1. Work published so far does not indicate any role of yeast Fun30 in the initial resection that is important for the choice between NHEJ and HR. Thus, any role of fused proteins in regulation of NHEJ would point to a nonphysiological function of the fusion protein.</p><p>2) The model proposed suggests a hierarchy of recruitment with both Ddc1 and 9-1-1 being upstream of Fun30. Testing Fun30 recruitment to DSBs (by ChIP) in a dpb11 mutant that does not interact with Fun30 or in a ddc1 mutant would greatly support this view. A decreased or no recruitment in these mutants is expected, if the model is correct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21687.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Although the observations are interesting and important, the collective major comments that need to be addressed prior to publication are:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The role of Fun30 phosphorylation by Cdk1 in the interaction with Dpb11 is clear.

First, we bypass the cell cycle regulation of Fun30 targeting. Second, we generate more efficient Fun30 recruitment to damaged chromatin than would be seen for the WT protein (see Fun30 ChIPs in Figure.6—figure supplement 3). This could lead to Fun30 hyperactivation. In fact, we generated the Ddc1-Fun30 specifically for this effect, because we reasoned that it would target Fun30 to damaged chromatin even more efficiently than the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion. Moreover, in case of the Ddc1-Fun30 fusion we have clear indication that it leads to Fun30 hyperactivation, as was rightly pointed out by the reviewers. In case of the Fun30-Dpb11 fusion we do not have such clear evidence of hyperactivation (the SSA efficiency in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> is in our opinion similar to WT), even though recruitment to DSBs is more efficient than in WT cells. Nonetheless, also in this case hyperactivation cannot be excluded entirely.</p><p>We have now rewritten the manuscript to better account for this effect and apologize if this was not entirely clear in the first version of the paper. Indeed, we are convinced that Fun30 hyperactivation in the Fun30-Ddc1 fusion is critical for allowing long-range resection to proceed efficient in G1. From this we conclude that (1) the cell cycle regulation of other factors, which also contributes to the overall cell cycle regulation of DNA end resection, could potentially be overridden by the hyperactivation of Fun30. Notably we also conclude from this finding that (2) Fun30 activity is most likely limiting to resection in WT cells.</p><p>While it is difficult to exclude entirely that Fun30 may have gained a new activity in the context of the fusion, we currently do not have any indication of such a phenomenon. We have thus followed the reviewers’ advice and tested whether NHEJ would be inhibited in the presence of the Ddc1-Fun30 fusion. However, we did not observe any significant decrease in NHEJ rates in the Ddc1-Fun30 fusion, when using a plasmid ligation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We thus currently have no evidence for a gain of a nonphysiological function.</p><p>Finally, we have also extensively tested conventional phosphomimetic mutations already early on in the project. However – as the reviewers expected and as we have previously observed for many Dpb11-binders – D or E mutations (and in particular the critical DD/EE mutation) in Fun30 failed to restore the interaction with Dpb11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). Phosphomimikry is as such not a tool that can be utilized to study Fun30 regulation.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21687.032</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Phospho-mimetic mutants of Fun30 S20 and S28 disrupt the interaction with Dpb11.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Two-hybrid spotting of strains expressing phospho-mimetic versions of ADFun30 1-188 (S20D, S28D, SS20,28DD, S20E, S28E and SS20,28EE respectively) and BDDpb11-N.

Testing Fun30 recruitment to DSBs (by ChIP) in a dpb11 mutant that does not interact with Fun30 or in a ddc1 mutant would greatly support this view. A decreased or no recruitment in these mutants is expected, if the model is correct.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for emphasizing the hierarchical targeting of Fun30 depending on 9-1-1 and Dpb11. In the revised version of our manuscript, we used two mutants (next to our <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic>) to specifically address the effect of mutations in the upstream factors: the 9-1-1 mutant <italic>ddc1-T602A</italic> (deficient in binding to and recruiting Dpb11) and the Dpb11 mutant <italic>sld3-dpb11ΔN</italic> (DPB11 is an essential gene, but the Fun30 interaction site (BRCT1+2) can be truncated if fused to Sld3 (Zegerman et al, Nature, 2007)). As predicted by the model, both mutants indeed lead to a reduction in Fun30 ChIPs to damaged chromatin. As discussed already in the context of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> (Fun30 ChIP in the <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> mutant) there is residual recruitment occurring in all mutant backgrounds affecting the 9‐1-1-Dpb11-Fun30 pathway. Most likely this reflects a 9-1-1-Dpb11-independent mode of recruitment. As we speculate in the paper, Fun30 could be targeted to resected DNA via an RPA interaction (Chen et al., Nature, 2012). We reason that the second pathway may depend on resection, which would explain why Fun30 recruitment in the <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> mutant (which is resection-deficient) is more strongly defective than in the <italic>ddc1-T602A</italic> mutant (which is not resection-deficient, because it also influences Rad9 (our unpublished data). Importantly, however, the <italic>fun30-SSAA</italic> mutant is as defective in resection as the <italic>fun30Δ</italic> mutant. This suggests that, even though other recruitment mechanisms may exist, it is the 9-1-1-Dpb11-Fun30 pathway, which is essential for efficient DNA end resection.</p></body></sub-article></article>
