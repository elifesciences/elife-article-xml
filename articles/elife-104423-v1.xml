potential therapeutic targets for immune modulation. In this study, we focused on the regulatory role of glycolytic enzymes in Tregs and identified phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) as being differentially overexpressed in Tregs and associated with a highly suppressive phenotype. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM reduced Treg differentiation and suppressive function while reciprocally inducing markers of a pro-inflammatory, T helper 17 (Th17)-like state. The regulatory role of PGAM was dependent on the contribution of 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PG), the PGAM substrate, to de novo serine synthesis. Blocking de novo serine synthesis from 3 PG reversed the effect of PGAM inhibition on Treg polarization, while exogenous serine directly inhibited Treg polarization. Additionally, altering serine levels in vivo with a serine/glycine-free diet increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated autoimmunity in a murine model of multiple sclerosis. Mechanistically, we found that serine limits Treg polarization by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and methylation of Treg-associated genes. Inhibiting one-carbon metabolism increased Treg polarization and suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo in a murine model of autoimmune colitis. Our study identifies a novel physiologic role for PGAM and highlights the metabolic interconnectivity between glycolysis, serine synthesis, one-carbon metabolism, and epigenetic regulation of Treg differentiation and suppressive function.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>immunometabolism</kwd><kwd>T cell biology</kwd><kwd>Treg</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>phosphoglycerate mutase</kwd><kwd>PGAM</kwd><kwd>serine synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08NS104266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kornberg</surname><given-names>Michael D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000910</institution-id><institution>Conrad N.

The regulation of immune responses by metabolic pathways, termed âimmunometabolism,â has become a major focus of research with a goal of identifying pathways that can be therapeutically targeted in conditions ranging from autoimmune and infectious diseases to cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Patel and Powell, 2017</xref>).</p><p>T lymphocytes, in particular, have emerged as a central focus of immunometabolic research with far reaching implications in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chapman and Chi, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geltink et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kelly and OâNeill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kornberg, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">OâNeill et al., 2016</xref>). Among the metabolic adaptations associated with T cell activation, glycolytic reprogramming plays a prominent role. Increased glucose uptake and augmented glycolysis are critical for the differentiation and effector functions of inflammatory T cell subsets, including effector CD8 cells and T-helper (Th) 1 and Th17 CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frauwirth et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cham and Gajewski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cham et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macintyre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerriets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, regulatory T cells (Tregs), which serve as the brakes of the immune response by promoting tolerance and suppressing inflammation, have a distinct glycolytic profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shi and Chi, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelin et al., 2017</xref>). Prior work has shown that initial engagement of glycolysis supports proliferation and migration of Tregs, whereas downregulation of glycolysis and greater engagement of fatty acid oxidation are required for expression of the Treg-specific transcription factor FOXP3 and Treg suppressive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kishore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gerriets et al., 2016</xref>). In this regard, forced engagement of glycolysis was found to decrease FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wei et al., 2016</xref>) while inhibition of glycolysis favored Treg differentiation and suppressive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scherlinger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornberg et al., 2018</xref>). The relationship between glycolysis and Treg function is not straightforward, however. For instance, in human Tregs induced following weak stimulation of the T cell receptor (TCR), glycolysis supported Treg suppressive function by regulating DNA-binding activity of the glycolytic enzyme enolase-1 (ENO1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Rosa et al., 2015</xref>). Such findings suggest the possibility of a more nuanced role for glycolysis in Tregs, with individual glycolytic enzymes serving unique and perhaps disparate functions.</p><p>Here, we report that the glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM), which converts 3-phosphoglycerate (3 PG) to 2-phosphoglycerate (2 PG), is physiologically upregulated in Tregs and its enzymatic activity supports FOXP3 expression and Treg suppressive function. Pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of PGAM inhibited Treg differentiation and shifted CD4 T cells toward a pro-inflammatory, Th17-like state. Mechanistically, we found that PGAM regulates Treg differentiation by controlling flux through the de novo serine synthesis pathway. The PGAM substrate 3 PG is also utilized for serine synthesis, and decreased PGAM enzyme activity led to increased serine synthesis through the accumulation of 3 PG. Both newly synthesized and imported extracellular serine inhibited Treg differentiation by contributing to one-carbon metabolism and promoting the methylation, and therefore silencing, of genes associated with Treg function. Manipulation of serine availability and the methylation cycle increased peripheral Tregs and attenuated disease in mouse models of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune colitis. Our finding that PGAM, a key glycolytic enzyme, physiologically supports Treg differentiation further challenges the notion that glycolysis plays a singular, inhibitory role in Tregs and suggests that individual glycolytic enzymes can serve as nodes for the fine-tuning of immune responses. Furthermore, our work identifies novel metabolic targets for the therapeutic manipulation of Treg function in human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PGAM regulates Treg differentiation and suppressive function</title><p>In order to identify the glycolytic enzymes that play the largest role in Treg differentiation, we analyzed multiple publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic datasets.

We, therefore, wondered whether PGAM inhibition impacts Treg differentiation. To answer this question, we used epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a known inhibitor of PGAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2017</xref>). We cultured naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions with either vehicle (solvent alone) or EGCG and assessed Treg differentiation by quantifying the percentage of CD25<sup>+</sup>FOXP3<sup>+</sup> cells by flow cytometry after 96 hr. Treatment with EGCG significantly reduced Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) without affecting proliferation or cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). To validate the effects of pharmacologic inhibition with genetic knockdown, we utilized antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting <italic>Pgam</italic> isoforms to reduce gene expression. Experiments conducted with fluorescently-tagged ASOs demonstrated near-complete ASO uptake by cultured CD4 cells after 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to scrambled control ASOs, we found that ASOs targeting <italic>Pgam</italic> reduced PGAM1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>) and significantly reduced Treg differentiation assessed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Because glycolysis is crucial for cell health, we wanted to know if PGAM knockdown was affecting survival and/or proliferation. We found that <italic>Pgam</italic> ASOs did not affect cell survival and led to a minor increase in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>To gain further insights into the effects of PGAM knockdown on Treg differentiation, we performed RNA-seq transcriptional profiling from unsorted naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells cultured under Treg polarizing conditions with either scrambled or <italic>Pgam</italic>-specific ASOs. PCA analysis showed that <italic>Pgam</italic> ASOs led to major transcriptional changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), with major effects on MYC targets and mTORC1 signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), among other changes. We then performed differential expression analysis on a subset of genes important in the Treg-Th17 axis and found that cells treated with <italic>Pgam</italic> ASOs had significantly higher expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as <italic>Il17</italic>, <italic>Il22</italic>, and <italic>Il9</italic>, while significantly lower expression of genes involved in Treg differentiation such as <italic>Foxp3</italic> and <italic>Izkf3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). A complete list of differentially expressed genes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>Given the observed changes in transcriptional profile and differentiation markers, we next asked whether PGAM knockdown leads to functional changes in Treg suppressive activity. Compared to treatment with scrambled ASOs, <italic>Pgam</italic> ASO-treated Tregs were less effective at suppressing effector T (Teff) cell proliferation, indicating diminished suppressive function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). To determine whether PGAM expression is associated with Treg suppressive activity in human disease, we examined a published scRNA-seq dataset of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TIL-Tregs) isolated from surgically resected non-small cell lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dykema et al., 2023</xref>). Among the 10 distinct subsets of TIL-Tregs identified in this study, one subset, the OX40<sup>hi</sup>GITR<sup>hi</sup> cluster [termed âActivated (1)â by the authors] had markedly increased suppressive activity and was enriched in patients who were resistant to immune checkpoint blockade. Strikingly, <italic>PGAM1</italic> was significantly overexpressed in the highly suppressive OX40<sup>hi</sup>GITR<sup>hi</sup> cluster compared to the 9 other TIL-Treg subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Moreover, <italic>PGAM1</italic> expression was selectively increased in this subset relative to proximal, rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes, suggesting a unique association between PGAM expression and Treg suppressive activity.</p><p>Taken together, these findings demonstrate a critical role for PGAM in promoting Treg differentiation and suppressive function, in vitro as well as in healthy and diseased human states. The positive regulatory role of PGAM in Tregs was intriguing, since glycolysis has generally been associated with decreased Treg function. Indeed, whereas inhibition or knockdown of PGAM led to decreased Treg differentiation, our own prior work found that similar inhibition of GAPDH, which catalyzes a reaction only two steps upstream from PGAM in glycolysis, had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornberg et al., 2018</xref>) â a finding we replicated here with the GAPDH inhibitor koningic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the ratio of <italic>PGAM1</italic> to <italic>GAPDH</italic> mRNA levels increased in human iTregs vs. Th0 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>), and PGAM2 protein levels increased out of proportion to GAPDH (and other glycolytic enzymes) in ex vivo Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Similarly, a review of published data from the ImmPres immunological proteome resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://immpres.co.uk/">http://immpres.co.uk/</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brenes et al., 2023</xref>) shows increased PGAM1/GAPDH protein copy number ratio in murine iTregs versus Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>), further implicating a specific role for PGAM in the Treg-Th17 axis. The discordant roles of GAPDH and PGAM in Tregs led us to focus on the glycolytic metabolites downstream of GAPDH and upstream of PGAM, as the concentrations of these metabolites would be differentially impacted by the two enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phosphoglycerate mutase (PGAM) regulates Treg differentiation through control of de novo serine synthesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic diagram of the intersection of glycolysis and the de novo serine synthesis pathway via the PGAM substrate 3 PG.

In addition to its role in glycolysis, 3 PG is the starting substrate for the de novo serine synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lunt and Vander Heiden, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2023</xref>). Given previous work implicating various roles for serine in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ron-Harel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ma et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurniawan et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesized that PGAM enzymatic activity regulates Treg differentiation and function by controlling levels of 3 PG with downstream effects on serine synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we first cultured naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions with either vehicle or the PGAM inhibitor EGCG and measured intracellular serine levels from unsorted cells by mass spectrometry. As anticipated, PGAM inhibition with EGCG increased intracellular levels of serine in Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We next asked whether glucose-derived de novo serine synthesis is physiologically regulated during Treg differentiation, focusing on the reciprocal Treg-Th17 axis. Following incubation with uniformly 13-carbon labeled glucose (U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose), serine that is newly synthesized from 3 PG has a mass shift of 3 (M+3) when analyzed by mass spectrometry, whereas unlabeled, non-glucose-derived serine has no mass shift (M+0). We differentiated naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells into either Tregs or Th17 cells for 72 hr. After 6 hr glucose starvation, the cells were incubated with U<sup>13</sup>C-glucose for an additional 6 hr. Using mass spectrometry, we found that <sup>13</sup>C-labeling of serine was significantly higher in Th17 cells compared to Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that flux through de novo serine synthesis is physiologically downregulated in Tregs compared to Th17 cells. Because serine can be recycled via one-carbon metabolism, we observed an increase in one-carbon-labeled (M+1) serine as well as M+3 serine in Th17 cells relative to Treg cells.</p><p>If the role of PGAM in Treg differentiation depends on de novo serine synthesis, then the effects of PGAM inhibition should be rescued by simultaneously blocking the serine synthesis pathway. To this end, we cultured naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions and treated them with the PGAM inhibitor EGCG Â±NCT-503, an inhibitor of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH, the rate-limiting enzyme of serine synthesis from 3 PG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bojkova et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pacold et al., 2016</xref>). As before, PGAM inhibition with EGCG inhibited Treg differentiation as assessed by FOXP3 expression, but this was reversed by PHGDH inhibition with NCT-503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Similarly, if PGAM regulates Tregs by controlling concentrations of 3 PG (the substrate for serine synthesis), then direct supplementation of 3 PG should replicate the effects of PGAM inhibition. To test this, 3 PG was delivered to naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells via electroporation, followed by Treg polarization. As expected, 3 PG supplementation decreased FOXP3 expression, which was rescued by PHGDH inhibition with NCT-503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To further validate the role of de novo serine synthesis in Tregs, we used <italic>Phgdh</italic>-targeted ASOs and found that genetic knockdown of PHGDH led to augmented Treg differentiation as assessed by FOXP3 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>The above findings demonstrate that PGAM regulates Treg differentiation by controlling flux through the serine synthesis pathway. Because serine can be derived from both de novo intracellular synthesis and extracellular sources, we next asked whether extracellular serine also affects Treg differentiation. We cultured naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells under Treg polarizing conditions in either serine/glycine-free media or serine/glycine-free media supplemented with 4 mM serine. Deprivation of both serine and glycine is required to evaluate the role of extracellular serine, as glycine can be converted to serine via the enzyme serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2023</xref>). The presence of extracellular serine diminished Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), indicating that both synthesized and exogenous serine impact Treg generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synthesized and dietary serine regulate Treg function in vivo</title><p>After finding that serine derived from both extracellular sources and de novo synthesis inhibits Treg polarization in vitro, we investigated the effect on Tregs of altering serine availability in vivo.

Autoimmunity occurs when Tregs fail to adequately regulate the immune response, so we wondered whether the predicted rate of de novo serine synthesis would be altered in Tregs derived from patients with autoimmune disease.

Because methionine can compensate as a one-carbon donor, other groups have found that the contribution of serine to one-carbon metabolism is greater in the absence of methionine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maddocks et al., 2016</xref>).

We, therefore, asked whether serine entry into one-carbon metabolism contributes to DNA methylation in Tregs, so we conducted a carbon tracing experiment in which Tregs were cultured in media containing uniformly 13-carbon-labeled serine (U<sup>13</sup>C-serine) for 12 hr before DNA was isolated from the unsorted cells and analyzed by mass spectrometry. We found that serine directly contributed to cytosine methylation, as measured by carbon labeling of methylcytosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Demethylation of the Treg-specific demethylated region (TSDR) in Tregs is a critical step for the generation of stable, bona fide Tregs, and methylation in this region is associated with transient or unstable expression of FOXP3 and suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Polansky et al., 2008</xref>). We, therefore, investigated the effects of extracellular serine and PGAM knockdown on methylation of the TSDR via pyrosequencing. In a first set of experiments, naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells were cultured under Treg polarizing conditions in either serine/glycine-free media or media containing serine. The presence of extracellular serine increased TSDR methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Genetic knockdown of PGAM using ASOs similarly increased TSDR methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that both extracellular serine and PGAM-regulated serine synthesis increase the methylation, and therefore silencing, of Treg-associated genes.</p><p>Given the promising results seen with pyrosequencing, we next used a next generation sequencing panel to identify CpG sites in Treg-specific genes whose methylation is regulated by serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Methylation of <italic>Ikzf2</italic> (Helios) was significantly increased with the addition of extracellular serine, but this was reversed by blocking serine entry into one-carbon metabolism with the SHMT inhibitor SHIN1. In the 5â upstream region of the <italic>Foxp3</italic> gene, one CpG site showed significantly higher methylation in the presence of serine, and this effect was reversed by SHIN1. A complete list of CpG methylation levels can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p><p>To definitively link methylation to Treg differentiation and suppressive function, we blocked methylation in Tregs with 3-Deazaadenosine (3DZA), an inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) hydrolase. SAH hydrolase degrades SAH and prevents recycling of the methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jeong et al., 1999</xref>). In naÃ¯ve murine CD4 cells cultured under Treg polarizing conditions, 3DZA increased Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>) without affecting cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Treatment with 3DZA similarly augmented suppressive function in cultured murine Tregs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). To determine the in vivo relevance of these findings, we used an adoptive transfer RAG colitis mouse model. Conventional murine CD4 cells were activated ex vivo and injected into RAG<sup>-/-</sup> mice to induce colitis, along with simultaneous injection of Tregs that had been treated during differentiation with either vehicle or 3DZA. Mice injected with Tregs polarized in the presence of 3DZA had less severe disease as measured by weight loss and colonic damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), indicating greater Treg suppressive function. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that one-carbon metabolism and methylation impair Treg differentiation and suppressive function both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that PGAM plays a key physiologic role in Treg differentiation and suppressive function through regulation of serine synthesis, which intersects with glycolysis immediately upstream of PGAM through the shared substrate 3 PG. Analysis of published datasets revealed that PGAM expression is specifically increased within human Tregs at both transcriptional and protein levels, and further that PGAM expression is enriched in highly suppressive Treg phenotypes. Pharmacologic inhibition or genetic knockdown of PGAM reduced Treg polarization and suppressive function while promoting a pro-inflammatory gene signature. These effects were replicated by exogenous supplementation of 3 PG and reversed by inhibition of serine synthesis. Single-cell flux estimation analysis predicted increased serine synthesis in Tregs isolated from patients suffering from autoimmune disease and decreased serine flux in tumor-associated Tregs, underlining the clinical importance of this regulatory pathway. Consistent with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurniawan et al., 2020</xref>), we found that both synthesized and exogenously imported serine impact Treg function. Mechanistically, serine inhibited Treg polarization by increasing flux through one-carbon metabolism with downstream effects on DNA methylation of Treg-related genes. Interfering with serine availability or methylation attenuated disease in in vivo models of autoimmunity.</p><p>The surprising role of PGAM in Treg differentiation has both physiologic and therapeutic implications. Although glycolysis has been shown to support initial proliferation and migration of Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kishore et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">De Rosa et al., 2015</xref>), most prior work has suggested that glycolytic flux supports effector T cell functions with concomitant downregulation of Treg stability and suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerriets et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Michalek et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Macintyre et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, previous studies have shown Tregs to depend on fatty acid oxidation and oxidative phosphorylation, largely independent of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angelin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berod et al., 2014</xref>). Our own prior work found that inhibition of GAPDH, an enzyme two catalytic reactions upstream of PGAM in glycolysis, enhances Treg differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kornberg et al., 2018</xref>), with similar findings observed following inhibition or knockdown of other proximal glycolytic enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scherlinger et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tanimine et al., 2019</xref>). It is striking, therefore, that PGAM enzymatic activity has the opposite effect. Inhibition or knockdown of PGAM not only attenuated Treg differentiation and suppressive function but reciprocally enhanced markers of a pro-inflammatory, Th17-like phenotype, implicating PGAM as a physiologic regulator of the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory lymphocyte responses via regulation of serine synthesis. These findings suggest that glycolytic regulation of immunity is more complex than previously appreciated, supporting a more granular view in which glycolytic enzymes can serve as independent regulatory nodes for the fine-tuning of immune responses. Our data suggest that these differential effects of glycolytic enzymes might be mediated by fine control of the metabolites whose concentrations they regulate, such as 3 PG in the case of PGAM.</p><p>From a therapeutic perspective, our findings identify novel targets for modulating Treg function in disease. Substantial prior work has shown that manipulation of glycolysis and other metabolic pathways has a therapeutic window for systemic administration despite the ubiquity of these pathways in cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Patel et al., 2019</xref>). Nonetheless, systemic administration may not be necessary for several key therapeutic applications, for instance, optimization of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McPhedran et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nanjireddy et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2024</xref>). Differentiation of CAR-T cells into a Treg-like state correlates with failure of CAR-T therapy in B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Good et al., 2022</xref>), such that manipulation of PGAM and downstream serine metabolism and DNA methylation is a potential strategy for improving the anti-cancer fitness of CAR-T cells ex vivo prior to infusion. Conversely, CAR-Tregs are currently in clinical trials for a variety of autoimmune disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraham et al., 2023</xref>), and there is widespread interest in treatments that improve the suppressive activity of Tregs.</p><p>Of note, a prior study reported that complete knockout of PGAM1 in T cells impaired differentiation and effector functions of pro-inflammatory T cell subsets with only a mild impact on Treg generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toriyama et al., 2020</xref>). However, complete knockout of a glycolytic enzyme would be expected to abrogate glycolytic flux entirely, with wide-ranging effects (including decreased energy production) likely to mask the impact of physiologic or therapeutic modulation of enzyme function. As we showed here, partial knockdown or pharmacologic inhibition of PGAM1, which decreases but does not fully abrogate enzymatic activity, substantially reduced Treg differentiation while supporting pro-inflammatory activation. Additionally, other groups studying glycolysis in cancer used partial knockdowns to show that PGAM supports tumor proliferation by controlling flux through the de novo serine synthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Itoyama et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Our investigation focused on the contribution of one-carbon metabolism to DNA methylation, which is particularly relevant in Tregs given the established regulatory role of methylation of Treg-specific genes, including the Treg Specific Demethylated Region (TSDR) of the FOXP3 gene locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zafari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Toker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kressler et al., 2020</xref>). However, one-carbon metabolism contributes to many cellular processes, including purine synthesis, amino acid metabolism, and phospholipid synthesis, among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mentch and Locasale, 2016</xref>), so it is likely that one-carbon metabolism inhibits Treg differentiation in a variety of ways. Although other groups have also identified the importance of one-carbon metabolism in Treg generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sugiura et al., 2022</xref>), we describe novel links between glycolysis, serine synthesis, and DNA methylation as a regulatory pathway of Treg differentiation.</p><p>In summary, we have found an unexpected role of PGAM that adds further nuance to the complex relationship between glycolysis and Treg function and further implicates serine and its contributions to one-carbon metabolism and DNA methylation as key regulators of Treg differentiation. In addition to yielding new biological insights into the metabolic regulation of lymphocyte fate and function, these findings point to new strategies for the therapeutic manipulation of Treg function.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>PGAM1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 5223</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Pgam1</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 18648</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, male and female)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J wild-type</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat #

They were then stained with anti-CD25 (BV785) for 30 min. Cells were then washed with Flow Wash buffer two times and fixed with FoxP3 fixation/permeabilization buffer following the manufacturerâs recommended protocol. Intracellular staining was performed with conjugated antibodies (1:200) against the specified proteins in permeabilization buffer for 1 hr, washed twice, and then analyzed cells with a Cytek Aurora Flow cytometer. Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-4"><title>Treg suppression assay</title><p>To generate Tregs for the Treg suppression assay, naÃ¯ve CD4 T cells were cultured for 4 days under Treg polarizing conditions. Then, total CD4 + T cells were isolated from murine spleens using Biolegend Mojo CD4 T cell isolation kit (480006) and labelled with Cell Proliferation Dye (eBioscience, #65-0842-85) by incubating in a 1:2000 dilution (PBS) for 10 min, washing 1 X with PBS, and then washing 2 X with complete RPMI. CD4 + T cells were cultured as described above (3 ug/mL anti-CD3, 3 ug/mL anti-CD28, 10 ng/mL recombinant murine IL-2) with varying ratios of Treg:T effector cells. Divisions were counted by measuring cell proliferation dye dilutions with flow cytometry after a 3 day culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-5"><title>Mouse peripheral blood samples</title><p>Mice were fed either a serine/glycine-free diet or a control diet (Animal Specialty and Provisions, 1812281 and 1817070â209) for 8 weeks immediately post-weaning and peripheral blood samples were obtained via cheek bleed into a microfuge tube coated with heparin/EDTA. RBCs were lysed with RBC lysis buffer for 7 min and then the reaction was stopped with HBSS (including Calcium and Magnesium). Cells were then stained with Zombie NIR (1:1000) and anti-CD16/32 (1:200) for 10 min, then stained with anti-CD45, anti-CD11b, and anti-CD4 for 30 min. Staining then proceeded as described in the flow cytometry section.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-6"><title>Mass spectrometry</title><p>Sample preparation for steady-state measurement of serine involved culturing CD4 T cells for 72 hr under Treg polarizing conditions, followed by treatment with the indicated drugs for 24 hr. The cells were collected, washed with PBS, and equal number of cells per condition were pelleted and flash-frozen. The frozen cell pellets were shipped to the Metabolomics Core at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. The cells were then resuspended in a 500 Î¼l mixture of 1:1 water/methanol, sonicated for 1 min (two 30 s pulses), and mixed with 450 Î¼l of ice-cold chloroform. The resulting homogenate was combined with 150 Î¼l of ice-cold water, vortexed for 5 min, incubated at â20 Â°C for 30 min, and centrifuged at 4 Â°C for 10 min to partition the aqueous and organic layers. The combined layers were dried at 37 Â°C for 45 min in a SpeedVac system (Genevac EZ Solvent Evaporator, SP Industries, Inc). The extract was reconstituted in a 500 Î¼l solution of methanol/water (1:1) and filtered through a 3 kDa molecular filter (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 3 kDa MWCO, Millipore Sigma) at 4 Â°C for 90 min to remove proteins. The filtrate was dried at 37 Â°C for 90 min in a SpeedVac and stored at â80 Â°C until mass spectrometric analysis. Prior to mass spectrometric analysis, the dried extract was resuspended in methanol/water (1:1).</p><p>For amino acid flux analysis, CD4 T cells were cultured for 6 hr in glucose-free media, then 12 mM U13C-glucose was added for 6 hr. The cells were resuspended in a 500 Î¼l mixture of 1:1 water/methanol, sonicated for 1 min (two 30 s pulses), centrifuged at 4 Â°C for 10 min, and filtered through a 3 kDa molecular filter (Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter, 3 kDa MWCO, Millipore Sigma) at 4 Â°C for 90 min to remove proteins. The samples were dried at 37 Â°C for 45 min in a SpeedVac system (Genevac EZ Solvent Evaporator, SP Industries, Inc). Prior to mass spectrometry analysis, the dried extract was resuspended in methanol/water (1:1).</p><p>CD4 T cells were cultured under Treg polarizing conditions in serine-free media to measure methylcytosine flux, followed by the addition of either normal serine or 13C3-serine for 12 hr. The cells were harvested, the pellets were washed, and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood &amp; Tissue Kit. DNA was quantified with a Nanodrop, and all samples were normalized based on total DNA content before mass spectrometry analysis. The details of the DNA hydrolysis methods were previously described (PMID: 27158554). DNA was denatured at 100 Â°C for 3 min, incubated with ammonium acetate and nuclease P1, then mixed and incubated with venom phosphodiesterase I, followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase. The details of the liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods were also described earlier (PMID: 27158554).</p><p>For the LC-MS analysis method for serine steady state and tracing study of serine and methylcytosine, chromatographic separation of extracted metabolites, including serine, was performed through Hydrophilic Interaction Chromatography (HILIC) using an XBridge Amide column (3.5 Âµm, 4.6Ã100 mm, Waters, Milford, MA) in ESI-positive ionization mode. Solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and Solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) were used for chromatographic separation (Ref). The data were acquired via multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using a 6495 Triple Quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled to an HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) through Agilent Mass Hunter Data Acquisition Software (ver. 10.1) (PMID: 31360899, PMID: 30642841). The acquired mass spectra were analyzed and integrated into each targeted compound peak using Agilent Mass Hunter Quantitative Analysis Software. For serine measurement, peak areas were normalized with a spiked internal standard. Differential metabolites were determined using p-values from t-tests following the Benjamini-Hochberg method, with a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.25. For serine and methylcytosine tracing studies, the percentage of 13 C incorporation was calculated using Microsoft Excel from peak areas and represented as bar graphs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-7"><title>EAE induction and scoring</title><p>Active EAE was induced in female and male C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abramson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gharibani et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Godfrey et al., 2022</xref>) (10 weeks old) after pretreatment with either serine/glycine-free diet or control diet (Animal Specialty and Provisions, 1812281 and 1817070â209) for 1 week. MOG<sub>35 â 55</sub> peptide dissolved in PBS at a concentration of 2 mg/mL was mixed 1:1 with complete Freundâs adjuvant (8 mg/ml Tuberculin toxin in incomplete Freundâs adjuvant), then mixed for 12 min into an emulsion. On day 0, mice were immunized by injecting 75 Î¼l of the emulsion subcutaneously into each of two sites on the lateral abdomen. In addition, on day 0 and again on day 2, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 375 ng pertussis toxin. Scoring was performed by a blinded individual according to the following scale: 0, no clinical deficit; 0.5, partial loss of tail tone; 1.0, complete tail paralysis or both partial loss of tail tone plus awkward gait; 1.5, complete tail paralysis and awkward gait; 2.0, tail paralysis with hind limb weakness evidenced by foot dropping between bars of cage lid while walking; 2.5, hind limb paralysis with little to no weight-bearing on hind limbs (dragging), but with some movement possible in legs; 3.0, complete hind limb paralysis with no movement in lower limbs; 3.5, hind limb paralysis with some weakness in forelimbs; 4.0, complete tetraplegia but with some movement of head; 4.5, moribund; and 5.0, dead.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-8"><title>RNA-seq</title><p>For all experiments, RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Plus Kit.

Briefly, cell pellets were lysed based on the total cell count per sample and total volume received using M-digestion Buffer (ZymoResearch; Irvine, CA; cat# D5021-9) and 5â10 ÂµL of protease K (20 mg/mL), with a final M-digestion concentration of 1 X. The samples were incubated at 65 Â°C for a minimum of 2 hr. For bisulfite modification, 20 ÂµL of the supernatant from the sample extracts was bisulfite modified using the EZ-96 DNA Methylation-Direct Kit (ZymoResearch; Irvine, CA; cat# D5023) as per the manufacturerâs protocol. The bisulfite-modified DNA samples were eluted using Melution buffer in 46 ÂµL. For Multiplex PCR, all bisulfite-modified DNA samples were amplified using separate multiplex or simplex PCRs. PCRs included 0.5 units of HotStarTaq (Qiagen; Hilden, Germany; cat# 203205), 0.2 ÂµM primers, and 3 ÂµL of bisulfite-treated DNA in a 20 ÂµL reaction. All PCR products were verified using the Qiagen QIAxcel Advanced System (v1.0.6). Prior to library preparation, PCR products from the same sample were pooled and then purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit columns or plates (cat# 28106 or 28183). The PCR cycling conditions were: 95 Â°C 15 min; 45 x (95 Â°C 30 s; TaÂ°C 30 s; 68 Â°C 30 s); 68 Â°C 5 min; 4 Â°C â. Samples were run alongside established reference DNA samples with a range of methylation. They were created by mixing high- and low-methylated DNA to obtain samples with 0, 50, and 100% methylation. The high-methylated DNA was in vitro enzymatically methylated genomic DNA with &gt;85% methylation. The low-methylated DNA was chemically and enzymatically treated with &lt;5% methylation. They were first tested on numerous gene-specific and global methylation assays using pyrosequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-11"><title>Methylation sequencing</title><p>Libraries were prepared using a custom Library Preparation method created by EpigenDx. Next, library molecules were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA; cat# A63882). Barcoded samples were then pooled in an equimolar fashion before template preparation and enrichment were performed on the Ion Chef system using Ion 520 &amp; Ion 530 ExT Chef reagents (Thermo Fisher; Waltham, MA; cat# A30670). Following this, enriched, template-positive library molecules were sequenced on the Ion S5 sequencer using an Ion 530 sequencing chip (cat# A27764). FASTQ files from the Ion Torrent S5 server were aligned to a local reference database using the open-source Bismark Bisulfite Read Mapper program (v0.12.2) with the Bowtie2 alignment algorithm (v2.2.3). Methylation levels were calculated in Bismark by dividing the number of methylated reads by the total number of reads. An R-squared value (RSQ) was previously calculated from controls set at known methylation levels to test for PCR bias.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-12"><title>T-cell transfer model of inflammatory bowel disease</title><p>To induce autoimmune colitis, CD4 T cells were transferred into RAG-knockout mice (Jackson Laboratories #002216).

We appreciate their comment that the number of approaches taken to test our hypothesis represents a strength that increases confidence in the conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Using publicly available transcriptomic and proteomic data of human T cells, the authors claim that both ex vivo and in vitro polarized Tregs express higher levels of PGAM1 protein compared to CD4 T cells (naÃ¯ve or cultured under Th0 polarizing conditions). The experiments shown in this paper have all been carried out in murine Tregs. Publicly available resources for murine data (ImmGen -RNAseq and ImmPRes - Proteomics) however show that Tregs do not express higher PGAM1 (mRNA and protein) compared to CD4 T cells. It would be good to verify this in the system/condition used in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair comment. Although our pharmacologic and genetic studies demonstrated the importance of PGAM in Treg differentiation and suppressive function in murine cells, thereby corroborating the hypothesis formed based on human CD4 cell expression data, we agree that investigating PGAM expression in murine Tregs is important in the context of our work. In reviewing the ImmPres proteomics database, the reviewer is correct that PGAM1 expression was not higher in iTregs compared to other subsets, including Th17 cells. However, when compared to other glycolytic enzymes, expression of PGAM1 increases out of proportion in iTregs. In particular, the ratio of PGAM1 to GAPDH expression is much greater in iTregs compared to Th17 cells. This data is now shown in the revised Figure S5. The disproportionate increase in PGAM1 expression is consistent with the regulatory role of PGAM in the Treg-Th17 axis via modulation of 3PG concentrations, a metabolite that lies between GAPDH and PGAM in the glycolytic pathway. The divergent expression changes between GAPDH and PGAM furthermore support the conclusion that GAPDH and PGAM play opposite roles in Treg differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would also be good to assess the levels of both PGAM1 mRNA and protein in Tregs PGAM1 knockdown compared to scramble using different methods e.g. qPCR and western blot. However, due to the high levels of cell death and differentiation variability, that would require cells to be sorted.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. As noted by the reviewer, assessing PGAM1 expression via qPCR and Western blot would require cell sorting, which we do not currently have the resources to pursue. However, we measured the effect of ASOs on PGAM1 protein expression using anti-PGAM1 antibody via flow cytometry, which allowed gating on viable cells. As shown in Figure S3A, PGAM-targeted ASOs led to an approximately 40% decrease in PGAM1 expression, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). Furthermore, we now show in revised Figure S2 that ASO uptake was near-complete in our cultured CD4 cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is not specified anywhere in the paper whether cells were sorted for bulk experiments. Based on the variability of cell differentiation, it would be good if this was mentioned in the paper as it could help to interpret the data with a different perspective.</p></disp-quote><p>Cells were not sorted for bulk experiments. In the revised manuscript, this point is made clear in the text, figure legends, and Methods. It is worth noting that all bulk experiments were conducted on samples with greater than 70% cell viability (greater than 90% for stable isotope tracing studies).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have tried to determine the regulatory role of Phosphoglycerate mutate (PGAM), an enzyme involved in converting 3-phosphoglycerate to 2-phosphoglycerate in glycolysis, in differentiation and suppressive function of regulatory CD4 T cells through de novo serine synthesis.

Unfortunately, despite attempting several methods, we were unable to consistently induce overexpression of PGAM1 in our primary T cell cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>I would suggest increasing the font size for flow cytometry gates. Percentages are the focus of the analysis, and it is very hard to read any.</p></disp-quote><p>We have increased the font size on all flow cytometry gates, as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, most of the flow data show Tregs polarization based on CD25 and FOXP3 expression. However, Figure 3 A, Figure 4D and Figure S3 show Tregs polarization based on FSC and Foxp3. Is there any reason for this?</p></disp-quote><p>Antibody staining against CD25 was poor in the experiments noted, which is why Foxp3 alone was used to identify Treg cells in these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Especially for Figure 3A, other cells could also express Foxp3 making interpretation difficult.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair comment. With respect to Figures 4D and S3 (now revised Figure S4), these experiments were conducted in isolated CD4 cells, in which the population of CD25-Foxp3+ cells is minimal following Treg polarization (as evident in our other figures). Regarding Figure 3A, previous work has found minimal expression of Foxp3 in circulating non-T cells (Devaud et al., 2014, PMID 25063364), such that we have confidence the identified Foxp3 expressing cells are, in fact, Treg cells. Notably, Figure 3A was already gated on CD4+ T cells, and in the periphery of wild-type mice, these would be reasonably referred to as Tregs, although this does not apply to diseased states or specific cases such as the tumor microenvironment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The level of murine Tregs differentiation varies a lot among experiments. The % of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ is ranging from 14% to 77% (controls). It would be good to understand and verify why such differentiation variability.</p></disp-quote><p>For most of our Treg polarization experiments, % differentiation in the control group falls within the 35 â 55% range. We found that treatment with ASOs (even scrambled control ASOs) tended to decrease Treg polarization overall, leading to lower numbers of Foxp3 expression in these experiments. Differentiation was similarly low in a few experiments that did not involve the use of ASOs, which we believe was caused by batch variability in the recombinant TGF-b that was used for polarization. Despite this variability, experiments were conducted with sufficient independent experiments and biological replicates to observe consistent trends and to have confidence in the results, as corroborated by statistical testing and the wide variety of experimental approaches used to verify our conclusions. Notably controls were run in every experiment, allowing accurate comparisons to be made in each individual experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similar comments apply to the level of cell death observed in the cultures of polarizing Tregs.</p></disp-quote><p>Although there was some variability in cell viability between experiments, flow cytometry experiments were always gated on live cells, and we believe concerns about reproducibility are substantially mitigated by the number of independent experiments, biological replicates, and distinct experimental approaches used for verification of the experimental findings. For all bulk experiments, cell viability was greater than 70% and equal across samples. For the flux studies, viability was greater than 90% and equal across samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 B and D: EGCG has been used at two different concentrations. Is it lower in Figure 2D because of one condition being a combination of inhibitors or is it a typo?</p></disp-quote><p>The doses stated in the original legend are correct. Yes, drug doses were optimized for combination-treatment experiments. This point is now clarified in the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2G: The description in the results does not match figure legend - Text - serine/glycine-free media or control (serine/glycine-containing) media; figure legend - serine/glycine-free media or media containing 4 mM serine.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this discrepancy, which was an error in the text. The two conditions used were (1) serine/glycine-free media, and (2) serine/glycine-free media supplemented with 4 mM serine. The text and figure legend have both been updated to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 F and G: the graphs do not show the individual points.</p></disp-quote><p>Individual points were not shown in these graphs because they are derived from scRNA-seq data, with SCFEA calculated from individual cells. As such, there are far too many data points to display all individual values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>CD4+ T-cell isolation and culture: cells were cultured in 50%RPMI and 50% AIM-V.</p><p>I thought that AIM-V medium was intended to be for human cultures. Could some of the conditions explain the low level of differentiation observed in some experiments? If there is such variability it might be because the conditions used are not optimal and therefore not reproducible.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this critique. Although AIM-V media is often used for ex vivo human T cell cultures, it can similarly be used for mouse T cell culture with the addition of b-mercaptoethanol, as suggested by ThermoFisher and as used in prior publications, such as PMID 36947105. As outlined in the responses above, the differentiation we observed was consistent in most experiments, with some variability based on experimental conditions (such as lower differentiation in the setting of ASO treatment). Furthermore, we believe the number of independent experiments, biological replicates, and independent experimental approaches used in the study supports the reproducibility of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures S1 A, S2 B, and S4: the flow data are shown using both heights (FSC) and area (zombie NIR dye). It would be better to use areas for both parameters.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, areas are now used on both the x- and y-axes for these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure S1 B and S2 C: The bar graphs are both showing proliferation index, however, the graphs are labelled differently in the two figures and in the legend (proliferation index -Fig S1 B; division index -Fig S2 C and replication index in the legend of Fig S2 C). The explanation of how the index has been calculated should probably go in the legend of the first figure that shows it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. In the revised manuscript, we have ensured consistency in the terminology (âproliferation indexâ is now used consistently), and the explanation of the proliferation index calculation is now included in the legend to Figure S1, where the proliferation index first appears.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Were Tregs PGAM1 KD used for RNAseq sorted or not? Based on the plots shown in Figure S2 B there is ~ 50% death which needs to be taken into consideration for the analysis if not depleted.</p></disp-quote><p>Similar question for all bulk experiments. It is not specified in the methods or figure legends.</p><p>The cells used for RNAseq and other bulk experiments were not sorted. This point is now made clear in the text, figure legends, and Methods. However, cultures were only used for bulk analyses if the viability in those particular experiments was greater than 70%. Given the sensitivity of stable isotope tracing analyses, cultures were only analyzed for those studies if viability was greater than 90%. In these experiments, viability was similar across samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It was mentioned in Figure 1 that the PGAM KD led to transcriptional changes that impacted MYC targets and mTORC1 signalling. It would be good to validate these findings maybe with more targeted experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and agree that validation and further investigation of these critical targets would be worthwhile. However, because of limitations to resources and the fact that these findings are not critical to the main conclusions of the study, we consider these experiments as future directions beyond the scope of the current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Here are a few suggestions and recommendations to improve the research study.</p><p>(1) The authors have used the word 'vehicle' in most of the figures, however, this word is not explained well in the figure legend. The authors may want to clarify to readers whether vehicle is a plasmid or a solvent for control purposes. For example, in Figure 1D, if vehicle is a plasmid, then another sample for vehicle +/-EGCG should be considered for the rigor in results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for identifying this point of confusion. For all drug treatment experiments, vehicle controls consisted of solvent alone without drug. For ASO experiments, the control condition consisted of scrambled ASO. This point is now made clear in the Methods (âDrug and ASO Treatmentsâ section) as well as in the main text. Furthermore, the figure legends and axes have been edited such that âvehicleâ is only used to refer to drug experiments (in which solvent vehicle alone was used as control), and âcontrolâ is used to refer to ASO experiments (in which scrambled ASO served as control).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1H represents the RNAseq data for knockdown of PGAM1. It might be interesting to see similar data for the overexpression of PGAM1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and agree that overexpression of PGAM1 would be an excellent way to complement and further corroborate our findings using PGAM1 knockdown and pharmacologic inhibition. Unfortunately, despite attempting several methods, we were unable to consistently induce overexpression of PGAM1 in our primary T cell cultures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The font in most of the data from flow cytometry experiments (for example 1I) is not legible. Please increase the font size to make it legible.</p></disp-quote><p>Font sizes have been increased.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure S2, PGAM expression was measured by Flow cytometry experiments. A similar experiment using western Blot, the direct measurement of protein expression, will strengthen the evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. As noted in the public reviews, Western blot would require sorting of viable cells, and unfortunately we do not currently have the resources to conduct additional experiments with FACS. However, we respectfully note that assessing protein expression via flow cytometry quantifies protein levels based on antibody binding, similar to Western blot (or in-cell Western blot), while also allowing gating on viable cells. We also note that nearly 100% of cultured CD4 cells took up ASO, as shown in revised Figure S2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 1J, it is mentioned in the text that 10 datasets were studied. a normalized parameter such as overexpression or suppression could be studied with the variance. It will be good to understand the variability in response among different datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the opportunity to clarify this data. This data was taken from a single published dataset (Dykema et al., 2023, PMID 37713507) in which 10 distinct subsets of tumor-infiltrating Tregs (TIL-Tregs) were identified, rather than from 10 distinct datasets. After identifying the Activated (1)/OX40hiGITRhi cluster of TIL-Tregs as a highly suppressive subset that correlates with resistance to immune checkpoint blockade, Dykema et al. compared gene expression in this subset to the bulked collection of the other 9 subsets, and the data shown in Figure 1J is derived from this analysis. As such, the data in Figure 1J is, indeed, a normalized parameter of overexpression, showing overexpression of PGAM1 in this highly suppressive subset versus other subsets, out of proportion to proximal rate-limiting glycolytic enzymes. The main text and figure/figure legend have been edited to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It will be good to rephrase that the roles of PGAM and GAPDH are opposite, this paragraph is confusing since words such as &quot;supporting Treg differentiation&quot; and &quot;augments Treg differentiation&quot; have been used, although the data in S3 and 1D are opposite. Any possible explanation for the opposing roles of PGAM and GAPDH, despite their involvement in the same pathway of glycolysis, can be added to build up the interest of readers. What is the comparison of the expression of GAPDH and PGAM in Figure 1J?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, as we appreciate that the language used in our initial manuscript was confusing. We have edited the main text, in both the Results and Discussion section, in order to clarify this point and provide explanation as suggested. Indeed, our experimental data indicate that GAPDH and PGAM play opposing roles in Treg differentiation; whereas inhibiting GAPDH activity leads to greater Treg differentiation (shown in revised Figure S4 and our previously published work), similarly inhibiting PGAM leads to diminished Treg differentiation. We view this point (that enzymes within the same glycolytic pathway can have divergent roles in T cells) as a primary implication of these findings, with the explanation that individual enzymes within the same pathway can differentially regulate the concentrations of key immunoactive metabolites. In our study, we identified 3PG as a key immunoactive metabolite whose concentration would be differentially impacted by GAPDH activity versus PGAM activity, since it lies downstream of GAPDH but upstream of PGAM.</p><p>To provide further evidence for the opposing roles of GAPDH and PGAM, we analyzed existing datasets. In the revised Figure S5, we show that the PGAM1/GAPDH expression ratio increases in both human and mouse Tregs compared to other CD4 subsets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 2C, what is M+1, M+2 etc. Does it represent the number of hrs? If so, why are the results for 6 hrs are not shown since the study was for 6 hrs? And what is happening with M+2?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this point and apologize for prior confusion. The terminology âM+nâ refers to mass-shift produced by incorporation of 13-carbon. When a metabolite incorporates a single 13-carbon atom, it has a mass-shift of one (M+1), whereas incorporation of three 13-carbon atoms produces a mass-shift of three (M+3). Because we used uniformly 13-carbon labeled glucose, 3PG derived from the labeled glucose will have all three carbons labeled (M+3), as will serine that is newly synthesized from 3PG. Because serine can enter the downstream one-carbon cycle and be recycled, we also see the appearance of recycled serine with a single 13-carbon (M+1). The critical point in Figure 2C is that labeled serine is higher in Th17 versus Treg cells, demonstrating that de novo serine synthesis from glycolysis is greater. The main text has been edited to clarify this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Including the quantification of inhibition and rescuing effect of EDCG and NCT will be helpful to readers.</p></disp-quote><p>The inhibition and rescuing effects of these drugs are quantified in Figures 2D and 2E as they relate to Treg differentiation. The reviewer may be referring to quantification of relative effects on 3PG levels and serine synthesis. If so, we unfortunately do not have the resources to complete these studies, which would require large-scale quantitative mass spectrometry studies or enzyme activity assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figure 2D and 2E: The authors could also experiment with a dose dependence curve on EGCG and NCT on this phenotype for Treg differentiation. That can help understand the balance between serine pathways and glycolysis pathways. Similarly, the dose dependence of 3PG for Figure 2E and comparing it to the kinetic constants of these enzymes involved and cellular concentrations, these details will be helpful to understand the metabolic dynamics, because this phenotype could be an interplay of both 3PG and serine concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion and agree that establishing detailed dose-dependence curves and relating these findings to enzyme kinetics would yield additional insights into the biochemical regulation provided by PGAM and PHGDH. Unfortunately we do not have the resources to pursue these additional studies, which therefore lie beyond the scope of our current work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) Figure 4: Explanation for no effect of methionine supplementation?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We speculate that methionine supplementation had minimal effect because physiologic levels of serine were sufficient to provide basal substrates for the one-carbon cycle. On the other hand, eliminating methionine produced enough of a decrease in one-carbon metabolism to potentiate the effects of excess serine. This point is now briefly addressed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) For direct connection between PGAM and methylation, methylation experiments could be worked out with NCT1 and SHIN1 (as in Figure 4H).</p></disp-quote><p>We very much appreciate this suggestion, which we agree would provide a strong complementary approach. Unfortunately we do not have the resources to pursue these studies currently. However, we believe the increased methylation observed following PGAM knockdown (Figure 4G) as strong evidence that PGAM activity directly modulates methylation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
