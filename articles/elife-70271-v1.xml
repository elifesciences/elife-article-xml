The determinants of feeding responses to stress are unknown, in part because this issue is rarely studied in rodents. We focused our efforts on the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) assay, which uses latency to eat as readout of anxiety-like behavior, but rarely assesses feeding per se. We explored how key variables in experimental paradigms – estrous and diurnal cyclicity, age and duration of social isolation, prandial state, diet palatability, and elevated body weight – influence stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and food intake in male and female C57BL/6J mice. Latency to eat in the novel environment is increased in both sexes across most of the conditions tested, while effects on caloric intake are variable. In the common NSF assay (i.e., lean mice in the light cycle), sex-specific effects of the length of social isolation, and not estrous cyclicity, are the main source of variability. Under conditions that are more physiologically relevant for humans (i.e., overweight mice in the active phase), the novel stress now elicits robust hyperphagia in both sexes . This novel model of stress eating can be used to identify underlying neuroendocrine and neuronal substrates. Moreover, these studies can serve as a framework to integrate cross-disciplinary studies of anxiety and feeding related behaviors in rodents.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In times of heightened anxiety – say, during a global pandemic – many of us will reach for donuts or a particularly appetizing pizza for comfort. Others, however, will tend to shun food. What underlies these differences, and, in fact, the neural and hormonal pathways at play during stress eating (when people eat without being hungry due to emotional reasons), remain unclear.</p><p>This is partly because scientists lack good animal models in which to study these behaviors. In particular, female rodents are usually excluded from studies under the assumption that their hormonal cycles will disrupt the results. Yet, women are overrepresented in studies on feeding habits.</p><p>Modeling human behaviors using rodents is harder than it may appear. These animals are most active at night – yet most experiments are performed during the day. The same stressors also have different outcomes in males and females. François et al. therefore explored better ways to induce anxiety and evaluate feeding behavior in mice, hoping to reliably elicit stress eating.</p><p>The starting point was a common type of experiments known as novelty-suppressed feeding. First, mice are kept alone in a cage for up to two weeks on a normal diet so that they are used to experimental conditions. Then they are deprived of food overnight, before being given free access to food in the morning in a new environment. This stressful experience normally causes mice to take longer to eat than in their home cage. In rodents, the delay is thought to reflect stress as it is reliably reversed by anti-anxiety compounds approved for human use. In the novelty-suppressed feeding assay, both male and female animals exhibit signs of anxiety, but how much females eat is variable. François et al. showed that this variability is not due to hormonal changes, but instead to how long female mice had been kept alone.</p><p>Crucially, the test could be adapted so that mice would consistently exhibit behavior similar to human stress eating, whereby they eat more during the test without having fasted the night before. The changes included running the experiment at night, when the animals are normally most active, and using overweight mice (which captures the fact that, in humans, being overweight is associated with being prone to stress eating).</p><p>Stress eating is an important clinical issue, hindering weigh loss in people with obesity. The new model developed by François et al. could be adopted by other laboratories, enabling better research into this behavior.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>novelty suppressed feeding</kwd><kwd>emotional eating</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>social isolation</kwd><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01 MH113353 89038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeltser</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005310</institution-id><institution>Klarman Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeltser</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Russell Berrie Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeltser</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000071</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R24 HD102061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zeltser</surname><given-names>Lori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systematic testing of experimental variables in a common neurobehavioral paradigm revealed that conditions that more closely match human physiology reliably elicit stress eating in mice.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most studies in humans focus on stress-induced overeating (also called emotional eating or stress eating), but stress can also lead to decreased caloric intake in some people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greeno and Wing, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oliver and Wardle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wallis and Hetherington, 2009</xref>). Although stress-related eating behaviors are heterogeneous at the population level, individual behaviors are highly predictable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oliver and Wardle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone and Brownell, 1994</xref>). Clinical and epidemiological studies support the idea that properties of the stressor influence the direction of the response. The effect of a mild stress is variable, but as the intensity of stress increases, people are more likely to eat less (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone and Brownell, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kandiah et al., 2008</xref>). The type of stress also matters, with physical stressors more likely to suppress intake than psychosocial stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O’Connor et al., 2008</xref>). While stress affects eating in both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rutters et al., 2009</xref>), there are sex differences in responsiveness. Females are typically more sensitive to interpersonal and emotional stress, while males are more sensitive to ego-threatening situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tanofsky-Kraff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laitinen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clauss and Byrd-Craven, 2019</xref>). Moreover, the threshold at which stress preferentially suppresses food intake is lower for males than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone and Brownell, 1994</xref>).</p><p>While properties of the stressor shape eating behaviors, these influences cannot account for all of the heterogeneity. Even when a common stress is shared by many, such as the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic, both overeating and restricting are increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phillipou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulthard et al., 2021</xref>). These observations are consistent with the idea that physiological and psychological traits determine the direction of eating responses to stress at the individual level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stone and Brownell, 1994</xref>). Elevated BMI is the variable most consistently associated with eating in the absence of hunger in both children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2019</xref>) and adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Laitinen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coulthard et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemmens et al., 2011</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism is unknown.</p><p>Basic principles governing stress-related eating behaviors are conserved in rodent models, providing construct validity. The likelihood of hypophagic responses increases with the stress intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Levine and Morley, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Michajlovskij et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martí et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vallès et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Michel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barfield et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, diet-induced obesity exaggerates hyperphagic behavior in models of social defeat stress in male mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolomucci et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Razzoli et al., 2015</xref>). Early experiments in rats reported stress-induced increases in food intake in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antelman et al., 1976</xref>). Over time, the field gradually shifted toward measurements of stress-induced suppression of eating behaviors as a readout of anxiety- or depressive-like states, without explicitly assessing caloric intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cryan and Sweeney, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kokras and Dalla, 2014</xref>). Current studies of stress-induced overeating are largely limited to models of binge-eating disorders, which involve restricted access to a palatable diet, often in combination with a chronic physical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boggiano and Chandler, 2006</xref>). Rodent models recapitulate the preferential susceptibility to binge-eating disorder and subclinical bingeing behavior in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klump et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hudson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Croll et al., 2002</xref>). However, there are no established models to study effects of short-term exposure to psychological stress on eating (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">François et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>There are several obstacles to studying the effects of acute stress on feeding behaviors in female rodents. They often exhibit reduced anxiety-like behaviors, especially when tasks involve locomotor activity or arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">File, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doremus et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, behavioral endpoints often vary across the ovarian cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Becker et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beery and Zucker, 2011</xref>). Together, these observations have been used as a rationale for excluding females in basic research. The paucity of rodent studies in females is particularly unfortunate, since the prevalence of anxiety, depressive symptoms, eating disorders, and subclinical disordered eating behaviors is higher in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hudson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altemus et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, single housing can exert opposite effects in males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oliver et al., 2020</xref>), which is rarely considered when using this manipulation to measure feeding or other behaviors.</p><p>We set out to uncover aspects of experimental paradigms that promote hyperphagic vs. hypophagic responses to stress in female mice. We used the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) paradigm as the foundation for these studies. It has strong predictive validity with respect to antidepressant and anxiolytic therapeutics but is rarely exploited to examine the effect of stress on food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulawa and Hen, 2005</xref>). We performed 15 variations of the NSF assay to parse influences of sex, estrous and diurnal cyclicity, age and duration of social isolation, prandial state, diet palatability, and chronic high-fat diet (HFD) exposure on anxiety-like and feeding behaviors in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Estrous cyclicity is not the primary driver of heterogeneity in stress responses in females</title><p>We tested males and females in the manual NSF assay. We acclimated the mice to single housing for 2 weeks, subjected them to an overnight fast, and recorded responses to a chow diet in the home vs. novel cage environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Our studies narrow this gap. We defined sex-specific variations of the NSF assay that permit investigations of consistent stress-related feeding behaviors in males and females. In addition, performing the assays in the active phase of the light cycle and in the context of chronic HFD consumption shifts responses toward hyperphagia, which more faithfully recapitulates the bias toward overeating in people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oliver and Wardle, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phillipou et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kandiah et al., 2006</xref>). Finally, discordance between effects of some experimental parameters on anxiety-like and feeding behaviors could indicate that the underlying circuits are distinct.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Assessing stress-induced behaviors: technical considerations</title><p>By focusing exclusively on latency as a readout of anxiety-like behavior in the NSF, investigators miss the opportunity to evaluate the effect of stress on feeding behavior. We incorporated several features into the basic NSF paradigm to permit reliable and meaningful assessments of caloric intake. We trained mice to eat under the test conditions for several days until baseline levels of intake stabilized and excluded those that failed to train (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schalla et al., 2020</xref>). We calculated intake from the first bite and not the start of the test. This is critical, as the high novel cage latencies (≥15 min) exhibited by most of the female groups and the overweight males would confound interpretation of feeding measurements that started at the onset of the test. We evaluated intake for 30 min, as recommended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schalla et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellacott et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, analyzing both baseline and stress-induced conditions makes it possible to parse the effects of acute stress from those imposed by stressors built into the paradigm. This is important because we observed the most variability in chow-based studies females in the home cage. Some factors, such as adolescent social isolation, have opposite effects on behavior in the home and novel cages. Uncovering experimental conditions that influence behavior across the estrous cycle in the home cage helped to define conditions that produce consistent behavioral outcomes in females.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Circuits mediating stress-induced anxiety-like and feeding behaviors are likely distinct</title><p>The novel cage consistently induced higher latencies, except for females acutely or chronically exposed to HFD. In contrast, feeding responses to stress were variable between groups. Moreover, distinct sets of factors influenced latency and feeding outcomes. The manual test and the timing of the onset of social isolation affected only latency outcomes, while the length of social isolation, time of day, and chronic HFD exposure only impacted feeding outcomes. The only feature of the paradigm that influenced both latency and food intake was acute exposure to the palatable diet. Together, these observations support the idea that the circuits regulating stress-induced anxiety-like and feeding behaviors are likely distinct.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Influences of sex and estrous cyclicity on stress-related feeding behaviors</title><p>Sex differences in feeding behavior are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asarian and Geary, 2013</xref>). Daily food intake fluctuates across the estrous cycle, with reductions during proestrus, when estrogen is at its peak, in rodents and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tarttelin and Gorski, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Petersen, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buffenstein et al., 1995</xref>). In contrast, fasting-induced food intake was significantly higher in proestrus than in diestrus, consistent with studies involving estrogen replacement in ovariectomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shakya and Briski, 2017</xref>). Low home cage intake after an overnight fast in diestrus likely reflects increased stress, because it is restored by automated measurements. When we eliminated the fast by performing the test in the dark cycle, the anorexigenic effects of estrogen were retrieved, as reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Asarian and Geary, 2013</xref>). Performing automated measurements eliminated effects of the estrous cycle on baseline intake but did not reduce the heterogeneity of feeding responses to stress. Conversely, we observed consistent hyperphagic responses in the dark cycle in the face of variability in home cage intake across the estrous cycle. Therefore, our studies debunk the assumption that estrous cyclicity drives variability in stress responses in females that precludes their use in neurobehavioral studies.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Sex-dependent effects of social isolation on stress-related feeding behaviors</title><p>Social isolation in adulthood produces opposite effects in males and female feeding behavior in the NSF, with males more likely to exhibit hypophagic behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Oliver et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, exposure to social isolation in the postweaning period has sex-specific effects on neurobehavioral outcomes, with increased sensitivity in males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weiss et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fone and Porkess, 2008</xref>). Here, we examined the impact of social isolation in adolescence, because it is a sensitive period for programming stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wright et al., 1991</xref>) and the peak onset of eating disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bulik, 2002</xref>). Longer exposure to social isolation influenced feeding behavior in a sex-dependent manner, promoting hypophagia in females. Exploring whether the impacts of adolescent social isolation on stress-induced feeding behavior are permanently programmed or can be reversed is an important area for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Increasing physiological relevance to humans</title><p>Assessing behaviors in the dark cycle is more physiologically relevant for feeding and minimizes stresses associated with the external environment and fasting, which impose sex-specific effects in mice and humans (described above).

Here, we found that performing the NSF assay at the start of the dark cycle promoted hyperphagic responses in both sexes. This could stem from a lower appetitive drive in the home test compared to an overnight fast. Diurnal influences, and not prandial state, are also more important influences on food intake in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schalla et al., 2020</xref>).

Consistent with these observations, we found that chronic exposure to HFD promoted hyperphagic responses to novel environment stress in both males and females. Stress-induced anxiety-like and feeding behaviors in females exposed to chronic HFD were discordant, consistent with observations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wardle et al., 2011</xref>). These effects are likely the consequence of the chronic exposure to HFD in contrast to the diet palatability, as performing the assay with HFD in lean mice produced opposite effects in both sexes. Although we did not observe correlations between body weight gain and feeding responses, identifying neuroendocrine or neuronal biomarkers that predict stress-induced hypophagia vs. hyperphagia is an important topic for future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Summary</title><p>We identified factors that have predictable effects on stress-induced feeding responses in both sexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

On the other hand, conducting the test in the inactive phase in lean mice, conditions used in most behavioral assays, promotes hypophagic responses. The duration of social isolation exerted sex-dependent effects. The use of other stress paradigms and other diets will be critical to draw more generalized conclusions.

While clinical evidence shows susceptibility to either hyperphagia or hypophagia that is predictable and sexually-dimorphic at an individual level, population conclusions have been more difficult to predict. Specifically, factors such as sex and BMI have been implicated in human over- or under-eating under stress; however, a clear picture has not emerged in experimental animal studies due to lack of evaluation and/or standardization of these parameters. Francois et al., systematically evaluate how developmental (and 24h) timing of social isolation impacts feeding in a sex-dependent manner, identify daily timing of novelty-induced feeding behaviors. Their work also probes how diet-induced obesity impacts feeding responses under stress and provide recommendations for creating predictable responses in animals that allow for best practices in studies of stress-induced feeding. Further, they identify that proper design of these experiments can lead to much greater predictability of feeding responses, indicating that the benchmarks herein will enlighten future neurocircuit-level analyses of stress-related appetitive behaviors.</p><p>While the behavioral characterizations were robustly conducted and provide important new insights to calibrate the entire and broad field of obesity research, a few considerations would enhance the final form of this manuscript. In particular, the question of whether palatability might impact latency of anxiety behavior and/or energy intake, and whether such factors may change according to nutrient prehistory may be helpful (e.g., are DIO mice driven more via rival hedonic vs homeostatic responses). Is there any way to parse out more within the present work whether the latency phenomenon vs energy intake aspect might reflect differences in &quot;homeostatic drive&quot;: for instance, are leptin(or active ghrelin) levels (or leptin-supressed refeeding responses) different amongst males/females, preadolescent/vs. post-pubertal, normal/vs. high-fat fed animals? The point would be to define with endocrine or biochemical quantification the observed distinction between latency and food intake endpoints. Equally exciting would be the observation that ACTH/cortisol levels might vary in a way that could provide a similar entry point for future endocrine analyses (or at least for these points one might review relevant existing literature to provide context from the starting point here).</p><p>– Addition of more behavioral assays or discussion of such an approach may extend context for the NSF paradigm.</p><p>– Question: With regard to social isolation and 24h timing in males vs females, is it possible that females are more synchronized when group-housed--would difference in estrus days explain variance within female experiments?</p><p>– As presented the work analyzed animals under light:dark conditions, so in formal terms the observations describe &quot;diurnal&quot; aspects of behavior rather than &quot;circadian&quot;-the latter requiring analyses under constant conditions such 24h dark:dark (a semantic point that may be a consideration to those in the field in the future).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this report, Marie Francois and colleagues set out to uncover aspects of experimental paradigms that promote hyperphagic vs hypophagic responses to psychological stress in mice. The comprehensive experiments were built upon the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, that is commonly used as an index of anxiety-like behavior. The authors make the salient point that collecting caloric intake data in this paradigm could expand the information revealed by the assay and potentially provide a better understanding of how, and under what experimental conditions, acute stress increases vs decreases caloric intake in mice. They performed 13 variations of the NSF test, to determine the influence of sex, estrous cycle, time of day, age and duration of social isolation, and diet on anxiety like and feeding behavior.</p><p>The data strongly support that latency to eat in the novel environment, an index of anxiety, was robustly increased across experimental conditions and in both sexes. By contrast, effects on feeding behavior were more variable. Most convincingly, in Figure 4, the authors demonstrate that females socially isolated for ~6 weeks beginning in adolescence exhibit novelty-suppressed caloric intake whereas females socially isolated for 2 weeks beginning in adulthood exhibit novelty-exaggerated caloric intake, when the test is performed during the normal feeding period at the onset of dark. Although the relative contributions of length of isolation and age of isolation onset remain entangled, these findings point towards two key variables that may influence the well-characterized divergent response to stress-eating in women setting the stage for mechanistic studies. Another factor that may influence the direction of the feeding response to stress is obesity, since DIO male and female mice exhibited a hyperphagic response to the novel environment. This conclusion could be strengthened by a direct comparison between lean and obese mice in the same experiment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– The important research question and creative approach.</p><p>– Careful attention to rigor in experimental design including counterbalancing the home cage and novel cage tests, training mice to eat under the test conditions, measuring caloric intake for 30 minutes from the first bite to avoid confounding latency and caloric intake, attention to estrus cycle as a potential variable, and attention to degree of caloric restriction as a potential variable.</p><p>– Use of the automated BIODAQ feeding system represents an important innovation allowing for feeding to be assessed under more ethologically-relevant conditions.</p><p>– Clear and easy to digest figures and methods.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The primary concern is regarding the statistical design and analysis.</p><p>– Essentially, the authors have created a powerful, large multifactorial experimental design but there is a missed opportunity to extract robust information since analyses are not integrated in a single model. Rather, there are mostly a series of pairwise comparisons, some of which span experiments.</p><p>– By my understanding, the data were collected across ~10 individual experiments represented by the various figures, and presumably within each experiment the groups were assayed simultaneously (e.g., in Figure 4 females isolated in adolescence and females isolated in adulthood were tested in the NSF test at the same time). However, many of the statistical comparisons shown in Supplemental Table 1 and resulting conclusions occur across experiments. There is less confidence in these conclusions/ findings since behavioral responses to stress are extremely labile and easily influenced by stochastic environmental conditions, which are not controlled when comparing across experiments.</p><p>– Comparisons of <italic>variance</italic> in the feeding response are critical to several conclusions regarding the effect of a given variable on the 'likelihood of hyperphagic vs hypophagic responses to stress'. However these comparisons are generally only narrative, rather than employing statistical tests to compare variance (or likelihood) between groups, and they also rely on binning the change in caloric intake to categorical variables rather than presenting the data as a continuous variable.</p><p>Additional physiological endpoints could begin to inform mechanism. For example, how the various timing(s) of social isolation affect body weight and whether weight is a significant overall predictor of the feeding response to stress. Likewise, it may be useful to know how all of these variables affect the HPA axis or SNS response to the novel cage.</p><p>The data are clearly described and well presented, particularly in Supplemental Table 1. In the text of the paper itself, however, it was sometimes unclear the basis on which some conclusions were being drawn, likely because it is unusual to perform statistical analyses across individual experiments. My primary recommendation is to consider a biostatistical collaborator to potentially build a more informative multivariable model. In the absence of this more robust analysis, the strength of some conclusions are questionable and I suggest focusing on the within-experiment comparisons.</p><p>NSF is of course just one kind of acute stressor, and only 2 diets were used. Further work will be needed to understand how generalizable these findings might be to other stressors and other foods. This limitation warrants further discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In Francois et al., &quot;Assessing effects of stress on feeding behaviors in laboratory mice&quot;, the investigators use a novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) assay to investigate variables associated with stress-induced hyperphagia and stress-induced hypophagia. Variables assessed included sex, phase of estrus cycle, duration of social isolation, age, circadian timing, and high fat diet exposure. Performing the assay during the dark (active) phase and performing the assay in HFD-fed mice led to hyperphagic responses. Social isolation induced hypophagia in males but longer social isolation was needed in females to produce the same effect. Factors influencing the variability of response were also investigated.</p><p>This is a very interesting topic that would be of interest to the scientific community and the lay public at large since stress affects feeding in the majority of people. The conclusions are interesting, however, I think that many are overstated given the small sample sizes and the lack of discussion as to the magnitude of the responses of the individual study mice. The paper perhaps also reads more like a Methods paper as opposed to a mechanistic paper.</p><p>1. My biggest concern with the study as written pertains to the sample sizes, which in general are low. Many of the analyses focus on the variability of the responses (eg hyperphagia vs. hypophagia vs. no change) – the % of the study subjects who responded in one of those three manners. It is risky to base these responses on n's of 8-11 in one set of studies, or even on n's of 15-16 in other sets of studies. Since variability of response was such a major component of the analyses, the n's must be bigger. In comparison, V. Krishnan et al., Cell 2007 used over 700 mice to examine variability in behavioral responses to chronic social defeat stress-while that study focused on molecular determinants of the variability and the current study does not – a larger number of study mice should be included for each of the groups. Without that, I think that looking at the average responses of the entire set of equivalently treated mice is the most that should be reported. A similar problem exists for the estrus cycle data. After separating the larger group of females into those in Diestrus, proestrus, or estrus, then numbers in each group decrease a lot – to n=3 or n-2 in some cases. More mice are needed.</p><p>2. Another major concern is the focus only on % of study subjects that respond in one way or another as opposed to the magnitude of the changes. Of those mice that were hyperphagic, what % increase in food intake was observed? This addresses physiologic significance of the results – a 1% average increase is far different than a 200% average increase. Those types of analyses examining the magnitude of the changes for should also be performed/analyzed/discussed. As just one example, on line 184, it is mentioned that 100% of males and 82% of females experienced novel environment stress increased latency – but looking at the figure, the amount of latency in each of the male mice was extremely slight.</p><p>3. A third major concern is the nature of the paper. The title suggests this will be a review or a Methods paper. The data contained/studies performed give it the feel of a Methods paper – these are the Methods that must be used in order to study stress-induced hyperphagia or stress-induced hypophagia. I do think that the paper would benefit from the addition of a more mechanistic set of data.</p><p>Some other concerns follow:</p><p>1. I would like to see an expanded mention (with some details) of other/additional studies in the literature in which stress-induced food intake in mice has been investigated.</p><p>2. Some details in the Methods are missing:</p><p>a. adults (&gt;10weeks) – that description is too vague. Needs to be more specific about ages of mice used. Preferably, there was not too wide of an age range utilized above 10 weeks of age for these studies.</p><p>b. For the animals in studied in their home cages, please specify in the Methods whether bedding changes were performed or changes to the physical home cage were performed during the 2 weeks of acclimation or recovery.</p><p>3. Line 275 – can the investigators provide data showing that the 90% caloric restriction was “matched”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70271.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should assess the question of whether palatability might impact latency of anxiety behavior and/or energy intake.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. We addressed this issue by adding two cohorts of lean males and females that were only exposed to the palatable high fat diet during the acclimation period and the test itself (hereafter referred to as “acute”) (Figure 5-Supplement 1). The lean and chronic HFD-fed groups exhibited distinct behavioral patterns when presented with HFD in the test. As anticipated, lean mice had &gt;10-fold lower latencies and consumed &gt;10 times more calories of the palatable HFD than the chow diet in the home cage.</p><p>In the novel cage, lean mice presented with HFD increase their latency and <italic>decrease</italic> food intake. Other than the fact that we are performing the test at the start of the dark cycle, the acute exposure paradigm is very similar to the “Novelty Induced Hyponeophagia” assay (Dulawa and Hen, 2005 Neurosci Biobehav Rev), which also produces stress-induced suppression of food intake in males. Therefore, novel stress induced increases in food intake seen in chronic HFD exposure is unlikely to be caused by the palatability of the test diet.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to reassess their statistical analyses.

The only change we needed to make was with respect to the effect length and timing of social isolation. We previously claimed that both factors are important for food intake.

The point would be to define with endocrine or biochemical quantification the observed distinction between latency and food intake endpoints. Equally exciting would be the observation that ACTH/cortisol levels might vary in a way that could provide a similar entry point for future endocrine analyses (or at least for these points one might review relevant existing literature to provide context from the starting point here).</p></disp-quote><p>This was an excellent suggestion. We performed exploratory studies to identify potential neuroendocrine biomarkers of latency and food intake outcomes. We measured ghrelin and CORT in some trunk blood samples that were collected at the end of either the home or novel cage test (randomized). (We did not have enough serum to measure leptin as well.) There are several important caveats to note. First, we were not able to collect blood during the test, because it would have interfered with behavioral assay. The blood was collected at 30-45 min after the test start. Another limitation of these studies is that the serum was not pre-treated in order to detect acyl-ghrelin, so we were only able to measure total ghrelin.</p><p>Novel cage stress resulted in higher ghrelin levels in mice with chronic exposure to HFD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> right panel) but not in lean mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> left and middle panels). This raises the possibility that ghrelin contributes to the hyperphagic response in chronic HFD-fed mice. However, the levels of total serum ghrelin did not correlate with latency or caloric intake.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70271-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We elected not to present these data in the manuscript because 1) we were not able to measure acyl-ghrelin; and 2) since ghrelin levels decline rapidly after the consumption of food, it is not clear what are samples are measuring. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of ghrelin signaling will be needed to define the contribution to stress-induced hyperphagia in chronic HFD-fed mice. This is a focus on our current research efforts.We used a similar strategy in exploratory measurements of CORT. We compared groups of lean mice that exhibited opposite phenotypes – males and females evaluated in the dark phase. The effects of the novel cage on CORT levels were similar between groups, and did not correlate with caloric intake.</p><p>Importantly, in all three groups, CORT levels were not significantly increased because several individuals showed levels of CORT similar to home cage levels.

When performed in the Biodaq, mice showed similar behavior regardless of their estrous cycle phase. In addition, when the test was performed in the dark, female behavior was now more consistent than males, despite the fact that caloric intake was impacted by estrous cyclicity in the home cage. Altogether, this suggests that the variance within female is not driven by variation in sex hormones when the assays are performed in the Biodaq environment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– As presented the work analyzed animals under light:dark conditions, so in formal terms the observations describe &quot;diurnal&quot; aspects of behavior rather than &quot;circadian&quot;-the latter requiring analyses under constant conditions such 24h dark:dark (a semantic point that may be a consideration to those in the field in the future).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this clarification. We replaced “circadian” by “diurnal” throughout the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this report, Marie Francois and colleagues set out to uncover aspects of experimental paradigms that promote hyperphagic vs hypophagic responses to psychological stress in mice. The comprehensive experiments were built upon the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, that is commonly used as an index of anxiety-like behavior. The authors make the salient point that collecting caloric intake data in this paradigm could expand the information revealed by the assay and potentially provide a better understanding of how, and under what experimental conditions, acute stress increases vs decreases caloric intake in mice. They performed 13 variations of the NSF test, to determine the influence of sex, estrous cycle, time of day, age and duration of social isolation, and diet on anxiety like and feeding behavior.</p><p>The data strongly support that latency to eat in the novel environment, an index of anxiety, was robustly increased across experimental conditions and in both sexes. By contrast, effects on feeding behavior were more variable. Most convincingly, in Figure 4, the authors demonstrate that females socially isolated for ~6 weeks beginning in adolescence exhibit novelty-suppressed caloric intake whereas females socially isolated for 2 weeks beginning in adulthood exhibit novelty-exaggerated caloric intake, when the test is performed during the normal feeding period at the onset of dark. Although the relative contributions of length of isolation and age of isolation onset remain entangled, these findings point towards two key variables that may influence the well-characterized divergent response to stress-eating in women setting the stage for mechanistic studies. Another factor that may influence the direction of the feeding response to stress is obesity, since DIO male and female mice exhibited a hyperphagic response to the novel environment. This conclusion could be strengthened by a direct comparison between lean and obese mice in the same experiment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>– The important research question and creative approach.</p><p>– Careful attention to rigor in experimental design including counterbalancing the home cage and novel cage tests, training mice to eat under the test conditions, measuring caloric intake for 30 minutes from the first bite to avoid confounding latency and caloric intake, attention to estrus cycle as a potential variable, and attention to degree of caloric restriction as a potential variable.</p><p>– Use of the automated BIODAQ feeding system represents an important innovation allowing for feeding to be assessed under more ethologically-relevant conditions.</p><p>– Clear and easy to digest figures and methods.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The primary concern is regarding the statistical design and analysis.</p><p>– Essentially, the authors have created a powerful, large multifactorial experimental design but there is a missed opportunity to extract robust information since analyses are not integrated in a single model. Rather, there are mostly a series of pairwise comparisons, some of which span experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive suggestion. See the response to issue #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– By my understanding, the data were collected across ~10 individual experiments represented by the various figures, and presumably within each experiment the groups were assayed simultaneously (e.g., in Figure 4 females isolated in adolescence and females isolated in adulthood were tested in the NSF test at the same time). However, many of the statistical comparisons shown in Supplemental Table 1 and resulting conclusions occur across experiments. There is less confidence in these conclusions/ findings since behavioral responses to stress are extremely labile and easily influenced by stochastic environmental conditions, which are not controlled when comparing across experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>With the help of a biostatistician, we replaced simple statistical comparisons across experiments with a multivariable statistical analysis of our data that controlled for confounding factors such as age, body weight, and order of the tests (home first or novel first).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Comparisons of variance in the feeding response are critical to several conclusions regarding the effect of a given variable on the 'likelihood of hyperphagic vs hypophagic responses to stress'. However these comparisons are generally only narrative, rather than employing statistical tests to compare variance (or likelihood) between groups, and they also rely on binning the change in caloric intake to categorical variables rather than presenting the data as a continuous variable.</p></disp-quote><p>See the response to issues #4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional physiological endpoints could begin to inform mechanism. For example, how the various timing(s) of social isolation affect body weight and whether weight is a significant overall predictor of the feeding response to stress. Likewise, it may be useful to know how all of these variables affect the HPA axis or SNS response to the novel cage.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a sentence in the results stating that body weights were similar between groups that were submitted to different social isolation length and timing. Moreover, weight and feeding responses to stress were not correlated (added to Figure 5F). Body weight was also included as a potential confounding factor in the multivariable analysis.</p><p>CORT responses were similar between males, females socially isolated in adulthood, and females socially isolated during adolescence, as shown in the response to Reviewer #1. Importantly, in all three groups, CORT levels were not significantly increased in the novel cage because several individuals showed levels of CORT similar to home cage levels. This could reflect the fact that mice were euthanized 30 to 45min after the start of the stress to observe the effects on food intake, and not at the start of the assay where the effects of stress are maximal.</p><p>To capture the true effect of novel cage stress on ghrelin and CORT levels, blood sampling should be performed in a separate cohort that is euthanized closer to the beginning of the assay. However, early sampling would then preclude the use of these cohorts to study behavior. Exploring the contributions of neuroendocrine factors, such as ghrelin, CORT and leptin, to our stress eating model is a focus of our current research efforts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data are clearly described and well presented, particularly in Supplemental Table 1. In the text of the paper itself, however, it was sometimes unclear the basis on which some conclusions were being drawn, likely because it is unusual to perform statistical analyses across individual experiments. My primary recommendation is to consider a biostatistical collaborator to potentially build a more informative multivariable model. In the absence of this more robust analysis, the strength of some conclusions are questionable and I suggest focusing on the within-experiment comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive suggestion. See the response to issue #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>NSF is of course just one kind of acute stressor, and only 2 diets were used. Further work will be needed to understand how generalizable these findings might be to other stressors and other foods. This limitation warrants further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive suggestion. For our discussion of other stressors, see the response to issue #7.</p><p>The lack of standardization in test diets was an issue we highlighted in our review of assays involving stress and feeding behavior that was recently published in Biological Psychiatry. We added a sentence in the Summary paragraph mentioning the need to repeat these results with other stress paradigms and with other diets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>In Francois et al., &quot;Assessing effects of stress on feeding behaviors in laboratory mice&quot;, the investigators use a novelty suppressed feeding (NSF) assay to investigate variables associated with stress-induced hyperphagia and stress-induced hypophagia. Variables assessed included sex, phase of estrus cycle, duration of social isolation, age, circadian timing, and high fat diet exposure. Performing the assay during the dark (active) phase and performing the assay in HFD-fed mice led to hyperphagic responses. Social isolation induced hypophagia in males but longer social isolation was needed in females to produce the same effect. Factors influencing the variability of response were also investigated.</p><p>This is a very interesting topic that would be of interest to the scientific community and the lay public at large since stress affects feeding in the majority of people. The conclusions are interesting, however, I think that many are overstated given the small sample sizes and the lack of discussion as to the magnitude of the responses of the individual study mice. The paper perhaps also reads more like a Methods paper as opposed to a mechanistic paper.</p><p>1. My biggest concern with the study as written pertains to the sample sizes, which in general are low. Many of the analyses focus on the variability of the responses (eg hyperphagia vs. hypophagia vs. no change) – the % of the study subjects who responded in one of those three manners. It is risky to base these responses on n's of 8-11 in one set of studies, or even on n's of 15-16 in other sets of studies. Since variability of response was such a major component of the analyses, the n's must be bigger. In comparison, V. Krishnan et al., Cell 2007 used over 700 mice to examine variability in behavioral responses to chronic social defeat stress-while that study focused on molecular determinants of the variability and the current study does not – a larger number of study mice should be included for each of the groups. Without that, I think that looking at the average responses of the entire set of equivalently treated mice is the most that should be reported. A similar problem exists for the estrus cycle data. After separating the larger group of females into those in Diestrus, proestrus, or estrus, then numbers in each group decrease a lot – to n=3 or n-2 in some cases. More mice are needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive suggestion. See the responses to issue #2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Another major concern is the focus only on % of study subjects that respond in one way or another as opposed to the magnitude of the changes. Of those mice that were hyperphagic, what % increase in food intake was observed? This addresses physiologic significance of the results – a 1% average increase is far different than a 200% average increase. Those types of analyses examining the magnitude of the changes for should also be performed/analyzed/discussed. As just one example, on line 184, it is mentioned that 100% of males and 82% of females experienced novel environment stress increased latency – but looking at the figure, the amount of latency in each of the male mice was extremely slight.</p></disp-quote><p>See the response to issues #4 and 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A third major concern is the nature of the paper. The title suggests this will be a review or a Methods paper. The data contained/studies performed give it the feel of a Methods paper – these are the Methods that must be used in order to study stress-induced hyperphagia or stress-induced hypophagia. I do think that the paper would benefit from the addition of a more mechanistic set of data.</p></disp-quote><p>We submitted the manuscript as a “Tools and Resources” paper, which has the “potential to substantially accelerate discovery in any area of biology or medicine.” Our studies will broadly enhance efforts to study stress eating. We comply with the requirement to “fully describe the tool or resource so that prospective users have all the information needed to deploy it within their own work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some other concerns follow:</p><p>1. I would like to see an expanded mention (with some details) of other/additional studies in the literature in which stress-induced food intake in mice has been investigated.</p></disp-quote><p>We recently published a review in Biological Psychiatry that discusses how various parameters impact the effects of stress on food intake in animal models and in humans.

Difference in ages can be explained by the fact that mice were bred in house, and space in the Biodaq was a limiting factor (only 16 cages for a total of 197 mice included in the present manuscript). However, ages were counterbalanced between cohorts and multivariable analysis controlled for age as a potential confounding factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b.
