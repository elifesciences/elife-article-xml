disorders characterized by the cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and cellular senescence underlies their pathogenesis. Thus, it is necessary for preventing these diseases to remove toxic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular senescence. As a source for such prophylactic agents, we selected zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS), a medicinal herb used in traditional Chinese medicine. Oral administration of ZSS hot water extract ameliorated Aβ and tau pathology and cognitive impairment in mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia. Non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder showed stronger effects than the extract and improved α-synuclein pathology and cognitive/motor function in Parkinson’s disease model mice. Furthermore, when administered to normal aged mice, the ZSS powder suppressed cellular senescence, reduced DNA oxidation, promoted brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression and neurogenesis, and enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. The quantity of known active ingredients of ZSS, jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin was not proportional to the nootropic activity of ZSS. These results suggest that ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dementia</kwd><kwd>senescence</kwd><kwd>rejuvenation</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>neurodegenerative disease</kwd><kwd>traditional Chinese medicine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Teijin Ltd.</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomiyama</surname><given-names>Takami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Cerebro Pharma Inc</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomiyama</surname><given-names>Takami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Simply crushed zizyphi spinosi semen not only ameliorates Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein pathology in dementia model mice, but also rejuvenates brain function by suppressing cellular senescence in normal aged mice.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cerebral accumulation of amyloidogenic proteins is a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases; Aβ and tau accumulate in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), tau accumulates in frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and α-synuclein accumulates in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). In patients’ brains, these proteins aggregate into toxic oligomers and fibrils to induce synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li and Selkoe, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Gutierrez and Limon, 2022</xref>) and intercellular propagation of neuropathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jaunmuktane and Brandner, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Umeda et al., 2022</xref>). In consequence, cognitive function declines in AD, FTD, and DLB, and motor function is impaired in PD. The accumulation of these proteins begins decades before the disease onset and many neurons die by the time clinical symptoms emerge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jack et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ossenkoppele et al., 2022</xref>). These findings indicate the importance of early diagnosis and prevention and that prophylactic agents for neurodegenerative diseases should have activities to remove toxic oligomers and repair damaged neurons.</p><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are age-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wyss-Coray, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hou et al., 2019</xref>), and recent evidence suggests that cellular senescence underlies their pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shafqat et al., 2023</xref>). Cellular senescence is a physiological phenomenon observed in aging in which proliferating cells undergo stable cell cycle arrest. This phenomenon is induced by telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, mechanical or shear stress, pathogens, and activation of oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shafqat et al., 2023</xref>). In neurodegenerative diseases, abnormal protein accumulation triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation which causes oxidative stress and organelle dysfunction leading to cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>). Senescent cells accelerate the aging and damage of surrounding tissues through senescence-associated secretory phenotype composed of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sahu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shafqat et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">González-Gualda et al., 2021</xref>), which in turn exacerbates neurodegenerating process. Eliminating senescent cells with senolytic drugs, such as dasatinib+quercetin (D+Q), has been shown to ameliorate neuropathology, inflammation, and cognitive function in AD model mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, cellular senescence is another target to prevent neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p>The current mainstream in drug development for neurodegenerative diseases is immunotherapy. Two Aβ antibodies have been approved, and tau and α-synuclein antibodies along with other Aβ antibodies are also in clinical trials. However, these drugs have problems in terms of cost, safety, and invasiveness. They are generally very expensive, and their side effects are often serious. In addition, patients must receive intravenous treatment at a hospital, which is a burden to the patient. Such treatments are not suitable for long-term prevention. Prophylactic agents must be safe, inexpensive, and noninvasively available so that all asymptomatic and undiagnosed people can take them for a long period at their own discretion. Also, they should be broadly effective against etiologic proteins, capable of repairing neurons, and effective at suppressing cellular senescence. These requirements are difficult to meet with single-ingredient pharmaceuticals, but it may be feasible by taking proper diets composed of multiple ingredients.</p><p>In search of materials for such diets, we explored medicinal herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, where several herbs such as <italic>Rehmanniae radix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jia et al., 2023</xref>), <italic>Polygalae radix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>), zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>), and <italic>Acorus tatarinowii/gramineus rhizome</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2022</xref>) are claimed to be effective for amnesia. In the present study, we focused on ZSS, the seeds of <italic>Ziziphus jujuba Miller</italic> var. <italic>spinosa</italic>, because ZSS is treated as a non-pharmaceutical in Japan but the other herbs are regarded as pharmaceuticals, i.e., not suitable for diets. In traditional Chinese medicine, medicinal herbs are often subjected to decoction; the resultant extracts are taken as medicines but the extraction residues are usually discarded. However, our previous studies revealed that the residues also have some functional ingredients and that hot water extraction tends to lose some volatile substances by evaporation and possibly break down some heat-sensitive components, which led us to conclude that simple crushing without extraction is a better way to maximize the effects of medicinal herbs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Umeda et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Umeda et al., 2024a</xref>). Based on these observations, we made three preparations from dried ZSS: hot water extract, extraction residue, and non-extracted simple crush powder, and examined their efficacy in three different mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases. In addition, we evaluated the antiaging effects of ZSS in normal aged mice. Our results show that non-extracted ZSS simple crush powder meets all the requirements for neurodegenerative disease-prophylactic agents and that the ZSS powder is a promising dietary material against neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Effects of ZSS hot water extract on APP23 mice</title><p>Initially, we examined the effects of ZSS hot water extract on cognitive function and Aβ pathology in AD model mice.

The hot water extract and simple crush powder were administered to 8- to 12-month-old mice (mean body weight, 29.3 g) at 0.1 mg/shot for 1 month. The hot water extract improved mouse memory, but the effect was incomplete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Subsequently, the simple crush powder and extraction residue were administered to 8- to 11-month-old mice (mean body weight, 31.2 g) at 0.1 mg/shot for 1 month. Again, the simple crush powder displayed a strong effect on mouse memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). On the other hand, the extraction residue showed only a moderate effect, similar to that of the hot water extract. The levels of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and tau oligomers in the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) were significantly attenuated by all three preparations, with the simple crush powder showing the strongest effects.

Huα-Syn(A53T) mice express human α-synuclein with A53T mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee et al., 2002</xref>) and exhibit α-synuclein phosphorylation, α-synuclein oligomer accumulation, synapse loss, and memory impairment at 6 months, and motor dysfunction at 9 months, indicating that they can be used as a model of DLB at 6–8 months and as a model of PD after 9 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Umeda et al., 2021a</xref>). ZSS powder was orally administered to 8-month-old mice (mean body weight, 29.8 g) at 0.1 mg/shot for 1 month. Motor function of mice was assessed by the rotarod test. The treatment significantly improved motor function of Tg mice to a level similar to that of non-Tg littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). α-Synuclein pathology was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The levels of phosphorylated α-synuclein and α-synuclein oligomers in the hippocampus were significantly reduced by the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). BDNF expression was examined in the cerebral cortex and substantia nigra; the latter brain region is particularly vulnerable to α-synuclein-induced neurodegeneration, leading to the motor dysfunction in PD. ZSS powder significantly enhanced BDNF expression in both brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Neurogenesis plays an important role in learning and memory and is shown to decrease in chronic stress, aging, and neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Horgusluoglu et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we examined neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and substantia nigra. Neurogenesis in Tg mice showed a tendency to decrease in both brain regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). ZSS powder significantly increased neurogenesis to levels higher than those in non-Tg littermates. These results suggest that ZSS simple crush powder is effective at repairing damaged neurons. As mentioned above, Huα-Syn(A53T) mice can be used as a model of DLB at 6–8 months. Thus, we investigated the effect of ZSS powder on DLB using younger mice.

This may be because when DNA oxidation products are continuously produced with aging, autoimmune response is strongly induced to remove them, and as a result, the increase in 8-OHdG is suppressed. Such a persistent immune reaction may cause chronic inflammation leading to cellular senescence. ZSS powder significantly reduced the levels of 8-OHdG and its autoantibodies to levels similar to or lower than those in water-treated young mice.

Contrary to our expectation, the powder contained less of these substances than the extract (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

It removed Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein oligomers, restored synaptophysin levels, enhanced BDNF expression and neurogenesis, and improved cognitive and motor function in mouse models of AD, FTD, DLB, and PD. Furthermore, in normal aged mice, ZSS powder reduced DNA oxidation and cellular senescence, increased synaptophysin, BDNF, and neurogenesis, and enhanced cognition to levels similar to those in young mice. We proposed that neurodegenerative disease-prophylactic agents should have activities to remove toxic oligomers of etiologic proteins, repair damaged neurons, and suppress cellular senescence. Our results show that the ZSS powder meets these requirements. In addition, such prophylactic agents must be safe, inexpensive, and noninvasively available because the preventive treatment would last for a long period. Since ZSS is safe (i.e. treated as a non-pharmaceutical in Japan), cheaper than medicines, and orally available, the powder can meet these demands as well. Thus, ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for aged people to avoid neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Effects of zizyphi spinosi semen (ZSS) simple crush powder on neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.</title><p>Oral administration of ZSS powder ameliorates pathological phenotypes in mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, and, furthermore, rejuvenates the brain condition of aged mice to a level comparable to that of young mice.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-100737-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Traditional Chinese medicines are generally formulated as a combination of several herbs. This is because combining multiple herbs can increase efficacy, reduce side effects, and create new synergy actions. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine aims to cure disease by balancing the body rather than targeting specific symptoms or molecules, which could be efficiently achieved by combining various herbal medicines. For example, in Japan, a Chinese medicine called Yokukansan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ikarashi and Mizoguchi, 2016</xref>) is often prescribed to relieve the peripheral symptoms of dementia, and it is composed of seven kinds of herbs not including ZSS. As for ZSS, it is prescribed in combination with other herbs to stabilize the mind and cure palpitation, anxiety, and insomnia, and improve amnesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hua et al., 2022</xref>). However, in order to facilitate the procurement of raw materials and reduce costs, it is better to use fewer herbs as long as the same effect can be obtained. Our results show that ZSS ameliorates core symptoms of dementia by clearing toxic protein oligomers and repairing damaged neurons, without being combined with other herbs. The peripheral symptoms of dementia, known as BPSD (behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia), include hallucination, delusion, depression, wandering, and agitation. Since ZSS is also effective on insomnia, depression, and anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hua et al., 2022</xref>), ZSS could potentially be used alone for both the core and peripheral symptoms of dementia.</p><p>Among the three preparations of ZSS we tested, the simple crush powder displayed the strongest effects, and the extraction residue showed the same efficacy as the hot water extract. We had observed a similar tendency with other herbs, Mamaki and <italic>Acorus tatarinowii/gramineus</italic> leaves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Umeda et al., 2024b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Umeda et al., 2024a</xref>). These results support our previous hypothesis that hot water extraction cannot necessarily recover all active ingredients of medicinal herbs, rather, some functional components will be lost during the process. Identifying true active ingredients would be useful not only for the development of functional foods but also for that of pharmaceuticals to prevent neurodegenerative diseases. ZSS contains various ingredients, and several major components have been identified: jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Liu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hua et al., 2022</xref>). These substances have been shown to restore cognitive function in disease model mice. For example, oral administration of jujuboside A promotes Aβ clearance and improves cognition in APP/PS1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, its intracerebroventricular injection prevents sleep loss-induced memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tabassum et al., 2019</xref>) and ameliorates cognitive impairment in Aβ42-injected mice by reducing the level of Aβ42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Jujuboside B, when administered intraperitoneally, suppresses febrile seizure in lipopolysaccharide-injected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jin et al., 2023</xref>). Oral administration of spinosin improves the cognition of Aβ42 oligomer-injected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ko et al., 2015</xref>) and in adult mice increasing neurogenesis as well as the levels of BDNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, its intracerebroventricular injection attenuates cognitive impairment and restores the levels of BDNF in Aβ42-injected mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). Based on these literatures, we compared the content of jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin in our ZSS preparations. Despite that the effects of simple crush powder were stronger than that of hot water extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the content of the three compounds in the powder was lower than that in the extract (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In addition, while ZSS extract sufficiently improved mouse memory at 0.5 mg/shot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), a mixture of jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin failed to do so at doses equivalent to their amounts in 0.5 mg ZSS extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These results suggest that the active components of ZSS are other than jujuboside A, jujuboside B, or spinosin. In aged mice, ZSS powder reduced the levels of 8-OHdG and its autoantibodies in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); nevertheless, the radical-scavenging ability of ZSS powder was very weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that the antioxidant activity of ZSS powder is not due to the direct action of ZSS components on free radicals. It has been shown that plant-derived dietary fibers can make the intestinal environment favorable for gut microbes and consequently affect brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Puhlmann and de Vos, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cuervo-Zanatta et al., 2023</xref>). The effects of ZSS powder on neuropathology, cognitive and motor function, oxidative stress, and cellular senescence may be attributed, to a greater or lesser extent, to the action of dietary fibers on gut microbiota. ZSS extraction residue is also expected to contain a significant amount of dietary fibers, which may account for its nootropic activity.</p><p>The present study showed that ZSS has a broad spectrum against Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein, but it remains to be studied whether ZSS is also effective against TDP-43, another protein accumulated in FTD and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Furthermore, we used three different mouse models of neurodegenerative diseases, but they do not fully represent human pathology, and, therefore, clinical studies are required to evaluate the true efficacy of ZSS in humans. ZSS has a long history of traditional Chinese medicine and can be treated as a non-pharmaceutical in Japan, suggesting its safety. However, since simple crushing is a different processing method than usual, the safety of the long-term intake of ZSS powder needs to be confirmed. Our results suggest that ZSS powder has antiaging effects. Twelve hallmarks of aging have been proposed, including cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, chronic inflammation, dysbiosis, and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">López-Otín et al., 2023</xref>). By clarifying which of these hallmarks, in addition to cellular senescence, are improved by ZSS powder, the antiaging effects of the powder can be more clearly understood. Although we don’t know the true active components in ZSS powder, and their identification may be necessary to develop ZSS-derived functional foods, our findings suggest that ZSS simple crush powder is a promising dietary material for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases and brain aging.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of hot water extract, simple crush powder, and extraction residue of ZSS</title><p>Dried ZSS (Origin: Hebei Province, China) was obtained from Auropure LifeScience Co, Ltd.

Measurements from the same regions of the left and right hemisphere were averaged for each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Biochemical analysis of DNA oxidation</title><p>Oxidative stress in mouse brain was quantified by measuring the levels of 8-OHdG, a marker of DNA oxidation caused by ROS, using the Highly Sensitive ELISA kit for 8-OHdG (Japan Institute for the Control of Aging, Fukuroi, Japan). 8-OHdG formed on chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA is excised by the action of repair enzymes and released from the cell. Brain tissues were homogenized by sonication at 100 mg wet tissue/mL in PBS containing protease inhibitor cocktail and centrifuged at 1000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatants were collected and their protein content was measured. Then, the supernatants were separated into two fractions, 8-OHdG fraction and its autoantibody fraction, using the Amicon Ultra Centrifugal 100 kDa MWCO Filters (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany). The filtrates containing 8-OHdG were mixed with the primary antibody and applied to the antigen plate. The concentrated samples on the filter, which contain autoantibodies to 8-OHdG, were recovered, diluted with PBS, and allowed to react with the antigen plate in the absence of the primary antibody. Standard curve for autoantibodies was created using the primary antibody provided in the kit, with the stock concentration set at 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Measurement of radical-scavenging ability of ZSS powder</title><p>Radical-scavenging ability of ZSS was measured using the SOD Assay Kit-WST (Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan). Superoxide dismutase (SOD)-like activity of samples against superoxide generated by xanthine oxidase was monitored with WST-1 which is reduced by superoxide and changes to WST-1 formazan to develop color. Simple crush powder of ZSS was solubilized in saline at 10 mg/mL by sonication. As a positive control, simple crush powder of Mamaki leaves, which is known to have strong antioxidant activity, was used. After centrifugation at 2000 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatants were passed through 0.45 μm filter. The filtrates were allowed to react with WST and enzyme working solutions included in the kit. Inhibition curves were created from the absorbance at 450 nm, and SOD-like activity in the samples was calculated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All experiments and data analyses were performed under unblinded, open-label conditions. Comparisons of means among more than two groups were performed using ANOVA or two-factor repeated measures ANOVA (for the behavioral tests), followed by Fisher’s PLSD test. Differences with a p value of &lt;0.05 were considered significant.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is an employee of Cerebro Pharma Inc, which funded this study and applied for a patent on ZSS.

It removes Aβ, tau, and α-synuclein oligomers, restores synaptophysin levels, enhances BDNF expression and neurogenesis, and improves cognitive and motor functions in mouse AD, FTD, DLB, and PD models. Additionally, ZSS powder reduces DNA oxidation and cellular senescence in normal-aged mice, increases synaptophysin, BDNF, and neurogenesis, and enhances cognition to levels comparable to young mice.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) While the study demonstrates that ZSS has protective effects across a wide range of animal models, including AD, FTD, DLB, PD, and both young and aged mice, it is broad and lacks a detailed investigation into the underlying mechanisms. This is the most significant concern.</p><p>(2) The authors highlight that the non-extracted simple crush powder of ZSS shows more substantial effects than its hot water extract and extraction residue. However, the manuscript provides very limited data comparing the effects of these three extracts.</p><p>(3) The authors have not provided a rationale for the dosing concentrations used, nor have they tested the effects of the treatment in normal mice to verify its impact under physiological conditions.</p><p>(4) Regarding the assessment of cognitive function in mice, the authors only utilized the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test, which includes a five-day spatial learning training phase followed by a probe trial. The authors focused solely on the learning phase. However, it is relevant to note that data from the learning phase primarily reflects the learning ability of the mice, while the probe trial is more indicative of memory. Therefore, it is essential that probe trial data be included for a more comprehensive analysis. A justification should be included to explain why the latency of 1st is about 50s not 60s.</p><p>(5) The BDNF immunohistochemical staining in the manuscript appears to be non-specific.</p><p>(6) The central pathological regions in PD are the substantia nigra and striatum.

However, ZSS contains other active substances besides jujuboside A, jujuboside B, and spinosin, which is more concerning. More critical data may be obtained if experiments have been designed to search for active substances.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion.
