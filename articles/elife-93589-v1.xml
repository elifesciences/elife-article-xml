spatial frequency (SF) in the primate cortex is vital for unraveling visual processing in object recognition. While many studies focus on SF in the primary visual cortex, the characteristics and interaction of SF with category representation remain unclear. To explore SF representation in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of macaques, we conducted extracellular recordings with complex stimuli systematically filtered by SF. Our findings reveal explicit SF coding at both single-neuron and population levels. Temporal dynamics analysis of SF representation reveals that low SF (LSF) is decoded faster than high SF (HSF), and the SF preference dynamically shifts from LSF to HSF over time. Additionally, the SF representation for each neuron forms a profile that predicts category selectivity at the population level. IT neurons cluster into four groups based on SF preference, each with distinct category coding behaviors. Notably, HSF-preferring neurons show the highest category decoding for faces. Despite the existing connection between SF and category coding, we have identified uncorrelated representations of SF and category. Unlike category coding, SF is more sparsely represented and depends more on individual neurons. These findings dissociate SF and category representations, underscoring SFâs pivotal role in object recognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>spatial frequency</kwd><kwd>inferior temporal cortex</kwd><kwd>object recognition</kwd><kwd>coarse-to-fine processing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatial frequency is explicitly and dynamically represented in the primate inferior temporal cortex, revealing distinct neural populations that differentially support object recognition, specially emphasizing high-frequency contributions to face processing.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spatial frequency (SF) constitutes a pivotal component of visual stimuli encoding in the primate visual system, encompassing the number of grating cycles within a specific visual angle. Higher SF (HSF) corresponds to intricate details, while lower SF (LSF) captures broader information. Previous psychophysical studies have compellingly demonstrated the profound influence of SF manipulation on object recognition and categorization processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joubert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schyns and Oliva, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashtiani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caplette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Bar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craddock et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jahfari et al., 2013</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saneyoshi and Michimata, 2015</xref> have highlighted the significance of HSF and LSF for categorical/coordinate processing and in object recognition and decision-making, respectively. The sequence in which SF content is presented also affects the categorization performance, with coarse-to-fine presentation leading to faster categorizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kauffmann et al., 2015</xref>). Considering face as a particular object, several studies showed that middle and higher SFs are more critical for face recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorentini et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayes et al., 1986</xref>). Another vital theory suggested by psychophysical studies is the coarse-to-fine perception of visual stimuli, which states that LSF or global contents are processed faster than HSF or local contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Bentin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kauffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rokszin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rotshtein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schyns and Oliva, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yardley et al., 2012</xref>). Despite the extensive reliance on psychophysical studies to examine the influence of SF on categorization tasks, our understanding of SF representation within primate visual systems, particularly in higher visual areas like the inferior temporal (IT) cortex, remains constrained due to the limited research in this specific domain.</p><p>One of the seminal studies investigating the neural correlates of SF processing and its significance in object recognition was conducted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar, 2003</xref>. Their research proposes a topâdown mechanism driven by the rapid processing of LSF content, facilitating object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenske et al., 2006</xref>). The exploration of SF representation has revealed the engagement of distinct brain regions in processing various SF contents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bastin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bermudez et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaumon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Bar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fintzi and Mahon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaska et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iidaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oram and Perrett, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peyrin et al., 2010</xref>). More specifically, the orbitofrontal cortex has been identified as accessing global (LSF) and local (identity; HSF) information in the right and left hemispheres, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fintzi and Mahon, 2014</xref>). The V3A area exhibits low-pass tuning curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaska et al., 1988</xref>), while HSF processing activates the left fusiform gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iidaka et al., 2004</xref>). Neural responses in the IT cortex, which play a pivotal role in object recognition and face perception, demonstrate correlations with the SF components of complex stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bermudez et al., 2009</xref>). Despite the acknowledged importance of SF as a critical characteristic influencing object recognition, a more comprehensive understanding of its representation is warranted. By unraveling the neural mechanisms underlying SF representation in the IT cortex, we can enrich our comprehension of the processing and categorization of visual information.</p><p>To address this issue, we investigate the SF representation in the IT cortex of two passive-viewing macaque monkeys. We studied the neural responses of the IT cortex to intact, SF-filtered (five ranges), and phase-scrambled stimuli. SF decoding is observed in both population- and single-level representations. Investigating the decoding pattern of individual SF bands reveals a course-to-fine manner in recall performance where LSF is decoded more accurately than HSF. Temporal dynamics analysis shows that SF coding exhibits a coarse-to-fine pattern, emphasizing faster processing of lower frequencies. Moreover, SF representation forms an average LSF-preferred tuning across neuron responses at 70â170 ms after stimulus onset. Then, the average preferred SF shifts monotonically to HSF in time after the early phase of the response, with its peak at 220 ms after the stimulus onset. The LSF-preferred tuning turns into an HSF-preferred one in the late neuron response phase.</p><p>Next, we examined the relationship between SF and category coding. We found a strong positive correlation between SF and category coding performances in sub-populations of neurons. SF coding capability of individual neurons is highly correlated with the category coding capacity of the sub-population. Moreover, clustering neurons based on their SF responses indicates a relationship between SF representation and category coding. Employing the neuron responses to five SF ranges considering only the scrambled stimuli, an SF profile was identified for each neuron that predicts the categorization performance of that neuron in a population of the neurons sharing the same profile. Neurons whose response increases with increasing SF encode faces better than other neuron populations with other profiles.</p><p>Given the co-existence of SF and category coding within the IT cortex and the prediction capability of SF for category selectively, we examined the neural mechanisms underlying SF and category representation. In single level, we found no correlation between SF and category coding capability of single neurons. At the population level, we found that the contribution of neurons to SF coding did not correlate with their contribution to category coding. Delving into the characteristics of SF coding, we found that individual neurons carry more independent SF-related information compared to the encoding of categories (face vs. non-face). Analyzing the temporal dynamics of each neuronâs contribution to population-level SF coding reveals a shift in sparsity during different phases of the response. In the early phase (70â170 ms), the contribution is more sparse than category coding. However, this behavior is reversed in the late phase (170â270 ms), with SF coding showing a less sparse contribution.</p><p>Finally, we compared the representation of SF in the IT cortex with several popular convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We found that CNNs exhibited robust SF coding capabilities with significantly higher accuracies than the IT cortex. Like the IT cortex, LSF content showed higher decoding performance than the HSF content. However, while there were similarities in SF representation, CNNs did not replicate the SF-based profiles predicting neuron category selectivity observed in the IT cortex. We posit that our findings establish neural correlates pertinent to behavioral investigations into SFâs role in object recognition. Additionally, our results shed light on how the IT cortex represents and utilizes SF during the object recognition process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SF coding in the IT cortex</title><p>To study the SF representation in the IT cortex, we designed a passive stimulus presentation task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, see Materials and methods). The task comprises two phases: the selectivity and the main. During the selectivity phase, 155 stimuli, organized into two super-ordinate and four ordinate categories, were presented (with a 50-ms stimulus presentation followed by a 500-ms blank period, see Materials and methods). Next, the six most responsive stimuli are selected along with nine fixed stimuli (six faces and three non-face objects, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) to be presented during the main phase (33-ms stimulus presentation followed by a 465-ms blank, see Materials and methods). Each stimulus is phase scrambled, and then the intact and scrambled versions are filtered in five SF ranges (R1âR5, with R5 representing the highest frequency band, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), resulting in a total of 180 unique stimuli presented in each session (see Materials and methods). Each session consists of 15 blocks, with each stimulus presented once per block in a random order. The IT neurons of passive-viewing monkeys are recorded where the cells cover all areas of the IT area uniformly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We only considered the responsive neurons (see Materials and methods), totaling 266 (157 M1 and 109 M2). A sample neuron (neuron #155, M1) peristimulus time histogram is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref> in response to the scrambled stimuli for R1, R3, and R5. R1 exhibits the most pronounced firing rate, indicating the highest neural activity level. In contrast, R5 displays the lowest firing rate, suggesting an LSF-preferred trend in the neuronâs response. To explore the SF representation and coding capability of IT neurons, each stimulus in each session block is represented by an <italic>N</italic>-element vector where the <italic>i</italic>th element is the average response of the <italic>i</italic>th neuron to that stimulus within a 50-ms time window (see Materials and methods).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and spatial frequency (SF) coding.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) <italic>Experimental design</italic>. The design of the experiment involved the collection of responses from inferior temporal (IT) neurons to 15 stimuli (including six faces, three non-faces, and six selective stimuli, see Materials and methods) in six SF bands (intact and R1âR5, see Materials and methods), and two versions (scrambled and unscrambled) using a passive presentation task. The presentation of blocks starts if the monkey preserves fixation for 200 ms. Each block consisted of a 33-ms stimulus presentation followed by a blank screen with a fixation point of 465 ms, and each stimulus was presented 15 times. The recorded signals were sorted, and visually responsive neurons were selected (<italic>N</italic> = 266, see Materials and methods). (<bold>b</bold>) <italic>A sample of the fixed stimulus set</italic>. This panel shows three (out of six) faces, three non-faces, and one scrambled sample stimulus.

The peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) of a sample neuron (<italic>N</italic> = 151, M1) for scrambled stimuli is depicted. To generate a response vector for a given stimulus or trial, the responses of each neuron were averaged in a 50-ms time window centered around the relevant time point. The PSTH was smoothed using a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 20 ms. The responses of three SF bands (R1, R3, and R5) are shown for better illustration. (<bold>d</bold>) <italic>SF coding exists in the IT cortex</italic>. The decoding performance of SF ranges using scrambled stimuli is shown over time. Single- and population-level representations were fed into a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) algorithm to predict the SF range of the scrambled stimuli.

The accuracy value is normalized by subtracting the chance level (0.2). At single level, the accuracy surpasses the chance level by an average of 4.02% at 120 ms after stimulus onset. We only considered neurons demonstrating at least three consecutive time windows with accuracy significantly greater than the chance level, resulting in a subset of 105 neurons. The maximum accuracy of a single neuron was 19.08% higher than the chance level (unnormalized accuracy is 39.08%, neuron #193, M2). Subsequently, the SF decoding performance of the IT population is investigated (R1âR5 and scrambled stimuli only, see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref> also illustrates the SF classification accuracy across time in population-level representations.

To calculate the preferred SF for each neuron, we multiplied the firing rate by the SF range and normalized the values (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> demonstrates that following the early phase of the response (70â170 ms), the average preferred SF shifts toward HSF, reaching its peak at 215 ms after stimulus onset (preferred SF, 0.54 Â± 0.15). Furthermore, a second peak emerges at 320 ms after stimulus onset (preferred SF, 0.22 Â± 0.16), indicating a shift in the average preferred SF in the IT cortex toward higher frequencies. To analyze this shift, we divided the time course into two intervals of 70â170 ms, where the response peak of the neurons happens, and 170â270 ms, where the first peak of SF preference occurs. We calculated the percentage of the neurons that significantly responded to a specific SF range higher than others (one-way ANOVA with a significance level of 0.05, see Materials and methods) for the two time intervals. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref> shows the percentage of the neurons in each SF range for the two time steps. In the early phase of the response (T1, 70â170 ms), the highest percentage of the neurons belongs to R1, 40.19%, and a decreasing trend is observed as we move toward higher frequencies (R1 = 40.19%, R2 = 19.60%, R3 = 13.72%, R4 = 10.78%, R5 = 15.68%). Moving to T2, the percentage of neurons responding to R1 higher than the others remains stable, dropping to 38.46%. The number of neurons in R2 also drops to under 5% from 19.60% observed in T1. On the other hand, the percentage of the neurons in R5 reaches 46.66% in T2 compared to 15.68% in T1 (higher than R1 in T1). This observation indicates that the increase in preferred SF is due to a substantial increase in the selective neurons to HSF, while the response of the neurons to R1 is roughly unchanged. To further understand the population response to various SF ranges, the average response across neurons for R1âR5 is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref> (bottom panels). In the first interval, T1, an average LSF-preferred tuning is observed where the average neuron response decreases as the SF increases (normalized firing rate for R1 = 1.09 Â± 0.01, R2 = 1.05 Â± 0.01, R3 = 1.03 Â± 0.01, R4 = 1.03 Â± 0.02, R5 = 1.00 Â± 0.01, Bonferroni corrected p-value for R2 &lt; R5, 0.006). Considering the strength of responses to scrambled stimuli, the average firing rate in response to scrambled stimuli is 26.3 Hz, which is significantly higher than the response observed between â50 and 50 ms, where it is 23.4 Hz (p-value = 3 Ã 10<sup>â5</sup>). In comparison, the mean response to intact face stimuli is 30.5 Hz, while non-face stimuli elicit an average response of 28.8 Hz. The distribution of neuron responses for scrambled, face, and non-face in T1 is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>. During the second time interval, excluding R1, the decreasing pattern transformed to an increasing one, with the response to R5 surpassing that of R1 (normalized firing rate for R1 = 0.80 Â± 0.02, R2 = 0.73 Â± 0.02, R3 = 0.76 Â± 0.02, R4 = 0.81 Â± 0.02, R5 = 0.84 Â± 0.01, Bonferroni corrected p-value for R2 &lt; R4, 0.022, R2 &lt; R5, 0.0003, and R3 &lt; R5, 0.03).

The distribution of neuron responses is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>.

Given the co-existence of SF and category coding in this region, we examine the relationship between SF and category codings. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, while the average preferred SF across the neurons shifts to HSF, the most responsive SF range varies across individual neurons. To investigate the relation between SF representation and category coding, we identified an SF profile by fitting a quadratic curve to the neuron responses across SF ranges (R1âR5, phase-scrambled stimuli only). Then, according to the fitted curve, an SF profile is determined for each neuron (see Materials and methods). Five distinct profiles were identified based on the tuning curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>): (1) flat, where the neuron has no preferred SF (not included in the results), (2) LSF preferred (LP), where the neuron response decreases as SF increases, (3) HSF preferred (HP), where neuron response increases as the SF shifts toward higher SFs, (4) U-shaped where the neuron response to middle SF is lower than that of HSF or LSF, and (5) inverse U-shaped (IU), where the neuron response to middle SF is higher than that of LSF and HSF. The U-shaped and HSF-preferred profiles represent the largest and smallest populations, respectively. To check the robustness of the profiles, considering the trial-to-trial variability, the strength of SF selectivity in each profile is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1âfigure 3</xref>, by forming the profile of each neuron based on half of the trials and then plotting the average SF responses with the other half. Following profile identification, the object coding capability of each profile population is assessed. Here, instead of LDA, we employ the separability index (SI) introduced by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dehaqani et al., 2016</xref>, because of the LDA limitation in fully capturing the information differences between groups as it categorizes samples as correctly classified or misclassified.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Spatial frequency (SF) profile predicts category coding.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) <italic>SF profile predicts category selectivity</italic>.

Neurons were then categorized into four groups based on the fitting of a quadratic function to their responses (see Materials and methods). Each panel presents the average neuron responses within each category for SF ranges R1âR5, with error bars indicating the SEM of the response values. The percentage of the neurons in each category is displayed at the top of each panel. The âflatâ category, where the response to no SF was higher than others, was excluded from this analysis.

The SI value and SF profile are determined within the time window of 70â170 ms after stimulus onset. The high SF (HSF)-preferred population exhibited significantly higher face SI compared to the other groups. The low SF (LSF)-preferred population displayed a significant difference in face and non-face SI. On the other hand, the IU profile indicates a significantly higher SI value for the non-face compared to the face. The U-shaped profile did not show any significant differences between the face and the non-face. These results suggest that the neuron's response to various SF bands can predict its decoding capability. (<bold>c, d</bold>) <italic>The relation between SF and category coding in sub-populations</italic>. Initially, the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) method was employed to calculate the individual neuron's performance in the single-level category and SF coding. Next, a sorting procedure based on SF (panel c) and category (panel d) coding performances was conducted to create sub-populations of neurons exhibiting similar capabilities (see Materials and methods). The scatter plot of the category and SF coding accuracy of these sub-populations demonstrated a notably high degree of positive correlation between SF and category accuracies in the inferior temporal (IT) cortex.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3sdata1"><label>Figure 3âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Source data for neuronal responses, SF profiles, and category selectivity, including separability indices and decoding accuracy for sub-populations of inferior temporal neurons.</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-93589-fig3-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93589-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><p>To examine the face and non-face information separately, SI is calculated for face vs. scrambled and non-face vs. scrambled. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> displays the identified profiles, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> indicates the average SI value during 70â170 ms after the stimulus onset.

This observation underscores the importance of middle and higher frequencies for face representation. The LSF-preferred profile also exhibits significantly higher face SI than non-face objects (p-value &lt;0.001). On the other hand, in the IU profile, non-face information surpasses face SI (p-value &lt;0.001), indicating the importance of middle frequency for the non-face objects. Finally, in the U profile, there is no significant difference between the face and non-face objects (face vs. non-face p-value = 0.36).</p><p>To assess whether the SF profiles distinguish category selectivity or merely evaluate the neuronâs responsiveness, we quantified the number of face/non-face-selective neurons in the 70- to 170-ms time window. Our analysis shows a total of 43 face-selective neurons and 36 non-face-selective neurons (FDR-corrected p-value &lt;0.05). The results indicate a higher proportion of face-selective neurons in LP and HP, while a greater number of non-face-selective neurons is observed in the IU category (number of face/non-face-selective neurons: LP = 13/3, HP = 6/2, IU = 3/9). The U category exhibits a roughly equal distribution of face and non-face-selective neurons (U = 14/13). This finding reinforces the connection between category selectivity and the identified profiles. We then analyzed the average neuron response to faces and non-faces within each profile. The difference between the firing rates for faces and non-faces in none of the profiles is significant (face/non-face average firing rate (Hz): LP = 36.72/28.77, HP = 28.55/25.52, IU = 21.55/27.25, U = 38.48/36.28, rank-sum with significance level of 0.05). Although the observed differences are not statistically significant, they provide support for the association between profiles and categories rather than mere responsiveness.</p><p>Next, to examine the relation between the SF (category) coding capacity of the single neurons and the category (SF) coding capability of the population level, we calculated the correlation between coding performance at the population level and the coding performance of single neurons within that population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). In other words, we investigated the relation between single and population levels of coding capabilities between SF and category. The SF (or category) coding performance of a sub-population of 20 neurons that have roughly the same single-level coding capability of the category (or SF) is examined. Neurons were sorted based on their SF or category performances, resulting in two separate groups of ranksâone for SF and another for category. Subsequently, we selected sub-populations of neurons with similar ranks according to SF or category (see Materials and methods). Each sub-population comprises 20 neurons with approximately similar SF (or category) performance levels. Then, the SF and category decoding accuracy is calculated for each sub-population. The scatterplot of individual vs. sub-population accuracy demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the sub-population performance and the accuracy of individual neurons within those populations. Specifically, the correlation value for SF- and category-sorted groups is 0.66 (p-value = 10<sup>â31</sup>) and 0.39 (p-value = 10<sup>â10</sup>), respectively. This observation illustrates that SF coding capacity at single-level representations significantly predicts category coding capacity at the population level.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Uncorrelated mechanisms for SF and category coding</title><p>As both SF and category coding exist in the IT cortex at both the single-neuron and population levels, we investigated their underlying coding mechanisms (for single and population levels separately). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref> displays the scatter plot of SF and category coding capacity for individual neurons. The correlation between SF and category accuracy across individual neurons shows no significant relationship (correlation: 0.024 and p-value: 0.53), suggesting two uncorrelated mechanisms for SF and category coding. To explore the population-level coding, we considered neuron weights in the LDA classifier as indicators of each neuronâs contribution to population coding. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> indicates the scatter plot of the neuronâs weights in SF and category decoding.

Therefore, SF representation relies more on individual neuron representations, suggesting a sparse mechanism of SF coding where single-level neuron information is less redundant. In contrast, single-level representations of category appear to be more redundant and robust against information loss or noise at the level of individual neurons. We utilized conditional mutual information (CMI) between pairs of neurons conditioned on the label, SF (LSF (R1 and R2) vs. HSF (R4 and R5)) or category, to assess the information redundancy across the neurons.

Numerous psychophysical studies have underscored the significant impact of SF on object recognition, highlighting the importance of its representation. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the first attempt to systematically examine the SF representation in a high-level area, that is, the IT cortex, using extracellular recording. Understanding SF representation is crucial, as it can elucidate the object recognition procedure in the IT cortex.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate explicit SF coding at both the single-neuron and population levels, with LSF being decoded faster and more accurately than HSF. During the early phase of the response, we observe a preference for LSF, which shifts toward a preference for HSF during the late phase. Next, we made profiles based on SF-only (phase-scrambled stimuli) responses for each neuron to predict its category selectivity. Our results show a direct relationship between the populationâs category coding capability and the SF coding capability of individual neurons. While we observed a relation between SF and category coding, we have found uncorrelated representations. Unlike category coding, SF relies more on sparse, individual neuron representations. Finally, when comparing the responses of IT with those of CNNs, it is evident that while SF coding exists in CNNs, the SF profile observed in the IT cortex is notably absent. Our results are based on grouping the neurons of the two monkeys; however, the results remain consistent when looking at the data from individual monkeys as illustrated in Appendix 2. However, for neurons preferring LSF, we observed some inconsistencies across monkeys, which may reflect individual differences or sampling variability. These findings highlight the complexity of SF processing in the IT cortex and suggest the need for further research to explore these variations.</p><p>The influence of SF on object recognition has been extensively investigated through psychophysical studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashtiani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Caplette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cheung and Bar, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Craddock et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Joubert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schyns and Oliva, 1994</xref>). One frequently explored theory is the coarse-to-fine nature of SF processing in object recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gao and Bentin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kauffmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rokszin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rotshtein et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schyns and Oliva, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yardley et al., 2012</xref>). This aligns with our observation that the onset of LSF is significantly lower than HSF. Different SF bands carry distinct information, progressively conveying coarse-to-fine shape details as we transition from LSF to HSF. Psychophysical studies have indicated the utilization of various SF bands for distinct categorization tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rotshtein et al., 2010</xref>). Considering the face as a behaviorally demanded object, psychophysical studies have observed the influence of various SF bands on face recognition. These studies consistently show that enhanced face recognition performance is achieved in the middle and higher SF bands compared to LSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Awasthi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheung et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fiorentini et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayes et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeantet et al., 2019</xref>). These observations resonate with the identified SF profiles in our study. Neurons that exhibit heightened responses as SF shifts toward HSF demonstrate superior coding of faces compared to other neuronal groups.</p><p>Unlike psychophysical studies, imaging studies in this area have been relatively limited. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gaska et al., 1988</xref> observed low-pass tuning curves in the V3A area, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref> reported an average low-pass tuning curve in the superior colliculus (SC). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Purushothaman et al., 2014</xref> identified two distinct types of neurons in V1 based on their response to SF. The majority of neurons in the first group exhibited a monotonically shifting preference toward HSF over time. In contrast, the second group showed an initial increase in preferred SF followed by a decrease. Our findings align with these observations, showing a rise in preferred SF starting at 170 ms after stimulus onset, followed by a decline at 220 ms after stimulus onset. Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2023</xref> found that LSF is the preferred band for over 40% of V4 neurons. This finding is also consistent with our observations, where approximately 40% of neurons consistently exhibited the highest firing rates in response to LSF throughout all response phases. Collectively, these results suggest that the average LP tuning curve observed in the IT cortex could be a characteristic inherited from the lower areas in the visual hierarchy. Moreover, examining the course-to-fine theory of SF processing, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Purushothaman et al., 2014</xref> observed a faster response to LSF compared to HSF in SC and V1, which resonates with our course-to-fine observation in SF decoding. When analyzing the relationship between the SF content of complex stimuli and IT responses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bermudez et al., 2009</xref> observed a correlation between neural responses in the IT cortex and the SF content of the stimuli. This finding is in line with our observations, as decoding results directly from the distinct patterns exhibited by various SF bands in neural responses.</p><p>To rule out the degraded contrast sensitivity of the visual system to medium and high SF information because of the brief exposure time, we repeated the analysis with 200 ms exposure time as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1âfigure 4</xref> which indicates the same LSF-preferred results. Furthermore, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the average firing rate of IT neurons for HSF could be higher than LSF in the late response phase. It indicates that the amount of HSF input received by the IT neurons in the later phase is as much as LSF; however, its impact on the IT response is observable in the later phase of the response. Thus, the LSF preference is because of the temporal advantage of the LSF processing rather than contrast sensitivity. Next, according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, 6% of the neurons are HSF-preferred and their firing rate in HSF is comparable to the LSF firing rate in the LSF-preferred group. This analysis is carried out in the early phase of the response (70â170 ms). While most of the neurons prefer LSF, this observation shows that there is an HSF input that excites a small group of neurons. Importantly, findings involving small neuronal populations can still be meaningful, as studies like <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dalgleish et al., 2020</xref> have demonstrated that perception can arise from the activity of as few as 14 neurons in the mouse cortex, emphasizing the robustness of sparse coding. Additionally, the highest SI belongs to the HSF-preferred profile in the early phase of the response, which supports the impact of the HSF part of the input. Similar LSF-preferred responses are also reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref> (50 ms for SC) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>) (3.5â4 s for V2 and V4). Therefore, our results show that the LSF-preferred nature of the IT responses in terms of firing rate and recall is not due to the weakness or lack of input source (or information) for HSF but rather to the processing nature of the SF in the IT cortex.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hong et al., 2016</xref> suggested that the neural mechanisms responsible for developing tolerance to identity-preserving transform also contribute to explicitly representing these categoryâorthogonal transforms, such as rotation. Extending this perspective to SF, our results similarly suggest an explicit representation of SF within the IT population. However, unlike transforms such as rotation, the neural mechanisms in IT leverage various SF bands for various categorization tasks. Furthermore, our analysis introduced a novel SF-only profile for the first time predicting category selectivity.</p><p>These findings prompt the question of why the IT cortex explicitly represents and codes the SF content of the input stimuli. In our perspective, the explicit representation and coding of SF contents in the IT cortex facilitates object recognition. The population of the neurons in the IT cortex becomes selective for complex object features, combining SFs to transform simple visual features into more complex object representations. However, the specific mechanism underlying this combination is yet to be known. The diverse SF contents present in each image carry valuable information that may contribute to generating expectations in predictive coding during the early phase, thereby facilitating information processing in subsequent phases. This topâdown mechanism is suggested by the works of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bar, 2003</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fenske et al., 2006</xref>.</p><p>Moreover, each object has a unique âcharacteristic SF signatureâ, representing its specific arrangement of SFs. âCharacteristic SF signaturesâ refer to the unique patterns or profiles of SFs associated with different objects or categories of objects. When we look at visual stimuli, such as objects or scenes, they contain specific arrangements of different SFs. Imagine a scenario where we have two objects, such as a cat and a car. These objects will have different textures and shapes, which correspond to different distributions of SFs. The cat, for instance, might have a higher concentration of mid-range SFs related to its fur texture, while the car might have more pronounced LSFs that represent its overall shape and structure. The IT cortex encodes these signatures, facilitating robust discrimination and recognition of objects based on their distinctive SF patterns.</p><p>The concept of âcharacteristic SF signaturesâ is also related to the âSF tuningâ observed in our results. Neurons in the visual cortex, including the IT cortex, have specific tuning preferences for different SFs. Some neurons are more sensitive to HSF, while others respond better to LSF. This distribution of sensitivity allows the visual system to analyze and interpret different information related to different SF components of visual stimuli concurrently. Moreover, the IT cortexâs coding of SF can contribute to object invariance and generalization. By representing objects in terms of their SF content, the IT cortex becomes less sensitive to variations in size, position, or orientation, ensuring consistent recognition across different conditions. SF information also aids the IT cortex in categorizing objects into meaningful groups at various levels of abstraction. Neurons can selectively respond to shared SF characteristics among different object categories (assuming that objects in the same category share a level of SF characteristics), facilitating decision-making about visual stimuli. Overall, we posit that SFâs explicit representation and coding in the IT cortex enhance its proficiency in object recognition. By capturing essential details and characteristics of objects, the IT cortex creates a rich representation of the visual world, enabling us to perceive, recognize, and interact with objects in our environment.</p><p>Finally, we compared SFâs representation trends and findings within the IT cortex and the current state of the art networks in deep neural networks. CNNs stand as one of the most promising models for comprehending visual processing within the primate ventral visual processing stream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubilius, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubilius et al., 2018</xref>). Examining the higher layers of CNN models (most similar to IT), we found that randomly initialized and pre-trained CNNs can code for SF. This is consistent with our previous work on the CIFAR dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Toosi et al., 2022</xref>). Nevertheless, they do not exhibit the SF profile we observed in the IT cortex. This emphasizes the uniqueness of SF coding in the IT cortex and suggests that artificial neural networks might not fully capture the complete complexity of biological visual processing mechanisms, even when they encompass certain aspects of SF representation. Our results intimate that the IT cortex uses a different mechanism for SF coding compared to contemporary deep neural networks, highlighting the potential for innovating new approaches to consider the role of SF in the ventral stream models.</p><p>Our results are not affected by several potential confounding factors. First, each stimulus in the set also has a corresponding phase-scrambled variant. These phase-scrambled stimuli maintain the same SF characteristics as their respective face or non-face counterparts but lack shape information. This approach allows us to investigate SF representation in the IT cortex without the confounding influence of shape information. Second, our results, obtained through a passive-viewing task, remain unaffected by attention mechanisms. Third, all stimuli (intact, SF filtered, and phase scrambled) are corrected for illumination and contrast to remove the attribution of the categoryâorthogonal basic characteristics of stimuli into the results (see Materials and methods). Fourth, while our dataset does not exhibit a balance in samples per category, it is imperative to acknowledge that this imbalance does not exert an impact on our observed outcomes. We have equalized the number of samples per category when training our classification models by random sampling from the stimulus set (see Materials and methods). One limitation of our study is the relatively low number of objects in the stimulus set. However, the decoding performance of category classification (face vs. non-face) in intact stimuli is 94.2%. The recall value for objects vs. scrambled is 90.45%, and for faces vs. scrambled is 92.45 (p-value = 0.44), which indicates the high level of generalizability and validity characterizing our results. Finally, since our experiment maintains a fixed SF content in terms of both cycles per degree and cycles per image, further experiments are needed to discern whether our observations reflect sensitivity to cycles per degree or cycles per image.</p><p>In summary, we studied the SF representation within the IT cortex. Our findings reveal the existence of a sparse mechanism responsible for encoding SF in the IT cortex. Moreover, we studied the relationship between SF representation and object recognition by identifying an SF profile that predicts object recognition performance. These findings establish neural correlates of the psychophysical studies on the role of SF in object recognition and shed light on how IT represents and utilizes SF for the purpose of object recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Biological sample (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>, male)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IT cortex neurons; Neurons; Monkey</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">From two adult male macaques (10 and 11 kg); see Materials and methods</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MATLAB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MathWorks</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used for stimulus presentation, control, and analysis</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MonkeyLogic toolbox</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://monkeylogic.nimh.nih.gov/">MonkeyLogic website</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">For experimental control in MATLAB</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Python</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Python Software Foundation</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">3.10</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Used for data analysis and machine learning workflows</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PyTorch</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pytorch.org/">pytorch.org</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.0</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Deep learning framework used for neural modeling</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and recording</title><p>The activity of neurons in the IT cortex of two male macaque monkeys weighing 10 and 11 kg, respectively, was analyzed following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Society for Neuroscience Guidelines and Policies. The experimental procedures were approved by the Institute of Fundamental Science committee (Approval Code: 99/60/1/160/1). Before implanting a recording chamber in a subsequent surgery, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scans were performed to locate the prelunate gyrus and arcuate sulcus. The surgical procedures were carried out under sterile conditions and isoflurane anesthesia. Each monkey was fitted with a custom-made stainless-steel chamber, secured to the skull using titanium screws and dental acrylics. A craniotomy was performed within the 30 Ã 70 mm chamber for both monkeys, with dimensions ranging from 5 to 30 mm A/P and 0 to 23 mm M/L.</p><p>During the experiment, the monkeys were seated in custom-made primate chairs, and their heads were restrained while a tube delivered juice rewards to their mouths. The system was mounted in front of the monkey, and eye movements were captured at 2 kHz using the EyeLink PM-910 Illuminator Module and EyeLink 1000 Plus Camera (SR Research Ltd, Ottawa, CA). Stimulus presentation and juice delivery were controlled using custom software written in MATLAB with the MonkeyLogic toolbox (see Supplementary File â <italic>PreTestCode.m</italic>). Visual stimuli were presented on a 24-inch LED-lit monitor (AsusVG248QE, 1920 Ã 1080, 144 Hz) positioned 65.5 cm away from the monkeysâ eyes. The actual time the stimulus appeared on the monitor was recorded using a photodiode (OSRAM Opto Semiconductors, Sunnyvale, CA).</p><p>One electrode was affixed to a recording chamber and positioned within the craniotomy area using the Narishige two-axis platform, allowing for continuous electrode positioning adjustment. To make contact with or slightly penetrate the dura, a 28-gauge guide tube was inserted using a manual oil hydraulic micromanipulator from Narishige, Tokyo, Japan. For recording neural activity extracellularly in both monkeys, varnish-coated tungsten microelectrodes (FHC, Bowdoinham, ME) with a shank diameter of 200â250 Î¼m and impedance of 0.2â1 MÏ (measured at 1 kHz) were inserted into the brain. A pre-amplifier and amplifier (Resana, Tehran, Iran) were employed for single-electrode recordings, with filtering set between 300 Hz and 5 kHz for spikes and 0.1 Hz and 9 kHz for local field potentials. Spike waveforms and continuous data were digitized and stored at a sampling rate of 40 kHz for offline spike sorting and subsequent data analysis. Area IT was identified based on its stereotaxic location, position relative to nearby sulci, patterns of gray and white matter, and response properties of encountered units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Stimulus and task paradigm</title><p>The experimental task comprised two distinct phases: selectivity and main phases, each involving different stimuli. During the selectivity phase, the objective was to identify a responsive neuron for recording purposes. If an appropriate neuron was detected, the main phase was initiated. However, if a responsive neuron was not observed, the recording location was adjusted, and the selectivity phase was repeated. First, we will outline the procedure for stimulus construction, followed by an explanation of the task paradigm.</p><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>The stimulus set</title><p>The size of each image was 500 Ã 500 pixels.

The monkeyâs eyes were located at a distance of 65 cm from the monitor. Each stimulus occupied a space of 5 Ã 5 degrees. All images were displayed in the center of the monitor. During the selectivity phase, a total number of 155 images were used as stimuli. Regarding SF, the stimuli were divided into unfiltered and filtered categories. Unfiltered images included 74 separate grayscale images in the categories of animal face, animal body, human face, human body, man-made, and natural. To create the stimulus, these images were placed on a gray background with a value of 0.5. The filtered images included 27 images in the same categories as the previous images, which were filtered in two frequency ranges (along with the intact form): low (1â10 cycles per image) and high (18â75 cycles per image), totaling 81 images. In the main phase of the test, nine images, including three non-face images and six face images, were considered. These images were displayed in the center of the monitor.

For each image in each frequency range, a scrambled version had been obtained by scrambling the image phase in the Fourier transform domain.

To apply the filter, the image underwent a two-dimensional Fourier transform, followed by multiplication with the appropriate filter. Subsequently, the inverse Fourier transform was employed to obtain the filtered image. Afterward, a linear transformation was applied to adjust the brightness and contrast of the images. Brightness was determined by the average pixel value of the image, while contrast was represented by its standard deviation (STD). To achieve specific brightness (L) and contrast (C) levels, the following equation was employed to correct the images:<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><alternatives><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:msub><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î¼</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mstyle></mml:mstyle></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math><tex-math id="t3">\begin{document}$$\displaystyle  I_{norm}= C \times \left(\frac{I - \mu}{\sigma}\right) + L$$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft8">\begin{document}$\sigma$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><alternatives><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mi>Î¼</mml:mi></mml:math><tex-math id="inft9">\begin{document}$\mu$\end{document}</tex-math></alternatives></inline-formula> are the STD and mean of the image.

ANOVA indicated no significant difference in brightness and contrast among various groups, with p-values of 0.62 for brightness and 0.25 for contrast. Finally, we equalized the stimulus power in all SF bands (intact, RâR5). The SF power among all conditions (all SF bands, face vs. non-face and unscrambled vs. scrambled) does not vary significantly (ANOVA, p-value &gt;0.1). SF power is calculated as the sum of the square value of the image coefficients in the Fourier domain. To create scrambled images, the original image underwent Fourier transformation, after which its phase was scrambled. Subsequently, the inverse Fourier transform was applied. Since the resulting signal may not be real, its real part was extracted. The resulting image then underwent processing through the specified filters in the primary phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Task paradigm</title><p>The task was divided into two distinct phases: the selectivity phase and the main phase. Each phase comprised multiple blocks, each containing two components: the presentation of a fixation point and a stimulus. The monkey was required to maintain fixation within a window of Â±1.5 degrees around the center of the monitor throughout the entire task. During the selectivity phase, there were five blocks, and stimuli were presented randomly within each block. The duration of stimulus presentation was 50 ms, while the fixation point was presented for 500 ms. The selectivity phase consisted of a total of 775 trials. A neuron was considered responsive if it exhibited a significant increase in response during the time window of 70 to 170 ms after stimulus onset, compared to a baseline window of â50 to 50 ms. This significance was determined using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with a significance level of 0.05. Once a neuron was identified as responsive, the main phase began. In the main phase, there were 15 blocks. The main phase involved a combination of the six most responsive stimuli, selected from the selectivity phase, along with nine fixed stimuli. There was, on average, 7.54 face stimuli in each session. In each block, all stimuli were presented once in random order. The stimulus duration in the main phase was 33 ms, and the fixation point was presented for 465 ms. For the purpose of analysis, our focus was primarily on the main phase of the task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Neural representation</title><p>All analyses were conducted using custom code developed in Matlab (MathWorks). In total, 266 neurons (157 M1 and 109 M2) were considered for the analysis. The recorded locations, along with their SF and category selectivity are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1âfigure 5</xref>. Neurons were sorted using the ROSS toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Toosi et al., 2021</xref>). In our analysis, we utilized both well-isolated single units and multi-unit activities (which represent neural activities that could not be further sorted into single units), ensuring a comprehensive representation of neural responses across the recorded population. Each stimulus in each time step was represented by a vector of <italic>N</italic> elements where the <italic>i</italic>th element was the average response of the <italic>i</italic>th neuron for that stimulus in a time window of 50 ms around the given time step. We used both single- and population-level analysis. Numerous studies had examined the benefits of population representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Dayan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adibi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Averbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dehaqani et al., 2018</xref>). These studies have demonstrated that enhancing signal correlation within the neural data population leads to improved decoding performance for object discrimination. To maintain consistency across trials, responses were normalized using the <italic>z</italic>-score procedure. All time courses were based on a 50-ms sliding window with a 5-ms time step. We utilized a time window from 70 to 170 ms after stimulus onset for our analysis (except for temporal analysis). This time window was selected because the average firing rate across neurons was significantly higher than the baseline window of â50 to 50 ms (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p-value &lt;0.05).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were conducted as outlined in this section unless otherwise specified.

This selection encompassed ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG11, VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientNetb0, CORNet-S, CORTNet-RT, and CORNet-z, strategically chosen to offer a comprehensive overview of SF processing capabilities within deep learning models. Our experimentation spanned the utilization of both randomly initialized weights and pre-trained weights sourced from the ImageNet dataset. This dual approach allowed us to assess the influence of prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained weights on SF decoding. In the process of extracting feature maps, we fed our stimulus set to the models, capturing the feature maps from the last four layers, excluding the classifier layer. Our results were primarily rooted in the final layer (preceding classification), yet they demonstrated consistency across all layers under examination. For classification and SF profiling, our methodology mirrored the procedures employed in our neural response analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Validation, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>The activity of neurons in the IT cortex of two male macaque monkeys weighing 10 and 11 kg, respectively, was analyzed following the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the Society for Neuroscience Guidelines and Policies.

A Gamma distribution is also fitted to each histogram. To calculate the histogram, the neuron response to each unique stimulus is calculated for each neuron in spike/seconds (Hz). In the early phase, T1, the average firing rate to scrambled stimuli is 26.3 Hz which is significantly higher than the response in â50 to 50 ms which is 23.4 Hz. In comparison, the mean response to intact face stimuli is 30.5 Hz, while non-face stimuli elicit an average response of 28.8 Hz. The average net responses to the scrambled, face, and non-face stimuli are 2.9, 7.1, and 5.4 Hz, respectively. Moving to the late phase, T2, the responses to scrambled, face, and object stimuli are 19.5, 19.4, and 22.4 Hz, respectively. The corresponding average net responses are 3.9, 4.0, and 1.0 Hz below the baseline response. While the firing rates and net responses to scrambled stimuli were modest (e.g., 2.9 Hz in T1), the differences across spatial frequency (SF) bands were statistically significant (p â 1eâ5) and led to a classification accuracy 24.68% above chance. This demonstrates the robustness of SF modulation in IT neurons despite low firing rates. The modest responses align with expectations for noise-like stimuli, which are less effective in driving IT neurons, yet the observed SF selectivity highlights a fundamental property of IT encoding.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93589-app1-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Robustness of SF profiles</title><p>To investigate the robustness of the SF profiles, considering the trial-to-trial variability, we calculated the neuronâs profile using half of the trials.

The authors suggest in the present study that some IT neurons show a sensitivity for the spatial frequency of scrambled images. Their report suggests a shift in preferred spatial frequency during the response, from low to high spatial frequencies. This agrees with a coarse-to-fine processing strategy, which is in line with multiple studies in the early visual cortex. In addition, they report that the selectivity for faces and objects, relative to scrambled stimuli, depends on the spatial frequency tuning of the neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Previous studies using human fMRI and psychophysics studied the contribution of different spatial frequency bands to object recognition, but as pointed out by the authors little is known about the spatial frequency selectivity of single IT neurons. This study addresses this gap and shows spatial frequency selectivity in IT for scrambled stimuli that drive the neurons poorly. They related this weak spatial frequency selectivity to category selectivity, but these findings are premature given the low number of stimuli they employed to assess category selectivity.</p><p>The authors revised their manuscript and provided some clarifications regarding their experimental design and data analysis. They responded to most of my comments but I find that some issues were not fully or poorly addressed. The new data they provided confirmed my concern about low responses to their scrambled stimuli. Thus, this paper shows spatial frequency selectivity in IT for scrambled stimuli that drive the neurons poorly (see main comments below). They related this (weak) spatial frequency selectivity to category selectivity, but these findings are premature given the low number of stimuli to assess category selectivity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93589.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Toosi</surname><given-names>Ramin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tehran</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Karami</surname><given-names>Behnam</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>German Primate Center</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Gottingen</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Koushki</surname><given-names>Roxana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shakerian</surname><given-names>Farideh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Royan Institute</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Noroozi</surname><given-names>Jalaledin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institute for Research in Fundamental Sciences</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rezayat</surname><given-names>Ehsan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Cognitive Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Education, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vahabie</surname><given-names>Abdol-Hossein</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Department of Cognitive Sciences, Faculty of Psychology and Education, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Akhaee</surname><given-names>Mohammad Ali</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tehran</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dehaqani</surname><given-names>Mohammad-Reza A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Tehran</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Tehran</named-content></addr-line><country>Islamic Republic of Iran</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This study reports that spatial frequency representation can predict category coding in the inferior temporal cortex.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for taking the time to review our manuscript.

Observations from our data showed that certain neurons exhibited high firing rates even with the brief 33 ms stimulus duration, and the results we obtained were consistent across different durations. To avoid redundancy, we initially chose not to include the results from the 200 ms stimulus duration, as they reiterated the findings of the 33 ms duration.</p><p>However, we acknowledge that the brief stimulus duration could raise concerns regarding the robustness of our conclusions, particularly concerning the effects of high spatial frequencies.

Therefore, we have included the data from the 200 ms stimulus duration in our revised manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, Our team is actively investigating the differences between fast (33 ms) and slow (200 ms) presentations in terms of SF processing. Our preliminary observations suggest similar processing of HSF in the early phase of the response for both fast and slow presentations, but different processing of HSF in the late phase. This was another reason we initially opted to publish the results from the brief stimulus duration separately, as we intended to explore the different aspects of SF processing in fast and slow presentations in subsequent studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I suggest the authors upload both data sets and analyzing codes, so that the claim could be easily examined by interested readers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion to make both data sets and the analyzing codes available for examination by interested readers.</p><p>We have created a repository that includes a sample of the dataset along with the necessary codes to output the main results.

This agrees with a coarse-to-fine processing strategy, which is in line with multiple studies in the early visual cortex. In addition, they report that the selectivity for faces and objects, relative to scrambled stimuli, depends on the spatial frequency tuning of the neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Previous studies using human fMRI and psychophysics studied the contribution of different spatial frequency bands to object recognition, but as pointed out by the authors little is known about the spatial frequency selectivity of single IT neurons. This study addresses this gap and shows spatial frequency selectivity in IT for scrambled stimuli that drive the neurons poorly. They related this weak spatial frequency selectivity to category selectivity, but these findings are premature given the low number of stimuli they employed to assess category selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your thorough review and insightful feedback on our manuscript. We greatly appreciate your time and effort in providing valuable comments and suggestions, which have significantly contributed to enhancing the quality of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors revised their manuscript and provided some clarifications regarding their experimental design and data analysis. They responded to most of my comments but I find that some issues were not fully or poorly addressed. The new data they provided confirmed my concern about low responses to their scrambled stimuli. Thus, this paper shows spatial frequency selectivity in IT for scrambled stimuli that drive the neurons poorly (see main comments below). They related this (weak) spatial frequency selectivity to category selectivity, but these findings are premature given the low number of stimuli to assess category selectivity.</p></disp-quote><p>While we acknowledge that the number of instances per condition is relatively low, the overall dataset is substantial. Specifically, our study includes a total of 180 stimuli (6 spatial frequencies Ã 2 scrambled/non-scrambled conditions Ã 15 instances, including 9 fixed and 6 non-fixed) and 5400 trials (180 stimuli Ã 2 durations Ã 15 repetitions). Conducting these trials requires approximately one hour of experimental time per session.</p><p>Extending the number of stimuli, while potentially addressing this limitation, would significantly compromise the quality of the experiment by increasing the duration and introducing potential fatigue effects in the subjects. Despite this limitation, our findings lay important groundwork by offering novel insights into object recognition through the lens of spatial frequency. We believe this work can serve as a foundation for future experiments designed to further explore and validate these theories with expanded stimulus sets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Main points.</p><p>(1) They have provided now the responses of their neurons in spikes/s and present a distribution of the raw responses in a new Figure. These data suggest that their scrambled stimuli were driving the neurons rather poorly and thus it is unclear how well their findings will generalize to more effective stimuli. Indeed, the mean net firing rate to their scrambled stimuli was very low: about 3 spikes/s. How much can one conclude when the stimuli are driving the recorded neurons that poorly? Also, the new Figure 2- Appendix 1 shows that the mean modulation by spatial frequency is about 2 spikes/s, which is a rather small modulation. Thus, the spatial frequency selectivity the authors describe in this paper is rather small compared to the stimulus selectivity one typically observes in IT (stimulus-driven modulations can be at least 20 spikes/s).</p></disp-quote><p>To address the concerns regarding the firing rates and the modulation of neuronal responses by spatial frequency (SF), we emphasize several key points:</p><p>(1) Significance of Firing Rate Differences: While it is true that the mean net firing rate to our scrambled stimuli was relatively low, the firing rate differences observed were statistically significant, with p-values approximately at 1e-5. This indicates that despite the low firing rates, the observed differences are reliable and unlikely to have occurred by chance.</p><p>(2) Classification Rate and Modulation by SF: Our analysis showed that the difference between various SF responses led to a classification rate of 44.68%, which is 24.68% higher than the chance level. This substantial increase above the chance level demonstrates that SF significantly modulates IT responses, even if the overall firing rates are modest.</p><p>(3) Effect Size and SF Modulation: While the effect size in terms of firing rate differences may be small, it is significant. The significant modulation of IT responses by SF, as evidenced by our statistical analyses and classification rate, supports our conclusions regarding the role of SF in driving IT responses.</p><p>(4) Expectations for Noise-like Pure SF Stimuli: We acknowledge that IT responses are typically higher for various object stimuli. Given the nature of our pure SF stimuli, which resemble noise-like patterns, we did not anticipate high responses in terms of spikes per second. The low firing rates are consistent with the expectation for such stimuli and do not undermine the significance of the observed modulation by SF.</p><p>We believe that these points collectively support the validity of our findings and the significance of SF modulation in IT responses, despite the low firing rates. We appreciate your insights and hope this clarifies our stance on the data and its implications.</p><p>We added the following description to the Appendix 1 - âStrength of SF selectivityâ section:</p><p>âWhile the firing rates and net responses to scrambled stimuli were modest (e.g., 2.9 Hz in T1), the differences across spatial frequency (SF) bands were statistically significant (p â 1e-5) and led to a classification accuracy 24.68\% above chance. This demonstrates the robustness of SF modulation in IT neurons despite low firing rates. The modest responses align with expectations for noise-like stimuli, which are less effective in driving IT neurons, yet the observed SF selectivity highlights a fundamental property of IT encoding.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Their new Figure 2-Appendix 1 does not show net firing rates (baseline-subtracted; as I requested) and thus is not very informative. Please provide distributions of net responses so that the readers can evaluate the responses to the stimuli of the recorded neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewerâs concern about the presentation of net firing rates. In T2 (the late time interval), the average response rate falls below the baseline, resulting in negative net firing rates, which might confuse readers. To address this, we have added the net responses to the text for clarity. Additionally, we have included the average baseline response in the figure to provide a more comprehensive view of the data.</p><p>âTo check the SF response strength, the histogram of IT neuron responses to scrambled, face, and non-face stimuli is illustrated in this figure. A Gamma distribution is also fitted to each histogram. To calculate the histogram, the neuron response to each unique stimulus is calculated for each neuron in spike/seconds (Hz). In the early phase, T1, the average firing rate to scrambled stimuli is 26.3 Hz which is significantly higher than the response in -50 to 50ms which is 23.4 Hz. In comparison, the mean response to intact face stimuli is 30.5 Hz, while non-face stimuli elicit an average response of 28.8 Hz. The average net responses to the scrambled, face, and non-face stimuli are 2.9 Hz, 7.1 Hz, and 5.4 Hz, respectively. Moving to the late phase, T2, the responses to scrambled, face, and object stimuli are 19.5 Hz, 19.4 Hz, and 22.4 Hz, respectively. The corresponding average net responses are 3.9 Hz, 4.0 Hz, and 1.0 Hz below the baseline response.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The poor responses might be due to the short stimulus duration. The authors report now new data using a 200 ms duration which supported their classification and latency data obtained with their brief duration. It would be very informative if the authors could also provide the mean net responses for the 200 ms durations to their stimuli. Were these responses as low as those for the brief duration? If so, the concern of generalization to effective stimuli that drive IT neurons well remains.</p></disp-quote><p>The firing rates for the 200 ms stimulus duration are as follows: 27.7 Hz, 30.7 Hz, and 30.4 Hz for scrambled, face, and object stimuli in T1, respectively; and 26.2 Hz, 29.1 Hz, and 33.9 Hz in T2. The average baseline firing rate (â50 to 50 ms) is 23.4 Hz. Therefore, the net responses are 4.3 Hz, 7.3 Hz, and 7.0 Hz for T1; and 2.8 Hz, 5.7 Hz, and 10.5 Hz for T2 for scrambled, face, and object stimuli, respectively.</p><p>Notably, the impact of stimulus duration is more pronounced in T2, which is consistent with the time interval of the T2 compared to T1. However, the firing rates in T1 do not show substantial changes with the longer duration. As we discussed in our response to the first comment, it is important to note that high net responses are not typically expected for scrambled or noise-like stimuli in IT neurons. Instead, the key findings of this study lie in the statistical significance of these responses and their meaningful relationship to category selectivity. These results highlight the broader implications for understanding the role of spatial frequency in object recognition.</p><p>We added the firing rates to the, Appendix 1, âExtended stimulus duration supports LSF-preferred tuningâ part as follows.</p><p>âFor the 200 ms stimulus duration, the firing rates were 27.7 Hz, 30.7 Hz, and 30.4 Hz for scrambled, face, and object stimuli in T1, respectively, and 26.2 Hz, 29.1 Hz, and 33.9 Hz in T2. The corresponding net responses were 4.3 Hz, 7.3 Hz, and 7.0 Hz in T1, and 2.8 Hz, 5.7 Hz, and 10.5 Hz in T2. While the longer stimulus duration did not substantially increase firing rates in T1, its impact was more pronounced in T2.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) I still do not understand why the analyses of Figures 3 and 4 provide different outcomes on the relationship between spatial frequency and category selectivity. I believe they refer to this finding in the Discussion: &quot;Our results show a direct relationship between the population's category coding capability and the SF coding capability of individual neurons.

This is consistent for the two monkeys but we are dealing here with a small amount of neurons. Only 6% of their neurons (16 neurons) belonged to this high spatial frequency group when pooling the two monkeys. Thus, although both monkeys show this effect I wonder how robust it is given the small number of neurons per monkey that belong to this spatial frequency profile. Furthermore, the higher separability for faces for the low-frequency profiles is not consistent across monkeys which should be pointed out.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs concern regarding the relatively small number of neurons in the high spatial frequency group (16 neurons, 6% of the total sample across the two monkeys) and the consistency of the results. While we acknowledge this limitation, it is important to note that findings involving sparse subsets of neurons can still be meaningful. For example, Dalgleish et al. (2020) demonstrated that perception can arise from the activity of as few as ~14 neurons in the mouse cortex, supporting the sparse coding hypothesis. This underscores the potential robustness of results derived from small neuronal populations when the activity is statistically significant and functionally relevant.</p><p>Regarding the higher separability for faces among neurons preferring high spatial frequencies, the consistency of this finding across both monkeys suggests that this effect is robust within this subgroup.

While most of the neurons prefer LSF, this observation shows that there is an HSF input that excites a small group of neurons.

Because the number of features and trial-to-trial variability differs between neural nets and neurons, the classification scores are difficult to compare. One can compare the trends but not the raw classification scores between CNN and neurons without equating these variables.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewerâs follow-up comment and agree that differences in the number of features and trial-to-trial variability between IT neurons and CNN units make direct comparisons of raw classification scores challenging. As the reviewer suggests, it is more appropriate to focus on comparing trends rather than absolute scores when analyzing the similarities and differences between these systems. In light of this, we have revised the text to clarify that our intention was not to equate raw classification scores but to highlight the qualitative patterns and trends observed in spatial frequency encoding between IT and CNN units.</p><p>âSF representation in the artificial neural networks</p><p>We conducted a thorough analysis to compare our findings with CNNs. To assess the SF coding capabilities and trends of CNNs, we utilized popular architectures, including ResNet18, ResNet34, VGG11, VGG16, InceptionV3, EfficientNetb0, CORNet-S, CORTNet-RT, and CORNet-z, with both pre-trained on ImageNet and randomly initialized weights. Employing feature maps from the four last layers of each CNN, we trained an LDA model to classify the SF content of input images. Figure 5(a) shows the SF decoding accuracy of the CNNs on our dataset (SF decoding accuracy with random (R) and pre-trained (P) weights, ResNet18: P=0.96Â±0.01 / R=0.94Â±0.01, ResNet34 P=0.95Â±0.01 / R=0.86Â±0.01, VGG11: P=0.94Â±0.01 / R=0.93Â±0.01, VGG16: P=0.92Â±0.02 / R=0.90Â±0.02, InceptionV3: P=0.89Â±0.01 / R=0.67Â±0.03, EfficientNetb0: P=0.94Â±0.01 / R=0.30Â±0.01, CORNet-S: P=0.77Â±0.02 / R=0.36Â±0.02, CORTNet-RT: P=0.31Â±0.02 / R=0.33Â±0.02, and CORNet-z: P=0.94Â±0.01 / R=0.97Â±0.01). Except for CORNet-z, object recognition training increases the network's capacity for SF coding, with an improvement as significant as 64\% in EfficientNetb0. Furthermore, except for the CORNet family, LSF content exhibits higher recall values than HSF content, as observed in the IT cortex (p-value with random (R) and pre-trained (P) weights, ResNet18: P=0.39 / R=0.06, ResNet34 P=0.01 / R=0.01, VGG11: P=0.13 / R=0.07, VGG16: P=0.03 / R=0.05, InceptionV3: P=&lt;0.001 / R=0.05, EfficientNetb0: P=0.07 / R=0.01). The recall values of CORNet-Z and ResNet18 are illustrated in Figure 5(b). However, while the CNNs exhibited some similarities in SF representation with the IT cortex, they did not replicate the SF-based profiles that predict neuron category selectivity. As depicted in Figure 5(c) although neurons formed similar profiles, these profiles were not associated with the category decoding performances of the neurons sharing the same profile.â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âFinally, we compared SF's representation trends and findings within the IT cortex and the current state-of-the-art networks in deep neural networks.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The mean baseline firing rate of their neurons (23.4 Hz) was rather high for single IT neurons (typically around 10 spikes/s or lower).
