These PIs are key regulators of subcellular processes; for example, phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>] plays a key role in the regulation of membrane transport and the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Janmey et al., 2018</xref>), whereas phosphatidylinositol three phosphate (PI3P) is an important regulator of endocytosis and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schink et al., 2016</xref>). PIs have also been implicated in the regulation of nuclear function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiume et al., 2015</xref>). PIs also play a key role in regulating developmental processes in metazoans. For example, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>) is an essential regulator of growth factor signaling and plays a conserved role in developmental control in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Engelman et al., 2006</xref>). Phosphatidylinositol four phosphate (PI4P) levels play a key role during cellular development in gametogenesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brill et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tan et al., 2014</xref>) and a conserved role for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is proposed in apico-basal polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Devergne et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martin-Belmonte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rousso et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yan et al., 2011</xref>). Dysregulation in PI signaling has also been linked to several human diseases; these include developmental disorders such as Lowe syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Staiano et al., 2015</xref>) and PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madsen et al., 2018</xref>); mutations in PTEN, a key regulator of PIP<sub>3</sub> levels are the second most frequent mutations seen in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Worby and Dixon, 2014</xref>). Mutations in genes regulating PI signaling are seen in a large number of genetic disorders of the human nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Raghu et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the PI signaling pathway is a key regulator of cell function and tissue architecture both during normal development and also in disease mechanisms and understanding their role in such processes is of fundamental importance.</p><p>Given their importance in a large number of important subcellular processes, PI signaling is tightly regulated. The seven PIs are generated in cells by the activity of a set of evolutionarily conserved lipid kinases that are specific for the substrate they will use, as well as the position on the inositol at which they will phosphorylate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sasaki et al., 2009</xref>). In turn, once generated, PIs exert their cellular effects by binding to and modulating the activity of a large number of PI-binding proteins whose functions are key to the control of subcellular processes by these lipids. For example, many proteins contain domains that bind PI3P (PX and FYVE) and PI4P (FAPP and OSBP) and numerous PH domains that bind various PIs with differing degrees of affinity and selectivity have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammond and Balla, 2015</xref>). Indeed, a recent biochemical study has identified a large number of proteins that bind a range of PIs with varying degrees of specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jungmichel et al., 2014</xref>). However, the biological function of many of these proteins remains to be discovered.</p><p>Although PI signaling is broadly a conserved feature of all eukaryotic cells, some aspects of this pathway are found uniquely in metazoa and play important roles in animal development and tissue architecture. However, there remain key challenges in the analysis of PI signaling in metazoan development. For example, PIs may regulate the same subcellular process (e.g endocytosis) but may be co-opted to control the trafficking of unique cargoes in different tissues. Second, through their ability to control the secretion of intercellular signaling morphogens and hormones that mediate intercellular signaling, PIs can regulate tissue development in a non-cell autonomous manner. Third, given their key functions in cell biology, whole body knockouts of these genes often result in organismal lethality. Finally, in many cases, a given biochemical activity is underpinned by multiple genes in mammalian genomes and gene redundancy usually makes analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> function challenging.</p><p>Analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a powerful alternative to overcome the challenges of studying PI function in cell and developmental processes. Many developmental mechanisms are conserved between <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other metazoan models. A detailed annotation of the PI signaling genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakrishnan et al., 2015</xref>) led to the identification of 103 genes which are part of the PI signaling toolkit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and conserved between flies and other organisms important for the study of developmental processes and disease biology. Further the availability of binary gene expression control systems such as the GAL4/UAS system allow for tight spatial and temporal gene modulation in turn allowing sophisticated analysis of both cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous modes of developmental control by PI signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombani et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, <italic>Drosophila</italic> offers a model where one can analyze the control of cellular and developmental processes by PI signaling in a metazoan context.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Interconversion of phosphoinositides in eukaryotic cells.</title><p>The metabolic pathway by which the different phosphorylated forms of phosphatidylinositol are interconverted is represented.

However, unlike transgenic fly lines expressing RNAi constructs that are available against almost the entire fly genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dietzl et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Perkins et al., 2015</xref>), efforts to make guide RNA (gRNA) expressing transgenic flies are still underway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Port et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we have generated a genome editing system that can be used for Cas9 mediated editing to delete the open-reading frame of each of the 103 annotated genes that could regulate PI signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balakrishnan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We demonstrate the use of this resource both in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells as well as in intact <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues in vivo during development. Importantly, we use these guides to generate both whole body knock outs as well as tissue specific, developmentally timed depletion of individual genes with high efficiency. Further, using these reagents we present the results of a genetic screen in the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye and identify key roles for PI signaling in this influential model of tissue development and patterning. Our reagent set will be a powerful and versatile tool for the discovery of novel regulation by PI signaling of development, tissue homeostasis, and human disease biology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design of gRNAs for editing PI signaling genes</title><p>In designing the gRNAs to target each PI signaling gene, we considered a few important factors: Firstly, CRISPR-Cas9-based genome editing is highly robust and specific; a single mismatch in the target sequence may highly reduce the efficiency of CRISPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pattanayak et al., 2013</xref>), especially if the mismatches are present in the core 12 bp protospacer region most proximal to the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) site. Second, a large number of users may find the library of these dual guide RNA (dgRNA) transgenic flies useful to study PI signaling in their own research contexts. This would mean that the dgRNA lines may be used in flies of different genetic backgrounds. Third, the same dgRNA constructs should be able to target the genes in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells for editing prior to biochemical experiments. Considering these points, we decided not to directly use the reference genome sequence to design the gRNAs. The entire genome of S2R<sup>+</sup> cells as well as the isogenized <italic>attP40</italic> parent fly stock (BDSC 25709: <italic>y<sup>1</sup> v<sup>1</sup> P{y[+t7.7]=nos-phiC31\int.NLS}X; P{y[+t7.7]=CaryP}attP40</italic>) that was to be used to generate dgRNA transgenic flies were sequenced (sequencing data is available for S2R<sup>+</sup> cells on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA606149">hyperlink</ext-link> and for isogenized <italic>attP40</italic> stock on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA606147">hyperlink</ext-link>). Sequences thus obtained were aligned against the reference genome and also against each other. When aligned against the reference genome, both the isogenized parent fly stock and the S2R<sup>+</sup> cell genome sequences showed more than 600,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). When compared to each other, these genome sequences had ~1.3 million mismatches (SNP, insertions, and deletions) suggesting that, as expected, almost all the sequence differences in the two genomes were independent of each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">4</xref>). While designing the single gRNA (sgRNA), we only chose those targets that did not have sequence mismatches in any of the three genomes (reference genome and the two genomes sequenced) thus ensuring that the dgRNAs could be used in flies of diverse genetic backgrounds and also in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells. Finally, the designed gRNAs were matched to recently added genomic sequences of reference genome r_6, <italic>vasa-Cas9</italic> (BDSC 51324: <italic>w<sup>1118</sup>; PBac{vas-Cas9}VK00027</italic>), <italic>nos-Cas9 II</italic> (BDSC 78781: <italic>y<sup>1</sup> sc<sup>*</sup> v<sup>1</sup> sev<sup>21</sup>; P{nos-Cas9.R}attP40</italic>) and <italic>nos-Cas9 III</italic> (BDSC 78782<italic>: y<sup>1</sup> sc<sup>*</sup> v<sup>1</sup> sev<sup>21</sup>; P{nos-Cas9.R}attP2</italic>). Only 1 gRNA target (targeting <italic>CG10426</italic>), out of the 206 generated, seemed to have one base mismatch marked in red (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), while the other 205 targets matched between all the genomes. These gRNA can hence be used in many genetic backgrounds. This allowed for a relatively simple way to test the designed dgRNAs in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells for their ability to target specific genes prior to generating transgenic fly lines.</p><p>For each gene, two regions were identified wherein an sgRNA would be designed to target each region. The first sgRNA would be designed to target the first coding exon and the second sgRNA to target the exon with the stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In case of genes with alternate spliced forms, regions around the most 5’ start codon and the most 3’ stop codon were chosen (For example, <italic>CG3682</italic> has upto six splice variants with four putative start sites). In cases where two or more putative genes are annotated on the same locus, sgRNA target regions were chosen such that the coding sequences of neighboring genes are not disrupted (for example, there are six different putative ORFs in the first few introns of <italic>plc21c</italic> and hence the first sgRNA is designed on exon 8). Once a set of two ~ 100 bp regions were identified for each gene keeping in mind the above-mentioned criteria, we designed the sgRNAs using an online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu">http://targetfinder.flycrispr.neuro.brown.edu</ext-link>) with zero predicted off-targets. During the course of this study, an additional online tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/">https://www.flyrnai.org/evaluateCrispr/</ext-link>) became available. Thereafter, this tool was used to obtain a predicted efficiency score. The most efficient sgRNAs in the region were then checked in our sequence database for presence of any mismatches in either S2R<sup>+</sup> cells or injection fly stocks compared to the reference genome sequence. The best sgRNA sequences predicted to efficiently target specific genes with no predicted off-targets and absence of any mismatches were chosen for synthesis. Any sgRNA sequences that did not qualify these criteria were discarded and new sgRNAs designed to fit all the above criteria. A full list of genes for which dgRNAs were designed is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Generation of dgRNA targeting PI signaling genes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Workflow for the generation of dgRNA transgenic flies. For each of the 103 PI signaling genes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, two gRNAs were designed using flyCRISPR and verified using the CRISPR Efficiency Prediction Tool (DRSC). The first gRNA (gRNA 1; indicated in blue) was designed to target the first coding exon and the second gRNA (gRNA 2; indicated in green) was designed to target the last coding exon. It was ensured that these designed gRNAs did not have any mismatches when compared against any of the three genomes (the genomes of <italic>Drosophila</italic> BL25709 line used for microinjection, S2R<sup>+</sup> cells and the reference genome). The two gRNAs (gRNA one and gRNA 2) for each gene were cloned into pBFv6.2 and pBFv6.2B, respectively, and tested in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells for their ability to delete the target genes in the presence of Cas9. Following this, both the gRNAs for each gene were cloned into a single plasmid to generate the dgRNA constructs. These were microinjected into <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos to generate dgRNA transgenic flies against each of the PI-signaling genes.

In order to satisfy this requirement, we designed and generated transgenic <italic>UAS-Cas9</italic> flies with a fluorescence reporter eGFP. Given that the human codon optimized Cas9 (Cas9.P2) expresses at lower levels thereby reducing the cytotoxic effects of the otherwise highly expressing Cas9.C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>), we have used Cas9.P2 to generate our construct. In order to ensure that the presence of an eGFP tag does not hinder the activity of Cas9, we introduced a self-cleaving peptide T2A sequence in between Cas9 and eGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This ensured that while the Cas9 and eGFP are expressed from the same mRNA, they are made as two independent proteins. Presence of the eGFP coding sequence downstream of Cas9 ensured that every cell positive for eGFP fluorescence would definitely also express Cas9. In addition, we tagged the Cas9 with a nuclear localization signal (NLS) at both the N- and the C-terminal to facilitate its translocation into the nucleus for better access of the genomic DNA.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Design and validation of <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of the <italic>Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> transgene indicating the presence of a nuclear localization signal (NLS-blue box) at the N and C termini of Cas9; Cas9 is shaded in pink.

For a few genes (13 genes), we were unable to generate germline deletions despite repeated attempts in some cases possibly due to their essential roles in gametogenesis or embryogenesis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Generating germ line fly knockouts using dgRNA transgenics.</title><p>The PI transfer protein RDGB (retinal degeneration B) is a good example to demonstrate the need for whole fly knockouts.

The progeny were collected and their ERG recorded. In contrast to the <italic>rdgB<sup>2</sup></italic> allele and the germline <italic>rdgB</italic> knockout generated in this study (see previous section), we observed no reduction in ERG amplitude compared to wild-type flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Although PCR analysis of these eyes confirmed the occurrence of deletion events, western blot analysis from heads of <italic>rdgB<sup>dgRNA</sup></italic>, <italic>ey-Gal4;UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> flies revealed that the RDGB protein was still present in these eyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), thus explaining the normal ERG amplitude observed. This finding implies that although <italic>rdgB<sup>dgRNA</sup></italic> worked efficiently to generate germline deletions, it was not effective in tissue-specific depletion of RDGB protein levels. The reasons for this are not entirely clear. We speculate that RDGB is a protein with a long half-life and therefore despite efficient targeting of <italic>rdgB</italic> locus by the dgRNA in the eyes, the protein levels are not affected. However, it is also possible that the deletion of <italic>rdgB</italic> was not homogeneous in all eye precursor cells where Cas9 was expressed using <italic>ey-Gal4</italic>; residual photoreceptors with normal <italic>rdgB</italic> might be sufficient to generate a normal light response.</p><p><italic>skittles</italic> (<italic>sktl</italic>) is a PI4P 5-kinase known to have a role during larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hassan et al., 1998</xref>). Mutations in <italic>sktl</italic> are organismal lethal as well as cell lethal. Hence, we expected a strong phenotype when the <italic>sktl</italic> locus was deleted in eye discs using <italic>ey-Gal4</italic>. However, when <italic>sgRNA</italic> or <italic>dgRNA</italic> targeting <italic>sktl</italic> was used, we did not see any morphological phenotype in the eye [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> (iii)]. One possible reason for this could be that the <italic>sktl gRNAs</italic> was non-functional in eye discs, although they had worked well, being able to delete <italic>sktl</italic> in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells. In order to test this, we crossed <italic>sktl <sup>sgRNA</sup></italic> to <italic>nanos-Cas9</italic> flies. From this cross, heterozygous F2 progeny were collected and their <italic>skittles</italic> genomic locus sequenced. Out of the 141 F2 flies sequenced, 132 showed in-frame indels with an intact kinase domain, with the largest deletion being 24 bp. This suggests that the <italic>sktl <sup>sgRNA</sup></italic> were highly efficient at targeting <italic>sktl</italic> but only cells with at least a partially functional protein managed to survive during eye development and therefore appeared morphologically normal.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Patterning tissue architecture during metazoan development or the systemic control of animal physiology are complex processes and typically involves the function of genes acting in both cell-autonomous and non-cell autonomous modes. Identifying novel genes regulating these processes and uncovering their mode of action is facilitated by the ability to inactivate genes in specific cell types, tissue domains or organs with spatial and temporal precision. Such controlled inactivation can be achieved through the use of gene manipulation systems expressed with spatial and temporal precision using the GAL4/UAS system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>) and this approach has been coupled previously with methods to deplete specific RNAs to study their role in development and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reim et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, we present the use of the GAL4/UAS module for gene inactivation by using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing system. By expressing Cas9 with spatial and temporal precision using the GAL4/UAS system we were able to selectively inactivate genes in early precursor cells of the eye imaginal disc and thus uncover functions of the PI signaling system in the growth and patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye. Using this method, we uncovered the function of 30 PI signaling genes in eye development and nine genes previously not implicated in this process. Our study identified phenotypes for genes such as <italic>Dp110</italic> and <italic>Pten</italic> that are previously described using either classical mutant alleles or using RNAi mediated depletion. However, the tool kit presented here includes reagents for editing ca. 72 PI binding proteins. While these have been described by in vitro protein biochemistry studies or predicted from structural bioinformatics, their function in vivo and their role in cell and developmental biology remains to be explored. Indeed, this resource can be used in almost any tissue or cell type in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that can be chosen for analysis, perhaps on the basis of their expression pattern or other relevant criteria. With this mind, we tested the ability of the dgRNAs in various tissues and found that any given dgRNA was able to generate deletions in diverse tissues such as the eye, wing and the germ line. Other groups have also recognized the potential of CRISPR-based mutagenesis to perform tissue specific screens in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and are generating gRNA transgenic fly libraries. While some studies have focussed on transcription factors, protein kinases, protein phosphatases and genes implicated in human pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Port et al., 2020</xref>), others have embarked on generating large-scale libraries with no special focus on any particular group of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meltzer et al., 2019</xref>). Our study, however, represents the first comprehensive resource of editing tools that will allow a systems level analysis of PI signaling, a pathway of fundamental importance for cellular organization, tissue development, and architecture.</p><p>The system we have developed includes a number of innovative features. In the study of cell-cell interactions in development, it is desirable and indeed essential to mark the cell types in which gene manipulation is being performed. To facilitate this, we have designed an <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> construct which provides many advantages: (i) All cells expressing Cas9 also express eGFP thus marking cells guaranteed to express Cas9. The expression of eGFP from this construct is a definite readout of Cas9 expression unlike the expression of eGFP from an independent UAS-eGFP transgene. (ii) Since Cas9 and eGFP are expressed as independent proteins, the possibility of a Cas9 fusion protein with reduced function is eliminated. (iii) The <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> presented here avoids the need for two independent genetic elements to express both Cas9 and eGFP thus reducing the complexity of strain construction. (iv) The use of Cas9 with an NLS ensures that the protein is nuclear localized maximizing the probability of gene editing activity. Thus, our system offers the ability to generate groups of gene-edited cells/tissue with high-efficiency that are guaranteed to be marked by eGFP expression.</p><p>The genetic strategy for CRISPR/Cas9 editing presented here enhances the number of genetic elements that can be brought together in a single fly and allow for CRISPR based reagents to be used in innovative ways. For example, in addition to the basic eye development screen presented here as an illustrative example, Cas9 can be expressed in a mosaic fashion under the control of the Gal4/UAS system using the CoinFLP method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bosch et al., 2015</xref>). This would allow for the generation of CRISPR edited mosaic clones useful for studying cell-cell interactions including cell competition that are integral elements of tissue development. Indeed, a recent study has presented evidence of a role of some genes involved in PI signaling as regulators of cell competition during eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janardan et al., 2020</xref>) and the expanded repertoire of editing reagents generated during this study will allow the mechanism by which PI signaling regulates cell competition to be analysed in greater detail.</p><p>Recent studies have used the approach of having two sgRNAs both targeting the coding region immediately downstream of the start codon with the expectation of maximizing the likelihood of a frameshift mutation to achieve loss of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Port et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, we have taken a slightly different approach of using two sgRNAs, one located near the start codon and the other near the stop codon thus generating a deletion of the full open-reading frame post-editing. Even if only the gRNA targeting the first exon is functional, indels can be introduced and lead to loss-of-function from a resulting frameshift mutation. However, the presence of second sgRNA targeting the last exon will ensure that the entire gene is deleted thus increasing the chances of generating loss-of-function mutants. Secondly, because our dgRNA containing transgenic flies target both the first and the last exon and result in complete deletion of the gene, the subsequent introduction of a copy of the gene with homologous arms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baena-Lopez et al., 2013</xref>) would result in gene knock-ins and reconstitution of function. This would require a germ line knockout of the gene and the use of our reagent set to generate such a null allele is described in the study. The use of a suitably mutagenized copy of the wild-type gene would allow individual point mutations or domain deletions of a protein to be generated, for example allowing the analysis of the role of specific amino acid residues or domains in a specific cell biological question. Since such knock-in constructs would also be expressed from the same locus as the wild-type gene thereby avoiding artifacts associated with altered levels of expression when transgenes are expressed from alternate genomic loci.</p><p>During the course of this study, we identified a few limitations for the use of these reagents. For example, in the case of the PI4P 5-kinase <italic>sktl</italic>, eye-specific deletion resulted in morphologically normal looking eyes. The reason for this was most likely that cells lacking <italic>sktl</italic> were eliminated (due to the essential nature of the gene product) early in eye disc development and only those cells with indels that are multiples of three bases thus possibly producing a partially functional protein survived. This is however dependent on the nature of the gene rather than the design of the gRNA constructs. For example, when sgRNA targeting the kinase domain of <italic>sktl</italic> was used in conjunction with <italic>ey &gt;UAS-Cas9-GFP</italic>, flies were pupal lethal presumably because even 1–2 bp deletions within the kinase domain of <italic>sktl</italic> abolishes kinase activity and gene function. In the case of the PI transfer protein RDGB, we were able to detect the presence of full-length protein in flies when eye specific knockout was performed. The possibility that either of the gRNAs were inefficient or non-functional in tissues was ruled out as we were able to use the <italic>rdgB<sup>dgRNA</sup></italic> flies to generate a germline knockout of this gene that phenocopied existing classical alleles. Since <italic>rdgB</italic> is located on the X-chromosome the inability to lose the protein by tissue-specific editing is unlikely to be due to editing of only one copy of the gene. We therefore speculate that the residual protein in eye-specific editing of <italic>rdgB</italic> most likely results from the long half-life of the protein that was present from early development. The implications of this is that when used for performing a screen in a tissue-specific manner, the lack of a phenotype does not conclusively rule out the involvement of that gene. Apart from the two examples described here, it is possible that CRISPR based targeting of genes in a tissue-specific manner may lead to heterogeneous disruption of the target gene especially in polyploid larval tissues such as the salivary glands and fat body. Therefore, absence of phenotypes in these tissue-specific gene disruptions using dgRNA will not be conclusive and under these circumstances, generation of a germline knock out would be valuable.</p><p>In summary, we have generated a toolkit consisting of a transgenic library of 103 dgRNA and a <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> that can be used in conjunction with the existing large repertoire of GAL4 lines to perform a systems level analysis of PI signaling selectively in any cell type/tissue of choice. The <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> construct would be helpful to track Cas9 expressing cells in culture or in fly tissues. The <italic>dgRNAs</italic> can also be transfected to delete gene function in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells. They can also be used to generate whole body knockouts and the null alleles so generated can be used as a template to knock in specific versions of the gene at the endogenous locus. While the PI kinases and phosphatases have been the subject of extensive analysis, the effectors of PI signaling, namely the binding proteins remain poorly studied. We envisage the availability of this dgRNA reagent set will accelerate the studies of the function of these proteins in cellular organization and tissue architecture. They will also facilitate the functional analysis of disease mechanisms in the case of those proteins linked to human disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC 3605</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>AB1-Gal4</italic></td><td valign="top">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center</td><td valign="top">BDSC 1824</td><td valign="top"><italic>y<sup>1</sup> w*;

The transfected cells were incubated at room temperature for 48 hr and then collected by spinning in a tube and removing the medium. These were then resuspended in squishing buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.2, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM NaCl and 200 µg/ml Proteinase K) and incubated at 37°C for 1 hr and 95°C for 20 min. This was directly used for PCR to test the efficiency of deletion. Since the efficiency of transfection was found to be low, for most of the gRNAs, deletion bands were seen only when a nested PCR was performed. For the primer list used for nested PCRs, please refer to the key resource table. The deletion bands were sequenced and verified for deletion against reference genomic sequence.</p><p>Generation of <italic>UAS-Cas9-T2A-eGFP</italic> transgenes pUAST-eGFP vector was first generated by inserting eGFP sequence using EcoR1 and Xba1 restriction enzymes into the pUAST vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). Cas9 insert was PCR amplified from pAC-Cas9-sgRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bassett et al., 2013</xref>) as a template, using the following primers (5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">gagcggagagcattgcggctgataagg</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">gaggcgcaccgtgggccgcggccgcagatctctaccgctgccgctaccgctagca</named-content>-3’) which led to amplification of 3xFLAG-SV40-NLS-Cas9-NLS-T2A. The PCR product was digested using EcoR1 and Not1 enzymes and cloned into the pUAST-eGFP vector. After testing for its expression and efficacy in S2R<sup>+</sup> cells, transgenics were generated by P-element-based random insertion. Two lines were obtained and were both mapped to the third chromosome. One of these lines (with stronger mini white expression, as judged visually) was used for further experiments.</p><p>Isogenization of fly stocks for NGS <italic>attP40</italic> and <italic>attP2</italic> fly stocks were isogenized by crossing them to triple balancer fly stocks. <italic>attP40</italic> fly stocks (BDSC 25709) were triple balanced with <italic>FM7a; CyO;Tb</italic>. Subsequently, the balancer chromosomes were removed and stocks were maintained. After repeated attempts, we are unable to bring <italic>attP2</italic> stocks (BDSC 25710) on triple balancers and hence were unable to isogenize them. Hence, only <italic>attP40</italic> and S2R<sup>+</sup> cells were processed for NGS sequencing. <italic>attP2</italic> stocks were Sanger sequenced for genomic regions of interest whenever needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Whole genome DNA library preparation, next-generation sequencing (NGS), and variant analysis</title><p>Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen Genomic DNA extraction kit. The Whole Genome DNA libraries were constructed using TruSeq Nano DNA LT Sample Preparation Kit Set B (24 Samples), Catalog no-FC-121–4002 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina Inc, USA). Briefly, the genomic DNA (100 ng) were sonicated using Covaris S220 to 350 bp insert size and clean up the fragmented DNA using illumina sample purification beads. Purified fragmented DNA were end repaired, 3'ends adenylation and adapter ligation. DNA fragments were enriched using eight cycles of PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions. Library quality was analyzed on Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using DNA high sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, USA). Next-generation sequencing of libraries was performed using Illumina Hiseq 2500 for 2 × 100 bp. Sequence reads of both isogenized <italic>attP40</italic> (30 million paired end reads) and S2R<sup>+</sup> (29 million paired end reads) cells were imported into the CLC Genomics Workbench 12.0 (Qiagen). The reads were trimmed off the adapter sequences and reads containing low-quality bases eliminated.

Briefly, flies were anesthetized and immobilized at the end of a disposable pipette tip using a drop of colorless nail varnish. Recordings were performed using glass microelectrodes (640786, Harvard Apparatus, MA) filled with 0.8% w/v NaCl solution. Voltage changes were recorded between the surface of the eye and an electrode placed on the thorax. At 1 day, flies, both male and female, were used for recording. Following fixing and positioning, flies were dark adapted for 5 min. ERGs were recorded with 2 s flashes of green light stimulus, with 10 stimuli (flashes) per recording and 15 s of recovery time between two flashes of light. Stimulating light was delivered from an LED light source to within 5 mm of the fly's eye through a fiber optic guide. Calibrated neutral density filters were used to vary the intensity of the light source. Voltage changes were amplified using a DAM50 amplifier (SYS-DAM50, WPI, FL) and recorded using pCLAMP 10.4. Analysis of traces was performed using Clampfit 10.4 (Molecular Devices, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Imaging of salivary glands and nephrocytes</title><p>Salivary glands or nephrocytes (of appropriate genotypes) from wandering 3rd-instar larvae were dissected in 1X phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and fixed for 20 min at room temperature in 4% paraformaldehyde.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three reviewers suggested major criticisms on validations of the new tool and generated stocks. Therefore, the revised manuscript should demonstrate efficient knockout events by expression analysis and by extensive molecular analysis of targeted mutations for many more genes rather than a few. Essential revisions are summarized as below and full reviewers' comments are attached for your reference.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study describes the generation of a CRISPR/Cas-9 mediated gene editing toolkit in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and offers germline or tissue-specific knockouts of <italic>Drosophila</italic> π signaling genes. There have been several independent efforts to generate systematic knockout tools in this study, and it will be a valuable toolkit for the fly community working on π signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and whole animals. However, this report shows a few successful cases of gene knockouts and insufficient assessments for the new tool, and therefore, the manuscript requires additional extensive molecular and genetic evaluation of the presented data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Confirm DNA lesions in many more cases:</p><p>i) The authors designed dgRNA constructs to generate gene deletion. Although they claimed that the targeted deletions were confirmed in S2R+ cells, it is unclear whether the mutations were confirmed in flies.</p><p>According to subsection “Investigating the role of π signalling in eye development using the dgRNA toolkit”, a few representative ey&gt;Cas9;dgRNA lines were tested for genomic deletion. Then, it appears that the majority of 103 transgenic lines were not tested for molecular lesions. Table 1 shows a list of genes with the size of the genomic deletion. If in fact only a few lines were tested, then it would be difficult to properly evaluate the data in Table 1. It is important to know how many lines were tested for deletion and how many actually showed an expected size of deletions.</p><p>2) Better validation of the efficacy:</p><p>i) The authors verified the efficiency and usefulness of the tool by targeting π genes in the eye. Most of the known target genes resulted in desirable phenotypes in the eye; however, some did not. In this case, it could be a matter of protein stability as the authors explained, but it also could be due to the efficiency or the variability of the new tool in the eye. The tool requires a better validation on a cell-by-cell basis. For example, with the use of in situ hybridization or an antibody against the protein (there are several antibodies readily available), expressions of target genes could be measured. If the phenotype/expression level could be quantified, efficiencies of whole body mutant, tissue-specific RNAi, and tissue-specific deletion need to be compared.</p><p>ii) In Figure 4A, the authors have shown a truncated band of CG5734 without showing its full-length gene. Even with the presence of truncated size, the intact gene may be still viable in some eye cells. It again will be important to show how efficient it is to use the new tool at a tissue level.</p><p>iii) In addition to ey-gal4, the tool requires validations with additional tissue-specific drivers. This will not only verify its effectiveness but enhance the broader applications.</p><p>iv) In subsection “Generation of whole fly knockouts and using dgRNA transgenics”, it seems that they tried germline knockout for several genes, but the procedure is not mentioned and the data are described very ambiguously. &quot;The deletions obtained in this manner are highly efficient (between 4-100% efficiency in F1 flies and between 3-70% efficiency in F2 flies) in generating germline knockouts with deletions ranging in size between 400bp and 38kb.&quot; From this description, it is difficult to know whether the deletions are highly efficient as claimed. The procedure for making germline knockout and the results need to be described in full detail. In Table 1, a number of tissue-specific knockouts show no phenotype. It is possible that some of them may not have expected mutations.</p><p>v) There is no data showing the loss of protein expression in eye discs from eye-specific knockout lines. Crosses with ey-Gal4 will generate mosaic tissues in developing eye discs. It is important to know how efficient is a somatic knockout in the region of ey-Gal4 expression.</p><p>3) Compare SNPs in other strains:</p><p>i) The authors make the argument that because their dgRNA constructs work in both their BL25709 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and S2R+ cells and match the reference genome, that they should work in other genetic backgrounds. However, these backgrounds don't sample the full range of nucleotide variation in laboratory stocks. Can the authors compare their gRNA sequences with genomes of other common lab strains (or optionally other wildtype genomic sequences like the DGRP)?</p><p>ii) Authors have carefully selected dgRNA sequences by comparing genomic sequences of S2R+ cells, parent fly stocks, and reference fly genome. This will be a useful resource for researchers who would refer to this study in the future. Therefore, detailed descriptions of SNPs found (e.g. in a table or additional diagrams) need to be added in addition to the diagram shown in Figure 2.</p><p>4) Separate methods from results:</p><p>i) Since the manuscript describes methods in the result, it does not separate the methods from the main text. However, it should either be more specific in the text or include the methods part for further details. As one example, UAS-Cas9-eGFP transgenic flies newly generated in this study require detail information for those who will order stocks.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Gaghu and colleagues have designed a set of CRISPR based genome editing tools and constructed reagents by which 103 phosphoinositide (PI)-related genes can be individually deleted. With the use of the reagents, authors have identified novel π genes that control eye development and verified the effectiveness of the tools.</p><p>This study will potentially benefit the fly community by providing the new tissue-specific CRISPR tool. However, as a resource paper, the manuscript requires better validations on the technique itself and focus on describing the validity of the tool.</p><p>1) Authors have carefully selected dgRNA sequences by comparing genomic sequences of S2R+ cells, parent fly stocks, and reference fly genome. This will be a useful resource for researchers who would refer to this study in the future. Therefore, detailed descriptions of SNPs found (e.g. in a table or additional diagrams) need to be added in addition to the diagram shown in Figure 2.</p><p>a) In the same vein, if SNPs in different backgrounds are critical for the CRISPR efficiency, giving a few examples of such cases would enhance the importance of resources provided.</p><p>2) Since the manuscript describes methods in the result, it does not separate the methods from the main text.

With additional constructs, they could also be used to generate new alleles or tagged proteins. This is a useful toolkit for the growing community working on signalling, transport and metabolism of π in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells and whole animals. The lines target two sites in each gene, are robust to some target genome variation, and in some cases are validated using RNAi or known mutant phenotypes. This is a very useful collection of well-designed lines, with good supporting validation.</p><p>The authors make the argument that because their dgRNA constructs work in both their BL25709 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and S2R+ cells and match the reference genome, that they should work in other genetic backgrounds. However, these backgrounds don't sample the full range of nucleotide variation in laboratory stocks. Can the authors compare their gRNA sequences with genomes of other common lab strains (or optionally other wildtype genomic sequnces like the DGRP)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes the generation of a genetic tool kit for tissue-specific and whole animal knockout using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. There have been several independent efforts to generate Cas9-based systematic gene knockout tools in culture cells and flies. This study attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing guide RNAi library targeted to a relatively small set the genes involved in phosphoinositides (PI) metabolism and signaling. This report shows a few successful cases of gene knockout and a list of 103 targeted genes. Therefore, in principle, the genetic tools generated in this study can be valuable resources in the field of π signaling. However, I feel that the general strategy used in this study is not particularly novel, and more importantly, analysis of their library appears to be rather limited and preliminary for proper evaluation of the presented data.</p><p>Merits of this work:</p><p>1) They sequenced S2R+ genome and an isogenic fly genome. After comparing these sequences and the reference genome, gRNA targets were carefully selected to avoid potential mismatches or off-targets.</p><p>2) This study used double guide RNAs targeted to 1st and last coding exons to generate null mutations by deletion. The use of T2A-mediated eGFP expression also helps to identify Cas9-expressing cells.</p><p>3) Cas9 mutagenesis targeted to a full set of PI-related genes is a new attempt.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Overall, their strategy for tissue-specific knockout is similar to two recent papers (Meltzer et al., 2019; Port et al., 2020). Hence, novelty of this manuscript is somewhat diminished. In addition, there are major issues related to their methods and data, as listed below.</p><p>1) Authors designed dgRNA constructs to generate gene deletion. Although they claimed that the targeted deletions were confirmed in S2R+ cells, it is unclear whether the mutations were confirmed in flies.</p><p>According to subsection “Investigating the role of π signalling in eye development using the dgRNA toolkit”, a few representative ey&gt;Cas9;dgRNA lines were tested for genomic deletion. Then, it appears that the majority of 103 transgenic lines were not tested for molecular lesions. Table 1 shows a list of genes with the size of the genomic deletion. If in fact only a few lines were tested, then it would be difficult to properly evaluate the data in Table 1. It is important to know how many lines were tested for deletion and how many actually showed expected size of deletions.</p><p>2) In subsection “Generation of whole fly knockouts and using dgRNA transgenics”, it seems that they tried germline knockout for several genes, but the procedure is not mentioned and the data are described very ambiguously. &quot;The deletions obtained in this manner are highly efficient (between 4-100% efficiency in F1 flies and between 3-70% efficiency in F2 flies) in generating germline knockouts with deletions ranging in size between 400bp and 38kb.&quot; From this description, it is difficult to know whether the deletions are highly efficient as claimed. The procedure for making germline knockout and the results need to be described in full detail. In Table 1, a number of tissue-specific knockout show no phenotype. It is possible that some of them may not have expected mutations.</p><p>3) There is no data showing the loss of protein expression in eye discs from eye-specific knockout lines. Crosses with ey-Gal4 will generate mosaic tissues in developing eye discs. It is important to know how efficient is somatic knockout in the region of ey-Gal4 expression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A genome engineering resource to uncover principles of cellular organization and tissue architecture by lipid signalling&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Utpal Banerjee (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All the reviewers agreed that the authors added a substantial amount of new data and appropriately addressed most of the concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, Trivedi et al. provide a significantly improved version of their work with additional analyses and in vivo validations and addressed most of the concerns raised by the reviewers. Two additional points need to be modified to clarify the results.</p><p>1) In Figure 2B, the authors validated the efficiency of ocrl deletion by immunohistochemistry and showed that ocrl knockout reduces the anti-OCRL staining in the wing disc. However, staining patterns shown in controls are too low, and it is hard to tell whether the antibody used was working in the disc.

Although they claimed that the targeted deletions were confirmed in S2R+ cells, it is unclear whether the mutations were confirmed in flies.</p><p>According to subsection “Investigating the role of π signalling in eye development using the dgRNA toolkit”, a few representative ey&gt;Cas9;dgRNA lines were tested for genomic deletion. Then, it appears that the majority of 103 transgenic lines were not tested for molecular lesions. Table 1 shows a list of genes with the size of the genomic deletion. If in fact only a few lines were tested, then it would be difficult to properly evaluate the data in Table 1. It is important to know how many lines were tested for deletion and how many actually showed an expected size of deletions.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the above comment following has been done:</p><p>a) dgRNA for all the 103 genes were tested for deletions in flies after crossing with Act5c-Cas9. 102 of these seem to show deletion in flies. Thus, in addition to our previous experiments (reported in the initial submission) where we showed deletions generated by all of the dgRNAs in S2R+ cells, we have now included new data showing that 102/103 dgRNAs also work in fly tissues (Supplementary file 1).</p><p>b) The exact size of deletion for each dgRNA is now added in Supplementary file 1 according to the results obtained in flies after sequencing the deletion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Better validation of the efficacy:</p><p>i) The authors verified the efficiency and usefulness of the tool by targeting π genes in the eye. Most of the known target genes resulted in desirable phenotypes in the eye; however, some did not. In this case, it could be a matter of protein stability as the authors explained, but it also could be due to the efficiency or the variability of the new tool in the eye. The tool requires a better validation on a cell-by-cell basis. For example, with the use of in situ hybridization or an antibody against the protein (there are several antibodies readily available), expressions of target genes could be measured. If the phenotype/expression level could be quantified, efficiencies of whole body mutant, tissue-specific RNAi, and tissue-specific deletion need to be compared.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. It has been a challenge to obtain appropriate antibodies during the current pandemic with many labs shut or difficult shipping conditions. Therefore, we were only able to perform a limited number of experiments. A well-validated antibody for OCRL was available. We were able to use this and show that in discs where the dgRNA for <italic>ocrl</italic> was expressed, there was a reduction in OCRL protein expression (Figure 2B). Quantification of the staining intensity across discs (Figure 2C) showed that the reduction in OCRL protein levels was quite uniform suggested minimal cell to cell variability in OCRL protein depletion with these reagents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) In Figure 4A, the authors have shown a truncated band of CG5734 without showing its full-length gene. Even with the presence of truncated size, the intact gene may be still viable in some eye cells. It again will be important to show how efficient it is to use the new tool at a tissue level.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been tested for several genes. Most do not show wildtype bands either because of high efficiency of deletion, or more likely because smaller deletion products are amplified favorably in PCR cycles. However, we have added a Figure 4—figure supplement 1 with an example where the WT product was amplified.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iii) In addition to ey-gal4, the tool requires validations with additional tissue-specific drivers. This will not only verify its effectiveness but enhance the broader applications.</p></disp-quote><p>We also performed additional deletions with tissue specific GAL4 lines. We expressed three different guideRNAs for the PI3K signalling pathway using nub-GAL4 that expresses in a specific domain of the developing wing imaginal disc. Each of these dgRNAs (encoding components of the Class I PI3K signalling pathway), when expressed in the developing eye disc with UAS-Cas9 had resulted in changes in tissue growth resulting in altered eye size. Likewise, when expressed using nub-GAL4, they resulted in equivalent effects in the phenotype of the adult wing. Thus, deletion of <italic>pTEN<sup>dgRNA</sup></italic> resulted in a larger wing blade while deletion of <italic>pi3K92E<sup>dgRNA</sup> </italic>and <italic>akt<sup>dgRNA</sup> </italic>resulted in substantial reductions in wing blade size. These results are now presented in Figure 4E.</p><p>Overall, during the course of this study, we have shown that our dgRNAs when expressed using four tissue specific drivers (ey-GAL4, nub-GAL, vasa-GAL4, nanos-GAL4) produce deletions and phenotypes. In addition, we have also demonstrated its ability to produce deletions with the ubiquitous Act5C-Gal4 that expresses in all tissues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>iv) In subsection “Generation of whole fly knockouts and using dgRNA transgenics”, it seems that they tried germline knockout for several genes, but the procedure is not mentioned and the data are described very ambiguously. &quot;The deletions obtained in this manner are highly efficient (between 4-100% efficiency in F1 flies and between 3-70% efficiency in F2 flies) in generating germline knockouts with deletions ranging in size between 400bp and 38kb.&quot; From this description, it is difficult to know whether the deletions are highly efficient as claimed. The procedure for making germline knockout and the results need to be described in full detail.</p></disp-quote><p>The absolute numbers have now been added to Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Table 1, a number of tissue-specific knockouts show no phenotype. It is possible that some of them may not have expected mutations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have a number of examples where there was no phenotype, but testing for deletions by PCR in these showed that a deletion had indeed taken place. This has now been added as Figure 4—figure supplement 2. It is possible that in some of these cases (i) the gene in question does not have a role in eye development (ii) some amount of residual pre-deletion RNA/protein perdures in the cells and is sufficient to support normal function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>v) There is no data showing the loss of protein expression in eye discs from eye-specific knockout lines. Crosses with ey-Gal4 will generate mosaic tissues in developing eye discs. It is important to know how efficient is a somatic knockout in the region of ey-Gal4 expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the challenge of obtaining appropriate antibodies during the current pandemic with many labs shut or difficult shipping conditions, we were only able to perform a limited number of experiments. A well- validated antibody for OCRL was available. We were able to use this and show that in discs where the dgRNA for ocrl was expressed there was a reduction in OCRL protein expression (Figure 2B). Quantification of the staining intensity across discs (Figure 2C) showed that the reduction in OCRL protein levels was quite uniform. Please note that we were able to do this experiment with only 2 genotypes- Act5c-Cas9/+; <italic>ocrl<sup>dgRNA</sup></italic>/+ and Act5c-Cas9/+ due to limitation of antibody availability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Compare SNPs in other strains:</p><p>i) The authors make the argument that because their dgRNA constructs work in both their BL25709 <italic>Drosophila</italic> and S2R+ cells and match the reference genome, that they should work in other genetic backgrounds. However, these backgrounds don't sample the full range of nucleotide variation in laboratory stocks. Can the authors compare their gRNA sequences with genomes of other common lab strains (or optionally other wildtype genomic sequences like the DGRP)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have compared the sequences obtained using NGS with WT genomic seq from Flybase. In addition, the designed gRNAs have now been matched to recently added genomic sequences of reference genome r_6, vasa-Cas9 (BDSC 51324), nos-Cas9 II (BDSC 78781) and nos-Cas9 III (BDSC 78782). Only 1 gRNA target (targeting CG10426), out of the 206 generated, seemed to have one base mismatch (Supplementary file 1- the variant base marked in red ), while the other 205 targets matched between all the genomes. These gRNA can hence be used in many genetic backgrounds.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>ii) Authors have carefully selected dgRNA sequences by comparing genomic sequences of S2R+ cells, parent fly stocks, and reference fly genome.

This study attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of constructing guide RNAi library targeted to a relatively small set the genes involved in phosphoinositides (PI) metabolism and signaling. This report shows a few successful cases of gene knockout and a list of 103 targeted genes. Therefore, in principle, the genetic tools generated in this study can be valuable resources in the field of π signaling.

The dOCRL polypeptide of the expected Mr of ca. 100 kDa is completely absent in dOCRLKO lysates. Protein levels of actin are used as the loading control. dOCRL antibody used here has been described in (Del Signore et al., 2017)(B) Immunolabelling of pericardial nephrocytes from 3rd instar larvae to examine the distribution of the dOCRL protein. As expected, the dOCRL protein is seen in punctate structures throughout the cell body but excluded from the nucleus. This staining is completely absent in dOCRLKO animals. The experiment was repeated three times and multiple animals examined in each case. A single nephrocyte is shown for illustrative purposes. (C) Schematic depicting the generation of nephrocyte specific knock out (NephroctyeKO) of dOCRL. A nephrocyte specific Gal4-Dot-Gal4 is used and combined with the dgRNA for dOCRL and UAS-Cas9-eGFP. Animals of the test and control genotype are identified on the basis of eGFP expression. (D) PCR analysis demonstrating the 555 bp band detected when dOCRL is edited by these dgRNAs is shown. For nephrocyteKO animals larvae were dissected and the body wall (including heart tube and nephrocytes) was sued for the DNA prep. As a positive control the germ line dOCRLKO larval lysates were used. CG7004 is used as a control gene for the quality and quantity of the DNA prep. The 555bp diagnostic band is seen in the dOCRLKO and nephrocyteKO lysates but not in wild type flies and in NTC (no template control). (E) Immunostaining of nephrocytes in dOCRL-NephrocyteKO animals. A single nephrocyte is shown. Green channel shows the GFP generated from the Cas9-EGFP transgene. Red channel shows immunolabelling with the dOCRL antibody. Nucleus is stained with DAPI. There is no detectable signal for dOCRL in the nephrocytes of NephrocyteKO animals; experiment repeated twice and 24 individual nephrocytes images from multiple animals. Although the immunostaining for dOCRL has been repeated twice, NephrocyteKO animals have been generated many times for physiological and cell biological characterization which is described in that manuscript.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55793-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 3C, gel images do not have proper labels.</p></disp-quote><p>Labelling has now been done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) If possible, it will be best to organize the deposition of generated flies to major stock centers before publication and describe it in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We are already in touch with the DGRC to deposit the gRNA plasmids in this repository.
