of a well-proportioned body plan. This is clear during somitogenesis, where progenitors must be allocated to the axis over time whilst maintaining a progenitor population for continued elaboration of the body plan. However, the relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic signals in timing progenitor addition at the single-cell level is not yet understood. Heterochronic grafts from older to younger embryos have suggested a level of intrinsic timing whereby later staged cells contribute to more posterior portions of the axis. To determine the precise step at which cells are delayed, we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis on heterochronic grafts of somite progenitors in the chicken embryo. This revealed a previously undescribed cell state within which heterochronic grafted cells are stalled. The delayed exit of older cells from this state correlates with expression of posterior <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Using grafting and explant culture, we find that both <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression and the migratory capabilities of progenitor populations are intrinsically regulated at the population level. However, by grafting varied sizes of tissue, we find that small heterochronic grafts disperse more readily and contribute to more anterior portions of the body axis while still maintaining <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression. This enhanced dispersion is not replicated in explant culture, suggesting that it is a consequence of interaction between host and donor tissue and thus extrinsic to the donor tissue. Therefore, we demonstrate that the timing of cell dispersion and resulting axis contribution is impacted by a combination of both intrinsic and extrinsic cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Hox</kwd><kwd>gastrulation</kwd><kwd>primitive streak</kwd><kwd>somitogenesis</kwd><kwd>timing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.35802/109408</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steventon</surname><given-names>Benjamin John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000275</institution-id><institution>Leverhulme Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG93881</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Serrano Nájera</surname><given-names>Guillermo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Busby</surname><given-names>Lara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>225360/Z/22/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steventon</surname><given-names>Benjamin John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Developmental tempo refers to the cell-intrinsic features that produce species-specific developmental speeds, including rates of transcription, translation, and protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matsuda et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rayon et al., 2020</xref>). In the context of an embryo, cells which have intrinsic features must regulate their dynamics in accordance with their surroundings to produce emergent properties in a manner that is not well understood. Therefore, the relative balance of intrinsic and extrinsic cues in timing events in development is an important question that has been investigated in contexts including limb development and the vertebrate tailbud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chinnaiya et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fulton et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pickering et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saiz-Lopez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Perez et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stainton and Towers, 2022</xref>).</p><p>The vertebrate primary body axis comprises a set of highly conserved axial and paraxial components, namely the midline notochord, dorsal neural tube, and pairs of somites on either side of the midline. These structures are produced in a defined anterior to posterior sequence by the controlled allocation of axial progenitor cells to the body axis over time. In the avian embryo, this occurs through the passage of cells through the blastopore-analogous structures of the primitive streak (PS) and node, which will go on to form a structure termed the tailbud, found at the caudal extremity of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Storey, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Catala et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gray and Dale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoenwolf, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Selleck and Stern, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, a population of progenitor cells is maintained within the embryo throughout the period of axis elongation. Crucially, the contribution of cells from progenitor populations to the axis occurs in a gradual manner, with cells streaming through the PS or later from the tailbud over a period of several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hambuger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>). The mechanisms which underlie this gradual streaming behaviour are unknown, though a role for <italic>Hox</italic> genes in timing axis contribution of progenitor cells has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deschamps and Duboule, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>). During development of the vertebrate posterior body, axial progenitor cells express <italic>Hox</italic> genes in a differential manner over time – a phenomenon termed temporal collinearity (‘the Hox Clock’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deschamps and Duboule, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izpisúa-Belmonte et al., 1991</xref>). Specifically, as development progresses, axial progenitor populations express progressively more 5′ <italic>Hox</italic> gene complements. Previous work has implicated <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the control of cell behaviour during posterior body development: the overexpression of various 5′ <italic>Hox</italic> genes in axial progenitor cells of the avian PS is sufficient to delay their contribution to the body axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>). More 5′ <italic>Hox</italic> genes delay the timing of cell contribution to a greater extent than more 3′ <italic>Hox</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the relative role of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic cues in timing the decision of individual cells to enter the body axis is unknown. The delayed contribution of heterochronic grafts of tissue from older to younger embryos relative to stage-matched grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tam and Tan, 1992</xref>) suggests a degree of intrinsic control over axis contribution timing, but the extent to which this is true remains to be understood. In this article, we exploit the rich toolkit provided by experimental embryology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Busby et al., 2022</xref>) in conjunction with next-generation sequencing methods and multiplexed staining to investigate the extent to which axial progenitor gene expression and behaviour are intrinsically or extrinsically regulated.</p><p>A progenitor population that produces the medial portion of somites has been described in the avian embryo, residing at the 90% region of the PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Iimura et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>). We chose to focus on this cell population, herein termed the medial somite progenitor (MSP) population, as a model for understanding the timing of cell contribution to the body axis. In particular, we focus our analyses on HH4 (definitive PS stage) and HH8 (4 somite-stage) embryo for several reasons. Whilst the somite progenitor population is continuous across these stages, it is known that the first 4–5 somites of the avian axis are distinct from more posterior ones – they are formed simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dias et al., 2014</xref>), lack the rostro-caudal sub-patterning present in more posterior somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodrigues et al., 2006</xref>), are not invaded by neural crest cells which give rise to ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 1987</xref>), and do not give rise to segmented structures but instead to the occipital and sphenoid bones of the skull (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Couly et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2000</xref>). Cells of the HH4 MSP region give rise to the occipital somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Psychoyos and Stern, 1996</xref>), whereas at HH8 these somites have formed already (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hambuger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>), and so the progenitor region exclusively produces trunk and tail somites. It is therefore interesting to consider possible differences between the dynamics and behaviour of the progenitor region between HH8 and HH4, and whether these are maintained irrespective of the environment that the tissue is placed in. In normal development, the context in which the HH4 and HH8 MSP regions allocate cells to the axis is very different – at HH4 (primary gastrulation) the mesendoderm represents an unbounded compartment that cells move into after ingression through the PS, whereas at HH8 a clear pre-somitic mesoderm is formed and cells are allocated to this bounded compartment. Despite the substantial differences between occipital and trunk somite formation, it remains unknown whether these modes of somitogenesis result from changing environmental inputs or changes to the progenitor population itself over time.</p><p>We find that heterochronic grafts of somitic progenitors from HH8 to HH4 are delayed relative to stage-matched grafts at a previously undescribed step that we term ‘dispersion’, occurring after cells pass through the PS and enabling substantial mixing between donor and host tissue in the mesendodermal compartment. By culturing MSP tissue ex vivo on fibronectin, we find that the delayed migration is an intrinsic property of HH8 tissue and can account for the delay in axis contribution of heterochronic grafts. Surveying <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in the MSP region at HH4 and HH8 reveals key differences in gene expression, which are maintained in grafted HH8 tissue in the HH4 environment, suggesting that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression is also an intrinsic property of the tissue. Together, this work demonstrates that a balance of tissue-intrinsic and -extrinsic timers controls <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression and cell dispersion during progenitor addition to the body axis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Delayed contribution of heterochronic grafts is characterised by a lack of dispersion of cells from the primitive streak</title><p>To ask whether the behaviour of progenitor cells differs before and after the onset of node regression (cessation of primary gastrulation), we compared homochronic HH4 to HH4 grafts with HH8 to HH4 grafts. Homochronic grafts of MSP cells were performed at HH4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hambuger and Hamilton, 1951</xref>) from a GFP transgenic line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>) to a wild-type embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Over time, the gradual contribution of cells deriving from the MSP population to the body axis can be observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>). At each timepoint, a population of MSP cells remains closely associated with the morphological remnant of the node during node regression after HH5 (indicated by the yellow boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–G</xref>), whilst other cells ingress through the streak and begin to migrate towards their final location in the medial portion of a somite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’ and G’’’</xref>). At the final timepoint imaged (24 hr after grafting), GFP-expressing donor cells can still be found in the progenitor region, by which time the embryo has reached tailbud stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G’’</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delayed contribution of heterochronic grafts is characterised by a lack of dispersion of cells from the primitive streak (PS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Homochronic grafts of the 90% PS region were performed from GFP-expressing HH4 embryos to wild-type HH4 embryos. (<bold>B–-G’’</bold>) Combined GFP/brightfield images of grafts at various times between 0 and 24 hr after grafting reveal the behaviours of this population during body axis development. As the node regresses posteriorly after HH5, a subpopulation of the medial somite progenitor (MSP) region remains associated closely with the morphological remnant of the node (yellow box ‘MSP’), whilst other cells clearly part from this population and move towards the anterior of the embryo, where the somites will form. At 24 hr post-graft, embryos are approximately HH10-11 and GFP cells are clearly located in the medial portion of the somites (<bold>G’</bold>), close to the midline.

Within 3 hr, GFP donor cells in homochronic grafts have spread appreciably from the graft site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I vs. J</xref>), whereas the location of GFP donor cells in heterochronic grafts does not differ substantially from immediately post-grafting (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>). The change in area occupied by the graft (between 0 and 3 hr post-grafting) was quantified and found to be statistically significant between the two graft types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P</xref>). Importantly, this delay in dispersion correlates with a difference in anteroposterior somite contribution: whilst homochronic grafts invariably have their most anterior axis contribution in somite 1, heterochronic grafts typically have their most anterior contribution in somite 4 or 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K vs. O</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Q</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the lack of cell dispersion in heterochronic grafts is reminiscent of HH8 cell behaviour in the HH8 environment, we performed stage-matched HH8 to HH8 grafts and allowed them to grow for 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1R–S</xref>). Importantly, stage-matched HH8 to HH8 grafts mix with surrounding host tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S’</xref>), suggesting that the limited dispersion of heterochronic grafts is associated with the combination of HH8 tissue with the HH4 environment. At 24 hr after grafting, HH8 to HH8 stage-matched grafts are primarily found in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM), meaning that they contribute to somites posterior to somite 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S</xref>). Therefore, while heterochronic grafts (HH8 to HH4) are delayed relative to HH4-to-HH4 grafts in their axis contribution, these cells nonetheless contribute to a more anterior portion of the axis than they would in their normal developmental context.</p><p>These results show that HH8 progenitor cells exhibit substantially different behaviour in the HH4 environment relative to stage-matched grafts as early as 3 hr after grafting. We therefore focused on the initial ingression and spreading of cells from the PS to elucidate which cell state transitions are key for the timing of somite progenitor addition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single-cell analysis reveals a previously undescribed cell state within which heterochronic grafted cells are stalled</title><p>To investigate the cell states occupied by homochronic and heterochronic MSP grafts, we turned to single-cell RNA-sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Splitting the dimensionality plot by sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>) shows some differences in the clusters populated in each sample – most notably, the HH4-4 sample lacks clusters 0, 4, and 7 which represent HH8 tissue (expressing posterior marker genes, including <italic>Hoxb8</italic> and <italic>Cdx4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barak et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joshi et al., 2019</xref>).

Strikingly, after 3 hr, HH8 <italic>eGFP</italic>-positive cells are enriched in the central clusters 6, 8, and 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Importantly, surveying the HH4-HH4 homochronic graft dataset shows that this cell state is not unique to the heterochronic graft condition, though there is not a particular enrichment of cells in this state in normal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and G</xref>).

Re-slicing Z-stacks of these grafts allowed us to survey the localisation of eGFP-positive cells in the dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). In both homochronic and heterochronic grafts, eGFP-positive cells clearly reside in the lower, ventral mesendodermal cell layer rather than the more dorsal epiblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>).

To further probe the morphology of grafted cell populations, we fixed both homochronic and heterochronic grafts after 20–30 min, as soon as the tissue had integrated into the host embryo. These embryos were stained with phalloidin and immunostained for the basement membrane component laminin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G–H</xref>). Homochronic grafts show a similar nuclear density to surrounding host tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In addition, the basement membrane within the grafted tissue is incompletely broken down at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G’’</xref>) consistent with the grafting of full-thickness streak tissue comprising both epiblast and mesendodermal cells. In contrast, heterochronic grafts at 30 min have an elevated nuclear density compared to surrounding host tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) and are delineated by a circumferential ring of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H’’’</xref>). These results suggest that HH8 cells can undergo gene expression changes associated with EMT but are delayed in their migration away from the PS, in a step we will refer to as <italic>cell dispersion</italic>.

We found a clear enrichment of genes associated with cell adhesion in this cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, full gene lists in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>), suggesting that the delayed dispersion and axis contribution of grafted cells may be accounted for by differences in cell adhesion. To ask if these genes are differentially expressed between HH4- and HH8-derived cells (and thus could account for the different behaviour of these two populations upon grafting), we subsetted the scRNA-seq dataset to clusters 6, 8, and 12 only, annotated cells as either HH8- or HH4-derived (based on <italic>eGFP</italic> expression), and looked for genes differentially expressed between the two groups (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Note that there are subtle differences between the cell cycle state of HH8 and HH4 populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and D–E</xref>) and so we regressed cell cycle-associated genes from the analysis to focus on other differences. The most significantly enriched GO term in this analysis is ‘anteroposterior pattern specification’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>), which annotates genes, including the <italic>Hox</italic> genes <italic>Hoxa7</italic> and <italic>Hoxb8</italic>.

To test this, we developed an ex vivo culture system where MSP tissue was dissected and cultured on fibronectin-coated glass dishes. We find that mesodermal cells readily migrate as a sheet in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both HH4 and HH8 MSP tissue migrate on fibronectin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>), so we used particle image velocimetry (PIV) to characterise the dynamics of this process in more depth. Representative explant velocity fields are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref> for HH4 and HH8 explants, respectively. HH4 explants undergo a rapid expansion in area with no or little lag time before this expansion begins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), whereas HH8 tissue does not show a substantial increase in area for the first 10–15 hr of imaging, upon which time it expands relatively slowly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The same trends can be seen in the velocity data, with HH4 explants showing an initial average velocity of 0.2 μm/min and a maximal average velocity of ~0.27 μm/min at 9–10 hr of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). In contrast, HH8 tissue has a relatively constant velocity of ~0.04 μm/min rising to ~0.1 μm/min at 14–15 hr of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Thus, HH8 tissue shows a slower increase in area (and corresponding lower velocity of tissue flow) than HH4 tissue, as well as a substantial lag time before spreading. This suggests that HH8 tissue intrinsically has a weaker proclivity to migrate than HH4 tissue and importantly could account for the lack of early migration we observe in heterochronic HH8 to HH4 grafts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Explanting medial somite progenitor (MSP) tissue on fibronectin reveals that HH4 and HH8 MSP tissue intrinsically migrate with different dynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) and (<bold>C</bold>) are brightfield stills taken from timelapse movies of MSP tissue migrating on fibronectin, with (<bold>A</bold>) showing an HH4 explant and (<bold>C</bold>) showing an HH8 explant.

RT-qPCR for various <italic>Hox</italic> genes was performed to test for differences between <italic>Hox</italic> expression at 0 and 24 hr after explanting. In each case, this difference was compared to the endogenous change in expression in the MSP region over an equivalent period of time – 24 hr after HH8 embryos reach HH14, so MSP tissue at HH14 was used to represent the endogenous change in expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).

Thus, we performed HH8 to HH4 heterochronic grafts with variable-sized pieces of donor tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that at the smallest graft size (eighth size, approximately 6000 μm<sup>2</sup> initial area), donor cells had spread substantially from the initial graft site within 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), whereas all larger graft sizes remained as a single cluster of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, example shown here is a quarter-sized graft, approximately 12,500 μm<sup>2</sup> initial area).

Alternatively, it could be due to extrinsic factors involving the interaction of host and donor cells that impacts larger and smaller grafted populations differently. To ask whether the size dependency of dispersion is an intrinsic feature of the HH8 tissue, we explanted HH4 and HH8 MSP tissue of varied sizes on fibronectin. If small HH8 explants can migrate at higher velocities than large HH8 explants on fibronectin, this would suggest that HH8 tissue can intrinsically account for the graft outcomes observed. We found that for both HH4 and HH8 tissue, smaller explants exhibit lower velocities of tissue flow and achieve smaller areas throughout the observed 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>). This suggests that the enhanced dispersion of small HH8 grafts in the HH4 environment cannot be accounted for by the HH8 donor tissue alone and instead is an outcome of the interaction between HH8 and HH4 tissue. Thus, despite the intrinsically regulated differences in gene expression and migratory dynamics between HH4 and HH8 tissue, extrinsic inputs also influence the timing of cell contribution to the vertebrate primary body axis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Mesodermal dispersion is a key step in avian gastrulation</title><p>In this work, we first sought to understand at what point in the developmental process of progenitor contribution to the body axis heterochronic grafts of cells from older to younger embryos are delayed. The delayed contribution of axial progenitor cells to the axis that we observe is consistent with previous studies, including mouse tailbud grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tam and Tan, 1992</xref>) and chicken PS grafts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>). Based on single-cell RNA-sequencing and in vivo gene expression analyses, we propose that MSP contribution to the body axis can be conceptualised as consisting of three successive phases: ingression, dispersion, and migration. In the first step, mesodermal progenitor cells of the PS undergo a classical EMT and ingress from the dorsal cell layer to the ventral one. This EMT involves a well-characterised set of molecular players including the upregulation of <italic>Snail2</italic> (<italic>Slug</italic>) and a switch from E-cadherin (<italic>Cdh1</italic>) to N-cadherin (<italic>Cdh2</italic>) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dady et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ohkubo and Ozawa, 2004</xref>). Once cells enter the mesendodermal cell layer, substantial and rapid cell dispersion occurs in both the anteroposterior and mediolateral axes. As grafted cell populations become situated within the ventral layer of the embryo as part of the healing process, we are unable to ascertain whether the morphogenetic process of cell ingression is delayed in heterochronic grafts. However, we do observe that the expected changes in EMT gene expression occur within 3 hr of HH8 populations being grafted into HH4 hosts, suggesting that cells are not blocked in this aspect of progenitor cell addition. Instead, cells are delayed in cell dispersion, resulting in the population being maintained as a distinct cluster of cells in the ME and not dispersing readily as control grafts do. These processes are recapitulated in the explant culture system we describe, where both HH4 and HH8 MSP populations ultimately migrate on fibronectin but HH8 populations do so with a delay and at lower velocities. Thus, delayed dispersion of HH8 tissue in heterochronic grafts to HH4 embryos can be accounted for by intrinsic migratory properties of the HH8 tissue.</p><p>As discussed in the introduction, the choice of HH4 and HH8 tissue as the focus for this project is interesting in the context of primary versus secondary gastrulation: the occipital somites form simultaneously from tissue that ingresses during primary gastrulation, whereas trunk somites form periodically through the progressive segmentation of a PSM. Here, we have shown that HH4 MSP tissue (pre-node regression) and HH8 MSP tissue (post-node regression) exhibit substantially different migratory dynamics, despite forming a continuous progenitor population. This concept of evolving cell behaviour and properties over time is consistent with the transcriptional changes that have been described in axial progenitor regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wymeersch et al., 2019</xref>). In our scRNA-seq data, we have found that between HH8- and HH4-derived cells of the same cluster, a whole suite of genes are differentially expressed in addition to <italic>Hox</italic> genes including genes associated with the cell cycle, RNA splicing, and epigenetic remodelling. Cell cycle differences may reflect differences in the population dynamics over time – the expansion versus depletion of the progenitor population, which is not well-characterised. Some of the genes differentially expressed in the intermediate cell state and associated with adhesion (including <italic>Ptk7</italic> and <italic>Nfasc</italic>) are known to have alternative splice transcripts, raising the possibility that despite not being differentially expressed between HH4 and HH8 cells, differences may arise downstream of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hassel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jung et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Katyal et al., 2007</xref>). A multitude of different cellular processes may be functionally important in the changes in cell behaviour we have described here between HH4 and HH8 tissue, and further research will be necessary to clarify the mechanistic underpinning of the differences we have described.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A possible role for cell sorting in graft outcome</title><p>When HH8 tissue is grafted to a HH4 host embryo, it tends to remain as a single group of cells and minimal mixing is observed with the surrounding host tissue. This is in stark contrast to stage-matched grafts (HH4-HH4), where extensive mixing of donor tissue with host tissue is observed. This result resembles published observations on heterotypic grafts of neural tube tissue from different axial levels in the mouse embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trainor and Krumlauf, 2000</xref>). Specifically, when homotypic grafts were performed of tissue between the same axial level, extensive cell mixing was observed, but heterotopic grafts did not show this mixing and instead largely remained as a single coherent group of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trainor and Krumlauf, 2000</xref>). Another study noted that “cells grafted heterochronically integrate less efficiently into host tissues than isochronic grafts (whether heterotopic or homotopic), suggesting that this temporal resetting may be less efficient than their acutely sensitive response to spatial cues” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wymeersch et al., 2021</xref>). Together, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that stage-matched tissues can mix more readily than heterotypic or heterochronic grafts because in the latter case donor cells have a greater affinity for other donor cells than host cells, and vice versa. This would resemble the mechanisms of self-recognition-based sorting that have been described in diverse contexts including, for example, <italic>Xenopus</italic> gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winklbauer and Parent, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Cell sorting is generally believed to result from adhesion differences between tissues. Early experiments in which three species of sponge were dissociated and reaggregated showed the formation of masses preferentially containing cells of the same species, suggesting that these cells have some ability to recognise others of their own kind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wilson, 1907</xref>). Similarly, when cells of amphibian neurulae are disaggregated and allowed to reaggregate, they initially form a mass where any cell type will associate with any other – but within 20 hr fully sort out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Townes and Holtfreter, 1955</xref>). This was found to be true across a huge variety of tissue combinations, and both when tissues were fully disaggregated or combined as explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Townes and Holtfreter, 1955</xref>). More recently it has been suggested that though cell sorting is unlikely to be a major contributor to morphogenesis, these mechanisms may be important for maintaining tissue boundaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Winklbauer and Parent, 2017</xref>). Although the differential gene expression analysis between HH4 and HH8 MSPs described here has not highlighted transcripts for any candidate molecules known to modulate adhesion, as mentioned above, it is entirely possible that due to differences at a protein level, the two stages of tissue show preferential adhesion for other cells of the same stage. A precedent exists for a changing adhesion profile over developmental time: such a dynamic process was described in 1939 by Ernest Just in sea urchin embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Just, 1939</xref>). In a future study, it would be interesting to perform pairwise grafts of tissue between embryonic stages and quantify the extent of cell mixing: this quantity would be expected to scale with the extent of similarity between the tissues. Much remains to be understood about the ways that transplanted tissues interact with their host environment and in certain cases show a greater extent of ‘incorporation’ and mixing with their surrounding host tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hox gene regulation is population-intrinsic for somite progenitors</title><p>Vertebrate embryos express <italic>Hox</italic> genes with a special dynamic – each paralogous cluster of <italic>Hox</italic> genes is expressed with spatiotemporal collinearity, meaning that they are transcribed in a strict 3′ to 5′ order both in space and time. It is known that the location within the cluster defines the timing of expression of each gene, that <italic>Hox</italic> clusters undergo epigenetic remodelling to increase DNA accessibility in a 3′ to 5′ direction, and that the initial induction of Hox gene expression at gastrulation is dependent upon Wnt signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Deschamps and Duboule, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Izpisúa-Belmonte et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kmita and Duboule, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moreau et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neijts et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tschopp et al., 2009</xref>). In the context of human pluripotent stem cell-derived axial progenitors of the spinal cord, it has also been shown that progressive Hox activation occurs in vitro, and that this is dependent on an increase in FGF and then GDF signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mouilleau et al., 2021</xref>). In this work, we find evidence for a population-intrinsic mechanism of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression within the MSP fated region of the PS: once HH8 cells are expressing a given <italic>Hox</italic> gene, they will maintain this expression profile in a novel HH4 environment. However, the MSP population also expresses FGF ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Darnell et al., 2007</xref>), and it could be that a similar mechanism is at play to explain the population-intrinsic control of <italic>Hox</italic> expression here too. The maintenance of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in a new environment (a younger embryo) is consistent with a result reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>, wherein <italic>Hoxb9</italic> expression was shown to persist at 6 hr after heterochronic grafting of streak cells. However, our results differ from those reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>, who observed reprogramming of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in HH15 tailbud chordoneural hinge cells transplanted to the equivalent region of the HH8 embryo – grafted cells no longer express the <italic>Hox</italic> gene <italic>Hoxa10</italic> at 8 hr after grafting. This difference may reflect the different cell populations studied or variation in the contributions of extrinsic and intrinsic influences to <italic>Hox</italic> regulation over the period of primary body axis formation; it is possible that there is a transition from intrinsic to a more extrinsic mode of <italic>Hox</italic> regulation later in primary body axis development. Alternatively, it may be explained by the relative mismatch between donor and host tissue. In the experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McGrew et al., 2008</xref>, <italic>Hoxa10</italic> expression is absent from the progenitor region at HH8-HH10 but expressed at HH15. <italic>Hoxa10</italic> expression is first detected in the progenitor region at HH12 (17 somite stage) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Denans et al., 2015</xref>), corresponding to a theoretical 20 hr lag time before expression of <italic>Hoxa10</italic> in host tissue of HH8 to HH15 grafts. Conversely, our HH8 to HH4 grafts experience a much shorter lag period before host expression of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes surveyed – expression of <italic>Hoxa2,</italic> for example, is evident in host tissue within 6 hr. Additional grafts and additional <italic>Hox</italic> genes must be studied to ascertain which of these possible explanations is most accurate.</p><p>We have seen that the difference in behaviour between homochronic and heterochronic grafts correlates with the persistence of the HH8 <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression profile, raising the possibility that the HH8 <italic>Hox</italic> profile may influence the transition from mesenchyme to invasive mesenchyme. Previous experiments that overexpressed <italic>Hox</italic> genes in PS tissue showed that cells were delayed at the point of ingression through the streak (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iimura and Pourquié, 2006</xref>). However, because donor tissue healed in the ventral compartment of the embryo after grafting, we were unable to observe the morphogenetic act of ingression and so unable to definitively distinguish between <italic>Hox</italic> regulating ingression or dispersion – functional experiments manipulating <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression would be necessary to make this distinction. Nonetheless, we have demonstrated that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression can be uncoupled from cell allocation to the axis in small transplants, suggesting that if <italic>Hox</italic> does influence these processes, its effect can be overcome by extrinsic influences under certain conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Population size-related inputs on cell allocation to the axis</title><p>Our experiments show that smaller grafts of older progenitor populations to PS stage embryos do not remain as a single mass but instead show substantial mixing with host tissue, like homochronic grafts. The observation of graft size influencing outcome resembles previous findings that grafts of neural tissue have different outcomes dependent upon graft size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Couly et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guthrie et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trainor and Krumlauf, 2000</xref>). A common differential outcome is the maintenance of donor gene expression in larger grafts but not in instances when donor cells are isolated or in smaller groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schilling et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Trainor and Krumlauf, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, in our experiments, we observe maintenance of the donor <italic>Hox</italic> profile even when cells are not contacting any other donor cells, suggesting that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in this context may be truly cell intrinsic. Cell-intrinsic timers have been described in diverse contexts when individual cells are isolated from their developmental contexts, including the somitogenesis clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Webb et al., 2016</xref>), the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblast clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2005</xref>), and oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Temple and Raff, 1986</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the maintenance of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression, we also find that smaller heterochronic grafts are able to disperse more readily and contribute to more anterior regions of the body axis. How might graft size influence the timing of cell dispersion and axis contribution? The tendency of smaller HH8 grafts to disperse may be related to tissue properties such as stiffness differences between the HH4 and HH8 progenitor regions. This could make it difficult for HH8 cells to invade the HH4 tissue (and vice versa), leading to little mixing. It also might be possible that due to adhesion differences and differential affinity of HH4 and HH8 tissue for like tissue, that HH8 grafts may undergo some rearrangement (e.g. rounding up to contact other HH8 cells) that slows its dispersion and minimises mixing. Smaller grafts have a relatively large surface area in contact area with surrounding host tissue relative to their volume when compared with larger grafts. There may also be more loose edges of tissue in smaller grafts as a result of the additional tissue cutting involved, creating additional surface area. This may facilitate mixing of HH4 and HH8 cells in smaller heterochronic grafts, allowing HH8 cells to disperse with the surrounding host tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Both intrinsic and extrinsic cues influence timing of axial progenitor axis contribution</title><p>Together, our work has shown that heterochronic somitic progenitor grafts from older to younger embryos are delayed by remaining as a single group of cells rather than mixing with surrounding host tissue. This difference despite cells occupying the ventral compartment of the embryo and correlates with the intrinsic regulation of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression, such that expression is robustly maintained upon grafting to the HH4 environment. We find that despite this maintenance HH8 cells can disperse if they are transplanted in relatively small groups, suggesting that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression is not the only input timing cell contribution to the primary body axis. Indeed, our explant culture experiments show that size dependency of migration rates is not evident when cells are cultured in a similar environment, suggesting that the faster contribution of small cell grafts in vivo is due to differences in the ability of donor cells to interact with the host environment. This is likely to be related to differences in the initial distribution of laminin and/or the ability of cells to breakdown the dense structures observed in larger grafted populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>).

We find that homochronic HH8 to HH8 grafted tissue (GFP-positive) shows substantial mixing with surrounding host tissue (GFP-negative). Additionally, the anteroposterior contribution of these grafts is more posterior than the contribution of HH8 to HH4 heterochronic grafts (the most anterior somite contribution is more posterior than somite 4/5), suggesting that while HH8 tissue is delayed in axis contribution relative to HH4 tissue in the host environment, it nonetheless has a substantially more anterior contribution relative to HH8-to-HH8 stage-matched grafts. This result suggests that while tissue intrinsic cues influence axis contribution timing, extrinsic cues that vary between the HH4 and HH8 environment must also play a role. We have added text making this point to accompany the edited figure (<italic>lines 143-150</italic>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The reverse heterochronic grafting experiment, namely HH4 cells into HH8. Do HH4 cells maintain their dispersal behavior at the ectopic position, or they behave differently?</p><p>While the authors assessed the intrinsic properties of HH4 and HH8 tissue by incubating it on fibronectin, this experiment does not properly reproduce the environment of the embryonic region receiving the graft, which might be different at HH4 and HH8. The experiments I am suggesting take this variable into consideration and will therefore help assessing the possible involvement of the host tissue in the behavior of the grafts.</p></disp-quote><p>The original manuscript included the reciprocal graft (HH4 in HH8 environment) at 6 hours after grafting in Figure 5I (now Figure 5H), in the context of assaying <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in this graft type. It is difficult to quantify ‘dispersion’ per se in the bounded compartment of the PSM (versus the unbounded mesendodermal compartment present at HH4) but there does appear to be movement of cells from the graft site at 6 hours after grafting (Figure 5H). Please note that the HH4 to HH8 graft is particularly technically difficult and while we performed this experiment numerous times, we were unable to recover sufficient numbers of embryos to confidently draw conclusions regarding somite contributions of these grafts. Regarding the question of host tissue involvement, please see the new <italic>Figure 6</italic> that addresses this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to those experiments, a more extensive analyses of the already reported experiments could also improve the manuscript.</p><p>1. When the cells staying in the MSP region after homochronic HH4 grafts reach later stages (e.g. approaching HH8), do they keep dispersing as at earlier stages after ingression through the primitive streak or they remain as a distinct cluster?</p><p>And does Hox gene expression within those grafts follow the same activation profile observed in the host cells as development proceeds?</p></disp-quote><p>Our original manuscript contains images of homochronic HH4 to HH4 grafts cultured to timepoints after HH8, where somite contribution of these grafts continues posterior to the most anterior 4 somites (those formed by HH8) and donor cells can be seen intermixed with host cells in the PSM (Figure 1G’’). This result would suggest that the donor cells do not become distinct from their host tissue at HH8 in the case of homochronic grafts.</p><p>Regarding <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression within grafted tissue, we have stained homochronic HH4-HH4 grafts for <italic>Hox</italic> genes at 24 hours after grafting (Figure 5 Supplement 2). At 24 hours after grafting, GFP-expressing donor tissue in the somites and in the tailbud region expresses <italic>Hox</italic> genes appropriate for its context. <italic>Hoxa2</italic> is expressed in somites posterior to and inclusive of somite 1, whilst <italic>Hoxa3</italic> transcripts are present in somites posterior to and including somite 4 (Figure 5 Supplement 2). These boundaries are present in the GFP-positive donor tissue and congruent with expression in the surrounding host tissue (Figure 5 Supplement 2). Similarly, <italic>Hoxa2</italic> and <italic>Hoxa3</italic> are expressed in the tailbud of HH10 embryos (old Supplementary Figure 5, new Figure 5 Supplement 1). Donor cells in the presomitic mesoderm of embryos 24 hours after heterochronic grafting express <italic>Hoxa3</italic> like surrounding host tissue. Together, these data support the normal progression of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in homochronically grafted tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the experiment reported on Figure 5I, HH4 MSP grafted into HH8 embryos fail to activate Hox genes like Hoxa2, even after 6 hours of incubation. When these grafted embryos develop even further (for the period of time required for a HH4 embryo to reach the HH8 stage), do they activate Hoxa2 or Hoxa3 or they remain negative for these genes?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, we have been unable to recover sufficient numbers of HH4 to HH8 grafts to determine the timing of upregulation (or absence of upregulation) of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the grafted tissue. The reciprocal graft was not the major focus of this work and so while an interesting question, we believe that this experiment falls outside the scope of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The differential GO terms between HH4 and HH8 tissue in cluster 6 include chromatin organization, DNA methylation and C5-methylation of cytosine. This suggests that epigenetic changes might be involved in the behavioral differences between the MSP of the two stages, which can affect many different processes involved in cell activity, including the activation of Hox genes.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing our attention to this interesting point and agree that this differential expression is important given the epigenetic remodelling previously described in the course of <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression progression. We have added a reference to this in the manuscript that can be found at lines 224-227.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some comments on data interpretation.</p><p>1. It is clear that Hox gene expression in the grafts matches the profile of the donor tissue, indicating the existence of a Hox &quot;timer&quot;. However, in my opinion, the authors place too much emphasis on the possible meaning of these observations in what concerns the differential behavior of the grafted cells. If they want to focus on Hox genes they should include some experiment testing their involvement in cell dispersal, either by misexpression or downregulation of specific genes (although there is plenty of information arguing against this possibility, maybe with the exception of that of Iimura and Pourquie, 2006; in this regard, the authors' own data already indicate that dispersion is independent of Hox gene expression).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment; we do not rule out the possible existence of two parallel but independent timers, one controlling Hox gene expression and one controlling cell behaviour.</p><p>In addition, in response to reviewer 2 (major comment 5), we have added a new figure (new Figure 6) that addresses an additional role for donor-host tissue interaction in modulating progenitor addition and modified our conclusions as well as the title of the paper (now ‘Intrinsic and extrinsic cues time somite progenitor contribution to the vertebrate primary body axis’) accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors disregard the involvement of differential patterns of cell adhesion molecules as the origin of the differential behavior of HH4 and HH8 grafts in the HH4 context. However, in their data on supplementary Figure 2A there are several genes differentially expressed between the HH8 and HH4 cells (e.g. Ptk7, Spon1 or Nfasc) that could indeed play a role in the differential interaction between cells from the two embryonic stages. It might be interesting to perform HCR experiments with some of these factors to see if they are differentially expressed at the two embryonic stages. Also, although it might be somewhat far reaching, if differential expression is observed by HCR, it might be interesting to experimentally manipulate expression of the relevant gene (s) (misexpression or down-regulation, depending on the stage) to evaluate its/their potential functional relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that there is a possible role for cell adhesion in the differential behaviour of cells (though there is no statistically significant difference in expression level of the genes mentioned between HH4 and HH8 cells) and have amended the text to make this clear. It is of course possible that there are adhesion differences that are not evident at the transcriptomic level. Please see lines 360-390 for a treatment of this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>1. The authors write that the HH8 specific clusters are 0, 4 and 6. However, I think that it is #7 and not #6 the one belonging to this group. I guess that this is typo, but becomes confusing, as a large part of the analysis of the single cell data is centered on cluster #6.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention – this is indeed a typo, and the text has been amended (line 170).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In the introduction the authors state that the first 4-5 somites do not develop ganglia, citing Lim et al. 1987. I think that the way this is written is imprecise, as it sort of implies that more caudal somites develop ganglia (which would mean that the dorsal root ganglia are somite derivatives). However, somites at any level do not develop ganglia; the anterior half of their sclerotomes are permissive to migration of the neural crest that will eventually build the ganglia, something that seems not to happen in the more anterior somites.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this statement is ambiguous and have edited the text to make it clear that the caudal somites are invaded by neural crest rather than differentiating to ganglia (line 88).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A side note</p><p>Different alternative transcripts have been reported at least for Ptk7 and Nfasc. This might be relevant considering that another of the prominent differential GO terms identified in supplementary Figure 2C is related to RNA splicing. Would different alternative transcripts for some of these genes be specifically associated with the cells from one of the embryonic stages?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting comment and we have added a mention of this possibility to the discussion of the manuscript, which can be found at lines 348-358<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Significance:</p><p>It has been known for many decades that the first 4-5 somites of amniotes are different to the rest of the somites in several ways, from the structures they generate to the way they are generated or the gene regulatory networks controlling their morphogenesis. Much is known about how the posterior somites are generated and the mechanisms of their differentiation. Conversely, relatively little is known about the same processes in the most anterior somites. The work described in this manuscript shows that the progenitor cells from the epiblast that will contribute to the 4-5 first somites already behave different than those generating more caudal somites. Also, they show that progenitors generating more caudal somites are unable to contribute to the rostral somites. These two sets of observations show that the differences in the rostral and caudal somites are already present in their progenitors and that those features are quite stable within the cells, at least when they are kept as a group.</p><p>So far, the single cell analyses shown in this manuscript failed to provide clear hints to explain the different behavior of the two sets of progenitors. However, they represent an important resource to further explore this important biological question. The authors focus on Hox genes as potential regulators of the differential behavior of the HH4 and HH8 MSPs, I guess that prompted by the report by Iimura and Pourquie (2006) indicating the involvement of Hox genes in the migratory properties of the somite progenitors. However, there is plenty of information, mostly genetic studies in mice, indicating that Hox genes might have very little influence in the differential behavior of rostral and caudal somites. In this regard, expression does not mean causation.</p><p>I think that this manuscript is interesting, most particularly for developmental biologists involved in understanding the mechanisms governing the basic layout of the vertebrate body plan. Research in my laboratory also explores this type of biological questions, although using more genetic approaches and in a different model system, namely the mouse. I therefore consider myself in a position that allows a knowledgeable evaluation of this manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>Evidence, reproducibility and clarity</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigate the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic factors in the timing of progenitor addition to the elongating primary body axis. During development, progenitor populations have to combine their selfrenewal with the gradual contribution to the full length of the body axis. The mechanisms underlying the population dynamics that ensure the formation of a proportioned body plan remain poorly understood. By combining heterochronic (HH8 to HH4) and homochronic grafting (HH4 to HH4) of somitic progenitors with next generation sequencing and imaging, the authors observe that the older HH8 tissue shows intrinsic delays in migration and does not disperse within the surrounding mesodermal tissue after ingression through the primitive streak. This behavior correlates with intrinsic and tissue-specific differences in the expression of Hox genes but not with differences in the expression of cell adhesion/migration genes.</p><p>Overall, this study provides new data exploring how progenitors control their contribution to the body axis. By combining classic embryology techniques with single-cell sequencing, the authors describe novel cell states that might help understand the progenitor population dynamics. There are however a number of further analyses and experiments that should be performed to support the main claims of the manuscript.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. The authors claim that grafted HH8 cells are paused after the ingression stage and before the dispersion stage. The grafted cells ingress through the primitive streak and then remain as a distinct cluster of cells that does not disperse throughout the mesoderm. This is in contrast with other obs ervations where overexpression of late hox genes delays the cells at the point of ingression. The authors should better demonstrate that their grafts are actually ingressing and then stopping once in the mesoderm compartment. Figure 3B' shows grafted HH8 cells (GFP positive) present in the mesoderm (ME) compartment 3 h after grafting. It is surprising that a cluster of cells can ingress through the primitive streak in a short period of time and then remain paused. It would be helpful to have the equivalent figure right after grafting to assess the differences in the location of the HH8 GFP+ cells and potentially observe them while ingressing.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point that we have addressed by characterising HH4-HH4 and HH8-HH4 grafts immediately after the graft has incorporated (~20-30 minutes after grafting). These grafts were fixed and stained with DAPI and phalloidin as well as immunostained for the basement membrane component laminin. We have included this data in the modified manuscript as the new Figure 3G-H.</p><p>To summarise our observations, homochronic and heterochronic grafts at 20-30 minutes after grafting can both be found ventrally in the embryo. There are differences in the tissue organization of the two graft types including a higher nuclear density in HH8 tissue relative to HH4 tissue and are delineated from surrounding host tissue by a circumferential ring of F-actin. The observation that HH8 to HH4 grafted tissue is found ventrally (below the host basement membrane) at such an early point after grafting suggests that HH8 tissue may not be actively ingressing through the primitive streak initially but is deposited ventrally by the healing of the host tissue. This changes the conclusions of our experiment from cells undergoing ingression through the primitive streak and then pausing before their dispersion to experiencing a delay before undergoing EMT. We have amended the text of the manuscript accordingly to reflect this new interpretation in the light of the new data (lines<italic>198-209</italic>) and thank the reviewer for their suggestion which has allowed us to clarify such an important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors describe a novel transcription state, namely clusters 6, 12 and 8 in Figure 2B, populated by HH8 cells 3 h after grafting. It is surprising that the UMAP looks very different between 0 h and 3 h in the HH8-HH4 grafts (Figure 2E and F). The authors should clarify where the HH4 (GFP negative) cells are present in Figure F, I. In the current figures, it looks as if both HH8 and HH4 cells changed completely their transcription profile in only 3 h and populated the central clusters (6, 12, 8). The authors claim that these central clusters are present in normal development and that cells rapidly transit through them. However, it is not clear whether this state happens before or after HH4. For example, the cells may be moving from right to left in UMAP_1 according to time (HH4 in the right, HH8 in the left and a central transient cluster). This would mean that in Figure 2F HH8 grafted cells are regressing to an earlier development state and not a new one. Including RNA velocity analysis could help clarify how the cells are changing their expression profiles.</p></disp-quote><p>From data present in the original manuscript, the HH4-HH4 homochronic graft sample at 0 hours has both donor and host cells present in the central set of clusters (Figure 2G), suggesting that HH4 cells transit through this cell state. There is a caveat to this experiment in that we have not included a sample of ungrafted tissue. The reviewer states that “it is not clear whether this state happens before or after HH4” – given that this is a sample of HH4 cells this is not the case, and the cell state therefore is present in the embryo at HH4. In addition, given that HH8 grafted cells at 3 hours maintain <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression, we do not think it correct to say that HH8 cells are “regressing to an earlier development state”.</p><p>One factor which should be mentioned is that there are a smaller number of cells in the HH8-HH4 3 hours sample than the others leading to a sparser population of the UMAP plot, which may be leading to difficulty interpreting the location of cells. We have replaced the original UMAP plot with plots showing just the <italic>egfp-</italic>negative cells and just the <italic>egfp-</italic>positive cells (Figure 2G) to make the representation of these classes of cells in each cluster clearer to the reader. In these plots, we show that clusters 6,12 and 8 are indeed present in host HH4 tissue (<italic>eGFP</italic>-negative) in all three datasets, supporting this notion that this is a gene expression state observed in normal development.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Related to the previous point, the striking changes between 0 h and 3 h in the HH8-HH4 grafts (Figure 2E and F) may suggest an effect of the grafting procedure on the transcription profile of the cells. The authors should demonstrate that the grafting of cells does not have a huge impact on the transcriptome and that these changes are specific to the previously undescribed delayed state of HH8 cells. For this, they should include scRNA data of HH4-HH4 3 h. If grafting does not have a significant effect on the transcriptome, they should see GFP positive and negative cells in HH4-HH4 3 h remain intermixed.</p></disp-quote><p>A comparison of HH4 to HH4 host and donor cells at 3 hours post grafting is now included as Figure 2 Supplement 2. Host and donor cells (distinguished by eGFP expression, Figure 2 Supplement 2A) remain intermixed after clustering and exhibit similar gene expression, consistent with grafting not impacting the transcriptome. We mention this result in the revised manuscript in lines 176-178<italic>.</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The authors observe that when doing smaller heterochronic grafts, cells can disperse throughout the mesoderm.</p><p>Nevertheless, the Hox gene expression does not change depending on the size of the grafts. This is in sharp contrast with their observations and claims done for big heterochronic grafts. The result is interesting as it demonstrates that the expression of Hox genes, but not dispersion, is cell intrinsic. However, the uncoupling of hox gene expression and cell dispersion requires further investigation. The authors should repeat the heterochronic grafting of Figure 1 using smaller grafts and check the contribution of grafted cells to the somites. If cells can readily disperse without delay, they might be able to contribute to all somites as observed with homochronic grafts.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point that we thank the reviewer for raising. We have performed small heterochronic HH8 to HH4 grafts and allowed them to grow to 24 hours to assay the somite contribution of the transplanted cells. This data is included in the manuscript as part of the new Figure 6. Interestingly, while large heterochronic grafts contribute most anteriorly to somite 4 or 5, our small heterochronic grafts contributed most anteriorly to somite 1, 2 or 3. This is an important result and suggests that in small heterochronic grafts, the early dispersion that we observe leads to a more anterior somite contribution (earlier in time), showing that <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression can truly be uncoupled from AP axis contribution. This result is discussed in the revised manuscript at lines 299-304.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, the authors should repeat the explant spreading assay using smaller HH8 grafts and quantify whether differences in the migratory dynamics are observed. The authors already discuss the possibility that other factors apart from Hox expression might affect dispersion. Nevertheless, they should assess the importance of graft size in their experimental system.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the explant experiment with HH4 and HH8 tissue of varying sizes and have included this in the revised manuscript as part of the new Figure 6. The prediction, if enhanced dispersion and earlier somite contribution of small HH8 to HH4 grafts is an intrinsic feature of the smaller piece of donor tissue, would be that small HH8 explants would be expected to spread more rapidly on fibronectin than large HH8 explants, possibly reaching similar migration velocities to HH4 explants. However, we find that migration velocities and area changes in smaller HH8 explants are actually lower than in larger HH8 explants, precluding this explanation for our data. We can thus interpret our results as suggesting that the enhanced dispersion of small HH8 grafts results from the context of grafting and possibly through differences in the interaction of small and large HH8 grafts with the surrounding HH4 tissue. We have included these ideas in the discussion of the new manuscript (lines 447-457). We thank the reviewer for leading us to this finding that highlights the importance of extrinsic factors in timing axis contribution of progenitors. It has led us to an interpretation of our data as supporting a model whereby both intrinsic and extrinsic cues modulate the timing of axis contribution, reflected by the new title “Intrinsic and extrinsic cues time somite progenitor contribution to the vertebrate primary body axis”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>6. It would be informative to have a better time-resolved description of the heterochronic graft behavior in Figure 1. For homochronic grafts, several timepoints are provided allowing the visualization of cells travelling through the body axis. For heterochronic grafts, by contrast, only an early and final timepoint are provided.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this comment, we have included images of HH8 to HH4 grafts at several intermediate timepoints after grafting (between 0 and 24 hours) to better characterise their behaviour over this time period and included this data in the revised manuscript as the new Figure 1 Supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 4, the authors show that explants of HH4 and HH8 embryos have different migratory dynamics, with HH4 cells migrating faster than HH8. In Figure 4E, HH8 explants seem not to change their area for about 15 h and then start spreading. This indicates that there is a great delay in migration compared to HH4 explants. However, once they start spreading, it seems that the area starts to increase exponentially in a similar manner to what is observed for HH4 at earlier time points. It would be interesting to monitor the HH8 for a longer time to see the behaviors at later time points. HH8 explants may be just delayed, and once they start fully spreading, the speed may not be so different from the one of HH4 explants.</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we have shown that the velocity of HH8 explants is relatively stable after 15 hours at values ½ of that seen in HH4 explants (please refer to Figure 4F). For this reason, we do not believe that the reduced spreading of HH8 explants represents a delay relative to HH4 explants (if the velocity were increasing over time this would be a possibility).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The authors conclude in Supp. Table 2 that HH8 and HH4 do not have different expressions of adhesion-related genes upon grafting. This observation is very important to understand the potential mechanism behind the different dispersion behaviors, and thus it should be included in the main figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point and have moved the GO term bar chart to Figure 3K.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The authors combine classic embryology with single-cell RNA-seq and imaging techniques to explore progenitor population dynamics during addition to the body axis. They conclude that the delayed contribution of older cells to axis formation correlates with the intrinsic expression of posterior hox genes. While the idea of intrinsic regulation of hox genes during axial specification is not conceptually new, the authors use modern techniques to describe with finer detail the progenitor population states. For this reason, this manuscript will be of interest to researchers in the development field who want to better understand the hox control and influence during axial elongation.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>In this manuscript entitled &quot;A population instrinsic timer controls Hox gene expression and cell dispersion during progenitor addition to the body axis&quot;, Busby and colleagues investigate the topic of &quot;cell type identity&quot; in the context of body axis elongation in chick embryos.</p><p>To this end, they performed heterochronic grafts from HH8 stage embryos to HH4 stage embryos and compared these to HH4 homochronic grafts. They found that HH8 grafts ingressed but were then delayed at a stage they termed cell dispersion. By scRNAseq this new cell state was characterized further. While HH8 cells adjusted their expression pattern to their surroundings, Hox gene expression was maintained as in the host developmental stage. Hox gene expression and collinearity of expression changes were also maintained when HH4 cells were grafted into HH8 embryos or cells were cultured ex vivo. Finally, the authors found differences in migration properties between HH4 and HH8 cells, when cultured ex vivo, with HH4 cells migrating faster than HH8.</p></disp-quote><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This constitutes an elegant work to describe the existence of a &quot;cell-intrinsic timer&quot; that regulates cell identity and progressive body axis extension. Experiments and analysis have been performed adequately and conclusions have been drawn appropriately.</p><p>There are a rather minor comments I would suggest for further analysis, discussion and potentially experiments to further support this paper:</p><p>- A major finding is that grafted cells keep their Hox expression pattern, independent of whether it is from HH4 to HH8 or vice versa. Moreover, grafted HH8 cells pause at the cell dispersion stage and do not mix, unless grafted in very low cell populations. The authors conclude that Hox gene expression seems to be cell intrinsically regulated. However, for pausing of cells after ingression, I wonder if it is rather the difference to the neighbors than a cell-intrinsic effect that prevents the cells from dispersing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thoughts. We agree that this is important to consider, and the question of intrinsic vs. extrinsic (neighbour interactions with host tissue, for example) factors in causing delay of graft spreading motivated our experiment with small explants (please see above in response to reviewer 2). In light of this data, we agree that it is absolutely important to consider the difference between the cells and their neighbours in the grafted context. We have adjusted our title and conclusions accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One possibility is that differences in adhesion could account for this, since sorting of cell populations based on differential expression of adhesion molecules has been observed in various model systems. This possibility is excluded here, since adhesion-related genes were not differentially expressed in their expression data. However, I would not exclude this possibility at this stage for the following reasons: 1. The authors detect different migration speeds for HH4 and HH8 cell clusters with HH4 cells migrating faster. Differential migration rate could indeed hint at differential adhesion and mechanical properties of the cells. 2. Hox genes have been shown to be upstream of and modulate adhesion molecules, which might be an interesting link. 3. So far, the authors have only analyzed expression of adhesion molecules at mRNA levels. However, the functional components are the adhesion proteins themselves. It might therefore be useful to stain embryos for some &quot;obvious&quot; candidate adhesion molecules, such as cadherins.</p><p>If no further experiments are performed, then this should at least be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point and agree that while adhesion genes are not differentially expressed at the transcript level between HH4 and HH8 cells, the cells may indeed have different adhesion profiles/ characters and/or different mechanical properties. We believe this to be an interesting hypothesis for the differential behaviour of HH4 and HH8 tissue, with cell sorting via differential adhesion contributing to graft outcome.

They perform scRNAseq and GO term analyses to analyze these cells in more detail. The also perform gene set enrichment analysis. However, I am still wondering about the exact identity of these cells. What are they? What markers do they express? Do they upregulate certain signalling pathways? Etc. I would for instance be interested if there are differences in FGF or Wnt levels/ activities. It would be useful if the authors could analyze their scRNAseq data further in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>The original manuscript contains information on the gene expression of these cells in Figure 2C, in Supplementary Table 1 (now Supplementary File 1a) (which shows the 10 most DE genes in each cluster), and in Supplementary Figure 2 (now Figure 2 Supplement 1) (which shows feature plots for key marker genes). Additionally, the GO terms enriched amongst the full list of DE genes in cluster 6 can be found in Supplementary Table 2 (now Supplementary File 1b). We went back to these gene lists and do not note a signature relating to a particular signalling state; however several markers of primitive streak and early mesoderm were evident among the top differentially expressed genes. Since they do not express many of the clear markers of these states that can be seen in the annotated clusters, it suggests that they are in a transitory state that is also reflected in the position of grafted cell populations.

This is also true of HH4-HH4 grafts at 3 hours after grafting (Figure 2 Supplement 2). These results suggest that grafting does not have any overt effect on the transcriptome of cells – or if it does, the effect is similar in host and donor cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors found differences in cell cycle stages of HH4 and HH8 grafts. A more detailed discussion of this aspect would be useful rather than just excluding any cell cycle-related genes from the comparisons. Why could there be this difference? What effect could this have? Etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this point. The differences between cell cycle representation in the HH4 and HH8 cells of clusters 6, 8 and 12 are subtle (Figure 3 Supplement 1 panels <italic>D-E</italic>). The choice to regress cell cycle associated gene expression was to prevent these genes eclipsing other genes of interest. We have added a few sentences to the discussion of the paper to address the possible significance of cell cycle differences (please see lines 351-352).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Optional: Other experiments that could increase the relevance of the work:</p><p>- As discussed by the authors, they specifically compare HH4 stage to HH8, which represents primitive streak stage and 4-somite stage, respectively. It would therefore be interesting to perform grafts from HH8 to later stages, such as HH10, or vice versa, when the process of somitogenesis is more similar. This could reveal if their findings are specific for pre to</p><p>post node development or more general. However, this might be outside of the scope of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a very interesting question but also agree that it goes outside the scope of the study. We have mentioned a need for a greater diversity of grafting experiments (varied host and donor stages) in order to draw more general conclusions and principles of intrinsic and extrinsic cues in timing axis contribution. Indeed, it may well be the case that the relative importance of these cues varies across axis elongation, and/or that the relative “match” between host and donor tissue influences graft outcome. We have added text suggesting this as a future direction for the field within the discussion (line 388-392) and called for a greater range of grafts to determine whether the contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic cues to <italic>Hox</italic> expression vary across different timepoints in axis elongation (line 420-421).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>General assessment: This study provides a systematic analysis of the interaction of embryonic cell clusters from different developmental stages. To this end, &quot;classical&quot; developmental biology techniques, i.e. grafting (complicated techniques that probably less and less people can perform nowadays), is combined with more modern ways of analysis, i.e. scRNAseq. This allows the authors to dissect the differential behaviour of hetero- and homochonic grafts. In the longer term this data can provide the basis for further in-depth mechanistic analyses, some of which could be added here already. The involvement of Hox genes in the control of developmental time is interesting and should be placed into context of our current knowledge. Here, Hox genes are rather used as readout of developmental time rather than active players.</p><p>Advance: How developmental time is maintained during embryonic development is a long-standing question in the field. This study provides conceptual advance in this question by describing a cell-intrinsic timer.</p><p>Audience: This study is relevant for developmental biologists in general, since it describes how developmental time can be kept by a cell-intrinsic timer, at least in early stages of somite formation in chick embryos.</p><p>My expertise: developmental biology, somitogenesis</p></disp-quote></body></sub-article></article>
