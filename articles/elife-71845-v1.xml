vertebrate trunk. To date, mechanisms underlying the morphogenetic process shaping the epaxial myotome are largely unknown. To address this, we used the medaka <italic>zic1/zic4</italic>-enhancer mutant <italic>Double anal fin</italic> (<italic>Da</italic>), which exhibits ventralized dorsal trunk structures resulting in impaired epaxial myotome morphology and incomplete coverage over the neural tube. In wild type, dorsal dermomyotome (DM) cells reduce their proliferative activity after somitogenesis. Subsequently, a subset of DM cells, which does not differentiate into the myotome population, begins to form unique large protrusions extending dorsally to guide the epaxial myotome dorsally. In <italic>Da</italic>, by contrast, DM cells maintain the high proliferative activity and mainly form small protrusions. By combining RNA- and ChIP-sequencing analyses, we revealed direct targets of Zic1, which are specifically expressed in dorsal somites and involved in various aspects of development, such as cell migration, extracellular matrix organization, and cell-cell communication. Among these, we identified <italic>wnt11</italic> as a crucial factor regulating both cell proliferation and protrusive activity of DM cells. We propose that dorsal extension of the epaxial myotome is guided by a non-myogenic subpopulation of DM cells and that <italic>wnt11</italic> empowers the DM cells to drive the coverage of the neural tube by the epaxial myotome.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dermomyotome</kwd><kwd>myotome</kwd><kwd>somite</kwd><kwd>Zic1</kwd><kwd>Wnt11</kwd><kwd>dorsalization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP15H05859</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeda</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP19K23741</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawanishi</surname><given-names>Toru</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18K14620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nakamura</surname><given-names>Ryohei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJCR13W3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takeda</surname><given-names>Hiroyuki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A medaka mutant revealed that Wnt11 promotes formation of uniquely large protrusions from non-myogenic dorsal dermomyotome cells, which guide the epaxial myotome dorsally to achieve the coverage of the neural tube.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Active locomotion, which is powered by skeletal muscles in vertebrates, is critical for animals to survive. Vertebrate skeletal muscles consist of axial muscles (head, trunk, and tail muscles) and appendicular muscles (limb muscles). Axial muscles first arose in the chordates to stabilize and enable side-to-side movement of the body axis. In jawed vertebrates, the subdivision of axial muscles into epaxial (dorsal) and hypaxial (ventral) muscles led to an increased range of movement: dorsoventral undulation in fish and lateral movements in terrestrial vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Goodrich, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Romer and Parsons, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fetcho, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sefton and Kardon, 2019</xref>). Among these muscles, epaxial muscles are characterized by their unique anatomical structure, which extends dorsally and surrounds the vertebrae. This morphology also ensures mechanical support and protection of the vertebrae and the spinal cord inside. While we have a detailed understanding of how the myotome, precursors of epaxial and hypaxial muscles, differentiates from a somitic compartment called the dermomyotome (DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalcheim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gros et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hollway and Currie, 2005</xref>), we only begin to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms of the subsequent morphogenetic processes generating the epaxial muscles. Previous studies in rats and mice suggested that myocytes of the epaxial myotome do not actively migrate dorsally but are guided by external forces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deries et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deries et al., 2012</xref>). However, what exerts such forces to drive extension of epaxial myotome is still unclear.</p><p>Fish have been extensively utilized to study myotome development thanks to the transparency of their bodies throughout embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wolff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stellabotte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganassi, 2018</xref>). Additionally, their epaxial trunk muscles have a simple structure consisting of only one anatomical unit (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sefton and Kardon, 2019</xref>). Like other vertebrates, fish myotomes, on either side of the neural tube, extend dorsally after somite differentiation and eventually cover the neural tube by the end of embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The spontaneous medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) mutant <italic>Double anal fin</italic> (<italic>Da</italic>) displays a particular epaxial myotome morphology, in which the dorsal ends of the left and right epaxial myotome fail to extend sufficiently and thus do not cover the neural tube at the end of embryonic development. Previous studies demonstrated that the dorsal trunk region of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant is transformed into the ventral one, including not only the myotome but also the body shape, skeletal elements, pigmentation, and fin morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ishikawa, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohtsuka et al., 2004</xref>). Given the unique morphological features, the medaka <italic>Da</italic> mutant is an excellent model to study the morphogenesis of epaxial myotome. Genetic analysis of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant revealed that this phenotype is due to a dramatic reduction of the expression of the transcription factors <italic>zic1</italic> and <italic>zic4</italic> in the dorsal somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and E</xref>), and identified <italic>zic</italic>1/<italic>zic4</italic> as master regulators of trunk dorsalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohtsuka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawanishi et al., 2013</xref>). The down-regulation of <italic>zic1/zic4</italic> specifically in the dorsal somites is caused by the insertion of a large transposon, disrupting the dorsal somite enhancer of <italic>zic1/zic4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moriyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>). While the function and downstream targets of Zic1 and Zic4 have been studied in nervous system development and somitogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Himeda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hong and Saint-Jeannet, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aruga and Millen, 2018</xref>), the molecular mechanism of how these Zic genes control dorsal trunk morphogenesis has not been investigated so far.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The epaxial myotome of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant fails to cover the neural tube at the end of embryonic development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of dorsal somite extension which results in the full coverage of the neural tube by the epaxial myotomes at the end of embryonic development.

By in vivo time-lapse imaging we uncovered its cellular dynamics; during dorsal somite extension, dorsal DM cells reduce their proliferative activity and subsequently form unique large protrusions extending dorsally, guiding the epaxial myotome towards the top of the neural tube. We also found that these DM cells form a subpopulation that gives rise to non-myotomal cell lineages during embryonic development. In the <italic>Da</italic> mutant, by contrast, DM cells keep their high proliferative activity and mainly form small protrusions. Mechanistically, we identified a Zic1 downstream-target gene, <italic>wnt11</italic> (former <italic>wnt11r</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Postlethwait et al., 2019</xref>), as a crucial factor for dorsal somite extension, and demonstrated that Wnt11 regulates cellular behavior of dorsal DM cells by promoting protrusion formation and negatively regulating proliferation. We thus propose an unprecedented process of epaxial myotome morphogenesis driven by a non-myogenic population of DM cells during embryogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Our previous study showed that <italic>zic1</italic> and <italic>zic4</italic> expression starts at embryonic stages and persists throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawanishi et al., 2013</xref>). Phenotypic analysis of homozygous adult <italic>Da</italic> mutants implies long-term participation of Zic-downstream genes in the formation of dorsal musculatures, which eventually affects the external appearance of the fish adult trunk. Here, we examined the initial phase of this long-term dorsalization process. In the following of the study, we will focus on <italic>zic1</italic>, since <italic>zic1</italic> and <italic>zic4</italic> are expressed in an identical fashion with overlapping functions in trunk dorsalization of medaka, and <italic>zic4</italic> is expressed slightly weaker than <italic>zic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moriyama et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kawanishi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The dorsal myotome of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant fails to cover the neural tube</title><p>In wild-type (Wt) medaka, the dorsal ends of the myotomes first came in contact at 7 days post fertilization (dpf, stage 37) and formed the tight, thick myotome layer covering the neural tube at the end of embryonic development (9 dpf, stage 39) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1FâG</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A-F</xref>).

The ends of the ventralized dorsal myotome in the mutant displayed a round shape (not pointed as found in Wt) which resembled the morphology of the ventral myotome.</p><p>We wondered if there are other morphological differences between Wt dorsal myotome and the ventralized dorsal myotome of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant. Indeed, the cross-sectional area in the <italic>Da</italic> mutant was significantly larger compared to Wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>).

We measured the diameter of dorsal myotome muscle fibers in Wt and <italic>Da</italic> mutant embryos but could not observe a difference, suggesting that dorsal myotome of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant has a higher number of myotomal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1M</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Proliferative activity of the dorsal DM cells is enhanced in the <italic>Da</italic> mutant</title><p>In fish, as in other vertebrates, the DM gives rise to muscle precursor cells, which ultimately differentiate into myofibers.

A high proliferative activity of the dorsal DM could explain a larger cross-sectional area of the dorsal myotome of the <italic>Da</italic> mutant.

From two biological replicates, 5247 reliable ChIP peaks were identified, and we confirmed that the enriched DNA motif among these peaks was showing high similarity with previously identified binding motifs of ZIC family proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2A-B</xref>).

While 47% of the dorsal-high genes and 27% of the dorsal-low genes were found to be Zic1 target genes, only 12% of genes which showed no differential expression in dorsal or ventral somites were potential Zic1 downstream target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

DM cells have been known to serve as a progenitor pool for myotomal and dermal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Yair and Kalcheim, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hollway et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stellabotte and Devoto, 2007</xref>). In our study, we showed that DM cells at the tip of the dorsal somite form unique large protrusions, guiding the myotome towards the top of the neural tube. Furthermore, these DM cells do not give rise to myotomal cells during embryonic development. We found that <italic>zic1</italic> and its direct downstream target <italic>wnt11</italic> are crucial factors for this morphogenetic process. We thus revealed a novel role of non-myogenic DM cells during epaxial myotome morphogenesis. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, this work demonstrates for the first time that the neural tube coverage by myotomes is driven by active cell movement, rather than passively by muscle growth. Consistent with this, in the absence of Zic1 activity, the myotome is unable to cover the neural tube at the hatching stage, despite increased dorsal myotome growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), supporting the involvement of the active cellular mechanism in this process. The model we propose for dorsal somite extension is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of dorsal somite extension in Wt and the <italic>Da</italic> mutant.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Zic1 induces or maintains the expression of <italic>wnt11</italic> during somite differentiation. This leads to a reduced proliferative activity of the dorsal DM and increases protrusion formation of the dorsal DM cells which are non-myogenic. Ultimately, the non-myogenic DM guides the epaxial myotomes dorsally where the myotomes form a gapless muscle layer covering the neural tube at the end of embryonic development. (<bold>B</bold>) In the <italic>Da</italic> mutant <italic>wnt11</italic> expression is reduced in the dorsal somites. The dorsal DM cells show a high proliferative activity and reduced ability to form numerous large protrusions causing insufficient dorsal somite extension. This results in the incomplete coverage of the neural tube by the epaxial myotomes at the end of embryonic development.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-71845-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In the present study, we described the characteristic behavior of dorsal DM cells and propose their guiding role for the epaxial myotome moving towards the top of the neural tube. During dorsal somite extension, DM cells at the tip of the dorsal somites form large, motile protrusions, which contain multiple bundles of filopodia dynamically branching out from the tip of the protrusions. These long protrusions could be beneficial for invading the restricted open space between the neural tube and the ectoderm. Additionally, previous studies showed that in migrating mesenchymal cells, the formation of lamellipodia is associated with higher migratory speed, whereas filopodia play an exploratory role and are associated with high directionality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leithner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Innocenti, 2018</xref>). Large protrusions of wild-type DM cells consist of a lamellipodia-like core and multiple filopodia, which could account for fast dorsal somite extension with high accuracy. The detailed structure and function of the large protrusions needs to be further investigated in the future studies.</p><p>In zebrafish, hypaxial muscle precursors delaminate from the ventral tip of the DM and migrate collectively in a cell stream to the prospective pectoral fin bud region while the cells at the leading edge form long filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haines et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Talbot et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, DM cells, regardless of whether dorsal or ventral, seem to have the potential to form protrusions and to exhibit migratory behavior. However, regulation of migratory behavior could be different as the migration of hypaxial muscle precursors is mediated by the receptor tyrosine kinase Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haines et al., 2004</xref>) which is not expressed in zebrafish dorsal DM cells.</p><p>At later stages of dorsal somite extension, we observed that DM cells delaminate from the tip of the dorsal somites and progressively occupy the space between the opposing dorsal somites. These mesenchymal DM cells actively form protrusions towards neighboring mesenchymal DM cells and DM cells of the somites, thus forming a dense cellular network on top of the neural tube. This could provide a communication platform for the opposing somites to meet at the right position, exactly on top of the neural tube. Indeed, ablation of mesenchymal DM cells resulted in transient opening of the gap between the somites, suggesting that these cells at least exert a tension to hold the positions of the dorsal tips of the left and right somite together during neural tube coverage. Interestingly, our lineage tracing experiment revealed that the dorsal DM cells at the tip of somites differentiated into cells of non-myotomal lineages including mural cells of blood vessels and mesenchymal cells in the dorsal fin fold. These observations are consistent with previous studies reporting their somitic origins in zebrafish and <italic>Xenopus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garriock and Krieg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ando et al., 2016</xref>). However, our data also showed that these DM cells do not appear to contribute to the myotome at the hatching stage. We thus propose that the neural tube coverage is driven by a specific population of dorsal DM cells, which do not contribute to myotomal cells during embryonic development.</p><p>The ability of the motile DM cells to guide the underlying myotome dorsally assures complete coverage of the neural tube by the epaxial myotomes. Considering the fact that DM cells are in close cell-cell contact with the underlying myotome, it is plausible that they are biomechanically coupled with myotomal cells, facilitating dorsal myotome extension. A similar mechanism has been investigated in mouse neural tube formation. During mouse neural tube closure, the surface ectoderm, overlying the neuroepithelium, forms cell protrusions towards the midline. Disruption of membrane ruffles, a form of lamellipodia, in the surface ectoderm results in incomplete fusion of the subjacent neuroepithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rolo et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our data suggest that in medaka dorsal somites Wnt11 exerts its effect through promotion of protrusion formation and down-regulation of cell proliferation in the dorsal DM. Regarding the protrusion formation, previous studies of migrating mesendodermal cells in the zebrafish mutant <italic>silberblick</italic> and neural crest cells in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos consistently reported that Wnt11 is involved in the oriented elongation and stabilization of protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Ulrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Calisto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Matthews et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, myocardial cells in the heart of <italic>Wnt11</italic> mutant mice also form fewer protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, regulation of cell protrusions is a conserved function of Wnt11, observed in various developmental processes. However, the relationship between Wnt11 and cell proliferation could be context-dependent, as it negatively regulates proliferation in mouse neonatal hearts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Touma, 2017</xref>), while it promotes cell proliferation in mouse intestinal epithelial cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ouko et al., 2004</xref>). Hence, the function of Wnt11 in medaka somites is unique in that it promotes tissue elongation by regulating a balance between proliferative and migrative activity.</p><p>By inhibiting the Wnt/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling pathway we showed that Wnt11 probably acts through this non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway during dorsal somite extension. Likewise, previous studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> have shown that Wnt11 acts through this pathway during cell migration into the dorsal fin fold. There it regulates epithelialâmesenchymal transition in a distinct dorsal somite cell population which, together with a population of neural crest cells, contribute to the mesenchyme of the dorsal fin fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garriock and Krieg, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, during convergent extension in vertebrate gastrulation, Wnt/Ca2<sup>+</sup> signaling pathway can regulate cell adhesion by promoting actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Choi and Han, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kohn and Moon, 2005</xref>). Whether Wnt11 functions cell-autonomously or not is context dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Calisto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garriock and Krieg, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gros et al., 2009</xref>). In our study, administration of exogenous Wnt11 protein rescued the protrusive behavior of the surrounding DM cells, suggesting that Wnt11 can function cell non-autonomously during dorsal somite extension.</p><p>Importantly, our RNA-seq and ChIPmentation analyses revealed that Zic1 has diverse downstream target genes including various developmental genes. This suggests that the dorsal myotome is established via pleiotropic actions of Zic1; Wnt11 may not be a sole factor for dorsal somite extension, although it was suggested to be crucial in the present study. The semaphorin-plexin pathway may play a role, since previous studies suggested, besides its implication in axon guidance and neural cell migration, a role in non-neural cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alto and Terman, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, cell migration and tissue deformation are often linked with the extracellular matrix (ECM), which provides guiding or restraining cues influencing cell movements. Previous studies showed that during mouse epaxial myotome development, ECM composition changes dynamically, which is tightly accompanied by epaxial muscle morphogenesis; while the laminin content in the ECM decreases, increasing tenascin and stable fibronectin contents potentially promotes the alignment of myofibers and their final organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deries et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, recent studies suggested that cells can remodel the surrounding ECM and thereby increase their own motility. For example, during zebrafish gastrulation, the metalloproteinase <italic>mmp14</italic> is expressed by migrating endoderm cells and degrades laminin and fibronectin, components of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). In this context, of particular importance is our identification of <italic>Adamts20</italic>, encoding a proteoglycanase, as a dorsal-high Zic1-target gene in the somites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Since Adamts20 is known to play a pivotal role in embryonic melanoblast migration by remodeling the dermal ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Silver et al., 2008</xref>), Adamnts20 could thus facilitate migration of Wnt11-expressing DM cells through remodeling of the ECM. Further functional analysis of dorsal-high Zic1-target genes identified in somites will provide useful insight into the molecular network driving dorsal somite extension.</p><p>Finally, in vertebrates and especially in fish, body shape and muscle morphology are closely linked, since a majority of the body mass consist of muscular tissue. Previous studies in fish populations have shown that speciation and adaptation to a specific aquatic habitat are associated with a changes in body depth, a measurement of the trunk dorsoventral axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tobler, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weese et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fruciano, 2016</xref>). In this context, the external appearance of the adult <italic>Da</italic> mutant is intriguing, in that it exhibits a teardrop body shape (typical for fish swimming in the middle layer like tuna), instead of a dorsally flattened one (typical for surface swimming fish like medaka). Since our study shows that the activity of <italic>wnt11</italic> could influence the body shape by regulating cell proliferation and the behavior of muscle progenitor cells, Wnt11 could be one of the crucial factors in evolution and diversity of body shape in fish. Furthermore, the expression of <italic>zic1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohtsuka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sun Rhodes and Merzdorf, 2006</xref>; <xref

among vertebrates, and we hypothesize that Wnt11-mediated morphogenesis of the somites represents an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that acts across vertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Zic1 advances epaxial myotome morphogenesis to cover the neural tube via Wnt11r&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the study addresses an interesting and underexplored question in developmental biology. The findings are interesting, especially the illustration of the dynamic behaviors of dorsal somitic cells, which form elaborate protrusions, delaminate from their parent somite, and bridge the gap between opposing epaxial myotomes. The reviewers would like the authors to address the minor technical issues outlined in the individual reviews if possible, as well as the following major critiques:</p><p>1) The reliance on photomorpholinos to downregulate wnt11r dampens the enthusiasm of the reviewers, as the judgement of its efficacy relies on circumstantial evidence that the phenotype resembles the zic1 phenotype and that exogenously supplied human wnt11 protein partially rescues the phenotype. The reviewers encourage the authors to generate a wnt11r Crispr mutant to validate the morpholino experiments.</p><p>2) The identification of a migratory population of dorsal somitic cells is an intriguing observation and the focus of this paper. The fate and function of these cells in epaxial myogenesis, however, is not clear from the current data set and is a gap in the paper. The function of these cells could possibly be explored through an examination of mutants and treatments that prevent their formation or migration.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Critique:</p><p>1) Wnt11r in zebrafish was renamed to wnt11f1 and is the ortholog to human wnt11 (see Postlethwait et al. Evolutionary origin and nomenclature of wnt11- family genes, 2019). The authors should check if medaka wnt11r is the ortholog to human wnt11 and should also be renamed.</p><p>2) In zebrafish neither wnt11 or wnt11r mutants die during gastrulation. The authors should generate mutants before concluding that they will not survive past gastrulation, especially since there is no good control for the efficacy of the knockdown of wnt11r by photomorpholinos.</p><p>3) Figure 5A: It is unclear to me why zic1:GFP and zic4DSRed fish were generated. Wouldn't the DSRed interfere with the detection of dead PI+ cells during FACS sorting?</p><p>4) Figure 5C: Please describe in the result section that dorsal and ventral somites were dissected and that the GFP- cells do not consist of cells from elsewhere in the body.</p><p>5) Discussion: there is no discussion on how wnt11r might instruct polarized cell protrusions. Does wnt11r need to be expressed in a gradient? Does it act non-cell autonomously or in a paracrine fashion? Is wnt11r an instructive cue or a permissive cue?</p><p>6) Throughout the figures it is hard to see which panels show mutants and which ones show wildtype embryos. Please label better, eg. on the left of the row of images.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Pigmentation (e.g., Fig1I) makes it difficult to visualize the margins of the epaxial myotomes.</p><p>The authors should consider complementing Ph3 labelling with BrdU/Edu labelling for cell birth-dating as a measure of proliferation.</p><p>While the medial movement of Zic1:GFP cells to bridge the gap between epaxial myotomes is an interesting observation, the authors do not provide clear evidence of the function of this population in epaxial myotome closure of the neural tube. What is the fate of these cells? Do they contribute to epaxial musculature?</p><p>In Figure 4, it is unclear what BFP labeling marks.</p><p>The authors provide quantification of the protrusions between WT and Da mutants. The authors should consider a similar quantification for the number of dorsal mesenchymal cells between Da and Wt mutants. Additionally, since the authors have the data already in hand, rendered cross sections might provide another way to clearly visualize differences in the epaxial myotome between WT and mutant fish.</p><p>The authors identified Wnt11r as a putative mediator of Zic function during epaxial myotome expansion and hypotheisized Wnt11r functions through the Wnt/ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling pathway. To test this, they treated embryos with Kn-93. Is it known whether this drug affects off additional pathways? The authors should include a comment on the specificity of the drug.</p><p>The authors should further explain the controls used for ChIP-seq experiments.</p><p>It would be interesting to know if similar cellular protrusions are present in the ventral margins of hypaxial myotomes, and if the presence of protrusions differ between fin and non-fin levels?</p><p>The role of migratory somitic cells to form hypaxial muscles such as those of limb is well described. The identification of migratory somitic cells originating from the Pax3/7+ DM/ECL population in fish is a particularly intriguing observation that seems to raise questions about how programs for migratory cell formation are similar and different between epaxial and hypaxial embryonic contexts.</p><p>Line 757 typo &quot;semaphoring&quot; should be &quot;semaphorin&quot;.</p><p>The author's ChipSeq data sets highlight the position of putative Wnt11r enhancer, and their ATACseq data suggests this region is differentially open in the dorsal somite versus the ventral somite. Given these intriguing data sets, the authors should consider using this region to generate an enhancer-reporter transgenic line to test if this enhancer drives dorsal expression.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The opening several paragraphs of the discussion include materials that are already covered in the results. It's good to give a synopsis and explain the model, but it would be nice to see this manuscript better connected with the larger literature. Help the readers understand why this work is important. A few potential connections are laid out in the following paragraphs.</p><p>I find it striking how similar the cell behaviors are in the epaxial myotome to behaviors shown in the hypaxial myotome of zebrafish. For instance, in both cases researchers have used long-protrusions as evidence of cellular guidance. It would be interesting to see discussion added comparing/contrasting behaviors on the extreme dorsal/ventral ends of differing somites. I will understand if you think this is off-topic, but I think a little discussion about how the epaxial findings related to other muscle groups could give context that broadens the impact of the study.</p><p>Even in the narrow literature, some citations are missing. For instance, a quick pubmed of 'zic1 epaxial' gives only three hits; one by the authors and two from another group â the latter two are not cited; these could easily be worked into introduction or discussion.</p><p>The paper could also benefit from the authors finding that Da mutants show increased dorsal muscle growth compared to the wild type, even though the mutant muscles do not enclose the dorsal surface. This finding seems like it further supports the author's claim that dorsal closure is not controlled merely by physical constraint; if the authors agree, they could mention this in the discussion.</p><p>Presentation issues:</p><p>The time-lapse videos could be strengthened by additional annotation of what the reader is supposed to be looking at. The one little arrow in videos 1 and 2 helps some, but it is not enough when there are complex movements amongst a sea of cells and no annotations are provided for videos 3-5, even though arrowheads are mentioned in-text for videos 3 and 4.</p><p>I needed to modify videos 3-5 before they played on my new Mac, though they did on a somewhat older Mac. Please double-check the formatting and make sure they are cross compatible with newer systems. The lack of arrowheads also suggests that an incorrect version may have been uploaded.</p><p>The animals in Video 3 (especially) and 5 do not hold still, making it difficult to follow what's happening. If feasible amid covid restrictions, it would be nice to see these replaced with time-lapse of immobilized fish.</p><p>It is difficult to see protrusions in figure 8b. This panel would benefit from separation of Rhodamine/GFP channels (in addition to the merge) and/or an accompanying illustration.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Zic1 advances epaxial myotome morphogenesis to cover the neural tube via Wnt11&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>As noted in the original reviews, the reviewers find the results reported in the manuscript interesting and the data of high quality. The revised manuscript contains new experimental data and the majority of the reviewers' prior concerns are addressed.</p><p>The reviewers agree that the requested wnt11 mutant analysis is indeed not informative as the embryos possess convergent extension defects. Even though the wnt11 morpholino experiments possess caveats, their phenotype correlates with the results of several other experiments, suggesting that the morpholinos work as expected. However, the text describing the results should reflect that these are morpholino experiments. Eg., line 337 could be changed to saying that the MO 'supports an important role'.</p><p>One major concern with the prior submission was that the fate and function of the dorsal somitic cells bridging opposing myotomes were not described. Here the authors present new data from pharmacological perturbation experiments and targeted laser ablation experiments. These data improve the manuscript and provide evidence that somitic mesenchymal cells have a functional role in myotome extension around the neural tube.</p><p>Unfortunately, a more detailed fate analysis of these cells is still missing. A fascinating finding of the paper is the time-lapse analysis of the cells crawling around on top of the neural tube. But it is not entirely clear what those cells become â are they becoming the fin fold or are they becoming muscle? They do not look too different from the fin mesenchyme cells Tom Carney looked at in a paper a few years back, and their appearance does look different from some zebrafish epaxial muscle-forming cells. Since the authors' main conclusion is about muscle, and their main analysis is of cells that we are not sure are becoming muscle, the authors should perform a more conclusive fate analysis.</p><p>So far, the fate of somitic mesenchyme cells is only partially addressed through use of mosaic pMTB-membmTagBFP2 expression. The authors extend their previous analysis to argue DM cells contribute to the median fin-fold. Did the authors examine only those somites where mosaic BFP was restricted to the DM and not present in other somitic tissues? This would be important for interpretation of results.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Zic1 advances epaxial myotome morphogenesis to cover the neural tube via Wnt11&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Marianne Bronner (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The authors further improved the manuscript by adding fate mapping data of the dorsal DM cells. The fate mapping shows that the dorsally extending cells of interest contribute to the fin-fold mesenchyme and appear to surround blood vessels, however no labeled cells contribute to the myotome itself.</p><p>1) These new findings need to be better represented throughout the manuscript. For example, the abstract still reads:</p><p>'In wild type, dorsal dermomyotome (DM) cells, progenitors of myotomal cells, reduce their proliferative activity after somitogenesis and subsequently form unique large protrusions extending dorsally, guiding the epaxial myotome dorsally'</p><p>Please clarify that dorsal dermomyotome cells are not myotomal progenitors in this context.</p><p>2) Given the new fate mapping data, please also make the modified model more explicit throughout the abstract, intro and discussion: that a non-myogenic lineage of pioneer cells non-cell-autonomously guides dorsal myotome growth.</p><p>3) Could the authors confirm that the fate mapping experiments consist of 17 individual cells in 17 different embryos?</p><p>4) Title: 'Zic1 advances epaxial myotome morphogenesis to cover the neural tube via Wnt11'. Please consider rephrasing the title, which currently does not convey that wnt11 acts on DM cells, which then guide the epaxial myotome. The title suggests that wnt11 acts on epaxial myotome cells directly.</p><p>Line 571, 1371: CRISPR-mediated knock-out of wnt11. Please, rephrase knock-out as the analyzed embryos were not stable mutants. F0 CRISPR causes a hodgepodge of mutations and WT cells.</p><p>Please soften the language regarding the morpholino experiments as initially requested by the reviewers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71845.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the study addresses an interesting and underexplored question in developmental biology.

We found out that development in the crispants were severely affected with a smaller head and truncated body axis at the somitogenesis stage (Figure 7 âfigure supplement 2E-Fâ, arrowheads). This phenotype is known to be secondarily caused by impaired gastrulation movement, and indeed we observed gastrulation defects in the crispants (Figure 7 âfigure supplement 2C, D). Because of these defects, we were unable to assess the myotome development in the <italic>wnt11</italic> mutant. However, these phenotypes (impaired gastrulation movement and malformed trunk) were consistent with our observation in the <italic>wnt11</italic> morphants when a high dose of <italic>wnt11</italic> MO was injected, further supporting that the <italic>wnt11</italic> MO inhibits the <italic>wnt11</italic> gene specifically.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we added description on the <italic>wnt11</italic> cripant embryos to justify the MO experiments (Line 305).</p><p>âInjection of gRNAs against <italic>wnt11</italic> to knock out the gene revealed that the resultant F0 embryos displayed delayed epiboly movement and subsequent morphological defects, including shorter body axis and impaired trunk development (Figure 7 âfigure supplement 2), implying the difficulty of assessment of the <italic>wnt11</italic> function at later stages using the <italic>wnt11</italic> mutant.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of a migratory population of dorsal somitic cells is an intriguing observation and the focus of this paper. The fate and function of these cells in epaxial myogenesis, however, is not clear from the current data set and is a gap in the paper. The function of these cells could possibly be explored through an examination of mutants and treatments that prevent their formation or migration.</p></disp-quote><p>We absolutely agree with the suggestion that the function and fate of the dorsal DM and mesenchymal cells are important for the significance of this study. We tested their roles with two additional experiments.</p><p>1) At the onset of dorsal somite extension, we inhibited filopodia formation of large protrusions of dorsal DM cells with ML141, a specific inhibitor against Rac1/Cdc42 (Figure 3L, M), and found that the treatment disturbed the dorsal extension of myotomes (Figure 3N). This result suggests that the dorsal DM cells promote the dorsal somite extension by utilizing the large protrusions.</p><p>2) We also ablated the mesenchymal DM cells arising at later stages of dorsal somite extension, using a UV laser and revealed that the ablation transiently widened the gap between the left and right myotomes and delayed the dorsal somite extension (Figure 4J-L). We concluded that the mesenchymal DM cells exert a force promoting the advancement of left and right myotomes to cover the neural tube. Thus, DM cells seem to be playing a crucial role throughout dorsal somite extension.</p><p>We further investigated the fate of the dorsal DM cells by sparsely labeling those cells with BFP plasmid injection. We found that some cell eventually differentiated into myotome fibers while some became mesenchymal cells in the dorsal finfold (Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3C). This result implies that the mesenchymal cells have multiple potentials to become at least myotomal and dermal cells.</p><p>We included the description on the function of the dorsal DM and mesenchymal cells in the Results section as follows:</p><p>1 (Line 172):</p><p>âTo investigate the role of large protrusions during the onset of dorsal somite extension, we inhibited filopodia formation using ML141 (Figure 3L, M). ML141 specifically inhibits Cdc42/Rac1 GTPases, which are critical for filopodia formation (Hong et al., 2013; Fantin et al., 2015). Intriguingly, dorsal somites of embryos treated with ML141 extended significantly less dorsally compared to control embryos treated with DMSO (Figure 3N).â</p><p>2 (Line 208):</p><p>âTo examine the function of mesenchymal DM cells, we ablated these cells between the 10th somites of 5.5 dpf Tg(zic1:GFP) embryos with a UV laser (Figure 4J-Kâ, Figure 4 âfigure supplement 3A-Bâ). Intriguingly, the distance between the left and the right tips of the 10th somites increased after ablating the mesenchymal DM cells while the neighboring 9th somites continued to shorten the gap (Figure 4L). This suggests that mesenchymal DM cells hold the left and the right somite together to promote the dorsal somite extension at this late phase of myotome development. After 16 hours post ablation, dorsal extension of the 10th somites eventually resumed as the mesenchymal DM cells regenerated at the ablation site (Figure 4L).â</p><p>Regarding the fate of DM cells, we added a sentence âInterestingly, besides the differentiation into myotome cells, our preliminary data suggest that DM cells also differentiate into mesenchymal fin fold cells, aligning with previous observations in <italic>Xenopus</italic> (Garriock and Krieg, 2007). â to the Discussion section (Line 423).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Critique:</p><p>1) Wnt11r in zebrafish was renamed to wnt11f1 and is the ortholog to human wnt11 (see Postlethwait et al.

Development 2005; Gros et al. Nature 2009). In our study, administration of exogenous Wnt11 protein rescued the protrusive behavior of the surrounding DM cells, suggesting that Wnt11 can function cell non-autonomously during dorsal somite extension.

For technical reasons, it is hard to observe the extension procedure of the hypaxial myotomes. We speculate that the ventral-most DM cells also exhibit protrusions while they are less active than in dorsal DM cells, since the hypaxial somites show similar characteristics to the epaxial ones in the <italic>Da</italic> mutant embryos.

Thus, DM cells, regardless of whether dorsal or ventral, seem to have the potential to form protrusions and to exhibit migratory behavior.

We tried to fix the position of the embryos but we failed to do so completely for the following technical reasons. The movement of the medaka embryos in the videos consists of three factors: muscle contraction, yolk contraction and body axis growth. We successfully inhibited the muscle movement by injecting <italic>bungarotoxin</italic> mRNA which blocks nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Swinburne et al. PLoS One 2015; Lischik et al. PLoS One 2019). However, the yolk contraction movement, which is unique to the early stages (from epiboly to mid-somitogenesis stages) of medaka embryos and is not observed in zebrafish, was difficult to be completely inhibited. The slight twitching of the embryos in the movies are due to this yolk movement. Furthermore, the movement to the left in videos 3 and 4 is due to the rapid body axis growth of the embryos during that stage, although we minimized the growth effect by registering the images by ImageJ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to see protrusions in figure 8b.

Even though the wnt11 morpholino experiments possess caveats, their phenotype correlates with the results of several other experiments, suggesting that the morpholinos work as expected. However, the text describing the results should reflect that these are morpholino experiments. Eg., line 337 could be changed to saying that the MO 'supports an important role'.</p><p>One major concern with the prior submission was that the fate and function of the dorsal somitic cells bridging opposing myotomes were not described. Here the authors present new data from pharmacological perturbation experiments and targeted laser ablation experiments. These data improve the manuscript and provide evidence that somitic mesenchymal cells have a functional role in myotome extension around the neural tube.</p><p>Unfortunately, a more detailed fate analysis of these cells is still missing. A fascinating finding of the paper is the time-lapse analysis of the cells crawling around on top of the neural tube. But it is not entirely clear what those cells become â are they becoming the fin fold or are they becoming muscle? They do not look too different from the fin mesenchyme cells Tom Carney looked at in a paper a few years back, and their appearance does look different from some zebrafish epaxial muscle-forming cells. Since the authors' main conclusion is about muscle, and their main analysis is of cells that we are not sure are becoming muscle, the authors should perform a more conclusive fate analysis.</p><p>So far, the fate of somitic mesenchyme cells is only partially addressed through use of mosaic pMTB-membmTagBFP2 expression. The authors extend their previous analysis to argue DM cells contribute to the median fin-fold. Did the authors examine only those somites where mosaic BFP was restricted to the DM and not present in other somitic tissues? This would be important for interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers and indeed could not exclude the possibility that other somitic cells besides the dorsal DM cells were also labeled during our lineage tracing experiment using the BFP plasmid. To tackle this issue, we set up another experiment utilizing KikGR (photoconvertible protein)-mediated photoconversion, which enables spatiotemporally controlled labeling of dorsal DM cells at a single-cell level. We injected <italic>kikGR</italic> mRNA into 1-cell stage embryos and photoconverted single dorsal DM cells specifically with a UV laser. Specific labeling of the dorsal DM cells was confirmed by visual inspection of z-stack images using confocal microscopy (Figure 4M). We tracked their fate until the hatching stage (9 days postfertilization).</p><p>We found that the labeled cells contributed to blood vessels (presumably mural cells surrounding endothelial cells; Figure 4N, Nâ) and dorsal finfold mesenchyme (Figure 4O, Oâ), which is in accordance with previous studies revealing their somitic origins (Ando et al., Development 2016; Lee et al., Development 2013; Garriock and Krieg, 2007). However, we did not observe any labeled myotomal cells. These results suggest that these dorsal DM cells, guiding the myotome to cover the neural tube, do not contribute to the myotome themselves, at least at the hatching stage.</p><p>In the manuscript, we replaced the previous figures for fate mapping with these new figures (Figures 4M-Oâ) and described them in the results and Discussion sections as follows:</p><p>(Line 220, Results):</p><p>âFinally, we examined the fate of the dorsal DM cells that derive the mesenchymal cells. We employed a photoconversion technique mediated by a photoconvertible protein KikGR to specifically label a single dorsal DM cell exhibiting protrusions at the tip of a 10<sup>th</sup> or 20<sup>th</sup> somite during dorsal somite extension (Figure 4M, arrowhead) and tracked them until the hatching stage. We found that the labeled dorsal DM cells eventually differentiated into cells surrounding blood vessels (likely mural cells, n = 12/17 for 10<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> somites; Figure 4N, Nâ, arrowheads) and mesenchymal cells in the dorsal fin fold (n = 4/8 for 20<sup>th</sup> somites; Figure 4O, Oâ, arrowheads); however, we did not observe any labeled axial muscles (n = 0/17 for 10<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> somites). This suggests that the dorsal DM cells at the tip of somites, guiding myotome extension, do not become myotomal cells themselves at least until the end of embryonic development (hatching stage, 9 dpf).â</p><p>(Line 420, Discussion):</p><p>âInterestingly, our lineage tracing experiment revealed that the dorsal DM cells at the tip of somites differentiated into cells of non-myotomal lineages including mural cells of blood vessels and mesenchymal cells in the dorsal fin fold.
