approach to identify potential regulatory elements. A popular example is ATAC-seq, whereby Tn5 transposase inserts sequencing adapters into accessible DNA (‘tagmentation’). CUT&amp;Tag is a tagmentation-based epigenomic profiling method in which antibody tethering of Tn5 to a chromatin epitope of interest profiles specific chromatin features in small samples and single cells. Here, we show that by simply modifying the tagmentation conditions for histone H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 CUT&amp;Tag, antibody-tethered tagmentation of accessible DNA sites is redirected to produce chromatin accessibility maps that are indistinguishable from the best ATAC-seq maps. Thus, chromatin accessibility maps can be produced in parallel with CUT&amp;Tag maps of other epitopes with all steps from nuclei to amplified sequencing-ready libraries performed in single PCR tubes in the laboratory or on a home workbench. As H3K4 methylation is produced by transcription at promoters and enhancers, our method identifies transcription-coupled accessible regulatory sites.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells keep their DNA tidy by wrapping it into structures called nucleosomes. Each of these structures contains a short section of DNA wound around a cluster of proteins called histones. Not only do nucleosomes keep the genetic code organized, they also control whether the proteins that can switch genes on or off have access to the DNA. When genes turn on, the nucleosomes unwrap, exposing sections of genetic code called 'gene regulatory elements'. These elements attract the proteins that help read and copy nearby genes so the cell can make new proteins. Determining which regulatory elements are exposed at any given time can provide useful information about what is happening inside a cell, but the procedure can be expensive.</p><p>The most popular way to map which regulatory elements are exposed is using a technique called Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing, or ATAC-seq for short. The 'transposase' in the acronym is an enzyme that cuts areas of DNA that are not wound around histones and prepares them for detection by DNA sequencing. Unfortunately, the data from ATAC-seq are often noisy (there are random factors that produce a signal that is detected but is not a ‘real’ result), so more sequencing is required to differentiate between real signal and noise, increasing the expense of ATAC-seq experiments. Furthermore, although ATAC-seq can identify unspooled sections of DNA, it cannot provide a direct connection between active genes and unwrapped DNA.</p><p>To find the link between unspooled DNA and active genes, Henikoff et al. adapted a technique called CUT&amp;Tag. Like ATAC-seq, it also uses transposases to cut the genome, but it allows more control over where the cuts occur. When genes are switched on, the proteins reading them leave chemical marks on the histones they pass. CUT&amp;Tag attaches a transposase to a molecule that recognizes and binds to those marks. This allowed Henikoff et al. to guide the transposases to unspooled regions of DNA bordering active genes. The maps of gene regulatory elements produced using this method were the same as the best ATAC-seq maps. And, because the transposases could only access gaps near active genes, the data provided evidence that genes switching on leads to regulatory elements in the genome unwrapping.</p><p>This new technique is simple enough that Henikoff et al. were able to perform it from home on the countertop of a laundry room. By tethering the transposases to histone marks it was possible to detect unspooled DNA that was active more efficiently than with ATAC-seq. This lowers laboratory costs by reducing the cost of DNA sequencing, and may also improve the detection of gaps between nucleosomes in single cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenomic profiling</kwd><kwd>chromatin accessibility</kwd><kwd>histone modifications</kwd><kwd>cut &amp; tag</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HG010492</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM108699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>Kami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fred Hutch HCA Seed Network</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahmad</surname><given-names>Kami</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Henikoff</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henikoff</surname><given-names>Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A simple modification of CUT&amp;Tag chromatin profiling method provides high-quality chromatin accessibility maps and indicates that 'open' chromatin results from a transcription-coupled process at promoters and enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Identification of DNA accessibility in the chromatin landscape has been used to infer active transcription ever since the seminal description of DNaseI hypersensitivity by Weintraub and Groudine more than 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weintraub and Groudine, 1976</xref>). Because nucleosomes occupy most of the eukaryotic chromatin landscape and regulatory elements are mostly free of nucleosomes when they are active, DNA accessibility mapping can potentially identify active regulatory elements genome-wide. Several additional strategies have been introduced to identify regulatory elements by DNA accessibility mapping, including digestion with Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Reeves, 1978</xref>) or restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jack and Eggert, 1990</xref>), DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gottschling, 1992</xref>), physical fragmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schwartz et al., 2005</xref>) and transposon insertion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bownes, 1990</xref>). With the advent of genome-scale mapping platforms, beginning with microarrays and later short-read DNA sequencing, mapping regulatory elements based on DNaseI hypersensitivity became routine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crawford et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorschner et al., 2004</xref>). Later innovations included FAIRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Giresi et al., 2007</xref>) and Sono-Seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auerbach et al., 2009</xref>), based on physical fragmentation and differential recovery of cross-linked chromatin, and ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>), based on preferential insertion of the Tn5 transposase. The speed and simplicity of ATAC-seq, in which the cut-and-paste transposition reaction inserts sequencing adapters in the most accessible genomic regions (tagmentation), has led to its widespread adoption in many laboratories for mapping presumed regulatory elements.</p><p>For all of these DNA accessibility mapping strategies, it is generally unknown what process is responsible for creating any particular accessible sites within the chromatin landscape. Furthermore accessibility is not all-or-none, with the median difference between an accessible and a non-accessible site in DNA estimated to be only ~20%, with no sites completely accessible or inaccessible in a population of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Oberbeckmann et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these uncertainties, DNA accessibility mapping has successfully predicted the locations of active gene enhancers and promoters genome-wide, with excellent correspondence between methods based on very different strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karabacak Calviello et al., 2019</xref>). This is likely because DNA accessibility mapping strategies rely on the fact that nucleosomes have evolved to repress transcription by blocking sites of pre-initiation complex formation and transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kornberg and Lorch, 2020</xref>), and so creating and maintaining a nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) is a pre-requisite for promoter and enhancer function.</p><p>A popular alternative to DNA accessibility mapping for regulatory element identification is to map nucleosomes that border NDRs, typically by histone marks, including ‘active’ histone modifications, such as H3K4 methylation and H3K27 acetylation, or histone variants incorporated during transcription, such as H2A.Z and H3.3. The rationale for this mapping strategy is that the enzymes that modify histone tails and the chaperones that deposit nucleosome subunits are most active close to the sites of initiation of transcription, which typically occurs bidirectionally at both gene promoters and enhancers to produce stable mRNAs and unstable enhancer RNAs. Although the marks left behind by active transcriptional initiation ‘point back’ to the NDR, this cause-effect connection between the NDR and the histone marks is only by inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), and direct evidence is lacking that a histone mark is associated with an NDR.</p><p>Here, we show that a simple modification of our <underline>C</underline>leavage <underline>U</underline>nder <underline>T</underline>argets and <underline>Tag</underline>mentation (CUT&amp;Tag) method for antibody-tethered in situ tagmentation can identify NDRs genome-wide at regulatory elements adjacent to transcription-associated histone marks in human cells. We provide evidence that reducing the ionic concentration during tagmentation preferentially attracts Tn5 tethered to the H3K4me2 histone modification via a Protein A/G fusion to the nearby NDR, shifting the site of tagmentation from nucleosomes bordering the NDR to the NDR itself. Almost all transcription-coupled accessible sites correspond to ATAC-seq sites and vice-versa, and lie upstream of paused RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII). ‘CUTAC’ (<underline>C</underline>leavage <underline>U</underline>nder <underline>T</underline>argeted <underline>A</underline>ccessible <underline>C</underline>hromatin) is conveniently performed in parallel with ordinary CUT&amp;Tag, producing accessible site maps from low cell numbers with signal-to-noise as good as or better than the best ATAC-seq datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Streamlined CUT&amp;Tag produces high-quality datasets with low cell numbers</title><p>We previously introduced CUT&amp;RUN, a modification of Laemmli’s Chromatin Immunocleavage (ChIC) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schmid et al., 2004</xref>), in which a fusion protein between Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) and Protein A (pA-MNase) binds sites of antibodies bound to chromatin fragments in nuclei or permeabilized cells immobilized on magnetic beads. Activation of MNase with Ca<sup>++</sup> results in targeted cleavage, releasing the antibody-bound fragment into the supernatant for paired-end DNA sequencing. More recently, we substituted the Tn5 transposase for MNase in a modified CUT&amp;RUN protocol, such that addition of Mg<sup>++</sup> results in a cut-and-paste ‘tagmentation’ reaction, in which sequencing adapters are integrated around sites of antibody binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>). In CUT&amp;Tag, DNA purification is followed by PCR amplification, eliminating the end-polishing and ligation steps required for sequencing library preparation in CUT&amp;RUN. Like CUT&amp;RUN, CUT&amp;Tag requires relatively little input material, and the low backgrounds permit low sequencing depths to sensitively map chromatin features.</p><p>We have developed a streamlined version of CUT&amp;Tag that eliminates tube transfers, so that all steps can be efficiently performed in a single PCR tube (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaya-Okur et al., 2020</xref>). However, we had not determined the suitability of the single-tube protocol for profiling low cell number samples. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adapted this CUT&amp;Tag-direct protocol for implementation with minimal equipment and space requirements that uses no toxic reagents, so that it can be performed conveniently and safely on a home workbench (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To ascertain the ability of our CUT&amp;Tag-direct protocol to produce DNA sequencing libraries at home with data quality comparable to those produced in the laboratory, we used frozen aliquots of native human K562 cell nuclei prepared in the laboratory and profiled there using the streamlined single-tube protocol. Aliquots of nuclei were thawed and serially diluted in Wash buffer from ~60,000 down to ~60 starting cells, where the average yield of nuclei was ~50%. We used antibodies to H3K4me3, which preferentially marks nucleosomes immediately downstream of active promoters, and H3K27me3, which marks nucleosomes within broad domains of polycomb-dependent silencing. Aliquots of nuclei were taken home and stored in a kitchen freezer, then thawed and diluted at home and profiled for H3K4me3 and H3K27me3. In both the laboratory and at home, we performed all steps in groups of 16 or 32 samples over the course of a single day through the post-PCR clean-up step, treating all samples the same regardless of cell numbers. Whether produced at home or in the lab, all final barcoded sample libraries underwent the same quality control, equimolar pooling, and final SPRI bead clean-up steps in the laboratory prior to DNA sequencing.</p><p>Tapestation profiles of libraries produced at home detected nucleosomal ladders down to 200 cells for H3K27me3 and nucleosomal and subnucleosomal fragments down to 2000 cells for H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Sequenced fragments were aligned to the human genome using Bowtie2 and tracks were displayed using IGV. Similar results were obtained for both at-home and in-lab profiles for both histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) using pA-Tn5 produced in the laboratory, and results using commercial Protein A/Protein G-Tn5 (pAG-Tn5) were at least as good.

High-salt buffers included 300 mM NaCl for pA-Tn5 binding, washing to remove excess protein, and tagmentation at 37°C. We have found that other protocols based on the same principle but that do not include a high-salt wash step result in chromatin profiles that are dominated by accessible site tagmentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaya-Okur et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>To better understand the mechanistic basis for the salt-suppression effect, we bound pAG-Tn5 under normal high-salt CUT&amp;Tag incubation conditions, then tagmented in low salt. We used either rapid 20-fold dilution with a prewarmed solution of 2 mM or 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> or removal of the pAG-Tn5 incubation solution and addition of 50 µL 10 mM TAPS pH8.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

For all three H3K4 methylation marks using normal CUT&amp;Tag high-salt tagmentation conditions we observed a bulge around the summit representing the contribution from adjacent nucleosomes on one side or the other of the peak summit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In contrast, tagmentation under low-salt conditions revealed much narrower profiles for H3K4me3 and H3K4me2 (~40% peak width at half-height), less so for H3K4me1 (~60%), which suggests that the shift is from H3K4me-marked nucleosomes to an adjacent NDR.</p><p>To determine whether free pAG-Tn5 present during tagmentation contributes, we removed the pAG-Tn5 then added 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to tagment, and again observed narrowing of the H3K4me2 peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> ‘Removal’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>). We also observed a narrowing if we included a stringent 300 mM washing step before low-salt tagmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, ‘Post-wash’), which indicates that peak narrowing does not require free pAG-Tn5. Inclusion of a stringent post-wash step improves consistency relative to the Dilution or Removal protocols, although it resulted in lower yields and reduced library complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>). However, if a small amount of pAG-Tn5 was included during tagmentation we obtained higher yields with increased peak narrowing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> ‘Add-back’). Because Tn5 is inactive once it integrates its payload of adapters, and each fragment is generated by tagmentation at both ends, it is likely that a small amount of free pA(G)-Tn5 is sufficient to generate the additional small fragments where tethered pA(G)-Tn5 is limiting, albeit with higher background.</p><p>Salt ions compete with protein-DNA binding and so we suppose that tagmentation in low salt resulted in increased binding of epitope-tethered Tn5 to a nearby NDR prior to tagmentation. As H3K4 methylation is deposited in a gradient of tri- to di- to mono-methylation downstream of the +1 nucleosome from the transcriptional start site (TSS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Soares et al., 2017</xref>), we reasoned that the closer proximity of di- and tri-methylated nucleosomes to the NDR than mono-methylated nucleosomes resulted in preferential proximity-dependent ‘capture’ of Tn5. Consistent with this interpretation, we observed that the shift from broad to more peaky NDR profiles and heatmaps by H3K4me2 low-salt tagmentation was enhanced by addition of 1,6-hexanediol, a strongly polar aliphatic alcohol, and by 10% dimethylformamide, a strongly polar amide, both of which enhance chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). NDR-focused tagmentation persisted even in the presence of both strongly polar compounds at 55°C. Enhanced localization by chromatin-disrupting conditions suggests improved access of H3K4me2-tethered Tn5 to nearby holes in the chromatin landscape during low-salt tagmentation. Localization to NDRs is more precise for small (≤120 bp) than large (&gt;120 bp) tagmented fragments, and by resolving more closely spaced peaks inclusion of these compounds increased the number of peaks called (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), also for H3K4me3-tethered Tn5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CUT&amp;Tag low-salt tagmentation fragments coincide with ATAC-seq and DNaseI hypersensitive sites</title><p>Using CUT&amp;Tag, we previously showed that most ATAC-seq sites are flanked by H3K4me2-marked nucleosomes in K562 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kaya-Okur et al., 2019</xref>).

Remarkably, heatmaps produced using either Omni-ATAC or CUTAC peak calls for the same ENCODE ATAC-seq data showed occupancy of ~95% for both sets of peaks (compare right panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).

This equivalence between H3K4me2 CUTAC and Omni-ATAC when compared to ENCODE ATAC-seq implies that CUTAC and Omni-ATAC detect the same chromatin features. This conclusion does not hold for H3K4me3 CUTAC, because similar alignment of ENCODE ATAC-seq data resulted in only ~75% peak occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and lower correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), which we attribute to the greater enrichment of H3K4me3 around promoters than enhancers relative to H3K4me2.</p><p>To evaluate whether CUTAC peaks also correspond to sites of DNaseI hypersensitivity, we aligned H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag and CUTAC signals over 9403 CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) motifs scored as peaks of DNaseI sensitivity in K562 and HeLa cells.

We observed that 86% of the DNaseI hypersensitive CTCF sites are occupied by CUTAC signal relative to flanking regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which suggests equivalence of CUTAC and DNaseI hypersensitive CTCF sites. We also found that the H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag sample showed detectable signal at only 53% of the CTCF sites. This improvement in detection of CTCF sites by H3K4me2 CUTAC over H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag illustrates the potential of using ≤120 bp CUTAC fragment data to improve the resolution and sensitivity of transcription factor binding site motif detection.</p><p>To evaluate signal-to-noise genome-wide, we called peaks using MACS2 and calculated the <underline>F</underline>raction of <underline>R</underline>eads <underline>i</underline>n <underline>P</underline>eaks (FRiP), a data quality metric introduced by the ENCODE project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Landt et al., 2012</xref>).

Using CUT&amp;Tag-direct, H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag FRiP = 0.41 for 3.2 million fragments and ~16,000 peaks (n = 4 replicates), whereas tagmentation by dilution in 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> resulted in FRiP = 0.18 for 3.2 million fragments and ~15,000 peaks (n = 4) with similar values for tagmentation by removal [FRiP = 0.21,~15,000 peaks (n = 4)]. In add-back experiments, we measured lower FRiP values after stringent washing conditions, suggesting increased background.</p><p>We also compared the number of peaks and FRiP values for CUTAC to those for ATAC-seq for K562 cells and observed that CUTAC data quality was similar to that for the Omni-ATAC method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces et al., 2017</xref>), better than ENCODE ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), and much better than Fast-ATAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>), a previous improvement over Standard ATAC-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). CUTAC is relatively insensitive to tagmentation times, with similar numbers of peaks and similar FRiP values for samples tagmented for 5, 20 and 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We attribute the robustness of CUT&amp;Tag and CUTAC to the tethering of Tn5 to specific chromatin epitopes, so that when tagmentation goes to completion there is little untethered Tn5 that would increase background levels.

Interestingly, alignment around TSSs, RNAPIIS5P or PRO-seq data resolved immediately flanking H3K4me2-marked nucleosomes in CUT&amp;Tag data, which is not seen for the same data aligned on signal midpoints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Such alignment of +1 and −1 nucleosomes next to fixed NDR boundaries is consistent with nucleosome positioning based on steric exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chereji et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the split in PRO-seq occupancies around NDRs defined by CUTAC and Omni-ATAC implies that the steady-state location of most engaged RNAPII is immediately downstream of the NDR from which it initiated. About 80% of the CUTAC sites showed enrichment of PRO-Seq signal downstream, confirming that the large majority of CUTAC sites correspond to NDRs representing transcription-coupled regulatory elements.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The correlation between sites of high chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulatory elements, including enhancers and promoters, has driven the development of several distinct methods for genome-wide mapping of DNA accessibility for nearly two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klein and Hainer, 2020</xref>). However, the processes that are responsible for creating gaps in the nucleosome landscape are not completely understood. In part this uncertainty is attributable to variations in nucleosome positioning within a population of mammalian cells such that there is only a ~20% median difference in absolute DNA accessibility between DNaseI hypersensitive sites and non-hypersensitive sites genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chereji et al., 2019</xref>). This suggests that DNA accessibility is not the primary determinant of gene regulation, and contradicts the popular characterization of accessible DNA sites as ‘open’ and the lack of accessibility as ‘closed’. Moreover, there are multiple dynamic processes that can result in nucleosome depletion, including transcription, nucleosome remodeling, transcription factor binding, and replication, so that the identification of a presumed regulatory element by chromatin accessibility mapping leaves open the question as to how accessibility is established and maintained. Our CUTAC mapping method now provides a physical link between a transcription-coupled process and DNA hyperaccessibility by showing that anchoring of Tn5 to a nucleosome mark laid down by transcriptional events immediately downstream identifies presumed gene regulatory elements that are indistinguishable from those identified by ATAC-seq. The equivalence of CUTAC and ATAC at both enhancers and promoters provides support for the hypothesis that these regulatory elements are characterized by the same regulatory architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arnold et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The mechanistic basis for asserting that H3K4 methylation is a transcription-coupled event is well-established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henikoff and Shilatifard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). In all eukaryotes, H3K4 methylation is catalyzed by COMPASS/SET1 and related enzyme complexes, which associate with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the large subunit of RNAPII when Serine-5 of the tandemly repetitive heptad repeat of the CTD is phosphorylated following transcription initiation. The enrichment of dimethylated and trimethylated forms of H3K4 is thought to be the result of exposure of the H3 tail to COMPASS/SET1 during RNAPII stalling just downstream of the TSS, so that these modifications are coupled to the onset of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Soares et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, our demonstration that Tn5 tethered to H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 histone tail residues efficiently tagments accessible sites, implies that accessibility at regulatory elements is created by events immediately following transcription initiation. This mechanistic interpretation is supported by the mapping of CUTAC sites just upstream of RNAPII, and is consistent with the recent demonstration that PRO-seq data can be used to accurately impute ‘active’ histone modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus CUTAC identifies active promoters and enhancers that produce enhancer RNAs, which might help explain why ~95% of ATAC-seq peaks are detected by CUTAC and vice-versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>).</p><p>CUTAC also provides practical advantages over other chromatin accessibility mapping methods. Like CUT&amp;Tag-direct, all steps from frozen nuclei to purified sequencing-ready libraries for the data presented here were performed in a day in single PCR tubes on a home workbench. As it requires only a simple modification of one step in the CUT&amp;Tag protocol, CUTAC can be performed in parallel with an H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag positive control and other antibodies using multiple aliquots from each population of cells to be profiled. We have shown that three distinct protocol modifications, dilution, removal and post-wash tagmentation yield high-quality results, providing flexibility that might be important for adapting CUTAC to nuclei from diverse cell types and tissues.</p><p>Although a CUT&amp;Tag-direct experiment requires a day to perform, and ATAC-seq can be performed in a few hours, this disadvantage of CUTAC is offset by the better control of data quality with CUTAC as is evident from the large variation in ATAC-seq data quality between laboratories (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, CUT&amp;Tag is highly reproducible using native or lightly cross-linked cells or nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaya-Okur et al., 2020</xref>), and as shown here H3K4me2 CUTAC maps regulatory elements with sensitivity and signal-to-noise comparable to the best ATAC-seq datasets, even better when larger fragments are computationally excluded. Although datasets from H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag have lower background than datasets from CUTAC run in parallel, the combination of the two provides both highest data quality (CUT&amp;Tag) and precise mapping (CUTAC) using the same H3K4me2 antibody. Therefore, we anticipate that current CUT&amp;Tag users and others will find the CUTAC option to be an attractive alternative to other DNA accessibility mapping methods for identifying transcription-coupled regulatory elements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (Human)</td><td>K562</td><td>ATCC</td><td>Cat#CCL-243; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0004">CVCL_0004</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (Human)</td><td>H1 embryonic stem cells</td><td>WiCell</td><td>Cat#WA01-lot#WB35186; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_9771">CVCL_9771</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-NPAT</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>PA5-66839; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2663287">AB_2663287</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>guinea pig polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG</td><td>Antibodies Online</td><td>Cat#ABIN101961; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10775589">AB_10775589</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#46540; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2614925">AB_2614925</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K27me3</td><td>Cell Signaling</td><td>Cat#9733; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2616029">AB_2616029</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K4me2</td><td>Upstate</td><td>Cat#07–730- <break/>lot#3229364; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11213050">AB_11213050</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K27ac</td><td>Millipore</td><td>Cat#MABE647</td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K4me3</td><td>Active Motif</td><td>Cat#39159; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2561020">AB_2561020</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit monoclonal <break/>anti-H3K4me2</td><td>Epicypher</td><td>Cat#13–0027</td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K4me1</td><td>Epicypher</td><td>Cat#13–0026</td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K9me3</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#ab8898; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306848">AB_306848</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K36me3</td><td>Epicypher</td><td>Cat#13–0031</td><td>Concentration: 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Protein A-Tn5</td><td>Henikoff lab</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.8yrhxv6">10.17504/protocols.io.8yrhxv6</ext-link></td><td>Concentration: 1:200</td></tr><tr><td>Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td>Protein AG-Tn5</td><td>Epicypher</td><td>1 Cat#5–1117</td><td>Concentration: 1:20-1:60</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Biological materials</title><p>Human K562 cells were purchased from ATCC (CCL-243) and cultured following the supplier’s protocol.

Briefly, nuclei were thawed, mixed with activated Concanavalin A beads and magnetized to remove the liquid with a pipettor and resuspended in Wash buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM spermidine and Roche EDTA-free protease inhibitor). After successive incubations with primary antibody (1–2 hr) and secondary antibody (0.5–1 hr) in Wash buffer, the beads were washed and resuspended in pA(G)-Tn5 at 12.5 nM in 300-Wash buffer (Wash buffer containing 300 mM NaCl) for 1 hr. Incubations were performed at room temperature either in bulk or in volumes of 25–50 µL in low-retention PCR tubes. For CUT&amp;Tag, tagmentation was performed for 1 hr in 300-Wash buffer supplemented with 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in a 50 µL volume. For CUTAC, tagmentation was performed in low-salt buffer with varying components, volumes and temperatures as described for each experiment in the figure legends. In ‘dilution’ tagmentation, tubes containing 25 µL of pA(G)-Tn5 incubation solution and 2 mM or 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> solutions were preheated to 37°C. Tagmentation solution (475 µL) was rapidly added to the tubes and incubated for times and temperatures as indicated. In ‘removal’ tagmentation, tubes were magnetized, liquid was removed, and 50 µL of ice-cold 10 mM TAPS pH 8.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added, followed by incubation for times and temperatures as indicated. The ‘post-wash’ protocol is identical to the CUT&amp;Tag-direct protocol except that tagmentation was performed in 10 mM TAPS pH 8.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 37°C as indicated. In ‘add-back’ tagmentation, the post-wash protocol was used with 10 mM TAPS pH 8.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> supplemented with pA(G)-Tn5 and incubated at 37°C as indicated.</p><p>Following tagmentation, CUT&amp;Tag and CUTAC samples were chilled and magnetized, liquid was removed, and beads were washed in 50 µL 10 mM TAPS pH 8.5, 0.2 mM EDTA then resuspended in 5 µL 0.1% SDS, 10 µL TAPS pH 8.5. Following incubation at 58°C, SDS was neutralized with 15 µL of 0.67% Triton-X100, and 2 µL of 10 mM indexed P5 and P7 primer solutions were added. Tubes were chilled and 25 µL of NEBNext 2x Master mix was added and vortexed. Gap-filling and 12 cycles of PCR were performed using an MJ PTC-200 Thermocycler. Clean-up was performed by addition of 65 µL SPRI bead slurry following the manufacturer’s instructions, eluted with 20 µL 1 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 0.1 mM EDTA and 2 µL was used for Agilent 4200 Tapestation analysis.

CUTAC builds on the Henikoff lab's exciting new CUT&amp;TAG method. Unlike the CUT&amp;TAG protocol published recently, however, this new work uses low-salt conditions during tagmentation, which appears to promote Tn5 transposition in nucleosome depleted regions adjacent to the primary antibody. The data demonstrating that CUTAC favors transposition inside of nucleosome depleted regions is compelling and clearly shown. Moreover, the new method affords a substantial improvement in the resolution for active regulatory regions compared with CUT&amp;TAG for histone modifications, comparable to that of high-quality ATAC-seq data. Compared with ATAC-seq, there are potentially several compelling advantages of CUTAC, including reproducibility, side-by-side library prep with CUT&amp;TAG, and the possibility of being selective about which open chromatin regions are sequenced (see below). Between these advantages and the authors' past success and broad community interest in the CUT&amp;RUN and CUT&amp;TAG family of methods, I am in favor of publication. I have several comments for the authors:</p><p>1) The authors' model is that the primary antibody recruits pA-Tn5 fusion, which then transposes DNA in adjacent accessible regions. However, not all nuclease accessible chromatin is marked by H3K4me2/3. Several lines of evidence suggest that, at least CTCF binding sites have a high level of DNase-I accessibility, but many lack histone modifications indicative of active enhancers/ promoters. Most of the previous work on this subject was done using DNase-I-seq, however presumably the same signal is true for ATAC-seq?! Assuming ATAC-seq shows the same signal, I am curious to know whether CUTAC data collected using K4me2/3 antibodies shows accessibility near CTCF binding sites. An easy way to get at this would be to center on CTCF sites, and break them into classes which do/ do not contain evidence of either K4me2/3 or transcription using ENCODE data. If a heatmap shows similar signal between ATAC and CUTAC at CTCF sites associated with K3me2/3, but only ATAC shows signal at CTCF sites not associated with these marks, then it implies a degree of specificity for open chromatin near the primary antibody as would be expected from the author's model.</p><p>2) Selecting which open chromatin regions to measure could be an additional, compelling advantage of CUTAC over ATAC-seq. One could imagine, for instance, using CUTAC to find open chromatin near specific kinds of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors, Pol II, or (possibly) transcription factors. I would imagine there are a range of applications that would benefit from something like this. Is it worth saying more about this? Or do the authors think that more exploration would be required before this could be stated with any certainty (perhaps the analysis suggested in point #1, above, will help)?</p><p>3) To what extent does CUTAC recover the quantitative amount of chromatin accessibility measured by ATAC-seq? Heatmaps suggest the two are highly correlated, as would be expected. It might be useful for readers to see scatterplots that show the correlation in integrated signal near peaks. Note that I would not necessarily expect the correlation to be perfect if there is some specificity for accessible chromatin near H3K4me2/3.</p><p>4) In some parts of the text and Abstract, I came away with the impression that CUTAC involves both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 primary antibodies in the same sample. Based on the main text, however, I think the authors are only using one of these two marks at a time. Please clarify.</p><p>5) In Figure 5, please clarify aspects of the CUTAC experiment that were explored in earlier figures were used. Was it me2 or me3? With or without hexanediol or dimethylformamide?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Henikoff et al. present a modification of CUT&amp;Tag, a method that they developed previously to profile chromatin epitopes genome-wide. Here, they show that CUT&amp;Tag can be applied to profile transcription-couple chromatin accessibility sites by simply altering the salt concentration during tagmentation that changes the biochemical binding preferences of the pA-Tn5 transposase. The authors have creatively shown that this method can be performed at home to yield the same results as when performed in the lab, an interesting feature given the current restrictions on laboratory occupancy. The authors claim that while CUTAC takes longer to perform that ATAC-Seq, it gives better quality data than ATAC-seq based on the variation of ATAC-seq data quality between laboratories. The authors assume that all laboratories that perform ATAC-Seq are equally proficient in the technique and that variation is simply due to the technique itself and not the experimentalist. Therefore, it is unclear if CUTAC is indeed superior to ATAC-Seq. Together with the fact that CUTAC is a very minor modification of CUT&amp;Tag, I am not convinced that it is a sufficient advance to warrant publication as a research tool in e<italic>Life</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Henikoff et al. developed a novel approach for in-situ mapping of transcription-coupled chromatin accessibility. Compared with conventional ATAC-seq, this method displays several unique advantages, including high sensitivity and compatibility with parallel Cut&amp;tag profiling. I am rather enthusiastic about the release of this work. Also it is highly appreciated that the authors already uploaded the detailed protocol to protocol.io. For publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, this work only has several points to be clarified as shown below:</p><p>1) In Figure 1AB, CUT&amp;Tag-direct with different starting nuclei numbers gave very different fragment size distributions. Is there a specific reason for this? How does the input nuclei/cell number affect the genome-wide signals?</p><p>2) For the divergent outputs from CUT&amp;Tag and CUTAC, the manuscript implies that this is due to different Tn5-DNA binding affinities between low and high salt conditions. Is it also possibly due to that the high salt simply broad the space between nearby nucleosomes for more efficient tagmentation?</p><p>3) My major concern for using this approach as a substitution of ATAC-seq is that this method may introduce bias with the use of antibody linked Tn5. Are there enriched H3K4me2 signals in the peaks detected only by H3K4me2 CUTAC compared with peaks detected only by Omni-ATACseq?</p><p>4) Figure 5 is helpful for evaluating technique efficiency and qualities. However, the number of peaks per mapped fragments is affected by the input cell/nuclei number and the library's complexity. It would be great if these comparisons are made based on the same number of input nuclei. This is also helpful for comparing the efficiencies of different approaches. Also, how similar is the CUTAC dataset compared with all other ATAC-seq datasets by correlation analysis?</p><p>5) For the broad application of the technique, it would be great if the authors can compare the library preparation cost per sample between this technique and conventional ATAC-seq.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Efficient chromatin accessibility mapping in situ by nucleosome-tethered tagmentation &quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Regarding H3K4me2 and ATAC-seq, your response and the revised text state &quot;Using an interval equal to average peak width at half-height, 51.3% of CUTAC and 50.0% of Omni-ATAC sites overlap ATAC_ENCODE peaks.&quot; As this was one of the three key requests of the reviewers, the analysis supporting these numbers should be shown, perhaps as additional panel to Figure 4 (ATAC encode peaks) or as a supplementary figure.</p><p>2) In Figure 4F, the estimate of 90% coverage of these sites with CUTAC seems generous based on the heatmap. Could you add a horizontal line to clearly indicate where you believe the cutoff is? Also your response mention that you aligned Omni-seq to these sites but it's not shown in the new figure. The reviewer had specifically asked to compare H3K4me2 positive and negative in Omni-seq and CUT&amp;tag.</p><p>3) Did you submit Table 1?

The same relationship is seen when comparing CUTAC with CUT&amp;Tag for H3K4me2, where the only difference is in the tagmentation buffer (Figure 4C compare left and middle panels). To test whether there is a class of nuclease-accessible chromatin not detected by CUTAC we aligned H3K4me2 CUTAC and Omni-ATAC data over ATAC_ENCODE peaks. Using an interval equal to average peak width at half-height, 51.3% of CUTAC and 50.0% of Omni-ATAC sites overlap ATAC_ENCODE peaks. If there were a class of ATAC_ENCODE peaks not adjacent to H3K4me2, then these would show up as a lower percentage of overlap with CUTAC than with Omni-ATAC. In light of the moderate correlation between CUTAC and Omni-ATAC (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.53, see below), it is likely that technical variation alone can account for the degree of peak overlap we observed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Most of the previous work on this subject was done using DNase-I-seq, however presumably the same signal is true for ATAC-seq?! Assuming ATAC-seq shows the same signal, I am curious to know whether CUTAC data collected using K4me2/3 antibodies shows accessibility near CTCF binding sites. An easy way to get at this would be to center on CTCF sites, and break them into classes which do/ do not contain evidence of either K4me2/3 or transcription using ENCODE data. If a heatmap shows similar signal between ATAC and CUTAC at CTCF sites associated with K3me2/3, but only ATAC shows signal at CTCF sites not associated with these marks, then it implies a degree of specificity for open chromatin near the primary antibody as would be expected from the author's model.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 1 for suggesting this interesting analysis. To rigorously test the assertion that there are CTCF sites that show DNaseI accessibility but lack active histone marks, we used the set of 9403 19-bp CTCF motifs with a DNaseI hypersensitive site in both K562 and HeLa cells collected in an earlier study (Skene and Henikoff, 2015: DOI: 10.7554/<italic>eLife</italic>.09225.001), and aligned Omni-ATAC and H3K4me2 CUTAC and CUT&amp;Tag fragments in heatmaps. We excluded nucleosomal fragments by using only ≤120 bp fragments. We observed that ~90% of the DNaseI hypersensitive CTCF sites were enriched for CUTAC signal relative to flanking regions. This suggests equivalence of the CUTAC and DNaseI hypersensitive CTCF sites, and we have added a new paragraph and new figure panel (Figure 4E) to this section. We also found that the H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag sample showed detectable signal at only ~50% of the CTCF sites. This improvement in detection of CTCF sites by H3K4me2 CUTAC over H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag is further evidence that the H3K4me2 mark on nucleosomes around hypersensitive sites, but is probably too weak to be detected above background in ChIP-seq experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Selecting which open chromatin regions to measure could be an additional, compelling advantage of CUTAC over ATAC-seq. One could imagine, for instance, using CUTAC to find open chromatin near specific kinds of transcriptional co-activators or co-repressors, Pol II, or (possibly) transcription factors. I would imagine there are a range of applications that would benefit from something like this. Is it worth saying more about this? Or do the authors think that more exploration would be required before this could be stated with any certainty (perhaps the analysis suggested in point #1, above, will help)?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and now mention this possibility to close the new paragraph describing the CTCF site comparisons: “This improvement in detection of CTCF sites by H3K4me2 CUTAC over H3K4me2 CUT&amp;Tag illustrates the potential of using ≤120-bp CUTAC fragment data to improve the resolution and sensitivity of transcription factor binding site motif detection.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) To what extent does CUTAC recover the quantitative amount of chromatin accessibility measured by ATAC-seq? Heatmaps suggest the two are highly correlated, as would be expected. It might be useful for readers to see scatterplots that show the correlation in integrated signal near peaks. Note that I would not necessarily expect the correlation to be perfect if there is some specificity for accessible chromatin near H3K4me2/3.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. Below is the requested scatterplot (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.53) on a log<sub>10</sub> scale to capture the 5 order-of-magnitude dynamic range (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We did not detect off-diagonal clusters that would indicate a subset of peaks found by one but not the other dataset. We now include a correlation matrix to more quantitatively illustrate the relationships between the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 CUTAC and ATAC-seq datasets as requested by reviewer 3 (new Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some parts of the text and Abstract, I came away with the impression that CUTAC involves both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 primary antibodies in the same sample. Based on the main text, however, I think the authors are only using one of these two marks at a time. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>Fixed (one at a time).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 5, please clarify aspects of the CUTAC experiment that were explored in earlier figures were used. Was it me2 or me3? With or without hexanediol or dimethylformamide?</p></disp-quote><p>It was H3K4me2 (fixed), but we now provide equivalent data for H3K4me3 showing the peak-narrowing effect of 1,6-hexanediol and corresponding improvements in peak-calling (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Henikoff et al. present a modification of CUT&amp;Tag, a method that they developed previously to profile chromatin epitopes genome-wide. Here, they show that CUT&amp;Tag can be applied to profile transcription-couple chromatin accessibility sites by simply altering the salt concentration during tagmentation that changes the biochemical binding preferences of the pA-Tn5 transposase. The authors have creatively shown that this method can be performed at home to yield the same results as when performed in the lab, an interesting feature given the current restrictions on laboratory occupancy. The authors claim that while CUTAC takes longer to perform that ATAC-Seq, it gives better quality data than ATAC-seq based on the variation of ATAC-seq data quality between laboratories. The authors assume that all laboratories that perform ATAC-Seq are equally proficient in the technique and that variation is simply due to the technique itself and not the experimentalist. Therefore, it is unclear if CUTAC is indeed superior to ATAC-Seq. Together with the fact that CUTAC is a very minor modification of CUT&amp;Tag, I am not convinced that it is a sufficient advance to warrant publication as a research tool in eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>From a user’s perspective, the fact that a minor modification converts a method for mapping specific chromatin features into one for precisely mapping accessibility in the same experiment is a major advantage. As for the question of experimentalist proficiency, we also showed that CUTAC at home outperforms ATAC-seq generated by the ENCODE project their recent <italic>Nature</italic> consortium publication (Moore et al., 2020). The poorest K562 ATAC-seq dataset is from another recent Nature paper (PMID: 32728247, June 2020) performed by the same lab that is listed for generating the ENCODE data (Snyder lab, Stanford). It is hard to attribute this extreme variation in ATAC-seq data quality to experimentalist skill when both the excellent and the poor datasets are from the same expert group published a month apart. To further support our assertion that nucleosome tethering of Tn5 is advantageous over free Tn5 tagmentation, our revision now includes a comparison between CUTAC, an ATAC-seq dataset from my own lab (PMID: 31253573) and one from PMID: 32728249 for human H1 ES cells. We find that CUTAC (FRiP = 0.28) is better than our own ATAC-seq dataset (FRiP = 0.16) and much better than the H1 ATAC-seq dataset from PMID: 32728249 (FRiP = 0.014). To reduce the possibility that readers will overlook our comparisons between CUTAC and ATAC-seq from expert groups, we have promoted the table reporting these statistics from part of a supplement to Table 1 in the main body of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript, Henikoff et al. developed a novel approach for in-situ mapping of transcription-coupled chromatin accessibility. Compared with conventional ATAC-seq, this method displays several unique advantages, including high sensitivity and compatibility with parallel Cut&amp;tag profiling. I am rather enthusiastic about the release of this work. Also it is highly appreciated that the authors already uploaded the detailed protocol to protocol.io. For publication in eLife, this work only has several points to be clarified as shown below:</p><p>1) In Figure 1AB, CUT&amp;Tag-direct with different starting nuclei numbers gave very different fragment size distributions. Is there a specific reason for this? How does the input nuclei/cell number affect the genome-wide signals?</p></disp-quote><p>To explain this difference, we added the following sentence to the Figure 1 legend: “The higher yield of smaller fragments with decreasing cell number suggests that reducing the total available binding sites increases the binding of antibody and/or pAG-Tn5 in limiting amounts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the divergent outputs from CUT&amp;Tag and CUTAC, the manuscript implies that this is due to different Tn5-DNA binding affinities between low and high salt conditions. Is it also possibly due to that the high salt simply broad the space between nearby nucleosomes for more efficient tagmentation?</p></disp-quote><p>No, because the CUTAC signal is centered over annotated NDRs, not over nucleosomes marked by H3K4me2. To better illustrate that the shift is due to low-salt tagmentation and not to mobility of marked nucleosomes with 300 mM NaCl, we show that the mapping of H3K4me2 by CUT&amp;Tag is similar to mapping by ENCODE ChIP-seq where no such mobility is possible. We now make this point in the text and in the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) My major concern for using this approach as a substitution of ATAC-seq is that this method may introduce bias with the use of antibody linked Tn5. Are there enriched H3K4me2 signals in the peaks detected only by H3K4me2 CUTAC compared with peaks detected only by Omni-ATACseq?</p></disp-quote><p>This point was raised by reviewer 1 and clarified above, including the new analysis showing CUTAC detection of ~90% of annotated DNaseI hypersensitive CTCF sites (new Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5 is helpful for evaluating technique efficiency and qualities. However, the number of peaks per mapped fragments is affected by the input cell/nuclei number and the library's complexity. It would be great if these comparisons are made based on the same number of input nuclei. This is also helpful for comparing the efficiencies of different approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>This issue is addressed in the expanded Figure 3—figure supplement 1, where we have compared nuclei from 30,000 cells for CUTUC using each of the three tagmentation variations to ATAC-seq with 50,000 nuclei and show the estimated size of each CUTAC library produced.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, how similar is the CUTAC dataset compared with all other ATAC-seq datasets by correlation analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>As described in response to reviewer 1, we now include a representative scatterplot and a correlation matrix (shown above) to more quantitatively illustrate the relationships between the H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 CUTAC and ATAC-seq datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For the broad application of the technique, it would be great if the authors can compare the library preparation cost per sample between this technique and conventional ATAC-seq.</p></disp-quote><p>For each CUTAC sample in a 32-sample experiment over an 8 hour day (all CUTAC@home experiments were done on this scale) we used 0.25 µL primary and 0.25 µL secondary antibody (at 1:100) and ~$10 for Epicypher pAG-Tn5 per 25 µL incubation volume, twice that for 50 µL sample volumes. Other materials, such as Concanavalin A and SPRI paramagnetic beads (~$1 per sample for both), pipette tips (~$1 per sample) and reagents increase the cost of library preparation to perhaps $15 per sample. Based on an ATAC-seq experiment from my lab (Meers et al., Mol Cell, 2019, PMID: 31253573), the cost of materials is similar, and both procedures would take about a full day if on the same scale starting with nuclei and finishing with sequencing-ready libraries (Michael Meers, personal communication). The 32-sample scale is typical for several antibodies multiplied by the number of CUT&amp;Tag samples run in parallel with CUTAC, but is probably too high for ATAC-seq. However, the most important cost-differential is the number of sequencing reads that are required to call peaks, and this is where the number of peaks called (sensitivity) and the fraction of reads in peaks (signal-to-noise) make a big difference. For example, we sequenced to a depth of 4.5 million paired-end 25-bp reads for our published H1 ES cell ATAC-seq data (~20,000 peaks with FRiP = 0.16 for 3.2 million fragments), whereas for the H1 ES cell ATAC-seq data from PMID: 32728247 (~450 peaks with FRiP = 0.014 for 3.2 million fragments) the authors sequenced to a depth of 45 million paired-end 100-bp reads. Our in-house sequencing cost per sample was ~$25 per sample, which exceeds the estimated cost of library preparation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Regarding H3K4me2 and ATAC-seq, your response and the revised text state &quot;Using an interval equal to average peak width at half-height, 51.3% of CUTAC and 50.0% of Omni-ATAC sites overlap ATAC_ENCODE peaks.&quot; As this was one of the three key requests of the reviewers, the analysis supporting these numbers should be shown, perhaps as additional panel to Figure 4 (ATAC encode peaks) or as a supplementary figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added Figure 4—figure supplement 2 with heatmaps centered over the ATAC_ENCODE peaks made from each of the data files used for the Figure 4 heatmaps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 4F, the estimate of 90% coverage of these sites with CUTAC seems generous based on the heatmap.
