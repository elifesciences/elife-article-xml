Asm hydrolyzes sphingomyelin to ceramide, which is further metabolized to sphingosine by Ac. Ceramide generates ceramide-enriched platforms that are involved in receptor clustering within cellular membranes. However, the impact of cell-intrinsic ceramide on T cell function is not well characterized. By using T cell-specific Asm- or Ac-deficient mice, with reduced or elevated ceramide levels in T cells, we identified ceramide to play a crucial role in T cell function in vitro and in vivo. T cell-specific ablation of Asm in <italic>Smpd1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> (Asm/CD4cre) mice resulted in enhanced tumor progression associated with impaired T cell responses, whereas <italic>Asah1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> (Ac/CD4cre) mice showed reduced tumor growth rates and elevated T cell activation compared to the respective controls upon tumor transplantation. Further in vitro analysis revealed that decreased ceramide content supports CD4<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell differentiation and interferes with cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. In contrast, elevated ceramide concentration in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice was associated with enhanced cytotoxic activity. Strikingly, ceramide co-localized with the T cell receptor (TCR) and CD3 in the membrane of stimulated T cells and phosphorylation of TCR signaling molecules was elevated in Ac-deficient T cells. Hence, our results indicate that modulation of ceramide levels, by interfering with the Asm or Ac activity has an effect on T cell differentiation and function and might therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of T cell-dependent diseases such as tumorigenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sphingolipids</kwd><kwd>T cells</kwd><kwd>ceramide</kwd><kwd>melanoma</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Westendorf</surname><given-names>Astrid M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK2098</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Katrin Anne</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cell-intrinsic ceramide concentrations are involved in T cell differentiation and function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sphingolipids are structural components and bioactive molecules of cellular membranes with different functions in cellular processes. One important member of the sphingolipid family is ceramide. Ceramide has the ability to form ceramide-enriched platforms within the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kolesnick et al., 2000</xref>). These microdomains contribute to receptor clustering and other protein interactions and are thereby involved in several signaling pathways and important cellular processes including proliferation, migration, differentiation, and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (Asm) generates ceramide by hydrolyzing sphingomyelin, whereas acid ceramidase (Ac) converts ceramide into sphingosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hannun and Obeid, 2018</xref>). Dysregulations in enzyme activity of the ceramide metabolism can lead to severe diseases. Specifically, mutations in the <italic>SMPD1</italic> gene, encoding for Asm, resulting in loss of or reduced Asm activity, cause the lipid-storage disease Niemann-Pick type A and B (NPD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schuchman and Wasserstein, 2015</xref>). NPD type A patients suffer from severe neuronal symptoms, due to sphingomyelin accumulations in the central nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohno, 1995</xref>). In contrast, elevated Asm activity is associated with the development of major depressive disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kornhuber et al., 2005</xref>). Pharmacological inhibitors of Asm (functional inhibitors of Asm, FIASMA) are therefore used as antidepressant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckmann et al., 2014</xref>). Loss of Ac activity leads to the development of Farber disease (FD). FD patients suffer from arthralgia, hepatosplenomegaly, and a general developmental delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In addition, alterations in the sphingolipid metabolism play an important role in other pathological disorders including different tumor entities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ogretmen and Hannun, 2004</xref>). For instance, Asm-generated ceramide-enriched platforms are crucial for the CD95-mediated induction of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grassmé et al., 2003</xref>). Cancer cells may upregulate Ac expression, leading to reduced ceramide abundance and increased levels of pro-survival lipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S-1-P) and thereby foster their survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morad and Cabot, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flowers et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, targeting of Asm and Ac in experimental cancer therapies has shown anti-tumoral efficacy. For example, ionizing radiation induces the activity of Asm, leading to ceramide generation and apoptosis of cancer cells, but fails to do so in lymphoblasts from NPD patients, which lack Asm activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Santana et al., 1996</xref>). In addition, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mauhin et al., 2021</xref> demonstrated most recently, in a retrospective study, that there was an elevated incidence for cancer in NPD patients. We previously observed an enhanced tumor growth rate of transplanted tumor cells in Asm-deficient mice as compared to wildtype (WT) mice. Investigation of the tumor microvasculature identified apoptosis-resistant endothelial cells in Asm-deficient mice as a driver of elevated tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Barros, 2003</xref>). In various cancer cell lines, Ac facilitates proliferation by the degradation of ceramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Govindarajah et al., 2019</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of Ac has been described to be effective for the treatment of patients suffering from colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sakamoto et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Emphasizing the important role of ceramide in the modulation of tumorigenesis, recent studies by Ghosh et al. provided evidence that the application of exogenous C2 ceramide induces a strong anti-tumor response by increasing frequencies of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> and IFN-γ-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2020</xref>). Among other immune cells, T cells play a crucial role during tumor progression. In melanoma patients, the ratio of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells versus CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment is predictive for the disease outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacobs et al., 2012</xref>). The infiltration of Tregs into the tumor tissue is considered as a critical step during tumorigenesis. We provided evidence that Neuropilin-1, highly expressed by Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bruder et al., 2004</xref>), regulates the migration of Tregs into VEGF-producing tumor tissue accompanied by elevated tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2012</xref>). Depletion of Tregs improved the anti-tumoral immune response of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in colitis-associated colon cancer, emphasizing the important role of the T cell composition in tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pastille et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of immune responses in Asm-deficient mice has shown an impaired cytotoxic activity of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells during LCMV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herz et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Asm has been identified as a negative regulator of Treg development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Asm-deficient or FIASMA-treated mice showed increased numbers of Tregs in comparison to WT animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollmann et al., 2016</xref>). In accordance, we detected lower Treg frequencies in spleens of t-Asm/CD4cre mice, which overexpress Asm specifically in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hose et al., 2019</xref>). In CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, isolated from human peripheral blood, inhibition of Asm led to an impaired T cell receptor (TCR) signal transduction accompanied by reduced T cell proliferation and impaired CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th) cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). The role of Ac in T cell responses is largely unclear. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, several lines of evidence indicate that ceramide metabolism participates in the regulation of T cell responses.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that elevated ceramide concentrations facilitate TCR signaling cascades and determine T cell activation and differentiation in vitro. Strikingly, transplantation of B16-F1 melanoma cells into <italic>Smpd1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> (Asm/CD4cre) or <italic>Asah1<sup>fl/fl</sup>/Cd4<sup>cre/+</sup></italic> (Ac/CD4cre) mice, which exhibit decreased or increased ceramide levels in T cells, respectively, revealed that increased ceramide concentrations improve the anti-tumoral T cell response during melanoma progression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Asm-deficient mice show enhanced tumor growth accompanied by reduced T cell activation</title><p>To analyze the impact of Asm activity on T cell function during tumorigenesis, we transplanted B16-F1 melanoma cells into <italic>Smpd1</italic>-deficient mice (Asm-KO) or control (Asm-WT) littermates.

Subsequently, we analyzed T cell frequencies in tumor draining lymph nodes (dLN) and tumors as well as the activation status of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).

Furthermore, CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs showed a reduced expression of IFN-γ and CD44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating a decreased T cell response in Asm-deficient mice during tumorigenesis.

Therefore, we treated tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice with amitriptyline by daily intraperitoneal(i.p.) injection. Indeed, we detected enhanced tumor progression in amitriptyline-treated mice compared to tumor-bearing mice that received the vehicle. This was accompanied by reduced activation of TILs in terms of IFN-γ and CD44 expression in amitriptyline-treated C57BL/6 mice compared to PBS-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the effect of Asm deficiency on the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg subpopulation in vitro, since we observed elevated frequencies of Tregs in dLN and tumors of tumor-bearing Asm-deficient mice.

Remarkably, depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in Asm-WT mice abolished tumor progression almost completely. Using flow cytometry analysis, we confirmed the successful depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in dLN and tumor tissue and observed an increase of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell frequencies and numbers, which was significantly less pronounced in dLNs and tumors of Asm-KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Strikingly, analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs from Asm-deficient mice revealed reduced expression of activation-associated molecules like IFN-γ, CD44, and granzyme B as compared to Asm-WT mice after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

We identified a correlation between ceramide levels and T cell activity. Reduced ceramide content due to loss of Asm activity triggered Treg induction and interfered with effector T cell responses, whereas elevated ceramide concentrations induced by ablation of Ac expression resulted in enhanced T cell activation. Strikingly, cell-intrinsic ceramide levels also correlated with anti-tumoral immune responses and tumor growth in T cell-specific Asm-deficient or Ac-deficient mice.</p><p>Several studies already described Asm as regulator of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell function and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hollmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>). Well in line, we demonstrated that cell-intrinsic Asm activity determines T cell activation and differentiation. However, the mechanism that triggers Asm activity in T cells is still controversial. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mueller et al., 2014</xref> postulated that CD28 stimulation induces Asm activity in T cells, whereas co-stimulation of CD3 and CD28 does not. In contrast, Asm activation has been described in isolated human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in response to CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>), while Wiese et al. identified CD28 co-stimulation to be required for enhanced human CD4<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg frequencies upon Asm inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wiese et al., 2021</xref>). In accordance, we detected significantly elevated ceramide concentrations upon anti-CD3/anti-CD28 treatment of WT CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which were substantially reduced in Asm-deficient T cells, suggesting that co-stimulation of CD3/CD28 is important for the induction of Asm activity in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.</p><p>Others and we demonstrated that transplantation of melanoma cells into Asm-deficient mice results in accelerated tumor growth.

Moreover, a higher ratio of Tregs to CD8<sup>+</sup> effector T cells correlates with poorer disease outcome in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sato et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angelova et al., 2015</xref>). To dissect whether enhanced Treg frequencies from Asm-deficient mice are responsible for the enhanced tumor growth, we depleted CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor-bearing mice. Interestingly, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion resulted in reduced tumor growth in both Asm-WT and Asm-KO mice. This is in line with studies by Ueha et al., who observed a reduction of tumor growth after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ueha et al., 2015</xref>). However, the tumor growth in Asm-deficient mice was still significantly enhanced compared to WT littermates after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. Subsequent analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells revealed reduced activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from tumor-bearing Asm-deficient mice. These results provide evidence that Asm activity has an impact not only on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets but also on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function during tumorigenesis. A reduced capacity to release cytotoxic granules by antigen-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from LCMV-infected Asm-deficient mice has already been described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herz et al., 2009</xref>. In accordance, we also observed decreased frequencies of granzyme B producing CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs in tumor-bearing Asm-deficient mice, after CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion. Further analysis of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from T cell-specific Asm-deficient mice (Asm/CD4cre) revealed a reduced activation upon stimulation in vitro compared to WT controls. Strikingly, Asm deficiency was associated with a lowered in vitro killing capacity of CD8<sup>+</sup> CTLs, suggesting that the ceramide content could regulate cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function. Indeed, Asm-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with reduced ceramide concentrations showed an impaired granzyme B production. Interestingly, this phenotype could partially be rescued by the addition of C16 ceramide in vitro. Validating the impact of ceramide on CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, we used Ac/CD4cre mice with T cell-specific ablation of Ac expression resulting in increased ceramide concentrations in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Well in line with results from Asm-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we demonstrated, at least to our knowledge, for the first time, that Ac-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells show increased granzyme B expression upon stimulation and importantly, elevated in vitro killing activity. This phenotype correlated with a facilitated anti-tumoral T cell response leading to reduced tumor growth rates in Ac/CD4cre mice transplanted with B16-F1 melanoma cells in contrast to WT littermates. These results indicate that ceramide concentrations may determine T cell activity and function in vitro and in vivo. In previous studies, intracellular S-1-P has been shown to reduce anti-tumor functions of T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chakraborty et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olesch et al., 2020</xref>). To exclude that the modulated anti-tumoral T cell response in Asm/CD4cre and Ac/CD4cre mice, respectively, is caused by altered S-1-P concentrations, we quantified its abundance in CD3/CD28 stimulated T cells. However, S-1-P concentrations were under the detection limit of 0.5 pmol per 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells (data not shown), emphasizing that indeed ceramide is more likely to modulate the anti-tumoral T cell response than S-1-P levels.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that ablation of Ac in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice led to a facilitated phosphorylation of ZAP-70 and PLCγ suggesting that ceramide, most likely as ceramide-enriched platforms in the plasma membrane, modulates the TCR signaling pathway. In accordance Bai and colleagues observed reduced phosphorylation of different TCR signaling molecules in stimulated human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of the Asm inhibitor imipramine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bai et al., 2015</xref>), further suggesting that TCR signaling is affected by ceramide. In addition, one might speculate about a positive feedback regulation between ceramide and T cell activation since TCR stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells resulted in elevated ceramide concentration, which in turn seems to strengthen the TCR signaling cascade.</p><p>By using fluorescence microscopy, we were able to reveal a co-localization of ceramide and TCR in stimulated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Strikingly, synaptic ceramide in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac/CD4cre mice was highly elevated compared to that of Asm-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. These results indicate that Asm and Ac activity in T cells not only effect the overall cellular ceramide content but also ceramide levels within the immunological synapse, supporting our hypothesis that the ceramide level is involved in the strength of TCR-induced signaling pathway. Although our results clearly demonstrated the impact of Asm and Ac activity on the ceramide content and T cell function, we could not exclude that other enzymes of the sphingolipid pathways may contribute to increased or decreased ceramide levels. For instance, ceramide could also be synthesized by the neutral sphingomyelinase 2, which was proposed to be required for the immune synapse polarization of TCR signaling components in human Jurkat T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Börtlein et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, blocking its enzymatic activity interferes with the polarized release of exosomes from multivesicular bodies produced by T cell clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mittelbrunn et al., 2011</xref>), emphasizing an important and diverse role of synaptic ceramide in T cell function. However, ablation of Asm resulted in lower cellular and synaptic ceramide levels associated with impaired CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function, suggesting that other sphingomyelinases are not able to fully compensate for Asm deficiency in T cells.</p><p>Overall, our study provides evidence that the cell-intrinsic ceramide content is regulated by the activity of Asm and Ac and associated with CD4<sup>+</sup> as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell function in vitro and in vivo. Thereby, the sphingolipid metabolism represents a potential therapeutic target for improving anti-tumoral T cell responses during tumorigenesis. However, the use of drugs modulating ceramide generating enzymes like amitriptyline or other FIASMAs should be carefully reflected in cancer patients. Nevertheless, genetic engineering of T cells by manipulating the expression of sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes and using them for cancer therapy could be a potential approach for cancer therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>All mice were on C57BL/6 background and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the Animal Facility of University Hospital Essen.

Indeed, we have now analysed S1P levels in Asm- and Ac-deficient T cells. However, S1P concentrations were under detection limit and therefore not included in the revised manuscript, but we included the information about non-detectable S1P levels in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The tumor volume measurements were performed within 13-18 days of post-injection of cells in mice. These studies are too short and need to be evaluated at around 21-30 days to evaluate whether observed defects in T cells are sustained in a time-dependent fashion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that analysis of our experiments at later time points would be interesting to see how T cell responses develop over time. Therefore, we repeated tumor transplantation into Ac<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre mice to evaluate tumor growth and T cell responses over an extended period of time. However, for animal welfare reasons, we again had to sacrifice the mice on day 18 after transplantation since tumors have become too large.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of anti-tumor functions of T cells by ASM versus AC are not very clear. Although TCR signaling is implicated, the mechanistic aspects of the data are weak.</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the clustering of ceramide facilitates the polarization of TCR molecules and thereby foster the intracellular downstream signalling cascade. Indeed, microscopy of T cells revealed a co-localization of TCR β and ceramide upon stimulation with CD3/CD28 MACSiBeads. We have included these new data in Figure 5 of the revised manuscript. Moreover, we could confirm and have included new data on a facilitated phosphorylation of Zap70 in ceramide enriched T cells from Ac<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre mice analysed by Western Blot (Figure 6D of the revised manuscript), suggesting that an increase in ceramide-enriched platforms contribute to elevated TCR clustering and signalling</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The subcellular localization of ceramide in the plasma membrane/TCR synapsis needs to be examined and shown to strengthen the major point of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion. We performed fluorescence microscopy of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated with CD3/CD28 MACSiBead Particles and stained for CD3, TCR β and ceramide. Indeed, ceramide accumulates at the contact site with the particle and co-localizes with CD3 and the TCR. We included representative images in Figure 5 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The effects of ASM or AC deletions on TCR signaling in T cells should be shown by Western blotting and/or immunofluorescence in addition to the flow cytometry-based assays (for detecting p-AKT, pZAP70, and p-PLC (these need to be examined in Figure 2F as in 6B). PKC-theta should be added in this panel also.</p></disp-quote><p>Analysis of phospho-TCR signalling molecules by flow cytometry is a well-established method and has been already been published by us and many other authors (for example, Hose et al., Front Immunol 2019, 10: 1225; Morelli et al., Cell Reports 2020, 30: 3448-65; Hong et al., Cell 2020, 180: 847-61; Balyan et al., Immunology 2018, 156: 384-401). Moreover, reduced phosphorylation of TCR signalling molecules upon Asm inhibition has already been shown by Western Blot analysis in a previous study (Bai, et al., Cell Death Dis. 2015,6(7):e1828.). Nevertheless, as a proof of concept we confirmed our results on elevated p-ZAP70 in Ac-proficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells by western blot analysis as an example and included it in Figure 6 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The list of references contain too many review articles, and it seems that it is missing many recent publications describing the roles and mechanisms of ceramide or S1P in the regulation of anti-tumor functions of T cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this recommendation and have now included more primary and recent publications on the topic in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>Figure 1: Data inconsistency: The tumor growth in control mice varies considerably between experiments (e.g. Figure 1a WT d13 700mm3 vs Figure 1d and WT/PBS d13 200mm3) why is this the case? While the impact of tumor control in Asm deficient mice is overall convincing the analysis of the functional defect of Asm deficient T cells is superficial. Analysis of additional cytokines (TNF, IL2) would be important. IFN needs be depicted as % positive rather than MFI and representative FACS plots would further strengthen the data. Same applies to Ki67 and CD44.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that tumor growth shows variation between the different experiments. One reason for that might be genetic differences between the WT controls used in the experiments. In Figure 1A WT mice are non-transgenic littermates from our in-house AsmKO breeding (AsmKO heterozygous x AsmKO heterozygous), whereas commercial available C57BL/6JOlaHsd mice from Envigo were used for amitriptyline treatment in Figure 1 of the original manuscript, now shown in the Supplemental Figure 1. Data for IFNγ and CD44 are now depicted as % in Figure 1 of the revised manuscript. Examples for representative FACS plots on IFNγ and CD44 expressing TILs are included in Figure 2 and an example for the gating strategy of CD4 and CD8 T cells used for all experiments is shown in Figure 4 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The authors switch between Asm KO to Asm inhibition without providing further explanation (e.g. Figure 2E and F the only use the inhibition model). The authors should clarify this in the text. Could the phenotype of Asm deficiency be rescued by addition of ceramide species in vitro? This could establish a mechanistic link between ceramide abundance and T cell function. Asm and Ac expression should be shown on a protein level (if possible) or at least on an mRNA level over time following activation. (E) intracellular cytokine staining and representative FACS plots would strengthen the data. (F) This data is not convincing. How were pos cells gated given the minimal shift in staining?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for these helpful comments. We agree that switching between Asm KO and Asm inhibition was confusing in the initial manuscript. Moreover, data on the impact of Asm inhibition on CD4 T cells in vitro has already been published by others (Bai et al., Cell Death Dis. 2015,6(7):e1828). Therefore, we have now excluded the in vitro data on Asm inhibition from the revised manuscript. In order to analyse whether the phenotype of Asm deficiency can be rescued by the addition of ceramide, we isolated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells from Asm<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre and WT mice and stimulated them in presence or absence of C16 ceramide and evaluated the expression of granzyme B. Indeed, addition of C16 ceramide partially rescued granzyme B expression of Asm-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The data are included in Figure 3F of the revised manuscript. Using RT-qPCR, we analysed the expression of Asm and Ac in T cells on mRNA level. We included the data in the revised manuscript in Figure 3A for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Supplemental Figure S2 for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from Asm<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre and WT mice and in Figure 6A for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and Supplemental Figure S3 for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from Ac<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre and WT mice. In addition, we now included the gating and FMOs for FACS analysis of TCR signalling in Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure S3 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: The authors should harmonize what they mean by &quot;activation&quot; among figures and use the same markers/molecules in every figure (e.g. IFN not shown in Figure 3, but shown in Figure 1, also applies to Figure 4,5 and 6). Otherwise, the comparison between different figures/conditions/models (e.g. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell depletion) is not feasible. (B) Absolute numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells need to be shown. (c) Ki67 levels should be shown as % positive and supported by representative FACS plots.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these recommendation. Unfortunately, we do not have analysed every marker/ molecule in all different models. However, since the main topic of our study is the impact of the sphingolipid metabolism on cytotoxic T cell function, we now mainly focused on IFNγ and granzyme B expression. Regarding absolute CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers, we agree with the reviewer and included respective data in Figure 2B of the revised manuscript. However, since CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are depleted, we could have only added absolute numbers of the control groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: (B) Gzmb levels should be shown as % positive and supported by representative FACS plots. (C) The proliferation assay shows that the KO and WT cells proliferate similarly once they enter cell cycle. The main difference is that in Asm KO T cells a larger fraction does not enter cell cycle. It would strengthen the manuscript to elucidate why this is the case. The authors should temper their conclusions. Arguing that Asm is &quot;essential&quot; for T cell activation seems exaggerated based on the provided data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these helpful comments. In the revised manuscript we now show granzyme B expression as % and included representative FACS plot (Figure 3E). We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to elucidate why a larger fraction of AsmKO CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not enter the cell cycle. However, the main focus of our study was the impact of the sphingolipid metabolism on T cell responses during tumorigenesis and its cytotoxic activity. Therefore, we have decided to exclude data on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell proliferation from the revised manuscript. We apologize for the exaggerated wording and have carefully adjusted corresponding statements in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5: (A) Absolute CD4, Treg cell and CD8 T cell numbers need to be shown to optimally interpret the data. Parental gating of the FACS plots should be shown/indicated. (B) Cytokine response and Gzmb expression should be shown as % positive rather than MFI. Based on the FACS plot the differences are likely more impressive than the MFIs suggest. (C) tumor growth WT control on d14 about 200mm3, this is not consistent with Figure 1a.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers suggestions and now included absolute numbers and the FACS gating strategy in Figure 4B in the revised manuscript. Moreover, we additionally show % of cytokine and granzyme B expression (Figure 4C). As mentioned above, differences in tumor growth curves are likely due to the use of different WT controls in the individual experiments. Data shown in Figure 1A are from non–transgenic WT littermates of our in-house AsmKO breeding (AsmKO heterozygous x AsmKO heterozygous), whereas WT controls in Figure 4 are littermates of Asm<sup>flox/flox</sup>CD4cre mice that do not express the cre recombinase.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6: Since the paper talks about T cell function in general and since this is a completely new mouse model (Acflox/flox/CD4Cre) and the first time this enzyme has been studied in T cells, the authors should show the phenotype and characterization of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well, and not only CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figures 6A-D). (B) This data is not convincing. How were pos cells gated given the minimal shift in staining? (C) Gzmb should be shown as % positive and representative FACS plots should be added. (E) Tumor growth curve at d18 does not match with the tumor size at day of sacrifize shown in the adjacent bar graph. Absolute numbers of CD4, Treg cells and CD8 T cells in tumors should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for these helpful suggestions. We have now included data on Ac-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in Supplemental Figure S3 of the revised manuscript. As mentioned above, we have added the FACS gating and FMOs plots for the analysis of TCR signalling in the new Figure 6C. Moreover, we now additionally show % of granzyme B-expressing T cells and representative FACS plots in Figure 6E of the revised manuscript. We agree and apologize that the way the tumor size was presented for Ac<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre mice is misleading. Therefore, we have now only included data of mice sacrificed 18 days post transplantation and added absolute numbers of tumor-infiltrating T cells in Figure 7B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Discussion line 496: &quot;the sphingolipid metabolism represents a potential therapeutic target for improving anti-tumoral T cell responses during tumorigenesis&quot;. If would great if the authors speculated more about how this could be done; how could a target inhibition of T cell be achieved? Maybe engineering CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> and Tregs by manipulating the expression of these sphingolipid metabolizing enzymes and using them for tumor therapy could be a potential approach.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now discussed this issue in more details in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1. Authors further argue that TCR signalling is affected in Asm KO and Ac KO cells. Data provided are not fully convincing. First, a strong stimulation by aCD3/aCD28 antibodies is used and in the most cases differences between WT and mutant cells is minor (Figure 2, Figure 6). Indeed, the use of antibodies with high affinity/avidity to the receptors may hide the real impact of changes on early TCR signalling events.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that effects on phosphorylation of TCR signalling molecules seems not to be tremendous, but differences are significant after stimulation with aCD3/aCD28. Although differences in early TCR signalling events might be even stronger after a milder form of stimulation, we decided to use the same stimulation protocol for all of our analysis in the manuscript to make the data comparable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Flow cytometry is used exclusively to show changes in phosphorylation of signalling molecules (ZAP70, Akt, PLCg, p38). Why ZAP70, Akt and PLCg are tested for Ac part and PLCg and p38 in the Asm section? Histograms are shown and the difference between control (WT, positive) and amitriptyline-treated T cells is very subtle. Negative control is not shown. In the graph, authors present % of cells with phosphorylated protein from the total number of protein-positive cells. This value strongly depends on setting of the value, which represents phoshoprotein positivity. For Ac mutant T cells, authors even use relative values in the graphs. Presented histograms again do not show well-distinguishable difference. However, it is unclear why authors use relative % values for data which represent ratiometric values. Presenting all measured and processed values in the Supplementary Data may help to resolve this issue. Still, the changes are small, and I am not sure if altered TCR signalling can explain well-documented effect of ceramide levels on T cell function in vivo and in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree with the reviewers’ opinion and apologize for the measurement of different signalling molecules for the Asm and Ac section. Since the section on Asm inhibition by amitriptyline was rather confusing (see comments of reviewer #2) and the impact of Asm inhibition on TCR signalling has already been shown in detail for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by others (Bai et al., Cell Death Dis. 2015,6(7):e1828) we excluded these data from the revised manuscript. For Ac-deficient T cells we added the FACS gating and FMOs (Figure 6C and Supplemental Figure S3) and performed exemplary western blot analysis for p-ZAP70 (Figure 6D) to further strengthen these data. Moreover, we now present % instead of relative values in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Immunobloting can further support presented flow cytometry data related to TCR-induced signalling (phosphorylation of signalling molecules).</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned above, we additionally performed western blot analysis to support the flow cytometry data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. As described above, the effect on early TCR signalling is inconclusive (in the current form of the manuscript). Please, revise the sentence in the Abstract: 'Mechanistically, our results indicate that ceramide levels, regulated by Asm and Ac activity, correlate with the phosphorylation of TCR signaling molecules in T cells.'It is not clear if authors mean that TCR signalling induces ceramide levels (well-supported by presented data) or that TCR signalling is affected by altered ceramide levels (less-well supported by the data).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that our data provide evidence for an increase in ceramide after TCR activation. Nevertheless, unstimulated T cells deficient for Asm or Ac already showed differences in the ceramide levels (Figure 3B and 6B of the revised manuscript) and our new data provide evidence for co-localization of the TCR and ceramide upon stimulation (Figure 5 of the revised manuscript).</p><p>Therefore, one might speculate about an influence of ceramide levels on TCR signalling, which in turn further affects the ceramide levels. We have carefully rewritten this aspect in the Abstract and discussed this issue in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Ceramide levels: There is dramatic difference between values presented for ceramide in WT cells in Figure 2 and Figure 6. Please, comment on the difference. Adding all relevant numbers into a table would be very useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that ceramide levels of WT cells shown in Figure 2 and Figure 6 of the original manuscript are different. However, ceramide concentration shown in the Figure 2 of the original manuscript derived from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, whereas concentration shown in Figure 6 were measured in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We have now analysed ceramide contents in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells as well as CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from both Asm<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre and Ac<sup>flox/flox</sup>/CD4cre mice included the new data in Figures 3, 6 and Supplemental Figures S2 and S3 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Changes in ceramide levels may influence levels of other lipids, e.g., sphingolipids,</p><p>glycosphingolipids, cholesterol, some specific glycerophospholipids (PS, PI). Do authors have any data about other lipids in Asm and Ac KO cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that analysis of other lipids in AsmKO and AcKO T cells would be interesting. However, the focus of this study was on the effects of Asm deficiency and Ac deficiency on ceramide levels and the resulting phenotypic changes of T cells. Therefore, we do not have analysed other lipids yet. Nevertheless, in response to the suggestion of reviewer #1 we analysed S1P levels of Asm- and Ac-deficient T cells, but concentrations were under detection limit.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1.
