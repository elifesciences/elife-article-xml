fate. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of T-lineage potential in pre-thymic progenitors remain unclear. Here, we established two murine <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient pro-B cell lines, with and without T-lineage potential. The latter expressed lower levels of <italic>Lmo2</italic>; their potential was restored via ectopic expression of <italic>Lmo2</italic>. Conversely, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion of <italic>Lmo2</italic> resulted in the loss of the T-lineage potential. Introduction of <italic>Bcl2</italic> rescued massive cell death of Notch-stimulated pro-B cells without efficient LMO2-driven <italic>Bcl11a</italic> expression but was not sufficient to retain their T-lineage potential. Pro-B cells without T-lineage potential failed to activate <italic>Tcf7</italic> due to DNA methylation; <italic>Tcf7</italic> transduction restored this capacity. Moreover, direct binding of LMO2 to the <italic>Bcl11a</italic> and <italic>Tcf7</italic> loci was observed. Altogether, our results highlight LMO2 as a crucial player in the survival and maintenance of T-lineage potential in T-cell progenitors via the regulation of the expression of <italic>Bcl11a</italic> and <italic>Tcf7</italic>.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Lmo2</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd><kwd>Tcf7</kwd><kwd>T-cell lineage</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into all blood cell types. HSCs begin to differentiate into various lineage cells, gradually losing their potential to become their descendants, hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs), and then differentiate into mature blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doulatov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kosan and Godmann, 2016</xref>). This sequence of processes has long been imagined as a ball rolling down a valley track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goldberg et al., 2007</xref>). Cell fate decisions in hematopoietic cells are controlled by continuous interactions between environmental influences and intrinsic cellular mechanisms, such as transcription factor networks and epigenetic regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the process of specification from HPCs, only the T-cell lineage requires a specialized environment of the thymus, where the immigrant cells receive Notch signaling induced by the interaction of Notch1 on the immigrant cells and a Notch ligand, delta-like 4 (Dll4), on the thymic epithelium, which determines their fate to the T-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Radtke et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hozumi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koch et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, several transcription factors contribute to the acquisition of T-cell identity, including TCF1 (encoded by <italic>Tcf7</italic>), basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) factors, E2A and HEB, PU.1, GATA3, Bcl11b, and Runx family members, all of which are essential for T-cell development in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hosokawa and Rothenberg, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hosokawa et al., 2021a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hosokawa et al., 2021b</xref>). Among them, one of the earliest Notch-activated genes, <italic>Tcf7</italic>, plays a critical role in Notch-mediated initiation of the T-lineage program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). The coordinated action of these environmental and intrinsic factors completes the commitment to T-cell lineage in double-negative (DN; CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup>) thymocytes at the transition from the DN2 to DN3 stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yui and Rothenberg, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hosokawa and Rothenberg, 2021</xref>). However, it remains unclear how the potential of the thymic immigrant cells is maintained to initiate their differentiation program toward the T-cell lineage.</p><p><italic>LMO2</italic> gene is located near the breakpoint of the chromosomal translocation t(11;14) (p13;q11) in human T-ALL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boehm et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Royer-Pokora et al., 1991</xref>), and LMO2 has been thought to function as a bridging factor in large transcriptional complexes with several DNA-binding and adaptor proteins (TAL1/SCL, E2A, GATA1, and Ldb1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wadman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grütz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Omari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Layer et al., 2016</xref>). Although deletion of <italic>Lmo2</italic> in mice causes embryonic lethality due to embryonic erythropoiesis deficiency around 10 days post-fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>), conditional disruption of <italic>Lmo2</italic> in T-lineage committed pro-T stages results in normal T-cell development in the thymus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McCormack et al., 2003</xref>), indicating that LMO2 is dispensable for T-cell development after T-lineage commitment. However, it remains unclear whether LMO2 plays an important role before T-lineage commitment, including the maintenance of T-lineage potential in pre-thymic progenitors.</p><p>It is well known that the recent gene therapy trials using retrovirus-mediated introduction of the common cytokine receptor gamma chain (γc; CD132) in X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (X-SCID) patients resulted in the development of T-cell leukemia due to retroviral insertion at the <italic>LMO2</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howe et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, transgenic overexpression of <italic>Lmo2</italic> in various murine tissues only results in T-cell leukemia, indicating its involvement exclusively in T-cell malignancies when abnormally expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neale et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>Lmo2</italic> is more highly expressed in HSCs and HPCs than in mature blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshida et al., 2019</xref>) and is known to induce reprogramming of HSCs from differentiated blood cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddell et al., 2014</xref>) and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vereide et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that LMO2 actively contributes to the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of HSCs. Consistently, aberrant induction of <italic>Lmo2</italic> in thymocytes generates self-renewing cells that retain the capacity for T-cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCormack et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cleveland et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, it is not clear why <italic>Lmo2</italic> overexpression causes only T-cell malignancies and how LMO2 contributes to the maintenance of an undifferentiated state.</p><p>In attempts to establish HPC lines with T-cell differentiation potential, it has been found that pro-B cells without transcription factors essential for early B-cell development, including Pax5, Ebf1, and E2A (encoded by <italic>Tcf3</italic>), can be maintained in vitro with an HPC-like phenotype, retaining T-cell potential on OP9 stromal cells in the presence of IL-7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nutt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rolink et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pongubala et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, based on their protocol, we established pro-B cell lines, called pro-B(+) cells, that retain T-cell potential on OP9 stromal cells. In contrast, proliferating pro-B cells, named pro-B(−) cells, were also obtained in our originally established thymic stromal cells, TD7, which die abruptly immediately following activation of Dll4-mediated Notch signaling in vitro. Thereafter, we identified <italic>Lmo2</italic> as a gene whose expression is downregulated in pro-B(−) cells compared to pro-B(+) cells and found that the forced expression of <italic>Lmo2</italic> was sufficient for the pro-B(−) cells to reacquire the ability to differentiate into T-cell lineage by Notch signaling. Furthermore, LMO2 ensures survival of pro-B cells through the activation of the Bcl11a/Bcl2 pathway and contributes to maintaining the accessibility of the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus, which is one of the earliest Notch downstream targets in thymic immigrant cells. These epigenetic alterations could be mediated by direct binding of the transcriptional complex, including LMO2, to the target loci. Together with loss-of-function experiments, we demonstrate that LMO2 is significant for maintaining T-cell progenitors for the progression of the T-cell differentiation program initiated by Notch signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LMO2 has a crucial role in the maintenance of T-cell differentiation capacity in <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient pro-B cells</title><p>Using different stromal cells, OP9 and TD7, with fetal liver progenitor cells from <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient mice, we established two types of pro-B cell lines, with and without the ability to differentiate into T-cell lineages designated pro-B(+) and pro-B(−) cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Both the <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient pro-B lines grew robustly on OP9 cells with IL-7, Flt3L, and SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, upper panels) and expressed intermediate levels of B220 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Pro-B(+) cells were able to initiate differentiation into the T-cell lineage, DN2 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>), DN3 (CD25<sup>+</sup>CD44<sup>lo</sup>), and double-positive (DP) stages on Dll4-expressing OP9 (OP9-Dll4) cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lower right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), and mature into CD4 and CD8 T cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pongubala et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, pro-B(−) cells remained in the pro-B cell phenotype (CD25<sup>−</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>int</sup>) and died with Dll4-mediated Notch stimulation, although the expression levels of the Notch receptors were comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To explore their different characteristics at the molecular level, we carried out comparative microarray analysis and identified the differentially expressed genes between pro-B(+) and pro-B(−) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

LMO2 directly binds to its target loci and enables the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus to achieve a state that is responsive to T-cell induction following Notch signaling.</p><p>We established our original thymic stromal cell line, TD7, in which HSCs differentiate into CD19<sup>+</sup> B-lineage cells in the presence of IL-7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) or into Thy1<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T-lineage cells upon receiving Notch signaling. To establish pro-B cell lines possessing pluripotency, we cultured HSCs from the fetal liver of <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient mice on TD7 or OP9 stromal cells, which have been reported to establish pro-B cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pongubala et al., 2008</xref>). The pro-B cells derived from cultures with TD7 grew robustly in the presence of IL-7, but abruptly died when Notch signaling is provided, in contrast to the cells from cultures with OP9, which differentiated into DN2/3 stages with Notch signaling. The characteristics observed in the former pro-B cells were found to be due to decreased expression of <italic>Lmo2</italic>. These results suggest that TD7 does not support the pluripotency of <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient pro-B cells, leading to loss of LMO2. Although the molecular machinery underlying LMO2 expression in HSCs has not been fully described, it was shown that several cis-regulatory elements around the <italic>Lmo2</italic> locus cooperatively function and ensure the full expression pattern of <italic>Lmo2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landry et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Landry et al., 2009</xref>), which appears to be driven in part by PU.1, TAL1, GATA factors, and LMO2 itself. The culture conditions provided by TD7 may be unable to sustain sufficient expression of these transcription factors. Alternatively, it is possible that TD7 could not support pro-B cells that retained their pluripotency because M-CSF, which is not produced by OP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakano et al., 1994</xref>), promoted the differentiation of HSCs into myeloid cells. In fact, the establishment of pro-B cells on TD7 was accompanied by a prolonged emergence of myeloid marker-positive cells compared to that on OP9, and the remaining pro-B cells lost their pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, HSCs may be depleted by differentiation into the myeloid lineage, resulting in IL-7-dependent proliferation of pro-B cells without pluripotency that express reduced <italic>Lmo2</italic>. In either case, substantial expression of <italic>Lmo2</italic> is critical for the maintenance of pluripotency in <italic>Ebf1</italic>-deficient pro-B cells, which is consistent with the finding that LMO2 is an important factor for the reprogramming of committed blood or mesenchymal cells to the induced HSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vereide et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A remarkable feature of LMO2 is that it only generates T-cell malignancies by abnormal expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Neale et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Curtis and McCormack, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Matthews et al., 2013</xref>). A recent study indicated that LMO2 overexpression induces T-cell malignancies not only at the hematopoietic undifferentiated stages, but also after differentiation to B-lineage cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García‐Ramírez et al., 2018</xref>). However, the strong association between LMO2 and T-cell malignancy is not well understood at the molecular level. We showed here that LMO2 plays an important role in maintaining the chromatin structure of the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus in an accessible state necessary for Notch signaling-mediated activation of <italic>Tcf7</italic>. The expression of <italic>Tcf7</italic> is highly specific to the T-cell lineage among hematopoietic cells, and TCF1 is important for initiating the epigenetic identity of the T-cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it can be inferred that, as the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus remains in an accessible state in HPCs or lineage-committed cells with ectopic LMO2 expression, they efficiently differentiate into T-lineage cells and selectively develop T-cell malignancy. In addition, TCF1 forms a complex with β-catenin, which contributes to the development of T-cell malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bigas et al., 2020</xref>). Although the contribution of the β-catenin/TCF1 complex in normal T-cell development remains unclear, the complex, together with RAG molecules, induces various genetic instabilities including those in the <italic>Myc</italic> gene in immature T cells and causes <italic>Myc</italic> gene-targeted tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dose et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gekas et al., 2016</xref>). As TCF1 is also involved in other tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), aberrant expression of LMO2 may promote T-cell malignancy via TCF1.</p><p>Previous reports suggest that LMO2 forms complexes with the bHLH transcription factors, including E2A, Lyl1, and TAL1/SCL, and binds to their target genomic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wadman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grütz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Omari et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Layer et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, in this study, we found that the binding motif for bHLH factors was enriched in LMO2 binding regions in pro-B(+) cells. Thus, LMO2 seems to function along with these bHLH factors in the lymphoid progenitors. In addition, we found that LMO2 directly binds to the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus. Initiation of <italic>Tcf7</italic> expression requires Notch signaling and Runx factors in T-cell progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shin et al., 2021</xref>). Two NICD-RBPJ complex and Runx1 binding sites were found at the −31 and −35 kb upstream regions of the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero-Wolf et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hosokawa et al., 2018</xref>). Among these, the functional importance of the −31 kb region has been previously reported as a Notch-dependent enhancer of <italic>Tcf7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harly et al., 2020</xref>). The LMO2 binding site, identified in this study, overlapped with the other RBPJ binding site, at the −35 kb upstream region. While the physiological role of the −35 kb RBPJ binding site has not been clarified, our data suggest that direct binding of LMO2 to this region in progenitor cells plays an important role in maintaining the accessible chromatin configuration of the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus. In fact, <italic>Lmo2</italic> expression levels were found to be associated with DNA methylation status around the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus and subsequent Notch-mediated activation of <italic>Tcf7</italic> expression. Taken together, in the T-cell progenitor stage, LMO2 acts as a gatekeeper for maintaining the transcriptionally poised chromatin state of the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus via direct binding to the −35 kb region, and guarantees T-cell differentiation potential.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The approach used employs an Ebf1-deficient pro-B cell line system that can be induced to differentiate toward the T cell lineage after receiving strong Notch signaling in vitro. However, a subset of these pro-B cells failed to give rise to T-lineage cells, which was attributed to low levels of Lmo2 expression as compared to the pro-B cells that retain T-lineage differentiation potential. Enforced expression of Lmo2 rescued the defect, which was shown to act by regulating epigenetic changes at the Tcf7 gene locus. However, what remains unclear is whether Lmo2 is required at the start of T-cell lineage differentiation to enable entry into the program, as well as serving to facilitate the elaboration of the program as the cells commit to the T cell lineage. Nevertheless, even without clarity as to the cellular subset or subsets requiring Lmo2 function, the present finds provide a clear rationale for considering Lmo2 as an important player during early T cell differentiation.</p><p>A few concerns, when addressed, would improve the impact of the findings.</p><p>1. It is clear that the proB(-) do not fare well in the Dll4+ cell cultures, and that the proB(+) cells can differentiate and survive well in the Dll4+ cell cultures, however, with only CD44 and CD25 expression as the only indicators of differentiation, and CD44 is expressed on both culture conditions, it would be good to also show an additional T-lineage related marker, e.g., CD90 to further support their differentiation as T cells. Additionally, do the proB(+) cells differentiate to later stages of T cell development, ie., do they eventually express CD3, CD4, CD8 and TCRs?</p><p>2. The results shown in Figure 2 make it seem that in the acute absence of Lmo2 the effect is not in the initiation of T-lineage commitment and early differentiation but rather affecting their progression or transition to later stages. Perhaps the authors should consider this interpretation of their results in the discussion and/or Results section.</p><p>3. The Supplemental Excel file with the microarray results appears to be missed labeled, i.e., reversed heading for ProB(-) vs ProB(+), as the data shown are the opposite to what is summarized in Figure 1.</p><p>4. The survival/death analysis shown in Figure 3, supplement 1, appears to show an increase in cell death in proB(-) cells when cultured on Dll4+ cells, while the ectopic expression of Bcl2 would appear to lessen the number of dying cells. However, if one were to use the ratio of dead cells from Dll4 vs Mock cell cultures (Dll4/Mock) to determine the fold increase in the % of cells dying in each condition, then the number would be as follows: 2x for proB(+); 6.4x for proB(-)/Mock; and 7.3x for proB(-)/Bcl2, which would lead to the conclusion that Bcl2 is not rescuing the cells from dying, and I feel that this is the more likely and correct interpretation of the results. Minimally, the authors should convey this notion in the results.</p><p>5. In Figure 4c, the results are quite striking and beautifully demonstrate that ectopic expression TCF1 in proB(-)/Bcl2 cells enables their ability to differentiate into CD25+ cells. However, it is not clear whether this would require Dll4-dependent signals as the Mock cell cultures are not shown. The authors should include this experiment, as it provides insights as to the requirement for Notch signaling in cells that have enforced TCF1 expression, which have been shown by the Bhandoola lab and others.</p><p>6. Lastly, some of the discussion statements, in page 18, which argue for a role for Lmo2 in prethymic progenitors are not fully backed by the results presented in the paper, as prethymic progenitors were not examined, these conclusions should be tempered as possible rather as having been shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Hirano et al. investigate the mechanisms that maintain T cell potential in pre-thymic lymphoid precursors. The authors establish a new stromal cell lines from fetal thymus, called TD7. They use this cell line to establish an Ebf1-deficient pro-B cell line (called pro-B(-)), using a protocol similar to the one previously described to generate Ebf1-deficient pro-B cells using the well-established OP9 stromal cell line (called pro-B(+)). Surprisingly, they find that unlike pro-B(+), pro-B(-) fail to engage toward the T cells lineage in response to Notch signaling. To understand this puzzling difference, they transcriptionally profile the two pro-B cell lines, and find that the transcription factor Lmo2 is expressed at lower level on pro-B(-) compared to pro-B(+). They propose that Lmo2 plays important functions to enable expression of the transcription factor TCF-1 in response to Notch signaling (encoded by Tcf7). To support this model, they notably show that Lmo2 overexpression rescues the T cell potential of pro-B(-), and conversely, Lmo2 loss of function restrain the T cell potential of pro-B(+). Importantly, they show that TCF-1 ectopic expression rescue the T cell potential of pro-B(-). They propose that Lmo2 may play key functions in maintaining T cell potential in pre-thymic T cell precursors.</p><p>In this elegant study, the authors provide a detailed characterization of the effect of ectopically expressing or deleting Lmo2 on transcription and epigenetics in Ebf1-deficient B cell lines, and their differentiation toward the T cell lineage. The results provided likely have an important impact for our understanding of the mechanisms driving the development of Lmo2-induced T cell leukemia. However, it is unclear whether this model also apply to normal hematopoiesis.</p><p>I believe that this very interesting study would be greatly strengthened and its impact increased if the authors could address the following points:</p><p>1) The novel TD7 stromal cell line and the pro-B cells generated on this cell line are poorly characterized. The authors state that &quot;We established our original thymic stromal cell line, TD7, in which HSCs differentiate into CD19<sup>+</sup> B-lineage cells in the presence of IL-7 or into Thy1+CD25+ T lineage cells upon receiving Notch signaling.&quot;, &quot;the establishment of pro-B cells on TD7 was accompanied by a prolonged emergence of myeloid marker-positive cells compared to that on OP9, and the remaining pro-B cells lost their pluripotency&quot;. However, this data is shown. The careful characterization of the cells generated on TD7 would be very valuable for the readers, and key to properly interpret the data presented in the manuscript. It is presently unclear how the pro-B(-) are related to pro-B cells. The authors mention that pro-B(-) cells express B220 but this is not shown. B220 expression should be shown on both pro-B cell lines. Also, from the microarray analysis, a huge number of genes is differentially expressed between the Pro-B(+) and the por-B(-) cell lines (4000 are different by more than 2 fold. This could perhaps be discussed.</p><p>2) The quantification of absolute cell numbers should be shown in all culture experiments in addition of the frequency of T and B-lineage cells. This is would help understand whether Lmo2 has effects on differentiation, proliferation, or cell death. The authors state that both cell lines grow robustly on OP9, and that the pro-B(-) cells dies in the presence of Notch ligands. However, this is not shown. Quantification of absolute cell numbers, proliferation (e.g. CFSE dilution) and cell death (e.g. Annexin staining) of the cell line should be shown in both conditions in Figure 1. Of note, Figure S3 suggests that both cell lines die on OP9Dl4. Is that correct?</p><p>3) As the authors state, it remains unclear whether Lmo2 plays an important role before T-lineage commitment. This would greatly increase the impact of the manuscript if the authors could investigate this key point. For example, they could use CRISPR mediated deletion of Lmo2 in hematopoietic precursors (as they do in pro-B cells) and investigate their ability to generate T cells on OP9Dl4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) This is a review of 'Lmo2 is essential to maintain the ability of progenitors to differentiate into T-cell lineage'.</p><p>The study by Hirano et al. addresses the mechanisms that reinforce the T-lineage potential at the B versus T-lineage branching, which is clearly dependent on NOTCH1 signaling. The authors took a genetic approach using Ebf1-deficient pro-B cells and exploited niche-based assays in which cells were either co-cultured on OP9 stromal cells or OP9-DL4 expressing the NOTCH1 ligand to isolate two Pro-B cell lines, Pro-B(+) cells and Pro-B(-) cells with and without T-lineage potential, respectively. An unbiased approach using global analysis of differentially expressed genes led to three candidates that, upon ectopic expression in Pro-B(-) cells, were either toxic or did not confer T-potential. The authors next took a hypothesis-driven approach based on LMO2 which is a major oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and has been shown to reprogram differentiated blood cells or fibroblasts into hemopoietic stem cells. Upon finding that Lmo2 was more highly expressed in Pro-B(+), they either overexpressed Lmo2 in Pro-B(-) cells or deleted Lmo2 in Pro-B(+) cells via CRISPR-Cas9 to demonstrate a role for Lmo2 in conferring or maintaining the T-lineage potential. Mechanistically, Lmo2 is required for cell survival via the Bcl11a/Bcl2 axis while driving the T-lineage potential via Tcf7. Interestingly, Tcf7 together with Bcl2 are sufficient to confer T-lineage potential to pro-B(-) cells. Finally, LMO2 binds the upstream enhancer of the Tcf7 locus and controls the methylation status of the CpG island near the transcription start site of Tcf7 to secure a transcriptionally poised chromatin state required for NOTCH1 responsiveness.</p><p>2) The extensive genetic approach together with well-defined niche-based assays for quantitative assessments of gene function represent the major strength of the present study. The kinetics of cell survival and cell surface expression on OP9 stromal cells versus OP9-DL4 allowed for a clear measure of cellular response to NOTCH1 signaling with regards to T-lineage differentiation. While there is a clear phenotypic difference between Pro-B(+) and Pro-B(-) cells on DL4, data illustrated in Figure 1A indicate that Pro-B(+) cells are mostly at the DN2 stage is response to DL4 exposure. Similarly, overexpression of LMO2 in Pro-B(-) cells allows these cells to progress to the DN2 stage, not DN3 (Figure 1D). The evidence that Pro-B(+) cells progress to the DN3 stage as stated by the authors for data shown in Figure 1A remains to be documented. In addition to surface markers, molecular evidence for Trb gene rearrangement, Ptcra or Trgv3 expression would more convincingly support the proposition that these cells have indeed progressed to the DN3 stage.</p><p>3) The combination of unbiased identification of differentially expressed genes and of a hypothesis-driven approach is interesting and led to the identification of Lmo2 as driver gene and of Tcf7 as the target effector gene that determines NOTCH1 response. The microarray data served the purpose of identifying genes that are differentially expressed between Pro-B(+) and Pro-B(-) cells. Nonetheless, the selection of three genes for functional validation within this gene set was guided by previous knowledge on gene function. A more global and complementary approach by gene set enrichment analysis or principal component analysis with control cell types would have provided further insight on cell stage (ProT, ETP, DN2, ProB, etc) and would have brought to the authors' attention that column headings pertaining to Pro-B(+) and (-) were inadvertently swapped in Supplementary File 1. Nonetheless, the confirmatory RT-PCR shown in Figure 1B and 3A are consistent with the text and the conclusions.</p><p>4) Another question that arises from closer look at the microarray data as reported in Supplementary File 1 is the 643 fold difference in Xist gene expression between Pro-B(-) and pro-B(+) cells. 'This gene is expressed exclusively from the XIC of the inactive X chromosome' (IMMGEN) raising the concern that some of the differences within the differentially expressed gene set could inadvertently be due to male/female differences. The origin of these two cell lines with regards to the age and sex of donor mice should be clarified and discussed in the context of the observed data.</p><p>5) It is interesting that enrichment analysis with HOMER of DNA motifs that are associated with LMO2 peaks are RUNX, ETS and bHLH consensus binding sites. While HOMER may associate common transcription factors to these motifs as illustrated in Figure 6A, a previous genome-wide study of a transcription factor heptad in hematopoietic progenitor cells would be more relevant to the current study (PMID: 20887958 – DOI: 10.1016/j.stem.2010.07.016.) That LMO2 peaks in the present study overlaps with the same three DNA motifs found in a previous study in which LM02 is described as part of a transcription factor heptad that includes RUNX1, TAL1/SCL and LYL1 as bHLH factors, and two ETS family members underlines the quality of the ChIP-seq data reported here. Second, it would be interesting to address the question whether the same motifs were enriched in the differentially expressed gene set between Pro-B(+) and Pro-B(-) cells, to further consolidate the evidence that the endogenous Lmo2 controls the difference between the two cell lines.</p><p>6) LMO2 is a major oncogene in T-ALL. Nonetheless, LMO2 expression was found to be elevated in a high proportion of diffuse large B cell lymphomas (DLBCL) in which LMO2 regulates genes implicated in kinetochore function, chromosome assembly, and mitosis (PMID: 22517897 – DOI: 10.1182/blood-2012-01-403154). Moreover, Lmo2 expression is also elevated in B cells from normal spleen and lymph nodes as can be quieried in the IMMGEN database. The present study is more likely to reveal Lmo2 and Tcf7 function in the absence of Ebf1 in Pro-B cells. The rescue of Pro-B(-) by Lmo2 for their capacities to survive and progress to the DN2 stage on OP9-DL4 is convincing. To address the consequence of restoring Ebf1 expression in this context would add further insight into the mechanism regulating NOTCH1 response, as well as the combinatorial interaction between cell autonomous transcription factors and signaling pathways that define cell fate.</p><p>1) Nuclear staining for TCF1 and GATA3 shown in Figure 4B is convincing.

How do the authors explain the fact that abolishing LMO2 protein levels on day 4 had no consequence on day 5, when cells were transferred to OP-DL4 for 3 days? That deficient progression to the DN2 stage should be detectable only after 10 days on OP9 plus another 3 days on OP9-DL4 is a very slow response (Figure 2B). The authors conclude on a 'slower time-scale transcriptional changes, including histone modifications, chromatin remodeling, and DNA methylation.'

The approach used employs an Ebf1-deficient pro-B cell line system that can be induced to differentiate toward the T cell lineage after receiving strong Notch signaling in vitro. However, a subset of these pro-B cells failed to give rise to T-lineage cells, which was attributed to low levels of Lmo2 expression as compared to the pro-B cells that retain T-lineage differentiation potential. Enforced expression of Lmo2 rescued the defect, which was shown to act by regulating epigenetic changes at the Tcf7 gene locus. However, what remains unclear is whether Lmo2 is required at the start of T-cell lineage differentiation to enable entry into the program, as well as serving to facilitate the elaboration of the program as the cells commit to the T cell lineage. Nevertheless, even without clarity as to the cellular subset or subsets requiring Lmo2 function, the present finds provide a clear rationale for considering Lmo2 as an important player during early T cell differentiation.</p><p>A few concerns, when addressed, would improve the impact of the findings.</p><p>1. It is clear that the proB(-) do not fare well in the Dll4+ cell cultures, and that the proB(+) cells can differentiate and survive well in the Dll4+ cell cultures, however, with only CD44 and CD25 expression as the only indicators of differentiation, and CD44 is expressed on both culture conditions, it would be good to also show an additional T-lineage related marker, e.g., CD90 to further support their differentiation as T cells. Additionally, do the proB(+) cells differentiate to later stages of T cell development, ie., do they eventually express CD3, CD4, CD8 and TCRs?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this point. In new Figure 1-supplement 1 D and E, we have added results to show the differentiation potential of pro-B(+) cells into DP stage in vitro (D), and mature CD4 and CD8 T cells in vivo (E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The results shown in Figure 2 make it seem that in the acute absence of Lmo2 the effect is not in the initiation of T-lineage commitment and early differentiation but rather affecting their progression or transition to later stages. Perhaps the authors should consider this interpretation of their results in the discussion and/or Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous results, we had used Cas9-GFP<sup>high</sup> pro-B(+) cells to delete <italic>Lmo2</italic>, however, the majority of them died after Notch stimulation, because of toxicity of high Cas9 expression. Thus, we had analyzed minor survived cells for the previous results, and it messed the flow profiles up. To solve this problem, we established pro-B(+) cell lines with intermediate Cas9-GFP expression. We confirmed that <italic>Lmo2</italic>-deficient pro-B(+) cells with intermediate Cas9 expression still had the significantly abrogated T-lineage potential with clearer flow profiles, which strongly supports our conclusion. These results were replaced in new Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The Supplemental Excel file with the microarray results appears to be missed labeled, ie., reversed heading for ProB(-) vs ProB(+), as the data shown are the opposite to what is summarized in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We have fixed the labels in the new Supplemental Excel file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The survival/death analysis shown in Figure 3, supplement 1, appears to show an increase in cell death in proB(-) cells when cultured on Dll4+ cells, while the ectopic expression of Bcl2 would appear to lessen the number of dying cells. However, if one were to use the ratio of dead cells from Dll4 vs Mock cell cultures (Dll4/Mock) to determine the fold increase in the % of cells dying in each condition, then the number would be as follows: 2x for proB(+); 6.4x for proB(-)/Mock; and 7.3x for proB(-)/Bcl2, which would lead to the conclusion that Bcl2 is not rescuing the cells from dying, and I feel that this is the more likely and correct interpretation of the results. Minimally, the authors should convey this notion in the results.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for bringing this up. We have added a graph for % cell death in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, and changed description about this point in the Results section as, ‘Transduction of <italic>Bcl2</italic> significantly protected pro-B(-) cells from cell death, before and after Notch stimulation’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In Figure 4c, the results are quite striking and beautifully demonstrate that ectopic expression TCF1 in proB(-)/Bcl2 cells enables their ability to differentiate into CD25+ cells. However, it is not clear whether this would require Dll4-dependent signals as the Mock cell cultures are not shown. The authors should include this experiment, as it provides insights as to the requirement for Notch signaling in cells that have enforced TCF1 expression, which have been shown by the Bhandoola lab and others.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the important suggestion. In our experimental system, we have not been able to see development of T cells (generation of CD25+ cells) in the TCF1 introduced pro-B(-) cells without Dll4 stimulation. We introduced mouse <italic>Tcf7</italic> using lentivirus, and it would have lower TCF1 expression levels than the retrovirus vector for human <italic>TCF7</italic>, the Bhandoola’s group used. We have included the flow data without Dll4 stimulation (OP9-Mock) in the new Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Lastly, some of the discussion statements, in page 18, which argue for a role for Lmo2 in prethymic progenitors are not fully backed by the results presented in the paper, as prethymic progenitors were not examined, these conclusions should be tempered as possible rather as having been shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and fixed this point in the Summary, Introduction, Result and Discussion sections. We have changed the description in the text from “pre-thymic progenitors” to “T-cell progenitors”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript, Hirano et al. investigate the mechanisms that maintain T cell potential in pre-thymic lymphoid precursors. The authors establish a new stromal cell lines from fetal thymus, called TD7. They use this cell line to establish an Ebf1-deficient pro-B cell line (called pro-B(-)), using a protocol similar to the one previously described to generate Ebf1-deficient pro-B cells using the well-established OP9 stromal cell line (called pro-B(+)). Surprisingly, they find that unlike pro-B(+), pro-B(-) fail to engage toward the T cells lineage in response to Notch signaling. To understand this puzzling difference, they transcriptionally profile the two pro-B cell lines, and find that the transcription factor Lmo2 is expressed at lower level on pro-B(-) compared to pro-B(+). They propose that Lmo2 plays important functions to enable expression of the transcription factor TCF-1 in response to Notch signaling (encoded by Tcf7). To support this model, they notably show that Lmo2 overexpression rescues the T cell potential of pro-B(-), and conversely, Lmo2 loss of function restrain the T cell potential of pro-B(+). Importantly, they show that TCF-1 ectopic expression rescue the T cell potential of pro-B(-). They propose that Lmo2 may play key functions in maintaining T cell potential in pre-thymic T cell precursors.</p><p>In this elegant study, the authors provide a detailed characterization of the effect of ectopically expressing or deleting Lmo2 on transcription and epigenetics in Ebf1-deficient B cell lines, and their differentiation toward the T cell lineage. The results provided likely have an important impact for our understanding of the mechanisms driving the development of Lmo2-induced T cell leukemia. However, it is unclear whether this model also apply to normal hematopoiesis.</p><p>I believe that this very interesting study would be greatly strengthened and its impact increased if the authors could address the following points:</p><p>1) The novel TD7 stromal cell line and the pro-B cells generated on this cell line are poorly characterized. The authors state that &quot;We established our original thymic stromal cell line, TD7, in which HSCs differentiate into CD19<sup>+</sup> B-lineage cells in the presence of IL-7 or into Thy1+CD25+ T lineage cells upon receiving Notch signaling.&quot;, &quot;the establishment of pro-B cells on TD7 was accompanied by a prolonged emergence of myeloid marker-positive cells compared to that on OP9, and the remaining pro-B cells lost their pluripotency&quot;. However, this data is shown. The careful characterization of the cells generated on TD7 would be very valuable for the readers, and key to properly interpret the data presented in the manuscript. It is presently unclear how the pro-B(-) are related to pro-B cells. The authors mention that pro-B(-) cells express B220 but this is not shown. B220 expression should be shown on both pro-B cell lines. Also, from the microarray analysis, a huge number of genes is differentially expressed between the Pro-B(+) and the por-B(-) cell lines (4000 are different by more than 2 fold. This could perhaps be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the encouragement to clarify this point. We showed that TD7 is able to support B cell differentiation, higher % of lineage marker-positive cells from FL progenitors is generated on TD7, and expression levels of B220 in pro-B(-) and (+) cells in the new Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B and C. We have also analyzed differentially expressed genes in pro-B(+) and pro-B(-) cells, and found that these genes were enriched for genes related to ‘Hematopoietic cell lineage’ in KEGG pathway analysis. We have added this new results in the Figure 1—figure supplement 1G and described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The quantification of absolute cell numbers should be shown in all culture experiments in addition of the frequency of T and B-lineage cells. This is would help understand whether Lmo2 has effects on differentiation, proliferation, or cell death. The authors state that both cell lines grow robustly on OP9, and that the pro-B(-) cells dies in the presence of Notch ligands. However, this is not shown. Quantification of absolute cell numbers, proliferation (e.g. CFSE dilution) and cell death (e.g. Annexin staining) of the cell line should be shown in both conditions in Figure 1. Of note, Figure S3 suggests that both cell lines die on OP9Dl4. Is that correct?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. Absolute cell numbers are totally dependent on the input cell numbers, thus we indicated numbers of CD25+ cells as fold expansion (/input cell number) in Figure 1A and D. We also show absolute numbers of CD25+ cells in Lmo2 -deficient pro-B(+)cells in Figure 2B.</p><p>Both pro-B(-) and pro-B(+) cells have slower proliferation with more dead cells after Notch stimulation. Thus, you are right, both cell lines die on OP9-Dll4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As the authors state, it remains unclear whether Lmo2 plays an important role before T-lineage commitment. This would greatly increase the impact of the manuscript if the authors could investigate this key point. For example, they could use CRISPR mediated deletion of Lmo2 in hematopoietic precursors (as they do in pro-B cells) and investigate their ability to generate T cells on OP9Dl4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for the suggestion. We have performed experiments as the reviewer suggested. Hematopoietic progenitor cells from BM of Cas9 knock-in mouse were transduced with sgLmo2, and they were cultured without OP9 for two days (if we culture them with OP9-Mock, they will differentiate into B-lineage). Then, they were transferred onto a OP9-Dll1 monolayer and cultured for 4 days. However, the sgLmo2-introduced progenitors were able to differentiate into DN2 stage, as new Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and B. Our results using pro-B(+) with acute deletion of <italic>Lmo2</italic> indicate that the loss of Lmo2 induces formation of closed chromatin structure at the <italic>Tcf7</italic> locus, but it would take ~10 days. In our knowledge, it is really difficult to maintain sgLmo2-introduced hematopoietic precursors in vitro for 10 days before Notch stimulation.
