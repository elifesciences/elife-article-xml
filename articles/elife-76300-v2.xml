id="abs1"><title>Background:</title><p>Multicentric approaches are widely used in clinical trials to assess the generalizability of findings, however, they are novel in laboratory-based experimentation. It is unclear how multilaboratory studies may differ in conduct and results from single lab studies. Here, we synthesized the characteristics of these studies and quantitatively compared their outcomes to those generated by single laboratory studies.</p></sec><sec id="abs2"><title>Methods:</title><p>MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched. Screening and data extractions were completed in duplicate by independent reviewers. Multilaboratory studies investigating interventions using in vivo animal models were included. Study characteristics were extracted. Systematic searches were then performed to identify single lab studies matched by intervention and disease. Difference in standardized mean differences (DSMD) was then calculated across studies to assess differences in effect estimates based on study design (&gt;0 indicates larger effects in single lab studies).</p></sec><sec id="abs3"><title>Results:</title><p>Sixteen multilaboratory studies met inclusion criteria and were matched to 100 single lab studies. The multicenter study design was applied across a diverse range of diseases, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, myocardial infarction, and diabetes. The median number of centers was four (range 2â6) and the median sample size was 111 (range 23â384) with rodents most frequently used. Multilaboratory studies adhered to practices that reduce the risk of bias significantly more often than single lab studies. Multilaboratory studies also demonstrated significantly smaller effect sizes than single lab studies (DSMD 0.72 [95% confidence interval 0.43â1]).</p></sec><sec id="abs4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Multilaboratory studies demonstrate trends that have been well recognized in clinical research (i.e. smaller treatment effects with multicentric evaluation and greater rigor in study design). This approach may provide a method to robustly assess interventions and the generalizability of findings between laboratories.</p></sec><sec id="abs5"><title>Funding:</title><p>uOttawa Junior Clinical Research Chair; The Ottawa Hospital Anesthesia Alternate Funds Association; Canadian Anesthesia Research Foundation; Government of Ontario Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multilaboratory</kwd><kwd>multicenter</kwd><kwd>metaresearch</kwd><kwd>reproducibility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>QEII Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hunniford</surname><given-names>Victoria T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007481</institution-id><institution>Canadian Anesthesia Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Scientist Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lalu</surname><given-names>Manoj M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Preclinical multilaboratory studies are a robust method to assess promising interventions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The impact of preclinical research using animal models is conditional on its scientific validity, reproducibility, and representation of human physiology and condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chalmers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">van der Worp et al., 2010</xref>). Improving the quality of the design, conduct, and reporting of preclinical studies may lead to a reduction in research waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chalmers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ioannidis et al., 2014</xref>), as well as increase their utility in informing the development of novel therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Begley and Ellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langley et al., 2017</xref>). One method to do so may be the application of multicenter experimentation in preclinical studies. This is analogous to what is done in clinical trials where positive findings from a single center study are usually evaluated and confirmed in a multicenter study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chamuleau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellomo et al., 2009</xref>). Multicenter studies allow for the comparison of effects between centers, which provides insight into the generalizability of effects across institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cheng et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, they inherently test reproducibility while also increasing efficiency in attaining sufficient sample sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bath et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, rigorously designed and reported multicenter studies may enhance the confidence in study findings and increase transparency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maertens et al., 2017</xref>). This approach has been adopted in other fields such as social and developmental psychology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Visser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumeister et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Multiple calls from the biomedical science community have been made to adopt and apply multicenter study design to preclinical laboratory-based research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chamuleau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maertens et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">OâBrien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boltze et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dirnagl and Fisher, 2012</xref>). Some recent examples have been published that exemplify the successful implementation of this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, multilaboratory studies may offer a method to test issues of reproducibility that have been highlighted by several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Begley and Ellis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>). As interest in preclinical multilaboratory studies grows, and major funders begin to invest in this approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Federal Ministry of Education and Research, 2022</xref>), a systematic evaluation of this method is needed. This will inform and optimize future multicenter preclinical studies by producing a synthesis of current practices and outcomes, while also identifying knowledge gaps and areas for improvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dirnagl and Fisher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Llovera and Liesz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">FernÃ¡ndez-JimÃ©nez and Ibanez, 2015</xref>). Moreover, it is currently unknown how the results obtained from a preclinical multilaboratory study compare to a preclinical study conducted in a single laboratory. This comparison is of interest as multiple <italic>clinical</italic> meta-epidemiological studies have shown that single center clinical trials have a higher risk of bias and overestimate treatment effects compared to multicenter trials (i.e. smaller clinical trials at single sites have a higher probability of methodological shortcomings, lower inferential strength, and may provide inaccurately high estimates of treatment effects) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Unverzagt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dechartres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bafeta et al., 2012</xref>). For this reason, results from single center studies are generally used cautiously for clinical decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellomo et al., 2009</xref>). Currently, there has been no empirical investigation into whether this trend occurs in the preclinical domain. This knowledge would provide greater insight into the potential value of the multilaboratory design in preclinical research.</p><p>The first objective of this systematic review was to identify, assess, and synthesize the current preclinical multilaboratory study literature.

Features that met the âmulticenterâ criteria included: shared design, specific hypothesis, a priori protocol, animal model, intervention protocol, method of analysis, primary endpoints tested with or without identical measurement apparatuses; separate centers for coordination, protocol development, and data analysis; and study objective, timelines, protocols, and dissemination strategies developed a priori. Veterinary clinical trials, in vitro and ex vivo studies (with no in vivo component), and retrospective data analysis from multiple sites were excluded.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Preclinical multilaboratory search strategy</title><p>The search strategy was developed in collaboration with our instituteâs information specialist (Risa Shorr MLS, The Ottawa Hospital). Embase (Embase Classic and Embase), and MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Medline Daily and Ovid Medline) were searched (last updated November 25, 2020). A second, independent librarian peer-reviewed the search strategy according to the Peer Review of Electronic Search Strategy (PRESS) framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGowan et al., 2016</xref>).

The âother sourcesâ of risk of bias domain was divided into four sub-domains (funding influences, conflicts of interest, contamination, and unit of analysis errors). An overall âotherâ risk of bias assessment was given based on the following: overall high risk of bias if one or more of the four other sources were assessed as high; overall unclear risk of bias if two or more of the four other sources were assessed as unclear (and no high risk); and overall low risk of bias if three of the four other sources were assessed as low (and no high risk).</p><p>Completeness of reporting of the multilaboratory studies was assessed using a checklist modified from various sources: consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moher et al., 2010</xref>); the National Institutes of Health (NIH)âs principles and guidelines for reporting preclinical research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; and the Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidance Document: E6(R2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Health Canada, 2016</xref>).

Search strategies using the eligibility criteria outlined above were developed with our instituteâs information specialist. The references of previous single lab studies cited in the multilaboratory studies were retrieved and used to refine the searches. The database MEDLINE (Ovid MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process &amp; Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid Medline Daily, and Ovid Medline) was searched from inception (1946). A validated animal filter limited results to animal studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hooijmans et al., 2010</xref>).

Given the large number of searches required, we chose to compare a maximum of 10 single lab studies for feasibility reasons. If more than 10 eligible studies were equally similar to the multilaboratory study, then 10 were randomly selected using a random-number generator (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.random.org/">https://www.random.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>Data from the eligible single lab studies were extracted by one reviewer (VTH) and audited by a second reviewer (JM).

Extracted data included: the first author, year of publication, the quantitative outcome data along with the measures of variation (e.g. means, standard error/deviation, and sample size) for the shared outcome with the multilaboratory study, the animal species and sex, the study sample sizes (intervention and control groups). Numerical data were extracted from reported study data or using Engauge Digitizer if data was presented in a graphical format.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Data analysis</title><sec id="s2-9-1"><title>Multilaboratory and single lab study quality</title><p>Study quality for both multilaboratory and single lab studies was assessed by one reviewer (VTH) and confirmed by a second (JM); disagreements were resolved by consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jadad et al., 1996</xref>). Specifically, for each study, we evaluated five key practices that are recognized to reduce bias in laboratory experiments: randomization to treatment groups, low risk of bias methods of randomization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Reynolds and Garvan, 2021</xref>), blinding of personnel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">OâConnor and Sargeant, 2014</xref>), blinding of outcome assessor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Macleod et al., 2008</xref>), and complete reporting of all outcome data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holman et al., 2016</xref>). Each practice was assessed as â0â for not performed/reported, or a â1â for having performed the practice. We used a Mann-Whitney U test to compare the total quality estimates between multilaboratory and single lab studies. We did not individually compare the five key practices between multilaboratory and single lab studies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Statistical analysis - effect size comparison</title><p>The multilaboratory studyâs effect size (i.e. treatment effect) of their respective primary/shared outcome was compared to the pooled effect size of the corresponding set of single lab studies. We extracted quantitative outcome effect measures and measures of variation from each single lab study (e.g. means, standard error/deviation, and sample size). We used Engauge Digitizer if data was presented in a graphical format. Summary effect sizes (ES) were calculated for the multilaboratory and single lab studies using Comprehensive MetaâAnalysis (version 3; Biostat Inc, USA). The effect size ratio (ESR) for the multilaboratory versus single lab studies was obtained by dividing the single lab summary effect size by the effect size of the corresponding multilaboratory study. This was expressed as a percentage. For each meta-analysis <italic>i</italic>, this was calculated as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>This quantified the difference between the effect size of matched multilaboratory and single lab studies, regardless of the metric used to demonstrate the outcome effect. An ESR of 1 indicates no difference, an ESR greater than 1 indicates single lab studies produce a larger summary effect size compared to multilaboratory studies, and an ESR less than one indicates that the single lab studies produce a smaller summary effect size compared to multilaboratory studies. To obtain a more metric-relevant comparison, and for cases where the single lab studies measure the effect of the same outcome in different ways, we also calculated the difference of standardized mean difference (DSMD). Because all multilaboratory outcomes were continuous, standardized mean differences were calculated using a random effects inverseâvariance model and presented with accompanying 95% confidence intervals. Standardized mean differences were used due to the variety of measurement methods reported for the outcomes of interest. We calculated the standardized mean difference for all single lab studies, collective, and for the multilaboratory study. These values, indicated as d, were used to calculate the DSMD as follows:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="mediummathspace"/><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Synthesis of preclinical multilaboratory qualitative data and assessments</title><p>Descriptive data of the multilaboratory study was synthesized and presented through tabulation of textual elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Popay et al., 2006</xref>).

fell into seven clinical domains: traumatic brain injury (n=6), myocardial infarction (n=2), stroke (n=2), traumatic injury (n=2), effects of stimulants/neuroactive medication (n=2), diabetes (n=1), and autism spectrum disorder (n=1). Twelve of 16 studies were published in 2015â2020. Five studies were international (studies with labs located in multiple countries), and eleven studies were conducted solely in the USA (all labs located in the USA). The median number of total labs involved per multilaboratory study was four (range: 2â6), and the median number of experimental labs performing in vivo work was three (range:2-5). Nine studies (56%) reported having non-experimental centers involved, such as a coordinating center, data processing center, biomarker core, or pathology core. Five different species of animals were used in the studies: rats (n=7), mice (n=6), swine (n=3), rabbits (n=1), and dogs (n=1). One study used three species of animals for their experiments. The median sample size was 111 (range 23â384 animals), and a total of 2145 animals were used across the sixteen studies, 91% of which were lab rodents (mice and rats).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reported preclinical multilaboratory outcomes</title><p>Five of the studies (31%) reported that the treatment showed statistically significant, positive results (i.e. favoring the hypothesis); seven studies reported that the treatment showed non-significant or null results; four studies reported that the results were mixed across different treatment specifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2009</xref>), animal models of the disease of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>), or outcome measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wahlsten et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jha et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Based on their respective results, thirteen studies made explicit statements of recommendations or future directions for the intervention tested. Seven studies stated that they would conduct further testing or recommended that further preclinical testing be done. Four studies indicated they would not continue testing or recommended that no further preclinical testing be done. Three studies recommended to proceed with clinical trials. Brief synopses of the sixteen studies can be found in supporting information (Appendix 1), along with sample statements of their future recommendations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1âtable 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Risk of bias of preclinical multilaboratory studies</title><p>None of the 16 studies (0%) were considered low risk of bias across all ten domains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Fifteen studies randomized animals to experimental groups and four of these reported the method of random sequence generation â one of which used pseudo-randomization methods at one of the participating labs (thus was given a high risk of bias assessment). Thirteen studies had a low risk of detection bias by blinding of outcome assessors. Eleven studies were at low risk of performance bias by blinding personnel administering interventions. All but one study were unclear if animals were randomly housed during the experiments. Six studies from the same research consortium (Operation Brain Trauma Therapy) had a high risk of bias for âother sourcesâ of bias due to potential industry-related influences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The four âother sourcesâ of risk of bias assessments for each study can be found in the supporting information (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table2">Appendix 1âtable 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap

The most frequently reported barrier identified in all five studies was the establishment of a consistent protocol, with attention to exact experimental details across research labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gill et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the challenge of the initial protocol development, studies reported difficulty in labs strictly adhering to the established protocol throughout the entirety of the study. One study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>) had considerable issues in adhering to the protocol, and in effect had to modify its methods through the course of the study.</p><p>Three studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>) reported differences in equipment and resources across labs as a barrier that made it difficult to conduct a collaborative project and to communicate what measurements and endpoints would be assessed. Specific experimental conditions that investigators were unable or unwilling to harmonize across all participating laboratories included animal models of the disease, animal housing conditions, the separate labsâ operating and measurement procedures, equipment, and institutional regulations. There was also inconsistent funding across research labs. Different labs had separate budgets with different amounts of funding that could be allocated to the study. If the protocol was to be harmonized, then it had to be adapted to fit each labâs budget accordingly (e.g. the lab with the smallest budget set the spending limit in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, labs developed a general protocol but adapted it to fit their own respective budget with what resources they had. Of note, recent work has suggested that harmonization reduces between-lab variability, however, systematic heterogenization did not reduce variability further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arroyo-Araujo et al., 2022</xref>); this may suggest that, even in fully harmonized protocols, enough uncontrolled heterogeneity exists that further purposeful heterogenization has little effect. Another barrier identified was ethics approval for animal experiments at all the labs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>). This was especially significant when labs were located in multiple countries, as each country had different regulations for ethical approval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref> suggested collaborative protocol development was facilitated by employing pilot testing through all the labs. Developing a defined experimental protocol also included establishing an agreed-upon timeline, laboratory setup, and method of analysis and measurement. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 1985</xref> suggested that a similar approach might have enhanced the conduct of both of their studies. Another study reported that the use of a centralized core for administration and data processing was a facilitator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref>). The validity of reports depends on the control of statistical and data management, and having one lab coordinate these operations reduces the chances of error or bias in the analysis. Other facilitators were related to the interpersonal aspect of collaboration. These included having investigator leadership through regular conferences and check-ins from the beginning to the end of the project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mondello et al., 2016</xref>) and building upon previously established personal/professional relationships between investigators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multiple calls for the use of multilaboratory study design in preclinical research have been published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">OâBrien et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dirnagl and Fisher, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Llovera and Liesz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">FernÃ¡ndez-JimÃ©nez and Ibanez, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mondello et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we have synthesized characteristics and outcomes from all interventional preclinical multilaboratory studies published in our search period. Our results suggest that this is an emerging, novel, and promising area of research. The sixteen identified multilaboratory studies had investigated a broad range of diseases, promoted collaboration, adopted many methods to reduce bias, and demonstrated high completeness of reporting. In addition, we found that multilaboratory studies had higher methodological rigor than single lab studies, demonstrated by the greater level of implementation of several key practices known to reduce bias. We observed that multilaboratory studies showed significantly smaller intervention effect sizes than matched single lab studies. This approach addresses pressing issues that have been recently highlighted such as reproducibility, transparent reporting, and collaboration with data and resource sharing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Errington et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kane and Kimmelman, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Errington et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>The differences between single and multilaboratory preclinical studies observed here have also been noted in clinical studies. Several comparisons between clinical single-and multilaboratory RCTs have been performed, all finding that single center RCTs demonstrate larger effect sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bellomo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Unverzagt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dechartres et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bafeta et al., 2012</xref>). These studies also found that multicenter clinical RCTs had larger sample sizes and greater adherence to practices such as allocation concealment, randomization, and blinding. This difference in sample size and methodological quality, which we have also observed, may explain the discrepancy in effect sizes. It has been shown that smaller studies included in meta-analyses provide larger intervention effects than larger studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fraley and Vazire, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, preclinical studies with a high risk of bias (i.e. low methodological quality) may produce inflated estimates of intervention effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Collins and Tabak, 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the discrepancy in methodological quality between single and multilaboratory studies was larger in our preclinical comparison than in previous clinical comparisons. This could be explained by the fact that practices such as blinding and randomization are better established in clinical research, thus, even small single center clinical trials are more likely to adhere to them.</p><p>A second, somewhat less intuitive issue that may have contributed to larger effect sizes in single lab studies is the smaller sample sizes that may lead to skewed results. It has been suggested that, even in the absence of other biases, under-powered studies have a greater likelihood of effect inflation and generate more false positives than high-powered studies; a lower probability that any observed differences reach the minimum threshold for asserting the findings reflect a true effect; and have a greater likelihood of effect inflation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Button et al., 2013</xref>). Perhaps the low power of these single lab studies, combined with well-recognized issues of publication bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sena et al., 2010</xref>), contributed to the larger effect sizes we observed.</p><p>Completeness of reporting in the multilaboratory studies was also noted to be high across many domains. This is in stark contrast to previous preclinical systematic reviews of single lab studies by our group and others that have found significant deficiencies in reporting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fergusson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Avey et al., 2016</xref>). Within our sample of multilaboratory studies, replicates, statistics, and blinding were overall transparently reported in the majority of studies. Items specific to multilaboratory designs, such as indicating the number of participating centers in the abstract and identifying as a multilaboratory study in the title were less frequent. One potential explanation for this finding is that guidelines and standards for multilaboratory preclinical studies are just emerging, and there have yet to be any reporting recommendations specific to a preclinical multilaboratory design.</p><p>The difference in observed methodological quality and high completeness of reporting in preclinical multilaboratory studies could be explained by the routine oversight and quality control that were employed by some of the multilaboratory studies included in our sample. Though not all multilaboratory studies reported routine oversight, we expect that this is inherent in collaborative studies between multiple independent research groups. As reported by several studies, the coordination of a successful preclinical multilaboratory study requires greater training, standardization of protocols, and study-level management when compared to a preclinical study within a single laboratory. Another barrier was the issue of obtaining adequate funding for a multilaboratory study. As a consequence of limited funding, we would speculate that these studies may have undergone more scrutiny and refinement by multiple investigators, funders, and other stakeholders. Indeed, comparison of single lab studies that had been conducted by authors of multilaboratory studies suggested differences in the conduct and outcomes of these studies (despite having the some of the same researchers involved in both). However, this post hoc analysis was qualitative with a limited sample; thus, future studies will need to explore these issues further.</p><p>Due to the greater methodological rigor and transparent reporting, the inferred routine oversight, and larger sample sizes, we speculate that preclinical multilaboratory studies may provide a more precise evaluation of the interventionâs effects than do single lab studies. As research groups globally consider adopting this approach, the biomedical community may benefit by emulating successful existing networks of multicenter studies in social psychology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://psysciacc.org/">https://psysciacc.org/</ext-link>), developmental psychology (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://manybabies.github.io">https://manybabies.github.io</ext-link>), and special education research (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://edresearchaccelerator.org/">https://edresearchaccelerator.org/</ext-link>). Moreover, identified barriers and enablers to these studies should be further explored from a variety of stakeholder perspectives (e.g. researchers, animal ethics committees, institutes, and funders) in order to maximize future chances of success.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>A strength of this systematic review is the in-depth synthesis of published preclinical multilaboratory studies that summarizes and assesses the state of this field of research, along with a quantitative comparison between single and multilaboratory studies. The application of rigorous inclusion criteria limited the eligible studies to interventional, controlled-comparison studies, which could omit valuable information that may have come from the excluded studies of non-controlled and/or observational designs, or studies focused on mechanistic insights. Another limitation is that our assessment of the risk of bias relies on complete reporting; reporting, however, can be influenced by space restrictions in some journals, temporal trends (e.g. better reporting in more recent studies), as well as accepted norms in certain fields of basic science. However, with the increasing prevalence of reporting checklists and standards in preclinical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Percie du Sert et al., 2020</xref>), future assessments will be less susceptible to this information bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramirez et al., 2020</xref>). We also note that our quantitative analysis included only 16 studies, and thus our results might be better regarded as a preliminary analysis that will require future confirmation when more multilaboratory studies have been conducted. We would note, however, that despite the diversity of included multilaboratory studies, overall trends were quite similar across these 16 studies (e.g. more complete reporting, lower risk of bias, and smaller effect size than comparable single laboratory studies).</p><p>An additional limitation is that we calculated the effect sizes of the comparable single lab studies using standardized mean differences. We acknowledge that using mean difference would provide a more readily interpretable comparison, however, the use of standardized mean difference allowed us to compare the same outcomes between studies irrespective of the unit of measurement reported. Another limitation is the restriction to a maximum of 10 studies for each multicenter comparison in order to maintain the feasibility of this study. However, we do not expect that this would influence the results or trends we observed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This review demonstrates the potential value of multicentric study designs in preclinical research, an approach that has been richly rewarding in clinical research. Importantly, this review provides evidence that preclinical multilaboratory studies report smaller treatment effect sizes and appear to have greater methodological rigor than preclinical studies performed in a single laboratory. This suggests that the preclinical multilaboratory design may have a place in the preclinical research pipeline; indeed, this approach may be a valuable means to evaluate the potential of a promising intervention prior to its consideration in an early-phase clinical trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-76300-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Preclinical multilaboratory search strategy.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-76300-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>PRESS review of search strategy.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-76300-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Completeness of reporting of preclinical multilaboratory studies for 29 reporting items.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-76300-supp3-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Quality scores, effect sizes, and effect size ratios of multilaboratory and single lab studies.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-76300-supp4-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="repstand1"><label>Reporting standard 1.</label><caption><title>PRISMA Checklist.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-76300-repstand1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The protocol for the effect size comparison was developed a priori and posted on Open Science Framework (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/awvs9/">https://osf.io/awvs9/</ext-link>).Supplementary documents contains the search strategies, risk of bias assessments, reporting checklists, quality scores, effect sizes, effect size ratios, and standardized mean differences to generate the figures and tables.</p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lalu</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Hunniford</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2020">2020</year><data-title>Study Protocol: Quantitative comparison between the effect sizes of preclinical multicenter studies and single center studies</data-title><source>Open Science Framework</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://osf.io/awvs9/">awvs9</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>VTH was supported by a Government of Ontario Queen Elizabeth II Graduate Scholarship in Science and Technology.

rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 1985</xref>, three independent laboratories collaborated to develop models to test potential ischemic myocardium protection therapies, using two standardized, well-characterized canine models of myocardial infarction. Using the two different dog models (conscious model of coronary occlusion, and unconscious model of 3-hr ischemia in open-chest), the researchers tested the effects of verapamil and ibuprofen (therapies) on infarct size. The pooled results from all three centers demonstrated that neither drug limited infarct size in either model. It was later published that the participating laboratories discovered through statistical and hard evidence that a fourth participating lab initially involved in the study had generated fraudulent data, in the sense that data had been completely fabricated by a researcher at one of the centers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bailey, 1991</xref>). The data from this lab was not included in the multicenter study paper. The detection of the fraudulent data would not have been possible if not for the design of a multicenter study. The fraud was detected by the large discrepancies in outcome data between the offending center and the other centers involved in the study.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref> performed a large study across three laboratories. The main objective was to test the behavioural variability in mice of different genetic strains, sexes, and laboratory environments. The evaluation was done with identical methods and protocols across all three labs. The potentially clinically relevant portion of this study was an assessment of cocaineâs effect on behavior (i.e. locomotor activity). The study found that cocaine effects on locomotor activity had a strong relationship with genetic differences on the laboratory giving the tests but was negligible for sex differences and source of mice (i.e. shipped from a supplier or bred locally).</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2009</xref> conducted a three-phase severe traumatic injury protocol to model trauma-induced coagulopathy, acidosis, and hypothermia on Yorkshire swine across three experimental centers. Animals were treated with four different blood products: fresh whole blood (FWB), hetastarch, fresh frozen plasma/packed RBCs (FFP: PRBC), and FFP, to determine which, if any, were effective in reversing trauma-associated coagulopathy. Treatment with FFP and FFP: PRBC corrected the coagulopathy as effectively as FWB, whereas hetastarch worsened coagulopathy.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spoerke et al., 2009</xref> tested whether lyophilized plasma (LP) is as safe and effective as fresh frozen plasma (FFP) for resuscitation after severe trauma. They used a swine model of severe injury across animal laboratories of two level 1 trauma centers, to test the lyophilized plasma for factor levels and clotting activity before lyophilization and after reconstitution. The swine model was developed and performed at one of the centers and was learned and performed at a second center. They found that LP decreased clotting factor activity and was equal to FFP in terms of efficacy.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jones et al., 2015</xref> aimed to develop a multicenter, randomized controlled clinical-like infrastructure for preclinical evaluation of cardioprotective therapies using mice, rabbit and pig models. The researchers established the Consortium for preclinicAl assESsment of cARdioprotective therapies â called CAESAR - to test the effect of ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on infarct size following a myocardial infarction. IPC involves short episodes of blood restriction to the heart â which is an experimental technique for producing resistance to longer durations of ischemia. Six centers (two centers/animal model) tested the therapy in the three animal models with shared protocols, and found the results were similar across centers and that IPC significantly reduced infarct size in all three species.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Llovera et al., 2015</xref> performed a preclinical randomized controlled multicenter trial to test the potential of anti-CD49d antibodies as a treatment for stroke. These antibodies had shown promise as a form of therapy in individual laboratories by inhibiting the migration of leukocytes into the brain following induction of stroke. Six independent European research centers tested the antibody using two mouse models of stroke. The results demonstrated that the antibody significantly reduced leukocyte invasion and infarct size in the less severe model of stroke. In contrast, these beneficial effects were not noted in the more severe model of stroke.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Maysami et al., 2016</xref> conducted a cross-laboratory study in five centers (four experimental, one coordinating) to test an interleukin receptor antagonist as a drug therapy for stroke. The coordinating center developed and distributed the standard operating procedure to all centers. Stroke was induced both by permanent and transient occlusion in mice. Drug effects on stroke outcome were evaluated by several measures: lesion volume, edema, neurological deficit scoring and post-treatment mortality. The results across all centers supported the therapeutic potential of the cytokine receptor antagonist in experimental stroke.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Six separate studies (2016-2020) that were coordinated by Operation Brain Trauma Therapy (OBTT) consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kochanek et al., 2016</xref>). Three independent centers collaborated to test 6 different therapies for severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). The consortium was supported by the United States Army and had an overall approach of testing promising therapies in three-well established models of TBI in rats with a rigorous design. The end goal of the consortium was to test the 6 initial therapies in rats prior to considering further testing in a swine model of TBI. Based on the results, four of the six drugs preformed below or well below what was expected based on the previously published literature. It was reported that levetiracetam would advance to testing in the swine model, and that glibenclamide showed benefit only in the cortical contusion injury model.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gill et al., 2016</xref> assessed the efficacy of combined anti-CD3 plus interleukin-1 blockade to reverse new-onset autoimmune diabetes in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Their consortium was supported by the National Institutes of Health Immune Tolerance Network and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Four academic centers shared models and operating procedures. They found that the combined antibody treatment did not show reversal of diabetes across all sites. They did, however, conclude that intercenter reproducibility is possible with the NOD mouse model of diabetes.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arroyo-Araujo et al., 2019</xref> evaluated the potential of the metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 (mGluR1) antagonist JNJ16259685, as a treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Three centers used <italic>Shank2</italic> knockout (KO) rats as a model for ASD, which mimics autistic-like hyperactivity and repetitive behaviour. They found that the results were reproducible across the three centers, and that KO rats treated with the mGluR1 antagonist demonstrated reduced hyperactivity and repetitive behaviour as compared to placebo treated KO rats.</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kliewer et al., 2020</xref> investigated whether <italic>Î²</italic>-arrestin2 signaling plays a role in opioid-induced respiratory depression. Three independent laboratories injected <italic>Î²</italic>-arrestin2 knockout (KO) mice and control wild-type mice with morphine and monitored the respiratory rate of both groups of mice. The authors found that the KO mice did develop respiratory depression across all three sites, thus, they suggested that Î²-arrestin2 signaling does not play a key role in opioid-induced respiratory depression.</p></list-item></list><table-wrap id="app1table1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1âtable 1.</label><caption><title>Statements of future recommendations.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Author, Year</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Recommendation statements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Reimer et al., 1985</xref></td><td align="left" valign="top">Nothing reported</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crabbe et al., 1999</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Relatively small genetic effects should first be replicated locally before drawing conclusions... genotypes should be tested in multiple labs and evaluated with multiple tests of a single behavioral domain</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Based upon the findings of the current study that demonstrated the impressive hemostatic properties of plasma, we have proceeded to successfully develop and test (in the same model) lyophilized [freeze dried plasma].</italic></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Spoerke et al., 2009</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>The species-specific differences in factor activities will require ongoing investigation to ensure full safety and efficacy.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: David Mellor (Reviewer #1); Andrew SC Rice (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Introduction: I believe that your audience reach would be expanded, and your intended audience would be even more interested in your work, by noting how this method of multi-lab collaborations is appropriate beyond preclinical research. I will not suggest changing your inclusion criteria for the study already conducted, but it would be worth noting how efforts in social psychology* and human development** have seen similar results as those you describe. Likewise, existing networks in psychology (https://psysciacc.org/), development biology (https://manybabies.github.io/), and special education research (https://edresearchaccelerator.org/) would be worth mentioning as models for emulation when discussing how these practices could be scaled to more communities within preclinical research (perhaps mention this in the Conclusion).</p><p>2) Line 123: Can you please define &quot;interventional&quot; and clarify your definition of &quot;Preclinical&quot; so as to make it clear to readers outside of your domain of focus why psychological or developmental biology was not included (as these do have human health implications). (Just to be clear, I am not being sarcastic or suggesting that these should have been included, I just know that these terms get blurry when going from the preclinical to the basic sciences).</p><p>3) I appreciate that the calculations for the effect size ratio and the difference of standardized mean difference were specified a priori. Even though they were straightforward calculations, there is room for divergence or selective reporting and it appears that those analyses were reported as pre-specified.</p><p>4) The sample size is rather limited. While I do not doubt that the authors invested a lot of work into finding multi-centre studies fulfilling their inclusion criteria, they ended up with a list of only 16 studies. Multi-centre studies are tedious to perform and more expensive, so it is not surprising that the authors could not find more. However, given an N=16 for a rather diverse collection of studies, spanning 35 years, different model species (mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and rabbits) and investigating rather different interventions, this might be better regarded as a preliminary analysis.</p><p>5) There is one question that cannot be answered but which is nevertheless rather important. Is the difference in effect size estimates (with the multi-lab studies presumably providing more accurate effect size estimates) due to the multi-lab setting itself or due to the fact that researchers willing to go the extra length of conducting a multi-lab study are stricter and more rigorous (and more aware) than the average researcher? If the latter is the case, then this would be a confounding factor and one could not conclude that the observed difference is due to the multi-lab approach itself.</p><p>6) As the authors noted themselves, sample sizes of single-lab and multi-lab differed substantially (median 19 vs. 111) and this difference in sample size might itself lead to more accurate effect size estimates (closer to the meta-analytic estimate). I am, therefore, missing an analysis, of whether this effect alone could explain the discrepancy. That is â would single-lab studies using the same number of animals be equally accurate as a multi-lab study?</p><p>7) I have some minor methodological issues regarding the evaluation of the risk of bias and specifically its interpretation as a measure for the quality of scientific rigor. This is more of a general critique of the use of 'risk of bias' in systematic reviews and is not specific to this study, but it nevertheless means that the results of this part of the study should be taken with a grain of salt and be interpreted with care. The risk of bias questionnaire is focusing on what is reported in the publication. As it is visible in table 3, even for the multi-lab studies-where risk of bias was considerably lower than for the single-lab studies-a substantial proportion of questions was answered with unclear-i.e., it was, for example, not reported whether allocation concealment was done or not. This could mean that it was not done or it can mean that it was done, but researchers didn't find it noteworthy to report it. Reporting practice slightly differs between fields, it differs between journals (due to space restriction, editorial guidelines, and also the rigor of the editors), and it very strongly changes over time â due to the current discussion about replicability editors and reviewers are now asking for more details than they did a decade ago. So, any analysis of the risk of bias using those criteria should consider journal and year of publication as co-variates. In the present case the authors mentioned, that they tried to match single-lab studies with multi-lab studies also according to age, though a quick look at publication years suggests that this was not always achieved.</p><p>8) There seem to be some inconsistencies between Table 3 and Table S11. For example, in the column &quot;Blinding of outcome assessment&quot; in Table S3 there are 4 studies with &quot;unknown&quot; (Crabbe, Alam, Spoerke, Gill), while in Table S11 in the column &quot;Blinding of outcome assessment&quot; there are 4 study scoring 0, but here Arroyo-Araujo scores also 0, while Gill scores 1. How does this fit together?</p><p>9) Methods: maybe I have missed that: have you described, whether for the reporting scores you checked only the main article or also the electronic supplementary (supporting information)?</p><p>10) Language limits: In the methods description you wrote &quot;No language limits were imposed&quot; (line 147). In the Results section, I could, however, not find any information, on if any non-English papers were found and whether they were included in the analysis.

Is there actually any study clearly showing that papers with authors from industry are more biased than papers from authors from academia? I know that this is an item on the SYRCLE list of bias tools, but is this prejudice against industry justified â i.e., based on evidence? Just recently there have been several cases of spectacular fraud (data fabrication) by authors in academia (behavioural ecology). Specifically for early career researchers in academia publication pressure for securing tenure or a faculty position is often described as extremely high, creating incentives for &quot;beautifying&quot; results which are then easier to publish. If you are, however, aware of any publication or data showing that bias in industry is more of an issue than in academia then it would be good to cite it here.</p><p>16) Line 388: As mentioned in the public review: I would be very careful with equating low reporting scores with &quot;quality of research&quot;</p><p>17) Analysis (Meta-analysis, Figure S12): It would be really interesting to add publication year as a covariate in the models.

First is the clear data showing the risk of bias assessments and effect size differences between single and multi-lab studies. This provides more clear evidence about the problematic process of single study science. Second, and I believe more important, is the qualitative information provided through the interviews with participating labs that describe the barriers and recommendations from participating labs (eg timelines, pilot periods, budget limitations set by the least well-resourced lab, ethics approval processes, centralized data processing, and even interpersonal lab coordination suggestions). Summarizing these qualitative findings in specific recommendations or a set of proposed guidelines would expand the relevance of this paper.</p><p>Below are my recommendations for improvement, which are not substantial but will hopefully help the authors widen their audience and convince their peers that these methods are not limited to their own community.</p><p>Introduction: I believe that your audience reach would be expanded, and your intended audience would be even more interested in your work, by noting how this method of multi-lab collaborations is appropriate beyond preclinical research. I will not suggest changing your inclusion criteria for the study already conducted, but it would be worth noting how efforts in social psychology and human development have seen similar results as those you describe. Likewise, existing networks in psychology (https://psysciacc.org/), development biology (https://manybabies.github.io/), and special education research (https://edresearchaccelerator.org/) would be worth mentioning as models for emulation when discussing how these practices could be scaled to more communities within preclinical research (perhaps mention this in the Conclusion).</p><p>Line 123: Can you please define &quot;interventional&quot; and clarify your definition of &quot;Preclinical&quot; so as to make it clear to readers outside of your domain of focus why psychological or developmental biology was not included (as these do have human health implications). (Just to be clear, I am not being sarcastic or suggesting that these should have been included, I just know that these terms get blurry when going from the preclinical to the basic sciences).</p><p>I appreciate that the calculations for the effect size ratio and the difference of standardized mean difference were specified a priori. Even though they were straightforward calculations, there is room for divergence or selective reporting and it appears that those analyses were reported as pre-specified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This paper reports results of a systematic review comparing single-lab with multi-lab studies with regard to reported effect size and risk of bias. The main outcome was that risk of bias was lower in multi-lab studies and so was the reported effect size. The authors argue, that the higher effect sizes observed in the single lab studies are presumably over-estimates and that, hence, the multi-lab studies provide more accurate effect size estimates. They, thus, conclude that this meta-analysis demonstrates the potential value of multi-centre studies in pre-clinical research. While I do agree that multi-centre studies are valuable, I have certain reservations as to what extent this is actually shown in the current study. Here are my concerns.</p><p>1) The sample size is rather limited. While I do not doubt that the authors invested a lot of work into finding multi-centre studies fulfilling their inclusion criteria, they ended up with a list of only 16 studies. Multi-centre studies are tedious to perform and more expensive, so it is not surprising that the authors could not find more. However, given an N=16 for a rather diverse collection of studies, spanning 35 years, different model species (mice, rats, dogs, pigs, and rabbits) and investigating rather different interventions, this might be better regarded as a preliminary analysis.</p><p>2) There is one question that cannot be answered but which is nevertheless rather important. Is the difference in effect size estimates (with the multi-lab studies presumably providing more accurate effect size estimates) due to the multi-lab setting itself or due to the fact that researchers willing to go the extra length of conducting a multi-lab study are stricter and more rigorous (and more aware) than the average researcher? If the latter is the case, then this would be a confounding factor and one could not conclude that the observed difference is due to the multi-lab approach itself.</p><p>3) As the authors noted themselves, sample sizes of single-lab and multi-lab differed substantially (median 19 vs. 111) and this difference in sample size might itself lead to more accurate effect size estimates (closer to the meta-analytic estimate). I am, therefore, missing an analysis, of whether this effect alone could explain the discrepancy. That is-would single-lab studies using the same number of animals be equally accurate as a multi-lab study?</p><p>4) I have some minor methodological issues regarding the evaluation of the risk of bias and specifically its interpretation as a measure for the quality of scientific rigor. This is more of a general critique of the use of 'risk of bias' in systematic reviews and is not specific to this study, but it nevertheless means that the results of this part of the study should be taken with a grain of salt and be interpreted with care. The risk of bias questionnaire is focusing on what is reported in the publication. As it is visible in table 3, even for the multi-lab studies â where the risk of bias was considerably lower than for the single-lab studies-a substantial proportion of questions was answered with unclear â i.e., it was, for example, not reported whether allocation concealment was done or not. This could mean that it was not done or it can mean that it was done, but researchers didn't find it noteworthy to report it. Reporting practice slightly differs between fields, it differs between journals (due to space restriction, editorial guidelines, and also the rigor of the editors), and it very strongly changes over time â due to the current discussion about replicability editors and reviewers are now asking for more details than they did a decade ago. So, any analysis of the risk of bias using those criteria should consider journal and year of publication as co-variates. In the present case the authors mentioned, that they tried to match single-lab studies with multi-lab studies also according to age, though a quick look at publication years suggests that this was not always achieved.</p><p>Overall, I think this study provides evidence that multi-centric preclinical studies do report effect size estimates that might be more trustworthy than those provided by single-lab studies. I can therefore fully agree with the authors' conclusion about the value of such studies. Yet, why exactly multi-center studies fare better (whether it is because of the larger sample sizes, the different mindset of the experimenters, or the necessity to coordinate protocols), remains an open question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is a well-written and clear manuscript covering an important and emerging area, albeit one that has not yet significantly penetrated into scientific practice. The authors were attempting to ascertain professional attitudes to multi-centre studies in pre-clinical biomedical research by using a semi-structured interview method. I am not an expert in the methods used and defer to expert reviewers in this regard; my expertise is in multi-centre animal studies.</p><p>A potential limitation is that only 16 participants were included in the interviews, although this is a sample size justified by reference to norms in the literature. Furthermore, in the results, the authors suggest that data saturation had been reached by the 13th interview, so perhaps this is sufficient. Ten out of 16 interviewees were US-based, the remainder European. A further potential bias may be that the interviewees had all participated in pre-clinical multicentre research, so were perhaps likely to be enthusiasts of the approach.</p><p>I was curious as to why the group considered that testing of efficacy was the major use of such studies (rather than testing a new mechanism or fundamental finding) and that evaluation of a new method, model, or outcome measure was not even mentioned.

The question is &quot;Is the difference in effect size estimates (with the multi-lab studies presumably providing more accurate effect size estimates) due to the multi-lab setting itself or due to the fact that researchers are willing to go the extra length of conducting a multi-lab study are stricter and more rigorous (and more aware) than the average researcher?&quot; I agree that the cause and effect cannot be addressed by this review and that only an experimental manipulation could start to truly answer that question (which would be a very tough experiment). However, the authors' response is also a bit limited and does add some additional questions from me. They state: &quot;For ten multilaboratory studies, researchers had authored at least one of the matched single lab studies.&quot; I am now curious as to whether or not those ~10 single lab studies were in some way different than the ~90 other single lab studies (which would suggest that it's the person instead of the process that makes the difference). HOWEVER- I do not suggest that the authors go down that rabbit hole. No matter what is found from such digging, the root question (&quot;is it the multi-lab process or the better scientist that makes the better studies?&quot;) will not be well addressed through this process simply because it will be an exercise in chasing smaller and smaller sub-samples with too much noise to make any reasonable conclusion. Instead, I have to disagree with the authors' first response to this comment and rather just recommend that they note these two possible explanations and state that this observational study cannot determine if it is the method or the authors that explain the differences reported.</p><p>All other changes and comments seem appropriate to me.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall the authors answered the questions coming up during the first review and changed the text accordingly.</p><p>There is, however, one point, where I would love to see a bit more.

Finally, we would note that our comparative approach emulates similar landmark clinical meta-research studies; the first highly cited landmark study on this issue in clinical research investigated only five topics (Ref #9, Bellomo 2009). Nonetheless, we agree with the reviewers that we have much to learn still and that our study is an important starting point. In our discussion we have now explicitly stated this:</p><p>âStrengths and limitations</p><p>â¦ In addition, our quantitative analysis included only sixteen studies, and thus our results might be better regarded as a preliminary analysis that will require future confirmation when more multilaboratory studies have been conducted.

Is there actually any study clearly showing that papers with authors from industry are more biased than papers from authors from academia? I know that this is an item on the SYRCLE list of bias tools, but is this prejudice against industry justified â i.e., based on evidence? Just recently there have been several cases of spectacular fraud (data fabrication) by authors in academia (behavioural ecology). Specifically for early career researchers in academia publication pressure for securing tenure or a faculty position is often described as extremely high, creating incentives for &quot;beautifying&quot; results which are then easier to publish. If you are, however, aware of any publication or data showing that bias in industry is more of an issue than in academia then it would be good to cite it here.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important point. Dr. Lisa Bero and colleagues have investigated this issue in several studies and demonstrated that the relationship is complicated. For studies investigating statins on atherosclerosis and bone outcomes they found that non-industry studies were more likely to demonstrate efficacy than industry sponsored studies (i.e. larger effect size in non-industry studies; PMID 25880564 and 24465178). However, in animal studies assessing the effect of atrazine exposure, industry sponsored studies were less likely to demonstrate harm than non-industry sponsored studies (i.e. smaller effect size in non-industry studies; PMID 26694022). In our groupâs work (not-published yet) we found that industry sponsored animal studies of hydroxyethyl starch intravenous fluids were more likely to demonstrate efficacy than non-industry sponsored studies (i.e. smaller effect size in non-industry studies). This is notable since these (very expensive) fluids were subsequently pulled from markets with a black-box warning from the FDA.</p><p>These data demonstrate that there is no straightforward/easy approach to understanding the relationship between industry/non-industry sponsorship and risk of bias in preclinical studies.</p><p>We agree that perhaps the SYRCLE risk of bias tool should reevaluate this issue in the future and we have brought it to their attention through an email communication with Dr. Kimberly Wever, who is a member of their leadership. Ultimately, this remains a question that needs to be investigated further and addressed by future iterations of the SYRCLE risk of bias tool.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) Line 388: As mentioned in the public review: I would be very careful with equating low reporting scores with &quot;quality of research&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have adjusted our terminology throughout (i.e. âcompleteness of reportingâ).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>17) Analysis (Meta-analysis, Figure S12): It would be really interesting to add publication year as a covariate in the models.

We have adjusted the sentence to, âWe found that the multicenter studies undertaken to date have been conducted using more rigorous methodology and quality controlâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21) I was curious as to why the group considered that testing of efficacy was the major use of such studies (rather than testing a new mechanism or fundamental finding) and that evaluation of a new method, model, or outcome measure was not even mentioned. That would not have been my view had I been interviewed. It would be nice to see a critical discussion about this.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we agree that multilaboratory studies could be used for other purposes (e.g. mechanistic/fundamental). However, the majority of studies using this method have been interventional/therapeutic. We have now discussed this in the Discussion:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>ââ¦The application of rigorous inclusion criteria limited the eligible studies to interventional, controlled-comparison studies, which could omit valuable information that may have come from the excluded studies of non-controlled and/or observational designs, or studies focused on mechanistic insights.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22) I wonder if a more forensic discussion of what the authors see as the probable barriers to funders, peer scientists, and other stakeholders would be informative. Perhaps even a more extensive discussion of potential solutions may have been informative.</p></disp-quote><p>As we had only interviewed the scientists involved, and not other stakeholders, we are hesitant to speculate on solutions from their viewpoints. Although we are hesitant to further lengthen our discussion (which we feel is already quite long), we have now included a statement that further studies will need to investigate this important issue. We believe a stakeholder response should be:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>ââ¦Moreover, identified barriers and enablers to these studies should be further explored from a variety of stakeholder perspectives (e.g. researchers, animal ethics committees, institutes and funders) in order to maximize future chances of success.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23) The main area of disagreement between interviewees was the issue of harmonisation of protocols- a strong contrast to the clinical multi-centre practice where harmonisation is the norm. This interesting response could perhaps have been discussed more?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have now elaborated on this issue in the Results:</p><p>âIf the protocol was to be harmonized, then it had to be adapted to fit each labâs budget accordingly (i.e. the lab with the smallest budget set the spending limit (19)). Alternatively, labs developed a general protocol but adapted it to fit their own respective budget with what resources they had. Of note, recent work has suggested that harmonization reduces between-lab variability, however, systematic heterogenization did not reduce variability further (52); this may suggest that, even in fully harmonized protocols, enough uncontrolled heterogeneity exists that further purposeful heterogenization has little effect.â</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall the authors answered the questions coming up during the first review and changed the text accordingly.</p><p>There is, however, one point, where I would love to see a bit more. This regards the rather central question of whether multi-lab (ML) and single-lab (SL) differ because of the procedure or because they were done by a different 'population' of authors or with a different objective in mind.</p><p>The authors responded:</p><p>&quot;We found that for the majority of the multilaboratory studies (i.e. ten), researchers had previously authored single lab studies on the same topic. &quot; and then &quot; This has now been addressed in the manuscript.

I don't advocate a statistical analysis, however, a descriptive summary (in how many of those 10 cases were the ML closer to the meta-analytic outcome than the SL?) and maybe these 10 SL studies could also be highlighted in figure 3 (if they were included there, though I presume they were).</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added:</p><p>Methods:</p><p>âPeer reviewers requested additional analysis to qualitatively assess identified single-laboratory studies that were conducted by the same authors of matched multilaboratory studies.â</p><p>Results:</p><p>âThe ESR was greater than 1 (i.e. the single lab studies produced a larger summary effect size) in 10 of the 14 comparisons.

The ESRs for each comparison along with the mean effect sizes and ratio of the mean effect sizes is found in the supplemental information (Appendix 11 â table 7).</p><p>For 10 multilaboratory studies, researchers also had authored 11 matched single lab studies. Median effect size ratio of this smaller matched cohort was 2.50 (mean 4.10, range 0.35-17.63). Median quality assessment score for the 10 multilaboratory studies was 3 (range 1-5); median quality score of the 11 single-laboratory studies matched by authors was 1 (range 1-4).â</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>âThe difference in observed methodological quality and high completeness of reporting in preclinical multilaboratory studies could be explained by the routine oversight and quality control that were employed by some of the multilaboratory studies included in our sample. Though not all multilaboratory studies reported routine oversight, we expect that this is inherent of collaborative studies between multiple independent research groups. As reported by several studies, the coordination of a successful preclinical multilaboratory study requires greater training, standardization of protocols, and study-level management when compared to a preclinical study within a single-laboratory. Another barrier was the issue of obtaining adequate funding for a multilaboratory study. As consequence of limited funding, we would speculate that these studies may have undergone more scrutiny and refinement by multiple investigators, funders, and other stakeholders Indeed, comparison single-laboratory studies that had been conducted by authors of multilaboratory studies suggested differences in the conduct and outcomes of these studies (despite having the some of the same researchers involved in both). However, this post hoc analysis was qualitative with a limited sample; thus, future studies will need to explore these issues further.â</p><p>We chose not to highlight the studies in Figure 3 to avoid distracting from our a priori planned analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
