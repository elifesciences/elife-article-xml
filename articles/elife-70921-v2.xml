The elaborate cytoarchitecture of these neurons is embedded within complex brain tissue, making it difficult to access the neuronal proteome using conventional methods. Here, we demonstrate APEX2 proximity labeling within genetically targeted neurons in the mouse brain, enabling subcellular proteomics with cell-type specificity. By combining APEX2 biotinylation with mass spectrometry, we mapped the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. Our dataset reveals the proteomic architecture underlying proteostasis, axonal metabolism, and neurotransmission in these neurons. We find that most proteins encoded by DA neuron-enriched genes are localized within striatal dopaminergic axons, including ion channels with previously undescribed axonal localization. These proteomic datasets provide a resource for neuronal cell biology, and this approach can be readily adapted for study of other neural cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>proximity labeling</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>dopamine neuron</kwd><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F30DA047775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobson</surname><given-names>Benjamin D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS095435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DA007418</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01MH122470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018231</institution-id><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-000375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sulzer</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Sims</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>APEX2 proximity labeling of genetically targeted neurons enables subcellular and cell type-specific proteomics in the mouse brain, revealing the axonal and somatodendritic proteomes of midbrain dopaminergic neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dopamine (DA) release from the axons of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons provides important signals that regulate learning, motivation, and behavior. Given that dopaminergic dysfunction is linked to neuropsychiatric diseases including Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia, and drug addiction, there is considerable interest in deep molecular profiling of mDA neurons in health and disease. Molecular profiling of striatal DA axons is of particular interest, since they may be the initial site of mDA neuronal degeneration in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burke and O’Malley, 2013</xref>), a point strongly supported by neuropathological comparison of dopaminergic axonal and cell body loss in PD patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kordower et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, the study of proteins in striatal mDA axons and how they are altered in disease or disease models is a topic of intense investigation.</p><p>Despite their importance in behavior and disease, mDA neurons are very few in number, with an estimated ~21,000 in the midbrain of C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Nelson et al., 1996</xref>). Thus, although proteomic profiling of midbrain tissue samples offers insight into PD pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Jung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Petyuk et al., 2021</xref>), such studies do not analyze striatal mDA axons, nor can they identify the cellular source of changes in protein levels. Most mDA neuron-specific molecular profiling studies have focused on mRNA using translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) or single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brichta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dougherty, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kramer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Poulin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tiklová et al., 2019</xref>). Although these methods have advanced our understanding of gene expression in mDA neurons, there are important issues that are not addressed by the study of mRNA. First, mRNA levels do not always correlate with protein abundance, particularly for axonal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moritz et al., 2019</xref>). Second, transcriptomics cannot establish the localization or abundance of the encoded proteins within specific subcellular compartments, which is particularly important for mDA neurons.</p><p>After exiting the midbrain, the axons of mDA neurons travel within the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) to innervate forebrain structures. mDA axonal arbors within the striatum are immense and highly complex: single mDA neuron tracing has shown that mDA axons can reach over 500,000 µm in total length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>). Although their axons constitute the major volume and energy demand for mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bolam and Pissadaki, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Matsuda et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pacelli et al., 2015</xref>), dopaminergic axons represent only a small fraction of tissue protein in the striatum. The ability to directly interrogate subcellular proteomes of mDA neurons in native brain tissue would significantly enhance our understanding of mDA neuronal biology.</p><p>To study the subcellular proteome of mDA neurons in the mouse brain, we have adapted enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling combined with mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics, a powerful approach for identifying protein interactions and/or localization in subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Loh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). For in-cell proximity labeling, a particularly efficient enzymatic approach uses the engineered ascorbate peroxidase APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lam et al., 2015</xref>). APEX2 rapidly biotinylates proximal proteins in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and biotin-phenol (BP), generally requiring &lt;1 min of labeling in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hung et al., 2017</xref>). While most proximity labeling studies have been conducted on cultured cells, APEX2 proximity labeling has also been demonstrated in live <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2015</xref>), and recently in mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Selective expression of APEX2 enabled electron microscopy reconstructions of genetically targeted neurons in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joesch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that APEX2 may be suitable for cell type-specific proximity labeling and proteomics in live brain tissue.</p><p>Here, we employ APEX2-mediated biotin labeling in acute brain slices to study the subcellular proteome of mDA neurons. Using a combination of cell type-specific APEX2 expression and proximity biotinylation in acutely prepared slices, we have characterized the somatodendritic and axonal proteomes of midbrain mDA neurons. We show that the striatal axonal arbors contain nearly 90% of mDA neuronal proteins accessible to cytoplasmic APEX2 labeling, providing robust coverage of proteins involved in axonal transport, DA transmission, and axonal metabolism. Of particular interest, we find that many proteins encoded by mDA neuron-enriched genes are preferentially localized in striatal axons. Together, our data establish a proteomic architecture for mDA neurons and identify candidates for mechanistic follow-up studies of PD-relevant mDA neuronal cell biology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>APEX2 enables rapid, mDA neuron-specific biotin labeling in acute brain slices</title><p>To express cytoplasmic APEX2 specifically in mDA neurons, we employed an AAV5 viral vector containing the Cre-dependent construct developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Joesch et al., 2016</xref>, which expresses a V5-tagged APEX2 fused to a nuclear export sequence (NES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wen et al., 1995</xref>). We injected AAV5-CAG-DIO-APEX2NES into the ventral midbrain (VM) of DAT-IRES-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bäckman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To confirm the cellular specificity and Cre dependence of APEX2 expression, we injected the virus into DAT-IRES-Cre mice crossed with Ai9 tdTomato reporter mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Madisen et al., 2010</xref>). Immunostaining against V5 (APEX2), RFP (tdTomato), and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a canonical mDA neuron marker, demonstrated specific expression of APEX2 in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). We found that ~97% of V5-APEX2<sup>+</sup> neurons were also double-positive for tdTomato and TH, while V5-APEX2 expression was never detected in nondopaminergic (TH<sup>−</sup>/tdTomato<sup>−</sup>) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a, b</xref>). All three markers displayed intense staining throughout the mDA neuronal cytoplasm, including dendrites in the VM and axonal projections in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). As determined by quantification of fluorescence intensity in confocal images, the subcellular distribution of V5-APEX2 concentration was indistinguishable from TH and tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>). The average intensity for all three proteins was slightly higher in mDA neuronal somata than in dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c, d</xref>), which may reflect somatic protein synthesis and outward transit into dendrites and axons. Importantly, these data show no bias in the distribution of V5-APEX2 concentration compared to other cytoplasmic proteins in mDA neurons. Thus, injection of Cre-dependent AAV-APEX2NES (hereafter referred to as APEX2) into the VM of DAT-IRES-Cre mice leads to robust expression of APEX2 throughout the mDA neuronal cytoplasm.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cre-dependent viral expression of cytoplasmic APEX2 and midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuron-specific biotinylation in acute brain slices.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic depicting viral expression strategy: Cre-dependent, cytoplasmic APEX2 expressing AAV (AAV5-CAG-DIO-APEX2-NES) is injected into the midbrain of DAT-IRES-Cre mice for mDA neuron-specific APEX2 labeling.

We conducted APEX2 labeling in acute brain slice preparations under conditions that preserve the integrity of neurons and severed axons, as shown by electrophysiological recordings and stable levels of evoked DA release for at least 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Typical sets of coronal or sagittal slices are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref> and our workflow is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>. Key steps in the protocol include: (1) transcardial perfusion with low-sodium cutting solution, which acts to preserve neuronal integrity in slices from adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Ting et al., 2014</xref>) and removes catalase-rich blood, (2) incubation of slices with BP in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) during the slice recovery period, (3) rapid labeling with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in aCSF, and (4) rapid quenching by transferring slices to antioxidant aCSF. Because the slices are far thicker (300 µm) than monolayer cell cultures, we fixed, cleared, and stained them with fluorescent anti-V5 (APEX2) and streptavidin after biotin labeling in 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1–5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>). We found that biotinylation was detectable at all time points, although streptavidin labeling appeared weaker within the center of slices, suggesting incomplete penetration of BP and/or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Rather than targeting a specific organelle or protein complex, our goal in this work was to broadly label the entire cytoplasm of mDA neurons. Therefore, we chose 3 min of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure for downstream applications, which provided sufficient labeling for proteomics while limiting H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure.</p><p>Western blotting of slices treated with BP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> showed broad biotinylation patterns in the midbrain and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>), consistent with labeling of somatodendritic and axonal proteins, respectively. Fluorescent streptavidin staining of sagittal slices after labeling and fixation revealed mDA neuron-specific labeling throughout the VM, MFB, and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). We confirmed that both BP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> are required for APEX2-mediated biotinylation in mDA neuronal soma/dendrites and axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f, g</xref>). Confocal imaging of striatal slices revealed a dense, intricate staining pattern consistent with the cytoarchitecture of mDA axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1g</xref>). Biotin labeling colocalized with V5-APEX2<sup>+</sup> mDA axons but not with surrounding somata or myelin tracts, since APEX-generated BP radicals do not cross membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Rhee et al., 2013</xref>).

Using data-independent acquisition (DIA), we quantified between 15,000 and 30,000 peptides representing 2100–2600 proteins per APEX2<sup>+</sup> sample, while only ~5000 peptides representing ~1000 proteins were detected in APEX2<sup>−</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Using the same LC–MS/MS workflow to analyze the bulk tissue proteome of VM and striatum slices, we found that approximately 45% of proteins quantified in the bulk tissue samples were also detected in APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). More than 84% of proteins in both bulk tissue and APEX2<sup>+</sup> streptavidin pulldown samples were identified based on quantification of multiple peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), and protein abundances of biological replicate APEX2<sup>+</sup> streptavidin pulldown samples were highly correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>; Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> = 0.93–0.94 for striatum, <italic>r</italic> = 0.89–0.92 for VM, and <italic>r</italic> = 0.82–0.84 for MFB). Thus, even for specific subcellular compartments of small cell populations (~21,000 mDA neurons), the high efficiency of APEX2 labeling enables highly reproducible cell type-specific proteomics from individual mice. We also conducted bulk tissue proteomics on VM and striatum slices that were immediately frozen or subjected to APEX2 labeling procedures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We found thousands of differentially expressed proteins when comparing VM vs. striatum slices, but no statistically significant differences when comparing acute vs. rested slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b, c</xref>). We also found that incubation of slices with 0.5 mM BP for 1 hr had no effect on spontaneous action potential frequency in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d, e</xref>). These data demonstrate that acute slice preparation and labeling procedures do not compromise mDA neuronal function or significantly distort brain tissue proteomes.</p><p>To identify APEX2-dependent proteins captured by streptavidin pulldown, we normalized protein abundances to total protein intensity within each sample (see Materials and methods) and directly compared APEX2<sup>+</sup> to APEX2<sup>−</sup> control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). The number of proteins enriched in APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples scaled with the fraction of biotinylation derived from each region (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–d</xref>), with 1449 proteins for VM, 702 proteins for MFB, 1840 proteins for striatal samples (FDR &lt;0.05, Welch’s unequal variance <italic>t</italic>-test with Benjamini–Hochberg correction). We emphasize that the normalized proteomics data report on the <italic>relative abundance</italic> of proteins (relative to all protein captured by streptavidin pulldown in each sample), while the <italic>absolute abundance</italic> determined by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) shows that most of the mDA neuronal protein mass is axonal. Although proteins such as endogenously biotinylated carboxylases (e.g., pyruvate carboxylase, propionyl-CoA carboxylase) and other nonspecific binders (e.g., myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein 1) were abundant in all samples, they were not enriched in APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples. The most abundant APEX2-specific proteins within each region displayed considerable overlap across regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), with 17 common proteins derived from the top 10 proteins in each region (VM, MFB, and striatum). Although cytoskeletal proteins such as actin and tubulin subunits were highly abundant in APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples from all three regions, the most abundant APEX2-specific proteins within each region also included proteins enriched in specific subcellular compartments. For example, the somatodendritic protein MAP-2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) was in the top 10 only for VM samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>), while proteins involved in synaptic vesicle fusion and endocytosis were in the top 10 only for MFB or striatum samples (e.g., synaptophysin, synaptogyrin-3, and α-synuclein). Compared to bulk striatal tissue, APEX2<sup>+</sup> striatal samples show significant enrichment of dopaminergic proteins such as TH, dopamine transporter (DAT), aromatic-<sc>l</sc>-acid (dopa) decarboxylase (AADC), and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>). Meanwhile, proteins specific to astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs), and cholinergic interneurons (ChI) were either not detected or were significantly depleted from striatal APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>).

It should be noted that although we refer to VM samples as somatodendritic, these samples will necessarily include axons exiting the midbrain as well as somatically synthesized axonal proteins. Accordingly, the difference in abundance between striatal and VM samples was dramatically greater for MAP-2 compared to tau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

After identification of high-confidence mDA neuron profiles, we used the mRNA expression distribution from scRNA-seq to establish a conservative lower bound for considering a gene as expressed in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>, see Materials and methods). The vast majority of proteins in the APEX2 data were encoded by genes expressed in mDA neurons, with &gt;93.0% of all detected proteins and &gt;97.4% of APEX2-enriched proteins encoded by genes above our scRNA-seq threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b, c</xref>). We removed proteins that were not significantly enriched in APEX2<sup>+</sup> &gt; APEX2<sup>−</sup> samples, proteins encoded by genes below our mDA neuron scRNA-seq threshold, and proteins that did not show evidence of APEX2-specificity in at least two regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1d</xref>, see Materials and methods for complete description). For comparison between VM and striatal samples, we retained the union of proteins passing filters in VM and striatal samples. Out of 1733 total proteins, 200 proteins passed filtering only in VM samples, 334 only in striatal samples, and 1199 both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of these 1199 overlapping proteins clearly segregated VM APEX2<sup>+</sup> and Str APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples from each other and from all APEX2<sup>−</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and direct comparison between APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples revealed 173 and 374 proteins with greater relative abundance in VM or striatal samples, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Manual examination of VM- and Str-enriched protein clusters revealed striatal enrichment of synaptic vesicle proteins (e.g., Synaptotagmin-1 [Syt-1], Synaptophysin, SNAP25, VMAT2) and VM enrichment of postsynaptic scaffolding proteins (e.g., Homer-2, Shanks1-3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We first sought to confirm that cytoplasmic APEX2 labeling does not enrich proteins within membrane-enclosed structures. Among the 1733 total proteins passing filter in either VM or striatum, we found significant enrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms related only to nuclear and mitochondrial outer membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3a, b</xref>), but not nuclear inner membrane, nuclear lamina, nuclear matrix, mitochondrial inner membrane, or mitochondrial matrix. These results confirm the membrane impermeability of BP radicals and the integrity of organellar membranes in the acute brain slices.</p><p>To assess the relative enrichment of functionally related proteins within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of mDA neurons, we conducted GO analysis of proteins that either passed filtering in only one region or were significantly enriched in that region in the APEX2<sup>+</sup> vs. APEX2<sup>−</sup> comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, 373 proteins for VM, 708 for striatum). First, we analyzed subcellular localization GO terms curated by the COMPARTMENTS resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Binder et al., 2014</xref>). We found that the top GO terms over-represented among VM-enriched proteins included ‘postsynapse’, ‘somatodendritic compartment’, ‘dendrite’, and ‘postsynaptic density’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>), while those over-represented among striatum-enriched proteins included ‘presynapse’, ‘axon’, ‘synaptic vesicle’, and ‘axon terminus’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>). Given the clear segregation of axonal/presynaptic and dendritic/postsynaptic terms from the COMPARTMENTS resource in striatum- and VM-enriched proteins, respectively, we analyzed the VM- and Str-enriched proteins using the GO Consortium resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2021</xref>). Similar to the COMPARTMENTS analysis, we found that GO terms related to postsynaptic function were over-represented in VM-enriched proteins, with terms such as ‘dendrite’, ‘glutamate receptor binding’, and ‘GABA-A receptor complex’. Canonical proteins associated with these terms included subunits and scaffolding proteins for AMPA, NMDA, GABA-A, and GABA-B receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). GO terms such as ‘RNA binding’ and ‘regulation of mRNA stability’ were also over-represented in VM-enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), consistent with the somatodendritic compartment being the major site of protein synthesis in neurons. Despite a clear role for the ubiquitin proteasome system in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Korhonen and Lindholm, 2004</xref>), we found over-representation of GO terms such as ‘cytosolic proteasome complex’ in VM-enriched proteins, with nearly all 20S subunits and most 19S subunits showing higher relative abundance in VM APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).</p><p>The enrichment of protein synthesis and degradation machinery within the somatodendritic compartment is consistent with our recent work on local translation in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hobson et al., 2021</xref>) and underscores the importance of cytoskeletal transport systems in axonal protein homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Maday et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Roy, 2014</xref>). Accordingly, GO terms such as ‘vesicle-mediated transport’ and ‘protein transport’ were over-represented in striatum-enriched proteins. Striatum-enriched proteins in these ontologies included kinesin and dynein subunits, cargo adaptor proteins, and upstream kinases involved in transport regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). In addition to microtubule-based transport proteins, proteins related to the axonal actin cytoskeleton were also over-represented in striatum APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples. These included actin subunits themselves, GTPases and other regulators of actin nucleation, and proteins that link actin rings in the distal axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Leterrier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). We also found that proteins involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis were uniformly enriched in striatum APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples, consistent with high rates of synaptic vesicle recycling in mDA neurons related to their tonic activity. Given the intense energetic demands placed on mDA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Pissadaki and Bolam, 2013</xref>), we were intrigued to find an over-representation of glycolytic enzymes in Str-enriched proteins: seven out of nine glycolytic enzymes show higher relative abundance in striatum compared to VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). These results suggest that glycolysis may be especially important in dopaminergic axonal metabolism, consistent with glycolysis supporting axonal transport and presynaptic function in other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ashrafi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hinckelmann et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib133">Zala et al., 2013</xref>). We note that striatum APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples also showed extensive enrichment of GO terms related to presynaptic function and synaptic vesicle proteins, as detailed below (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref> for a complete GO analysis summary).</p><p>While anterograde transport is critical for delivery of new proteins to distal axons, it is likely that both local autophagy and retrograde transport contribute to protein clearance in mDA axons. Many autophagosomes formed in distal axons are transported back to the soma prior to fusion with lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Maday et al., 2012</xref>), although other findings implicate local autophagic degradation of damaged mitochondria in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ashrafi et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, we previously showed that macroautophagy regulates presynaptic structure and function in mDA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with these results, we found that GO terms related to autophagy were over-represented in Str-enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>). Autophagy-related proteins enriched in striatum APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples included kinases involved in upstream regulation of autophagy, membrane proteins involved in autophagosome maturation, and membrane proteins involved in lysosomal membrane fusion. Among the autophagy-related proteins present in striatal axons, vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) was recently shown to be critical for survival and axonal integrity in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). Our results suggest that VMP1 may regulate autophagy in the axons as well as soma of mDA neurons, highlighting the ability of APEX2 proteomics to elucidate the distribution of proteins with unknown localization. Collectively, these results establish a foundation of protein localization that underlies diverse cellular functions within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of mDA neurons. While our GO analysis is broadly consistent with established features of neuronal polarization (e.g., somatodendritic enrichment of terms such as ‘postsynapse’ and ‘RNA binding’), findings from this discovery approach will require follow-up studies to elucidate compartment-specific function of the identified proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Localization of K<sup>+</sup> channels Kv4.3 and GIRK2 in dopaminergic, but not cortical axons</title><p>To validate our axonal vs. somatodendritic comparisons using orthogonal approaches, we first used western blotting to compare the axonal or somatodendritic enrichment of TH, βIII-tubulin, and synaptophysin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).

Although we have recently demonstrated a striking absence of axonal translation in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hobson et al., 2021</xref>), these findings also highlight technical differences between the two datasets, since many ribosomal proteins would not have surface residues accessible to cytoplasmic APEX2 labeling. Indeed, we also observed a significant overrepresentation of proteins associated with ‘intracellular organelle lumen’ and ‘mitochondrial matrix’ in the cortical axon data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Nonetheless, the presence of histone proteins in cortical axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chuang et al., 2018</xref>) appears not to be conserved in mature mDA axons: thus, some features of these axonal proteomes are likely cell type specific.</p><p>Among proteins unique to our striatal APEX2 data, we found that the A-type K<sup>+</sup> channel Kv4.3 (<italic>Kcnd3</italic>) and the G-protein-regulated inward-rectifier potassium channel 2 (GIRK2;<italic>Kcnj6</italic>) were present in the VM, MFB, and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Both of these potassium channels are known to be important for mDA neuronal physiology: Kv4.3 channels mediate somatodendritic A-type K<sup>+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>A</sub>) that regulate pacemaker frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haddjeri-Hopkins et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Liss et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Serôdio and Rudy, 1998</xref>), while GIRK2 mediates somatodendritic hyperpolarization downstream of D2 autoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Beckstead et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ford, 2014</xref>). However, the APEX2 labeling of Kv4.3 and GIRK2 from the MFB and striatum was surprising, given that these channels are densely localized within the somatodendritic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Reyes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Rhodes et al., 2004</xref>) and assumed to mediate postsynaptic rather than presynaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lüscher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martel et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore used confocal immunofluorescence to confirm the axonal localization of GIRK2 and Kv4.3 in sagittal sections. As expected, we observed strong labeling of somatodendritic membranes for both proteins in mDA neurons within the VM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e</xref>, <italic>left</italic>). Labeling in the MFB was less intense, but clear colocalization along the course of TH<sup>+</sup> axons was apparent at high magnification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e</xref>, <italic>middle</italic>). Similarly, scattered labeling of the striatal neuropil was colocalized with TH<sup>+</sup> axonal fibers and varicosities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d, e</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Thus, our APEX2 data accurately predict that both Kv4.3 and GIRK2 are present in striatal mDA axons, but are not enriched relative to the somatodendritic compartment.</p><p>In some instances, we observed a few mDA axons crossing myelinated corticospinal tracts that course through the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref>, <italic>right</italic>). Kv4.3 immunoreactivity within these tracts was clearly restricted to TH<sup>+</sup> axonal fibers, indicating that Kv4.3 is present in mDA axons, but not corticospinal axons. These results are consistent with the absence of Kv4.3 in the cortical axon proteomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chuang et al., 2018</xref>) and ultrastructural studies of Kv4.3 localization in the mouse visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Burkhalter et al., 2006</xref>). Future studies are required to determine the functional role of axonal GIRK2 and Kv4.3 in mDA neurons, but the axonal localization of these K<sup>+</sup> channels should be considered when interpreting knockout studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Costa et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McCall et al., 2017</xref>). More broadly, these data suggest that some, but not all, somatodendritic proteins are also in mDA axons. Indeed, consistent with the APEX2 data, we found that immunoreactivity for Homer2, an mDA neuron-enriched postsynaptic protein, is prominently localized within dopaminergic dendrites in the SNr but not within MFB/Str axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The dopaminergic presynaptic proteome via APEX2 labeling in striatal slices and synaptosomes mDA neuron-specific APEX2 labeling in striatal slices provides a convenient means to isolate proteins from dopaminergic axons, but acute slice preparation may not be practical for all laboratories. To further study the presynaptic proteome of dopaminergic axons and provide an alternative to the slice labeling procedure, we conducted APEX2 labeling in synaptosomes prepared from the striatum of DAT-IRES-Cre mice expressing APEX2NES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Synaptosomes are resealed nerve terminals formed by liquid shearing forces during homogenization of brain tissue in isotonic sucrose buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gray and Whittaker, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Whittaker, 1993</xref>). After a brief, low-speed centrifugation to remove heavy cellular debris and nuclei, the majority of synaptosomes can be rapidly recovered in the pellet from moderate-speed centrifugation known as the P2 fraction. Although the P2 fraction also contains myelin and free mitochondria, we reasoned that these contaminants would not interfere with APEX2 labeling within resealed dopaminergic nerve terminals. After isolation and washing of the P2 fraction, reagents were added directly to synaptosomes under typical in vitro APEX2 labeling conditions (30-min incubation with 0.5 mM BP followed by 60 s of 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Similar to the slice procedure, streptavidin–HRP western blotting of striatal P2 lysates showed APEX2-dependent protein biotinylation across a wide range of molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). Staining of labeled P2 samples with fluorescent streptavidin revealed deposition of biotin within TH<sup>+</sup>/V5-APEX2<sup>+</sup> particles approximately ~1 µm in diameter, consistent with APEX2 labeling within dopaminergic synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). We analyzed APEX2-enriched proteins from striatal synaptosomes by MS.

Thus, all of the protein machinery required for DA neurotransmission and metabolism is present within dopaminergic axonal boutons, including monoamine oxidases that metabolize DA and contribute to oxidative phosphorylation via presynaptic mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Graves et al., 2020</xref>). We also found significant enrichment of proteins that contribute to DA vesicular uptake, including most subunits of the vesicular ATPase and SLC10A4, an orphan transporter found on monoaminergic synaptic vesicles that contribute to axonal DA homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Larhammar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p><p>Striatal DA release is powerfully modulated by nicotinic receptors and DA D2 receptors on dopaminergic axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Sulzer et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with pharmacological studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Exley and Cragg, 2008</xref>), we found that β2 and α4 nicotinic receptor subunits were enriched by APEX2 in striatal slices and synaptosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Despite a wealth of functional evidence supporting their presence on mDA axons, the DA D2 receptor as well as β3, α5, and α6 nicotinic receptor subunits were notably absent from our dataset. Since the vast majority of APEX2 labeling occurs on tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Udeshi et al., 2017</xref>), some membrane proteins may not be labeled if they lack cytoplasm-facing tyrosine residues accessible to BP radicals. However, the absence of these nicotinic receptor subunits and the DA D2 receptor is likely related to MS, since none of these membrane proteins were detected in any bulk striatal tissue sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>, gray boxes). Thus, the absence of a protein in our dataset does not necessarily indicate the absence in mDA axons, especially when other functionally related proteins are enriched. For example, we found significant APEX2 enrichment of β-anchoring and -regulatory protein (BARP), a protein recently shown to interact with and modulate α6/β2/β3 nicotinic receptors on dopaminergic axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Similarly, we find significant APEX2 enrichment of D2 receptor-interacting proteins (e.g., G protein subunits and neuronal calcium sensor NCS-1) and downstream effectors (e.g., adenylyl cyclase and PKA subunits) known to function within mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dragicevic et al., 2014</xref>). We also found significant enrichment of voltage gated potassium channels Kv1.2 and Kv1.6, consistent with previous work on Kv1 channels as downstream effectors of presynaptic D2 receptor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Martel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>).</p><p>We next focused on the dopaminergic presynapse, using the SynGO resource (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Koopmans et al., 2019</xref>) to analyze the 1,348 proteins enriched in APEX2<sup>+</sup> striatal slice and synaptosome samples. Ontology terms such as ‘presynapse’, ‘synaptic vesicle’, and ‘presynaptic active zone’ were all highly over-represented among APEX2-enriched proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Consistent with recent work on the molecular architecture of striatal DA release sites, APEX2 labeling of striatal and synaptosome samples significantly enriched active zone proteins RIM1, Bassoon, Liprin-α2 and -α3, Munc13-1, ELKS1/2, and RIM-BP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>), although ELKS1/2 and RIM-BP2 are not essential for DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Banerjee et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Coverage of synaptic vesicle trafficking and fusion proteins was extensive, with significant enrichment of all major integral synaptic vesicle proteins (SV2A-C, CSPα, Synaptogyrin1–3, Synaptophysin, Synapsin-1, RAB3A-C, VAMP-2), target SNAREs (Syntaxin 1A/B, SNAP25), and functionally related proteins (NSF, SNAP-α/β, Munc18-1, Complexin1/2, and α/β/γ-synuclein). We also observed a significant enrichment of CAPS1 and CAPS2, proteins that prime synaptic vesicles in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jockusch et al., 2007</xref>) and regulate catecholamine loading into large dense-core vesicles in adrenal chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Speidel et al., 2005</xref>) but whose function is to our knowledge unexplored in mDA neurons. Notably, we find significant enrichment of Synaptotagmins-1 and -7 (Syt-1/Syt-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). These data support the recent finding that Syt-1 is the major fast Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for synchronous DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Banerjee et al., 2020b</xref>). In addition to the established role of Syt-7 in somatodendritic DA release and the observation of its presence in DA axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Delignat-Lavaud et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Mendez et al., 2011</xref>), our findings support Syt-7 as a candidate protein for asynchronous axonal DA release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Banerjee et al., 2020b</xref>). These data highlight candidate proteins for further investigation and provide a proteomic architecture of the dopaminergic presynapse that is highly consistent with recent functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Banerjee et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Banerjee et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Liu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, we also found significant APEX2 enrichment of proteins with SynGO annotations for ontology terms related to postsynaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Many of these proteins were annotated for both pre- and postsynaptic function, including proteins such as DAT and VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Although these proteins are present within dopaminergic dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Nirenberg et al., 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nirenberg et al., 1996b</xref>), they are clearly derived from dopaminergic axons in our striatal APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples. Similarly, many proteins with postsynaptic annotations were functionally related to actin dynamics, PKA or MTOR signaling, or other functions not exclusively related to postsynaptic function. Other proteins bearing only postsynaptic SynGO annotations, such as the Netrin receptor DCC and metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR1, have functional evidence supporting their localization on mDA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Reynolds et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Zhang and Sulzer, 2003</xref>). Nonetheless, 63 proteins with clear roles in dendrites were enriched by APEX2 in both slice and synaptosome samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Two-thirds of these proteins were also present in cortical axons in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chuang et al., 2018</xref>), and they were significantly lower in abundance than proteins with presynaptic annotations in both datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Despite significant biological and technical differences in these two studies, the correlation of protein abundance was similar for proteins with pre- or postsynaptic annotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility of low levels of post-synaptic contamination, the significant depletion of proteins highly expressed by glia and striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>) demonstrates the absence of extensive cross-membrane labeling. Furthermore, we observed no enrichment of DARPP-32 and Spinophilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>), proteins highly abundant within striatal dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Blom et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greengard et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Smith et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>APEX2 enrichment in all regions can provide additional evidence of axonal localization for proteins often found in the postsynapse. For example, GABA receptors are typically present on dendrites, but recent electrochemical and electrophysiological studies have demonstrated the presence of both GABA-A and GABA-B receptors on mDA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kramer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lopes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Schmitz et al., 2002</xref>). We found that GABA-A receptor subunits and scaffolding protein gephyrin were most abundant in VM APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples, but still higher in APEX2<sup>+</sup> than APEX2<sup>−</sup> samples from both MFB and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Similar results were obtained for GABA-B receptor subunits, the PDZ scaffold Mupp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balasubramanian et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Although many comparisons did not pass the FDR correction in MFB comparisons, likely due to substantially lower proteomic depth in these samples, APEX2 enrichment in both MFB and striatal samples supports axonal transport and localization of these proteins.</p><p>Axonal APEX2 proteomics allowed us to identify proteins and protein complexes that are previously undescribed in striatal mDA axons. The cytosolic chaperonin T-complex protein 1-ring complex (TRiC), or chaperonin containing T-complex (CCT) is an oligomeric complex that promotes folding of newly synthesized polypeptides, suppresses aggregation of huntingtin in Huntington’s disease, and can inhibit assembly of α-synuclein amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Lopez et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sot et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tam et al., 2009</xref>).

We detected seven out of eight TRiC subunits in our APEX2 proteomics data, six of which showed strong evidence of axonal localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2d</xref>). These results suggest that the recently described interaction between CCT5/CCTε, CDK5, and tau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chen et al., 2018</xref>) may regulate retrograde transport in mDA neurons. Given that TRiC/CCT can regulate α-synuclein aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sot et al., 2017</xref>), future research on TRiC/CCT function in dopaminergic axons is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Subcellular localization of proteins encoded by mDA neuron-enriched genes</title><p>Genetic analysis can identify mutations that cause familial PD or variants linked to sporadic PD risk, but not whether the relevant genes are expressed in mDA neurons.

In contrast, a majority of proteins encoded by mDA neuron-enriched genes (35 out of 55, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>) were preferentially localized to dopaminergic axons (FDR &lt;0.05 for APEX2<sup>+</sup> striatal vs. VM samples). mDA neuron-enriched genes encoding striatal APEX2-enriched proteins included many canonical synaptic vesicle and active zone proteins mentioned above (e.g., Bassoon, Syt-1, Complexin-1/2, SV2B/C, RAB3C, CAPS2), highlighting a striking proportion of mDA neuronal gene expression dedicated to presynaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Another group of APEX2<sup>+</sup> striatum-enriched proteins were those involved in DA synthesis and transmission, including AADC, TH, DAT, and GTP cyclohydrolase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>).</p><p>The axonal enrichment of Syt-17 is also of particular interest, given that human SYT17 lies within a PD risk locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nalls et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>Syt17</italic> mRNA is enriched in mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Syt-17 is an atypical synaptotagmin that does not bind calcium or participate in synaptic vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ruhl et al., 2019</xref>) and has no established role in axons. Although hippocampal neurons from Syt-17 knockout mice display axonal growth defects, tagged Syt-17 is found in the Golgi complex of these cells and this phenotype appears to be mediated by deficits in vesicular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Ruhl et al., 2019</xref>). We found additional evidence of Syt-17 localization in mDA neurons, including axons, via a Syt-17-EGFP mouse in the GENSAT Brain atlas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Heintz, 2004</xref>). We are currently investigating the unknown function of SYT-17 in dopaminergic axons. Thus, our APEX2 proteomic dataset elucidates the subcellular localization of proteins encoded by genes within PD risk loci and highlights novel areas for further study of mDA neuronal cell biology.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study demonstrates APEX2 labeling and MS-based proteomics of axonal and somatodendritic compartments of mDA neurons in the mouse brain. Thus, APEX2 labeling in acute brain slices provides a general approach for cell type-specific proteomics and/or proximity labeling proteomics in the mouse brain (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dumrongprechachan et al., 2021</xref>), alongside promiscuous biotin ligase (BioID or TurboID)-catalyzed proximity labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>) and incorporation of non-canonical amino acids via mutant tRNA synthetases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krogager et al., 2018</xref>). Each of these methods has advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>The major advantages of APEX2 are speed and efficiency: we were able to capture thousands of proteins from multiple subcellular compartments of a relatively rare neuronal population in individual mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In comparison, BioID and TurboID labeling in the mouse brain typically requires over 7 days and pooling tissue from many mice, precluding the use of individual mice as biological replicates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Takano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Uezu et al., 2016</xref>). The mutant tRNA synthetase methods label all synthesized proteins during 7–21 days of noncanonical amino acid administration, which complicates dynamic studies of specific protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Krogager et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to its high efficiency, the speed of APEX2 labeling enables dynamic studies of protein complexes on a time scale of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Lobingier et al., 2017</xref>), including during physiological responses in the mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). Future studies might combine APEX2 labeling with optical and electrophysiological slice manipulations to interrogate rapid changes in neuronal physiology at the proteomic level. Beyond neurons, selective expression of APEX2 fusion proteins will broadly facilitate proteomic profiling of organelles and protein–protein interactions within a variety of genetically targeted brain cells.</p><p>APEX2 labeling in the mouse brain has several limitations compared to other aforementioned methods. First, the introduction of labeling reagents required preparation of acute brain slices or synaptosomes, which would preclude labeling during long-term behavioral or environmental manipulations (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alvarez-Castelao et al., 2017</xref>). Second, the high efficiency of APEX2 may lead to low levels of off-target protein labeling. Although we observed biotin labeling within morphologically intact mDA axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and significant depletion of proteins specific to striatal SPNs and glia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>), we cannot completely exclude post-synaptic contamination. We propose at least four possible explanations for the detection of proteins with ‘postsynapse’ annotations in striatal APEX2 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1e</xref>). First, it is possible that many canonical ‘postsynaptic’ proteins are also localized within mDA axons. For example, we and others have shown that NMDA receptors are present on mDA axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fortin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Schmitz et al., 2009</xref>), and most members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (PSD-93, PSD-95, SAP-102, SAP-97) and Shank families have been observed in axons and/or nerve terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arnold and Clapham, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Halbedl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Müller et al., 1995</xref>). Indeed, comparison to a previously published dataset revealed that two-thirds of the ‘postsynapse’ annotated proteins were also present in cultured cortical axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chuang et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, we clearly demonstrated the axonal localization of Kv4.3 and GIRK2, potassium channels typically assumed to be present only within the somatodendritic compartment of mDA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Second, it is possible that a small amount of APEX2 is transferred between mDA axons and postsynaptic compartments during slice preparation and synaptosome homogenization. Third, it is possible that BP radicals directly cross damaged axonal and synaptosomal membranes during APEX2 labeling. Finally, it is possible that biotinylated proteins present only in APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples provide surfaces for nonspecific binding of nonbiotinylated proteins. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, but appear to produce similar results in both slice and synaptosome labeling environments.</p><p>Although the slice procedure may not be accessible to all laboratories, APEX2 labeling in synaptosomes provides a simple and rapid alternative to access the presynaptic proteome of genetically targeted projection neurons. Somewhat surprisingly, we found that the APEX2 proteome of dopaminergic synaptosomes is largely comparable to that of the entire axonal arbor within the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). We suspect this is due to the high density of boutons <italic>en passant</italic> along dopaminergic axons, which would provide a strong representation of the entire axonal proteome upon resealing as synaptosomes. Our data thus highlight the utility of the synaptosome sorting technique developed by Herzog et al. as a complementary approach for study of the presynaptic proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Biesemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Paget-Blanc, 2021</xref>). Future work will determine whether the strong correlation between axonal and synaptosomal proteomes is a unique feature of mDA neurons.</p><p>MS-based quantification of proteins provides significant advantages over immunohistochemical methods, especially for fine structures like dopaminergic axons. Suitable antibodies that provide high-quality immunofluorescence in brain tissue are not available for a majority of the proteome, and off-target binding affects the reproducibility and interpretation of research findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Rhodes and Trimmer, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Weller, 2016</xref>). Many studies rely on overexpression of tagged proteins to establish localization, which can result in mislocalization and altered function. Our study demonstrates proximity labeling of endogenous proteins within subcellular compartments of genetically targeted neurons, and can thus be used for unbiased discovery as well as protein-targeted biochemical experiments.</p><p>While they represent the vast majority of neuronal volume and are critically important to DA biology, dopaminergic axons have remained largely inaccessible to proteomic study. Due to the relative immaturity, limited axonal complexity, and incomplete synaptic and hormonal inputs of cultured mDA neurons, we chose to examine the mDA neuronal proteome in native brain tissue of adult mice. Cytoplasmic labeling in dopaminergic axons captured a diverse range of cytosolic and membrane proteins involved in metabolism, protein transport, endolysosomal trafficking, synaptic transmission, and autophagy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Thus, our axonal proteomic dataset should be broadly useful to axonal and neuronal cell biologists.</p><p>The axonal enrichment of autophagy-related proteins is of particular importance to mDA neurons, given that autophagy dysfunction is heavily implicated in PD pathophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wong and Cuervo, 2010</xref>) and associated with methamphetamine toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Larsen et al., 2002</xref>). Due to the limitations of bulk striatal tissue-based protein measurements, our previous studies of autophagy in mDA axons were limited to electrochemical measurement of DA release and morphological changes via electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>). APEX2 labeling will enable future studies of protein biochemistry in mDA axons, including proteins that are ubiquitously expressed and difficult to resolve using immunohistochemistry.</p><p>A majority of mDA neuron-enriched genes encode proteins localized to axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>), suggesting that this compartment is central to the identity of mDA neurons. Regardless of expression specificity, the bulk of total protein within mDA neurons is present within their striatal axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These findings may be particularly important for understanding pathogenic mechanisms in PD, wherein the axon is often considered the primary site of degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burke and O’Malley, 2013</xref>). Thus, the massive axons of mDA neurons can be considered a double-edged sword: while they are required for DA release to support healthy brain function, they are susceptible to myriad environmental and genetic insults.</p><p>We note that the biggest risk factor for idiopathic PD is aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sulzer, 2007</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the proteomic framework and cytoarchitecture of mDA neurons in the mammalian brain evolved under positive selective pressure related to motor control, reward, and motivation, with little selective pressure related to the organism’s lifespan. Comparing the axonal proteome of mDA neurons to that of other neurons spared from degeneration in PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Surmeier et al., 2017</xref>) may identify distinguishing features that contribute to increased risk of axonal degeneration in PD. Thus, our study lays a proteomic foundation upon which future studies of neuronal cell biology and PD pathophysiology may build.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male and female mice (6–12 months old) were used in all experiments.

Protein abbreviations and corresponding full protein names are provided as source data for each respective figure.</p><p>Unless otherwise noted, all statistical analysis and data visualization were conducted in Python using <italic>SciPy</italic>, <italic>Matplotlib</italic>, and <italic>Seaborn</italic> packages. For visualization of proteomics data (log–log abundance plots, <italic>Z</italic>-scores, clustered heatmaps, etc.), total intensity normalized protein abundances were log<sub>2</sub> transformed after adding 1.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers and the Reviewing editor agreed that additional protein validation is needed, potentially with orthogonal antibody staining approaches. While the synaptosome preps presented are supportive of the BioIDs, and may facilitate candidate selection, the synaptosome preps do not obviate the need for an orthogonal approach. In protein validation, the target could be evaluated in other circuits as well which would help provide insight into how unique the localization in the dopaminergic neurons really is compared to other types of neurons.</p><p>2) All reviewers and the Reviewing editor were confused by the steps taken by the authors to normalize the data. Two of the reviewer's thought that it is critical to normalize the abundance of biotinylated proteins from one lysate to the next to the amount of APEX2 enzyme present in the lysate, or provide a justification of why more peroxidase expression would not be expected to label more distinct protein substrates and label protein substrates to a higher level? Normalization methods of all mass spectrometry data should be included briefly in all relevant figure legends, as well as a clear work-flow in the Methods section.</p><p>3) Two reviewers thought the comparative analysis of the PD GWAS data with the proteome IDs was imprecise at best, and potentially misleading. Some specific concerns include the conflation of strong recessive, dominant, and risk factor variants with potentially incorrect gene assignments, arbitrary inclusion of some genes and not others, overly relaxed false-discovery rates, and heavy implicit bias. All reviewers and Reviewing Editor agreed that the manuscript would be more focused without these experiments and the related claims about the heritable aspects of PD and PD-associated diseases.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The following suggestions for improvement are provided per figure for clarity, although some may be relevant more globally;</p><p>Figure 1 is generally showing that the technique works in vivo and is good. One small question is with 1d, where it appears that the V5APEX2 expression is higher in the striatum than in midbrain. Was this consistently seen and might it influence detection sensitivity later in the paper? It would be important to add a reference protein for loading to 1d and quantify relative expression in the two regions.</p><p>Figure 2 is the main results figure and again largely makes sense. Here, I would again like to see an evaluation of the amount of V5-APEX2 in each region relative to control, so we can understand the apparent discrepancy between number of proteins detected and % biotinylation between ventral midbrain and striatum. It is notable here that the control is different from figure 1, which was -H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, vs no APEX2. It would therefore be important to include validation experiments using immunoblotting and also include the controls from figure 1 to be sure that these are dependent on APEX2 activity.</p><p>Figure 3 is generally fine apart from the discrepancy in FDR p values selected for cutoffs. FDR&lt;0.15 is too liberal, especially given that log fold cutoffs appear not to have been applied and that t-tests were used without evaluation of normal distributions that would be difficult from low n of samples. Again some validation of key results is needed.</p><p>Figure 4 particularly needs validation of proteins that are expected to be post-synaptic. I am sure that the literature distinctions between pre and post synaptic are less rigid than might be inferred, but some evaluation of accuracy of this separation is needed.</p><p>Figure 5 is the figure that has most problems. Figure 5a is a schematic and 5b tells us that there is partial agreement between proteome and scRNA-seq, which is to be expected. But, 5c, has little informational quality for multiple reasons. For GWAS SNPS, the selection of nearest gene to lead SNP is only true in some uncertain proportion of loci so whether INPP5F is the gene at the Chr10 locus that includes BAG3 and RGS10 is impossible to evaluate. For the smaller set of Mendelian loci, whether we should combine PD and atypical and dystonia is hard to evaluate. At the same time, there are multiple loci that are not in this set – LRRK2 and GBA being very obvious. So at best, this dataset says that some PD genes are in dopamine neurons, which is unsurprising, but not all PD genes are dopamine neuronal. The real problem here is in decision of numerator and denominator. For other tools more widely used in GWAS (FUMA, MAGMA etc) the test set is all candidate genes vs all expressed in a given cell type. Here, the authors compare a set they detect in the cells and then look for cell body vs axon enrichment, which is fundamentally less precise or informative. Authors should look for enrichment within each dataset for all Mendelian PD genes or all GWAs hits, which should include all reasonable candidates within LD-defined bounds of each locus. Even if this turns out to be more than chance, the authors must discuss limitations – DJ-1 is found here but very notably not PINK1/parkin. Such patterns might easily be explained by chance ordering of proteins in Str vs VM and should be discussed adequately.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. When doing streptavidin-dependent pulldowns of biotinylated proteins the authors write 'immunoprecipitation'. This is not correct since no antibodies are used. The authors should be technically correct and talk about 'pull-downs' or 'streptavidin-dependent purification of biotinylated proteins.' I realize most readers will understand what they are trying to say, but for such a technically excellent paper I think the authors shouldn't use wrong terminology.</p><p>2. In some instances I found the figures to be overly 'busy'. For example, Figure 3d is very busy with a great deal of speculation included about protein function. No studies here actually test biology of the candidates identified by mass spectrometry. The faith (and I label it as such) placed in GO analysis by the authors is not justified. On the other hand, I applaud the authors for attempting to place some of the identified proteins in biological context. What I'd prefer to see is a bit of a disclaimer about the robustness of GO analysis and also include more statements about how this is a discovery approach that will require many follow-up studies to elucidate protein function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The compendium seems rigorous and potentially useful to the field in understanding TH neurons in the SNpc.</p><p>1. I do not understand why biotinlyated protein abundance in the different preparations from the different compartments are not normalized to APEX2 abundance in the relative quantifications. Overall, the process of normalization was unclear, including how differing AAV transduction efficiency is factored into calculated biotinylated proteins. Unless i am fundamentally mistaken, APEX2 labeling occurs so quickly that the relative abundance of enzyme will influence not only the number of proteins that the mass spectrometry analysis can identify, but also the relative abundance when comparing one preparation of protein to the next.</p><p>2. Along those lines, since there are simply more proteins IDed in the striatum, with a larger 'interactome' afforded by more substrate material, and with higher possible proportional abundance of APEX2 , it makes sense that there are more PD- GWAS genes identified in the striatal lysates. Would the same be true for any compendium of neuronal genes?</p><p>3. Along those lines, are the 'novel' post-synaptic and other proteins identified in the striatum something that is unique to SNpc cells, or present in other subsets of neurons. The implication of involvement in PD seems overly speculative without real support.</p><p>4. Beyond the proteomic IDs, orthogonal methods of detecting some of the non-expected post-synaptic proteins in the striatum are mandatory for interpreting the validity of the IDs.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Subcellular proteomics of dopamine neurons in the mouse brain reveals axonal enrichment of proteins encoded by Parkinson's disease-linked genes&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor and a Reviewing Editor. The consensus discussion of the reviewers and editors is summarized below. We will look forward to hearing from you with a revised article and a response letter describing the changes made.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript has been greatly improved but all reviewers concur that there are some remaining issues that must be addressed. All reviewers applaud the quality and rigor of revised data and corresponding Figures 1-5. The reviewers and editors agree that the authors have carefully considered concerns and addressed the major questions surrounding methods and rationale for normalization of data as well as validation of key DA axon enriched proteins using orthogonal approaches. Further the flawed statistical analysis of axonal vs. somatodendritic enrichment for PD genes was removed.</p><p>However, a lingering remnant of the flawed enrichment dataset in PD is inappropriately held over (e.g., the title of the manuscript which must be revised). The reviewers and editors think that the enrichment strategy (Figure 6) continues to suffer from an imprecise GWAS list of genes that inaccurately infers a particular gene at a locus when the actual gene may not be known with the degree of precision required here. Further, the APEX2 strategy biases towards certain proteins and not others that are known to be important in PD but were excluded. For example, well-known PD-associated genes like LRRK2 and GBA might be excluded because the cytoplasmic APEX2 enzyme does not access many endolysosomal proteins, favoring instead distributed proteins with bias. APEX2 is not distributed in the soma in all compartments evenly, and may exclude important mitochondrial genes. The imprecision and bias in both approaches combined, yields a meaningless dataset that is included in Figure 6 and related Supplementary files. Even without these flaws, without comparator datasets, it is not clear whether there would be similar enrichments in any neuronal context, or what the non-neuronal proteome might be. Thus, Figure 6 and all related text referring to PD and PD enrichment that utilizes PD-linked genes should be removed, including references in the title and Supplementary files. The editors acknowledge that removal of these analyses may have an impact on authorship.</p><p>All reviewers felt that Figures 1-5 and related text were exciting and had sufficient impact on their own.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70921.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) All reviewers and the Reviewing editor agreed that additional protein validation is needed, potentially with orthogonal antibody staining approaches.

We have also added a comparison of our mDA axonal proteomics data to a previously published dataset of cultured cortical axons (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1). Despite major differences in neuronal maturity, cell type, and methodology, we find that many features of our axonal proteome are conserved in cortical axons. However, we also identify axonal localization of proteins that appears specific to mature mDA neurons or to embryonic cortical neurons. Of particular interest, we use immunohistochemistry to confirm the axonal localization of Kv4.3 and GIRK2 in mDA neurons (new Figure 4), both of which are ion channels that had been presumed to be exclusively somatodendritic.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) All reviewers and the Reviewing editor were confused by the steps taken by the authors to normalize the data. Two of the reviewer's thought that it is critical to normalize the abundance of biotinylated proteins from one lysate to the next to the amount of APEX2 enzyme present in the lysate, or provide a justification of why more peroxidase expression would not be expected to label more distinct protein substrates and label protein substrates to a higher level? Normalization methods of all mass spectrometry data should be included briefly in all relevant figure legends, as well as a clear work-flow in the Methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the normalization of the mass spectrometry data. The Methods section “Proteomic Differential Expression Analysis and Filtering” explained that we used total intensity (i.e., the sum of all protein intensities within a given sample) to normalize protein abundances. We have expanded this section for added clarity (page 22):</p><p>“Total intensity normalized, log2 transformed protein abundances were used for visualization, clustering, and all differential abundance analyses. […] Differential abundance testing consisted of a Welch’s (unequal variance) t-test with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the False discovery rate (FDR).”</p><p>and to assist readers, in the figure captions where we previously specified “log2(normalized intensity +1)”, we now write “log2(total intensity normalized abundance + 1)”. In addition, given the confusion about relative vs. absolute protein abundances, we have added further clarification to the Results section (page 6):</p><p>“To identify APEX2-dependent proteins captured by streptavidin pulldown, we normalized protein abundances to total protein intensity within each sample (see Methods) and directly compared APEX2<sup>+</sup> to APEX2<sup>-</sup> control samples (Figure 2e). […] We emphasize that the normalized proteomics data report on the <italic>relative abundance</italic> of proteins (relative to all protein captured by streptavidin pulldown in each sample), while the <italic>absolute abundance</italic> determined by western blot (Figure 2b) shows that most of the DA neuronal protein mass is axonal.”</p><p>Regarding normalization to the amount of APEX2, this concern is addressed in detail in several responses to reviewers below. Briefly, we find no evidence that the cytoplasmic abundance of APEX2 across mDA neuronal compartments is biased compared to other cytoplasmic proteins. Thus, axon vs. somatodendritic comparisons are unlikely to be affected by mouse-to-mouse variability in APEX2 expression, as the VM, MFB, and Str samples all come from the same mouse. The reviewers are correct that large differences in APEX2 expression (i.e., transduction efficiency of the AAV) between mice might be a concern for the extent of labeling. However, as we show in the manuscript, our biological replicates are highly reproducible in both the number of proteins identified and the correlation between within-group samples. Thus, viral expression is not a major source of variability between mice in our study. We found that the total intensity (i.e., the sum of all mapped peptides/proteins) was more variable between samples in the raw mass spectrometry data, likely due to technical variability in the LC-MS/MS data acquisition. As we show below, total intensity normalization and normalization to APEX2 produce virtually identical effect sizes (log2 fold changes), but total intensity normalization is much better at reducing within-group variability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Two reviewers thought the comparative analysis of the PD GWAS data with the proteome IDs was imprecise at best, and potentially misleading. Some specific concerns include the conflation of strong recessive, dominant, and risk factor variants with potentially incorrect gene assignments, arbitrary inclusion of some genes and not others, overly relaxed false-discovery rates, and heavy implicit bias. All reviewers and Reviewing Editor agreed that the manuscript would be more focused without these experiments and the related claims about the heritable aspects of PD and PD-associated diseases.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that the claims about heritable aspects of PD are unnecessary, and the points about grouping of recessive, dominant, and risk factor variants from GWAS for joint analysis are well-taken. Therefore, rather than conduct an underpowered analysis with each of these groups independently, we have chosen to remove the statistical analysis of axonal vs. somatodendritic enrichment for PD genes as a group (now Figure 6).</p><p>However, we disagree that the data should be removed from the manuscript. Assuming a protein has equal relative abundance in the somatodendritic and axonal cytoplasm, our protein abundance data suggest that ~90% of the total protein would then be axonal. It is therefore important to consider axonal localization in cell biology studies of PD-linked proteins, regardless of whether PD-linked proteins are statistically enriched in axons as a group compared to all neuronal proteins. Our dataset does not detect all PD-linked proteins, which could be due to the underlying cell biology (e.g., low expression levels in mDA neurons, such as LRRK2) or technical reasons (e.g., not detected by mass spec, or not accessible to cytoplasmic APEX2 labeling, such as GBA, which encodes a luminal lysosomal enzyme). Although we agree that these limitations preclude robust statistical analysis for PD-linked proteins as a group, we believe the localization pattern of the proteins we detect is of interest to the field, as it may provide insight on axonal proteins involved in PD neurodegeneration. We have modified the figure (now Figure 6c), the Results, and the Discussion to reflect these changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The following suggestions for improvement are provided per figure for clarity, although some may be relevant more globally;</p><p>Figure 1 is generally showing that the technique works in vivo and is good. One small question is with 1d, where it appears that the V5-APEX2 expression is higher in the striatum than in midbrain. Was this consistently seen and might it influence detection sensitivity later in the paper? It would be important to add a reference protein for loading to 1d and quantify relative expression in the two regions.</p></disp-quote><p>The western blot in Figure 1d is VM/Str tissue lysates first probed with streptavidin HRP and subsequently re-probed with anti-V5/APEX2. As noted in the manuscript, probing brain lysates or streptavidin pulldowns with streptavidin HRP produces strong bands in all lanes at ~75 and ~150 kDa, which are endogenously biotinylated proteins. These are labeled ‘ebp’ in Figure 1d and serve as an internal control that demonstrates equal protein loading. We note that the amount of V5-APEX2 in each sample is a function of:</p><p>1) the density of mDA neurons/axons in the tissue (VM vs. Str)</p><p>2) the relative abundance of APEX2 within the somatodendritic and axonal compartments of mDA neurons (VM vs. Str)</p><p>Even with equal protein loading, there is no expectation that V5-APEX2 levels should appear equal by tissue western blot, since mDA cell bodies/dendrites vs. axons do not comprise an equal fraction of total protein for VM and striatal tissue, respectively. Given the NES tag, we expect V5-APEX2 to be evenly distributed throughout the axonal and somatodendritic cytoplasm. The western blot in Figure 1d likely reflects a higher fractional protein contribution from mDA neurons in the striatum compared to the VM, and cannot quantify relative V5-APEX2 expression within the mDA neuronal cytoplasm. Instead, we analyzed the fluorescence intensity of TH, tdTomato, and V5-APEX immunostaining in confocal images of DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup>/Ai9<sup>tdTomato</sup> mice injected with AAV5-CAG-DIO-APEX2-NES.</p><p>As shown in the new panels Figure 1—figure supplement 1c-d, we found no evidence that the concentration of APEX2 is higher in mDA axons than in soma and dendrites: rather, it appears that the concentration of APEX2, TH, and tdTomato may be slightly higher in the soma. We now report in the Results (page 4):</p><p>“All three markers displayed intense staining throughout the DA neuronal cytoplasm, including dendrites in the VM and axonal projections in the striatum</p><p>(Figure 1b). […] Thus, injection of Cre-dependent AAV-APEX2NES (hereafter referred to as APEX2) into the VM of DAT<sup>IRES-Cre</sup> mice leads to robust expression of APEX2 throughout the DA neuronal cytoplasm.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 is the main results figure and again largely makes sense. Here, I would again like to see an evaluation of the amount of V5-APEX2 in each region relative to control, so we can understand the apparent discrepancy between number of proteins detected and % biotinylation between ventral midbrain and striatum. It is notable here that the control is different from figure 1, which was -H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, vs no APEX2. It would therefore be important to include validation experiments using immunoblotting and also include the controls from figure 1 to be sure that these are dependent on APEX2 activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully point out that the ‘amount of V5-APEX2 in each region relative to control’ is a misunderstanding, as the controls in these experiments do not have APEX2. The discrepancy between number of proteins detected and % biotinylation is expected due to the <italic>greater total abundance</italic> of mDA neuronal cytoplasm, and thus V5-APEX2, in the striatum. As demonstrated above, these differences do not reflect a higher relative abundance of V5-APEX2 within mDA axons, but rather that majority of the total mDA neuronal volume is axonal.</p><p>Regarding the controls, as established by the Ting Lab (Hung et al., Nat Protocols 2016): “Negative controls are performed alongside, with APEX2 omitted, BP omitted or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> omitted.” We have used all three controls in our work. In Figure 1, we show that in the presence of APEX2, omission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or BP leads to a complete absence of biotinylation. In Figure 2b, we show that biotinylation is undetectable in the absence of APEX2 (aside from endogenously biotinylated proteins). However, it is possible that very low levels of endogenous peroxidases could catalyze BP and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-dependent labeling in the absence of APEX2. The omission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> would not capture such low level labeling, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is also likely to have biological effects on slices that could potentially alter non-specific binding to the streptavidin beads. Therefore, we feel that for proteomics experiments, omission of APEX2 is the best control for endogenous peroxidase activity and non-specific binding, rather than omission of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3 is generally fine apart from the discrepancy in FDR p values selected for cutoffs. FDR&lt;0.15 is too liberal, especially given that log fold cutoffs appear not to have been applied and that t-tests were used without evaluation of normal distributions that would be difficult from low n of samples. Again some validation of key results is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion: the GO analysis was conducted only on APEX2-enriched proteins that met the criteria of FDR &lt; 0.05 for VM vs. Str. As shown in the center of Figure 3, there are two shades of red/blue used to color proteins based on the significance of VM vs. Str enrichment: a darker shade for those meeting FDR &lt; 0.05 (121/149, 81% of proteins shown), and another for those meeting FDR &lt; 0.15 (12/149, 8% of proteins shown). Proteins present in both compartments at roughly equal levels are shown in gray (16/149, 11% of proteins shown). The goal was to include a more complete representation of detected proteins relevant to the Ontologies shown. As an example, the glycolytic enzymes HK1 and GAPDH were detected in all APEX2 samples but were not differentially abundant in the VM vs. Str comparison. However, 7/9 of the other glycolytic enzymes were found to be enriched in Str &gt; VM (shown in dark red) and thus Glycolysis is highlighted as a Str-enriched Gene Ontology. Rather than omit HK1 and GAPDH from the figure, we show these proteins in grey to indicate that they are detected in both compartments, but not differentially abundant.</p><p>To highlight the validity of our Str vs. VM comparisons using an orthogonal approach, we measured the log2 fold change (Str/VM) for several proteins using western blotting. As shown in new Figure 4a-b, the effect sizes determined by western blot (absolute abundance) and proteomics (relative abundance) are well correlated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 particularly needs validation of proteins that are expected to be post-synaptic. I am sure that the literature distinctions between pre and post synaptic are less rigid than might be inferred, but some evaluation of accuracy of this separation is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The previous Figure 4 (now Figure 5) did not show proteins that are expected to be post-synaptic, and we surmise that the reviewer is referring to previous Figure 4—figure supplement 1 (now Figure 5—figure supplement 1). As noted in the discussion, distinguishing the ultrastructural localization of these broadly expressed proteins would require immunoelectron microscopy and suitable antibodies, and the often poor binding specificity of most antibody reagents is a major concern for reproducibility, especially in brain IHC studies (PMID 16885215). Indeed, we found that many of the antibodies we purchased produced non-specific IHC staining and numerous bands on western blot that precluded identification of the correct protein (not shown). These experiments often require knockout cells/mice to be properly interpreted.</p><p>For some proteins we identified, such as Syt17, visualization of protein localization requires expression of tagged fusion proteins (Ruhl et al., 2019, PMID 31387992). In this case, we found orthogonal evidence of Syt17 in mDA neurons via the GENSAT project mouse that expresses a Syt17-EGFP fusion protein. EGFP staining of these mice showed intense labeling of mDA neurons in the midbrain as well as their axons in the MFB and striatum (new Figure 6—figure supplement 3).</p><p>While recognizing the limitations with antibodies, we found that knockout-validated antibodies for Kv4.3 and GIRK2 were suitable for high resolution confocal immunohistochemistry (new Figure 4d-e). These ion channels are known to be highly expressed in the somatodendritic compartment of mDA neurons, but previous work suggested that GIRK2 was not present in mDA axons (Martel et al., 2011, PMID 21647367). Our APEX2 data showed that while were Kv4.3 and GIRK2 were higher in VM vs. Str samples, both proteins were present in mDA axons. Consistent with the APEX2 data, we demonstrate that immunoreactivity for Kv4.3 and GIRK2 co-localized with mDA axons within the MFB and the striatal neuropil (new Figure 4d-e). As noted in the immunostaining and comparison to cortical axon proteomics, the axonal localization of these ion channels in mDA neurons is not shared with cortical neurons. These data support our finding that some, but not all, canonical somatodendritic proteins are localized to mDA axons. Indeed, consistent with the APEX2 data, we show that Homer2, an mDA neuron-enriched post-synaptic protein, is prominently localized within dopaminergic dendrites in the SNr but not within MFB/Str axons (new Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5 is the figure that has most problems. Figure 5a is a schematic and 5b tells us that there is partial agreement between proteome and scRNA-seq, which is to be expected. But, 5c, has little informational quality for multiple reasons. For GWAS SNPS, the selection of nearest gene to lead SNP is only true in some uncertain proportion of loci so whether INPP5F is the gene at the Chr10 locus that includes BAG3 and RGS10 is impossible to evaluate. For the smaller set of Mendelian loci, whether we should combine PD and atypical and dystonia is hard to evaluate. At the same time, there are multiple loci that are not in this set – LRRK2 and GBA being very obvious. So at best, this dataset says that some PD genes are in dopamine neurons, which is unsurprising, but not all PD genes are dopamine neuronal. The real problem here is in decision of numerator and denominator. For other tools more widely used in GWAS (FUMA, MAGMA etc) the test set is all candidate genes vs all expressed in a given cell type. Here, the authors compare a set they detect in the cells and then look for cell body vs axon enrichment, which is fundamentally less precise or informative. Authors should look for enrichment within each dataset for all Mendelian PD genes or all GWAs hits, which should include all reasonable candidates within LD-defined bounds of each locus. Even if this turns out to be more than chance, the authors must discuss limitations – DJ-1 is found here but very notably not PINK1/parkin. Such patterns might easily be explained by chance ordering of proteins in Str vs VM and should be discussed adequately.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree on many of these points, particularly the grouping of Mendelian PD, atypical PD, dystonia, and GWAS genes for a joint analysis. We have chosen to remove the statistical analysis and claims about axonal enrichment of PD-linked proteins as a group. However, we believe that the localization pattern for the proteins we do detect is worth reporting. We agree about the GWAS SNPs and we have expanded the heatmap (now Figure 6c) to include all genes within the PD GWAS risk loci as defined by Nalls et al. (2019). To acknowledge the limitations of our dataset, we have also edited the Results (page 13):</p><p>“Nonetheless, we are limited to analysis of proteins detected by our APEX2 proteomics, which does not detect all PD-linked proteins. […] Thus, while our dataset highlights subcellular localizations for follow-up studies, it does not establish the absence of PD-linked proteins at a given site.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. When doing streptavidin-dependent pulldowns of biotinylated proteins the authors write 'immunoprecipitation'. This is not correct since no antibodies are used. The authors should be technically correct and talk about 'pull-downs' or 'streptavidin-dependent purification of biotinylated proteins.' I realize most readers will understand what they are trying to say, but for such a technically excellent paper I think the authors shouldn't use wrong terminology.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and regret the error. We have changed all instances of ‘immunoprecipitation / IP’ to ‘streptavidin pulldown’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In some instances I found the figures to be overly 'busy'. For example, Figure 3d is very busy with a great deal of speculation included about protein function. No studies here actually test biology of the candidates identified by mass spectrometry. The faith (and I label it as such) placed in GO analysis by the authors is not justified. On the other hand, I applaud the authors for attempting to place some of the identified proteins in biological context. What I'd prefer to see is a bit of a disclaimer about the robustness of GO analysis and also include more statements about how this is a discovery approach that will require many follow-up studies to elucidate protein function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our proteomic profiling is a discovery approach, and in Figure 3d we intended to highlight the breadth and depth of proteins identified in our mass spec data. The sets of proteins displayed were chosen on the basis of the axonal vs. somatodendritic GO analysis. We agree that GO analysis does not establish biological function, but rather highlights areas for further follow-up studies. We have modified the Results (page 9):</p><p>“While our GO analysis is broadly consistent with established features of neuronal polarization (e.g., somatodendritic enrichment of terms such as ‘Postsynapse’ and ‘RNA binding’), findings from this discovery approach will require follow-up studies to elucidate compartment-specific function of the identified proteins.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The compendium seems rigorous and potentially useful to the field in understanding TH neurons in the SNpc.</p><p>1. I do not understand why biotinlyated protein abundance in the different preparations from the different compartments are not normalized to APEX2 abundance in the relative quantifications. Overall, the process of normalization was unclear, including how differing AAV transduction efficiency is factored into calculated biotinylated proteins. Unless i am fundamentally mistaken, APEX2 labeling occurs so quickly that the relative abundance of enzyme will influence not only the number of proteins that the mass spectrometry analysis can identify, but also the relative abundance when comparing one preparation of protein to the next.</p></disp-quote><p>We minimize mouse-to-mouse variability by conducting all surgeries for a cohort of mice in a single day with the same aliquot of virus, and conducting the slicing/labeling procedures on at least 2 mice per day in balanced pairs of control/APEX2. We minimize protein preparation variability by freezing the labeled tissue at -80C until all samples in a batch are ready for protein extraction and streptavidin pulldown. We then process all samples at the same time, including streptavidin digest and mass spectrometry. The major proteomics dataset in this paper is derived from a single cohort of mice, and the extent of biotinylation measured by streptavidin HRP western blotting was comparable between mice (Figure 2b). Overall, we show that our workflow facilitates strong reproducibility in our APEX2 mass spectrometry data, both for the number of peptides/proteins detected per sample (Figure 2c) and the correlation of biological replicates (Figure 2—figure supplement 1c).</p><p>The reviewer’s suggestion to normalize protein abundances to APEX2 abundance within each sample is an interesting one, but a key disadvantage of that approach is that it eliminates the possibility of comparing APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples to our APEX2<sup>-</sup> controls. Another recent proximity labeling study suggested that normalization to the endogenously biotinylated protein, propionyl-CoA carboxylase alpha chain (Pcca), reduced variability between different batches of APEX samples (Frankenfield et al., 2020; PMID 33201688).In our study we normalized protein abundances to the total intensity within each sample. To compare total intensity normalization to APEX2 or Pcca normalization, we compared the intragroup coefficient of variance (CV), a commonly employed metric in evaluating proteomic normalization methods (Välikangas et al., 2018; PMID 27694351). Compared to total intensity, APEX2 or Pcca normalization both increased the intragroup variability for the majority of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of proteomic normalization methods.</title><p>(A-B) Intragroup coefficient of variation (CV) for APEX2<sup>+</sup> samples after normalization to total intensity vs. Pcca or APEX2 abundance.

However, for the majority of proteins the FDR q-values are much higher (less significant) with APEX2 normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>), consistent with the increased intragroup variability. These results demonstrate that normalization to total protein intensity reduces within-group variability better than normalization APEX2 or Pcca. However, they do not rule out the possibility that normalization to Pcca or APEX2 would be useful in future studies containing multiple batches of samples, given that our study was rigorously designed to mitigate experimental batch effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Along those lines, since there are simply more proteins IDed in the striatum, with a larger 'interactome' afforded by more substrate material, and with higher possible proportional abundance of APEX2 , it makes sense that there are more PD- GWAS genes identified in the striatal lysates. Would the same be true for any compendium of neuronal genes?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct that there is more total substrate material in the striatum due to the massive mDA axons, but not a higher relative abundance of APEX2 in axons (see above). The point is well taken that the deeper coverage of striatal samples might bias which proteins are detected; we attempted to mitigate this bias by analyzing only PD-GWAS genes that were detected in both VM and Str samples. Nonetheless, as described above and in response to the reviews and Editor’s points, we have chosen to omit this analysis and remove claims about PD genes as a group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Along those lines, are the 'novel' post-synaptic and other proteins identified in the striatum something that is unique to SNpc cells, or present in other subsets of neurons.

The reviewers and editors agree that the authors have carefully considered concerns and addressed the major questions surrounding methods and rationale for normalization of data as well as validation of key DA axon enriched proteins using orthogonal approaches. Further the flawed statistical analysis of axonal vs. somatodendritic enrichment for PD genes was removed.</p><p>However, a lingering remnant of the flawed enrichment dataset in PD is inappropriately held over (e.g., the title of the manuscript which must be revised). The reviewers and editors think that the enrichment strategy (Figure 6) continues to suffer from an imprecise GWAS list of genes that inaccurately infers a particular gene at a locus when the actual gene may not be known with the degree of precision required here. Further, the APEX2 strategy biases towards certain proteins and not others that are known to be important in PD but were excluded. For example, well-known PD-associated genes like LRRK2 and GBA might be excluded because the cytoplasmic APEX2 enzyme does not access many endolysosomal proteins, favoring instead distributed proteins with bias. APEX2 is not distributed in the soma in all compartments evenly, and may exclude important mitochondrial genes. The imprecision and bias in both approaches combined, yields a meaningless dataset that is included in Figure 6 and related Supplementary files. Even without these flaws, without comparator datasets, it is not clear whether there would be similar enrichments in any neuronal context, or what the non-neuronal proteome might be.
