However, the application of allosteric switches in optogenetics has been scarce and suffers from critical limitations. Here, we report an optogenetic approach that utilizes an engineered Light-Regulated (LightR) allosteric switch module to achieve tight spatiotemporal control of enzymatic activity. Using the tyrosine kinase Src as a model, we demonstrate efficient regulation of the kinase and identify temporally distinct signaling responses ranging from seconds to minutes. LightR-Src off-kinetics can be tuned by modulating the LightR photoconversion cycle. A fast cycling variant enables the stimulation of transient pulses and local regulation of activity in a selected region of a cell. The design of the LightR module ensures broad applicability of the tool, as we demonstrate by achieving light-mediated regulation of Abl and bRaf kinases as well as Cre recombinase.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells need to sense and respond to their environment. To do this, they have dedicated proteins that interpret outside signals and convert them into appropriate responses that are only active at a specific time and location within the cell.</p><p>However, in many diseases, including cancer, these signaling proteins are switched on for too long or are active in the wrong place. To better understand why this is the case, researchers manipulate proteins to identify the processes they regulate. One way to do this is to engineer proteins so that they can be controlled by light, turning them either on or off.</p><p>Ideally, a light-controlled tool can activate proteins at defined times, control proteins in specific locations within the cell and regulate any protein of interest. However, current methods do not combine all of these requirements in one tool, and scientists often have to use different methods, depending on the topic they are researching.</p><p>Now, Shaaya et al. set out to develop a single tool that combines all required features. The researchers engineered a light-sensitive ‚Äòswitch‚Äô that allowed them to activate a specific protein by illuminating it with blue light and to deactivate it by turning the light off. Unlike other methods, the new tool uses a light-sensitive switch that works like a clamp. In the dark, the clamp is open, which ‚Äòstretches‚Äô and distorts the protein, rendering it inactive. In light, however, the clamp closes and the structure of the protein and its activity are restored. Moreover, it can activate proteins multiple times, control proteins in specific locations within the cell and it can be applied to a variety of proteins.</p><p>This specific design makes it possible to combine multiple features in one tool that will both simplify and broaden its use to investigate specific proteins and signaling pathways in a broad range of diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group

optogenetic methods that allow researchers to mimic and manipulate the function of individual proteins. Multiple broadly applicable approaches have been developed to enable tight regulation of protein localization and protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guntas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Strickland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>); however, the direct control of enzymatic activity remains a challenge. Only a few existing strategies achieve direct regulation of enzymatic activity, but they either lack the ability to activate enzymes locally within a cell, or they are difficult to apply to multiple enzyme classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diaz et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hongdusit et al., 2020</xref>), thus limiting their use for addressing mechanistic questions in cell biology. This highlights the need for an optogenetic approach which is broadly applicable, easy to implement and provides all the advantages of optogenetics in one tool including tight temporal and local subcellular regulation. An attractive strategy that can be harnessed for this purpose is the application of a rationally designed light-sensitive domain that can allosterically control protein activity. This protein engineering approach offers several important advantages. It enables targeted regulation of one domain within a multidomain protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>). Regulation is achieved ‚Äòremotely‚Äô without steric interference with the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and substrate binding. Also, allosteric switch domains are genetically encoded into the targeted protein simplifying the application of the tool. Only four optogenetic methods for allosteric regulation of activity have been reported so far and they suffer from critical limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hongdusit et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Winkler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). Two of these strategies achieve subcellular control of certain targeted proteins but they cannot be applied to many other enzymes due to their design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hongdusit et al., 2020</xref>). One approach is broadly applicable but it does not achieve local control and triggers inactivation rather than activation of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>). A similar approach described by Reynolds et al achieves regulation in both directions for dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and PDZ domain but efficiency of this approach for applications in mammalian cells and its ability to regulate proteins at subcellular level has not been demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, existing allosteric switches lack the ability to tune the activation/inactivation kinetics, an important feature required for mimicking different temporal signaling modes of enzymes.</p><p>Among the various potential targets of value for cell biology applications, protein kinases constitute an important family of enzymes that regulate key physiological functions and thus their activity is tightly controlled. Aberrant kinase regulation is the underpinning of many diseases, including the development and progression of malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lee and Yaffe, 2016</xref>). Many kinases are therefore important therapeutic targets and significant research effort is directed towards uncovering their function in cells. Such functional studies are challenging because a single kinase often induces drastically different responses depending on the location, level and timing of its activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Marshall, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rauch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen-Saidon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugaj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toettcher et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, transient, sustained, or oscillatory kinase activation can result in distinct outcomes. Therefore, interrogating kinase-mediated signaling requires approaches capable of mimicking complex spatiotemporal control of kinase activity down to the subcellular resolution. Traditional methods using genetic manipulation and small molecule inhibitors lack this level of regulation. Optogenetics, on the other hand, overcomes these limitations by leveraging the precision of light-mediated activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Toettcher et al., 2011</xref>). Some existing optogenetic tools regulate the dimerization or localization of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toettcher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wend et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grusch et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2014</xref>). These approaches control the catalytic activity only indirectly and can only be applied to a narrow group of kinases. Other approaches employ light-sensitive caging or allosteric switches for the regulation of kinase catalytic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). However, these methods do not achieve subcellular control of activity and some of these approaches are also limited in their broader applicability due to structural requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the development of a broadly applicable approach to enable optogenetic regulation of protein kinases remains challenging and highly desirable.</p><p>Here, we report the development of a protein engineering approach that enables light-mediated allosteric control of enzymatic activity and combines critical advantages of optogenetics in one tool: it provides tight temporal regulation of activity with tunable kinetics, enables local control that can be achieved with subcellular resolution, and allows for broad applicability to different types of enzymes. We achieve this by employing an engineered light sensitive switch domain that is genetically encoded and enables the allosteric regulation of kinase catalytic domains. It provides fast, specific, and tunable control of kinase activity in living cells using low intensity blue light. Furthermore, this method enables reversible and repetitive activation of a kinase and provides local control of kinase activity at a subcellular level. Application of this tool allowed us to uncover temporal dynamics of phosphorylation-mediated signaling following short term (10 s) as well as prolonged activation of a kinase.

VVD is a monomer in the dark, and it forms an antiparallel homodimer upon illumination with blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nihongaki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vaidya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zoltowski and Crane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Dimerization is accompanied by a major flip of the N-terminal tail, bringing it close to the C-terminus of the other VVD in the dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>;¬†<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vaidya et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zoltowski and Crane, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Zoltowski et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we surmised that a tandem connection of two VVDs via a flexible linker would generate a clamp-like switch of 335 amino acid total size that opens in the dark and closes in response to blue light. To connect two VVD molecules, we designed a flexible 22 amino acid linker (GGS)<sub>4</sub>G(GGS)<sub>3</sub> which provides sufficient flexibility and length (approximately 25‚Äì30 √Ö when extended in the dark state) to accommodate the association and dissociation of the VVD monomers. We hypothesized that inserting this LightR clamp domain into a small flexible loop within the catalytic domain of an enzyme would enable light-mediated regulation of its activity. In the dark, the opening of the LightR clamp could increase the distance between its N- and C- termini up to approximately 25 √Ö, which should distort the native structure of the catalytic domain and thereby inactivate the enzyme. Illumination with blue light would close the clamp and bring the N- and C-termini of LightR together resulting in restoration of the native structure of the catalytic domain and recovery of the enzyme activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>LightR-Src design and molecular dynamics simulations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Crystal structures of two Vivid monomers in the dark state (PDB: 2PD7), and the dimer in the lit state (PDB: 3RH8).

Our previous studies demonstrate that the insertion of a regulatory domain at position Gly288 in the Src catalytic domain can be employed to achieve allosteric control of activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>; thus we focused on this site for the insertion of LightR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We first performed molecular dynamics simulations of the designed LightR-Src catalytic domain to predict a possible mechanism for the regulation of kinase activity by LightR domain. To build the initial LightR domain model for the dark and lit state, we modified the crystal structures of VVD in the light (PDB: 3RH8) and dark (PDB: 2PD7) by connecting the VVD proteins with a 22-residue flexible linker, (GGS)<sub>4</sub>G(GGS)<sub>3</sub>. The GPGGSGG and GSGGPG linkers were then added to the N- and C-termini of the LightR domain, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). All of these flexible linkers were refined in Modeller. The LightR-Src structures were then constructed by inserting LightR domain into crystal structures of c-Src catalytic domain (PDB:1Y57) replacing G288. To ensure the best possible approximation of a starting structure, the engineered molecules were also subjected to energy minimization to allow for resolution of potential steric clashes, unusual torsion angles, or other energetically unfavorable aspects potentially introduced in the construction of the model. The geometry optimized molecules were equilibrated at 37¬∞C to reach an equilibrium state structure at the desired temperature prior to starting the simulations. The analysis of 100 ns simulations demonstrated stabilization of fluctuations in root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the backbone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This is indicative of a structure occupying an energetic minima and thus represents a reasonable structure for further analysis. Analysis of LightR-Src in the dark shows increased RMSD of individual residues within the catalytic domain relative to the active wild-type Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>) and a strong correlation between the motion of the residues in the LightR clamp and in the Src catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>) suggesting a possible allosteric mechanism. In contrast, the lit state of LightR-Src exhibits much lower RMSD, closer to wild-type Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and loses the motion correlation between LightR domain and Src residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>). This indicates that the open conformation of LightR clamp in the dark can cause changes in the catalytic domain of Src that can be reversed upon illumination with blue light. Interestingly, LightR-Src in the dark shows substantial deviation of the G-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplements 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>), a critical functional element of most protein kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowan-Jacob, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krupa et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests a possible allosteric mechanism by which LightR domain regulates kinase activity via disruption of the G-loop.</p><p>To test whether LightR insertion enables light-mediated regulation of Src, we evaluated Src catalytic activity by an <italic>in¬†vitro</italic> kinases assay using purified N-terminal fragment of paxillin as a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klomp et al., 2016</xref>). In this and all following experiments, we used a LightR-Src construct bearing a Y527F mutation (avian cSrc position) that disrupts Src autoinhibition and prevents its negative regulation by endogenous mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zheng et al., 2000</xref>). We employed this to ensure that LightR-Src is only regulated by light. We compared LightR-Src activity to the activity of the catalytically inactive mutant of LightR-Src (D388R in mouse cSrc, sequence ID: NP_001020566.1) and the constitutively active mutant of cSrc (Y527F in avian cSrc). LightR-Src, as well as the control constructs, were transiently overexpressed in and immunoprecipitated from LinXE cells. Our results show that LightR insertion in Src completely disrupts its activity in the dark which is recovered in response to blue light to levels comparable to that of the constitutively active Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we tested the regulation of LightR-Src in living cells by evaluating changes in phosphorylation of known endogenous Src substrates, p130Cas (Y249) and paxillin (Y118) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham-Edmondson and Hanks, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sachdev et al., 2009</xref>). Our results show that illumination of LinXE cells, transiently expressing LightR-Src, induces robust phosphorylation of the endogenous Src targets paxillin and p130Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, cells expressing the catalytically inactive mutant of LightR-Src (D388R) that were also exposed to blue light did not show any increase in phosphorylation of Src substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This demonstrates that the increase in phosphorylation is a direct consequence of LightR-Src activation and that blue light by itself had no effects on the Src targets. The activation time-course demonstrates noticeable phosphorylation of Src targets after only two minutes of light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The level of activity of LightR-Src can be regulated by attenuation of light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data support our model for regulation of kinase activity using LightR clamp domain and demonstrate efficient and specific regulation of LightR-Src in living cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characterization of LightR-Src.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of LightR-Src using¬†<italic>in¬†vitro</italic> kinase assay.

For this analysis, we used HeLa cell line stably expressing LightR-Src-mCherry-myc construct at levels comparable to that of endogenous Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Phosphorylation of known Src targets, including caveolin1 (Y14), p130Cas (Y12, Y128, Y249, and Y287), paxillin (Y88 and Y118), p120 catenin (Y217 and Y228), and cortactin (Y421), was significantly increased in LightR-Src expressing cells, but not in control cells, exposed to blue light (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2‚Äîsource data 1</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that LightR-Src-expressing cells exhibited a broadly distinct phosphoproteome dynamics from control cells following light exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Protein interaction network analysis along principal component one revealed that LightR-Src-induced phosphorylation events were enriched for cell migration, cell adherens junctions, and focal adhesions, all of which are processes known to be driven by Src activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>). To assess the kinetics of LightR-Src signaling, we analyzed changes in the phosphoproteome at different time points after LightR-Src activation. Several distinct phosphorylation kinetics profiles were identified. ‚ÄòEarly responders‚Äô exhibited a significant increase in phosphorylation as early as ten to thirty seconds after LightR-Src activation, further demonstrating rapidity of activation achieved by LightR-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). ‚ÄòIntermediate responders‚Äô show increased phosphorylation at the 1 to 5 min time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Interestingly, we detected Src autophosphorylation on Y416 at 1 min, indicating that Src phosphorylates some targets before it even undergoes autophosphorylation. A group of ‚Äòlate responders‚Äô were phosphorylated at 1 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A distinct group of proteins comprised of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 exhibited only transient increase in phosphorylation at 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). This phosphorylation is mediated by upstream MAP kinase cascades and leads to activation of ERK kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bugaj et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toettcher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cargnello and Roux, 2011</xref>). Thus, our data indicate that Src only transiently activates specific MAP kinase pathways. Importantly, all these phosphorylation changes were not detected in control HeLa cells that were exposed to blue light but did not express LightR-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 4A‚ÄìC</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that LightR-Src phosphorylates known Src substrates, show the fast kinetics of LightR-Src signaling within seconds, and uncover distinct temporal patterns of Src target protein phosphorylation in living cells.</p><p>Since VVD dimerization is reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>), we hypothesized that LightR-Src should become inactive when light is switched off. To test this, LinXE cells transiently expressing LightR-Src were illuminated with blue light for 30 min and then placed in the dark for different periods of time. Our results show that incubation in the dark led to a significant decrease in phosphorylation of paxillin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, it took up to 2 hr for phosphorylation to return to basal levels, indicating the slow inactivation kinetics of LightR-Src. To achieve faster inactivation of LightR-Src, we introduced an I85V mutation into both VVD domains. This mutation reduces the half-life of VVD dimer in the dark from 18,000 s to 780 s and thus should facilitate faster LightR-Src inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zoltowski et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, our results demonstrate that compared to the original LightR-Src, the I85V/I85V variant (FastLightR-Src) shows much faster reversibility. Within two minutes after the light was switched off, we observed a significant decrease in paxillin phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). By fifteen minutes, phosphorylation reached basal level. However, we noticed that activation of FastLightR-Src leads to a lower p130Cas phosphorylation level when compared to the same activation time point of LightR-Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1</xref>). This is potentially due to the fast cycling of I85V mutants between lit and dark state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zoltowski et al., 2009</xref>). This cycling could happen even when cells are illuminated and thus would reduce the fraction of active LightR-Src molecules at a given time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zoltowski and Crane, 2008</xref>). Thus, FastLightR-Src may allow researchers to mimic function of Src kinase cycling between activation and inactivation states in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaimachnikov and Kholodenko, 2009</xref>). Overall, our results show that the off-kinetics of the LightR switch can be tuned by modifications of the VVD domains. This provides the flexibility required for mimicking different temporal modes of kinase signaling, a capability that existing optogenetics approaches lack (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reversibility of LightR- and FastLightR-Src.</title><p>LinXE cells transiently expressing the indicated Src constructs bearing tandem mCherry-myc tag at the C-terminus were continuously exposed to blue light for specified times and then either placed in the dark for different periods of time (<bold>A, B</bold>) or repeatedly incubated in the dark for 10 min and in the light for 20 min (<bold>C</bold>).

Our results reveal successful cycles of activation and inactivation as indicated by changes in phosphorylation of p130Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies show that activation of Src leads to stimulation of cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Klomp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karginov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaplan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cary et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether LightR-Src activation induces a similar response in living cells. Our results show that cells expressing FastLightR-Src start spreading upon irradiation with blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and stop immediately when the light is turned off. Repeated irradiation of cells with blue light induced corresponding cycles of cell spreading; demonstrating again that the LightR tool can be used to mimic oscillation of kinase activity in living cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Importantly, illumination of cells expressing catalytically inactive mutant of LightR-Src (D388R) did not induce any cell-spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Also, we observed that inactive FastLightR-Src localizes in the perinuclear region and translocates to focal adhesions and cell membrane upon activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). This translocation is reversible and correlates with activation/inactivation cycles. Notably, this change in localization mimics that of wild type Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaplan et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, our results demonstrate that LightR-Src activation can mediate cell morphodynamic changes and functions similarly to what has been observed for native Src kinase.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Regulation of cell morphology and LightR-Src localization by light.</title><p>HeLa cells transiently co-expressing FastLightR-Src-mCherry-myc (N¬†=¬†10 cells) or catalytically inactive LightR-Src (D388R)-mCherry-myc (N¬†=¬†9 cells) with stargazin-iRFP670 (plasma membrane marker) were imaged live every minute while illuminated for indicated periods of time (blue rectangles).

Light-mediated regulation of kinase catalytic activity per se has not been achieved at a subcellular level. We hypothesized that FastLightR-Src activation/inactivation kinetics should enable local activation of the kinase only in a defined subcellular location. Localized activation of protein kinases and Src is a critical determinant in the regulation of cell function. Previous studies have suggested that local activation of Src at the cell periphery should stimulate the formation of local membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cary et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgartner et al., 2008</xref>). However, this hypothesis has only been indirectly supported and has not been rigorously evaluated due to the limitations of existing methods. The LightR-Src approach would allow us to define the effects of local activation of Src in living cells. Indeed, we observed that local illumination of HeLa cells transiently expressing FastLightR-Src induced the formation of membrane protrusions within the illuminated area and caused polarization of the cell towards the light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A‚ÄìC</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This effect was reversed as soon as the light was switched off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). Cells expressing the catalytically inactive LightR-Src (D388R) did not polarize in response to local light irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>).

A previous study using Src family kinases (SFK) biosensor suggested strong correlation between SFK activity at the cell periphery and cell-edge velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>). LightR-Src allows us to determine the direct effect of local Src activity on protrusion dynamics. To achieve this, we evaluated temporal changes in cell edge velocity upon continuous local activation of LightR-Src in HeLa cells. Our analysis revealed that Src induced local waves of increased cell-edge velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2A</xref>); suggesting the induction of recurrent local contractions that slow down membrane protrusion.

Interestingly, inhibition of ROCK caused significantly smaller average velocity reduction than inhibition of MLCK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>), consistent with its limited role in phosphorylating MLC at the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Totsukawa et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, by applying LightR-Src, we demonstrated that sustained local Src activity induces waves of protrusions that are mediated by ROCK and MLCK.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The broad applicability of LightR approach</title><p>To verify that the LightR approach is applicable to other kinases, we set out to engineer LightR variants of tyrosine kinase Abl and a dual specificity kinase bRaf. Since the majority of kinases share a conserved catalytic domain structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fabbro et al., 2015</xref>), we inserted LightR switch into Abl and bRaf at a position analogous to the insertion site used in Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), replacing K282 residue in Abl and H477 in bRaf. Our results show that illumination of LinXE cells transiently expressing LightR-Abl-GFP construct induced the phosphorylation of known Abl substrate p130Cas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Stimulation of LightR-bRaf-Venus construct transiently expressed in LinXE cells induced phosphorylation of its direct target, MEK1, and led to downstream activation of ERK1 and ERK2 kinases at levels comparable with the constitutively active mutant of bRaf (V600E) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To demonstrate that LightR-bRaf off-kinetics are tunable, we generated a FastLightR-bRaf variant following the same strategy used to generate FastLightR-Src.

This demonstrates that the LightR approach can be used broadly for the precise regulation of several types of enzymes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study describes an optogenetic approach that provides several advantages for the interrogation of signaling pathways and demonstrates its broad applicability to address important biological questions. The key features of this method include: (1) allosteric regulation of the enzymatic activity, (2) tight temporal control of activity with tunable kinetics, (3) local regulation of activity at a subcellular level, and (4) broad applicability to different enzymes. Importantly, unlike other approaches, LightR combines all these advantages in one tool, thus, simplifying application of optogenetics in biological research.</p><p>We achieved direct regulation of enzymatic activity via an allosteric control by inserting the LightR switch into small loops within the protein structure. This modular design provides significant flexibility in the selection of the insertion site and allows for specific regulation of catalytic activity without compromising key functions of the protein such as its interactions with binding partners or its native localization in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Karginov et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, variation of the flexible linkers, both between the kinase and VVD as well as between the two VVDs, or changing the insertion site for LightR in the targeted enzyme could result in reversing or altering the regulatory mechanism of LightR, as was previously demonstrated for insertion of LOV2 domain in DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>). While we implemented only one linker type and only one insertion site in LightR-Src, this is a venue for future work to generate more modular tools. Application of LightR approach to different classes of enzymes suggests its broad applicability for the regulation of a wide variety of protein functions in living cells. Thus, unlike other light-regulated allosteric switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hongdusit et al., 2020</xref>), this method combines multiple important advantages of optogenetic regulation with its broad applicability to a wide range of enzymes.</p><p>We showed that regulation by LightR domain is tunable, enabling different modes of regulation. LightR switch with slow off kinetics will be useful for long-term activation of LightR-enzymes; since brief periodic pulses of light will be sufficient to maintain activity while avoiding phototoxicity caused by long exposure to blue light. The FastLightR switch, on the other hand, is more suitable for studies that mimic transient, oscillatory or localized activation of a protein. It could also be used to study the kinetics of negative regulators of signaling pathways immediately after a signaling input is turned off. Activation of a LightR-enzyme requires low intensity light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1B</xref>, 0.6 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), minimizing the phototoxic effects of blue light illumination. This level is lower than the intensity used in other optogenetic studies using light-sensitive switches to regulate enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). The activation of LightR is limited to the blue light spectrum, thus enabling its multiplexing with other red-shifted optogenetic tools or FRET biosensors.</p><p>Several optogenetic approaches for the regulation of protein kinases have been described previously; however, all had specific shortcomings. Several methods regulate the localizationof a kinase rather than its catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kawano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graziano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">M√ºhlh√§user et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Moitrier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katsura et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The method described by Zhou et al provides efficient control of kinases by light-regulated steric hindrance but it does not enable regulation on a subcellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, one of the regulatory domains has to be inserted in the FG loop, a substrate-interacting region in several kinases including Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shah et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, this approach may not be applicable to some critical kinases. The insertion site that we selected for LightR domain is intentionally positioned away from any substrate binding elements, which should minimize any steric hindrance by this domain. Dagliyan et al., achieved regulation of Src through insertion of LOV domain at the same site that we used for the LightR approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>). However, this method also did not achieve local regulation at a subcellular level. Furthermore, this approach only enabled inactivation of a kinase by illumination with light. To activate a kinase at a specific time, researches have to first inhibit the kinase by keeping cells under blue light for a significant period of time, then release the inhibition by switching the light off. This requirement increases the possibility of potential cytotoxic effect of light and makes the implementation of this tool problematic for studies where activation of a kinase is desired. While the insertion of LOV domain at a different site may result in light-induced activation, as was previously demonstrated for DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Reynolds et al., 2011</xref>), this has not been achieved for protein kinases at the moment. Thus, combined advantages of LightR enable broader application of this tool for interrogation of kinase signaling.</p><p>Tight and efficient control of LightR allowed us to mimic fast signaling dynamics of Src kinase in cells, and to establish stimulation of different signaling patterns over time. Several identified targets link early effects of Src activation to focal adhesion regulation and membrane protrusion formation. Our phosphoproteomics analysis revealed early Src-dependent phosphorylation of talin-1 at Y26 and Y70 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). These residues are located in the N-terminal F0 FERM domain of talin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouaouina et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goult et al., 2010</xref>). When talin-1 is in the inactive closed conformation, the F0 domain remains exposed and is proposed to act as an early detector of changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bouaouina et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, phosphorylation of talin-1 on Y26 and Y70 by Src may represent an early step in the inside-out integrin activation mechanism performed by talin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vinogradova et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Vinogradova et al., 2004</xref>). Later phosphorylation (1‚Äì5 min) of proteins involved in formation of new focal adhesions and membrane protrusions (such as lamellipodin, p130Cas, palladin, tensin-3, cortactin, GIT1, and paxillin) correlates with the time at which we observed cell spreading and increased protrusion velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5H</xref>). Elevated phosphorylation of many proteins at 1 hr is indicative of oncogenic transformation processes mediated by prolonged activation of Src (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hunter and Sefton, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sefton et al., 1980</xref>). Our phosphoproteomics studies also revealed that continuous Src activity induces only transient activation of MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 3</xref>). This suggests that short term Src activation induces activation of ERK1/2 whereas prolonged activity triggers inactivation of this pathway. Previous studies demonstrated that stimulation of cells with EGF results in transient activation of ERK1 and ERK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Olsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sasagawa et al., 2005</xref>). In the future studies, it will be interesting to study whether Src also plays a role in negative regulation of ERK1/2 downstream of EGF. Importantly, our approach allowed us to identify temporal categories of Src targets; distinguishing between targets that are phosphorylated at early, intermediate, or delayed time points. Such temporal compartmentalization can be elucidated by the optogenetic approach and provides unprecedented insights into the complexity and diversity of signaling networks.</p><p>Periodic activation of kinases occurs during different cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kaimachnikov and Kholodenko, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roche et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilioti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacquel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kholodenko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maeda et al., 2004</xref>). Depending on the kinase and the physiologic context, periodicity of these cycles ranges from minutes to hours, which often determines the functional outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hilioti et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacquel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kholodenko, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Maeda et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Karginov et al., 2014</xref>). Using FastLightR, we demonstrated that we can modulate activation cycles of protein kinases, Src (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) and bRaf, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>) with light. Tight regulation of FastLightR allows us to control the periodicity and the amplitude of these activation pulses. Therefore, FastLightR can be potentially applied to any enzyme of interest to directly reconstruct its oscillatory signaling and identify its functional role.</p><p>The ability to regulate proteins on a subcellular level is one of the main capabilities desired in optogenetic tools. However, this has been challenging to achieve for methods employing steric hindrance and allosteric control as a mechanism of regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagliyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhou et al., 2017</xref>). Efficiency and fast reversibility of FastLightR allowed us to control Src activity at a specific location in the cell and demonstrate that its activity is sufficient to induce local protrusion. One of the interesting observations is the fact that continuous local activation of Src induces waves of protrusions instead of causing persistent protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,H</xref>). Several groups have previously described periodic protrusions at the cell edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsai and Meyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giannone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Machacek and Danuser, 2006</xref>), and correlated this phenotype with periodic contractions due to phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tsai and Meyer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giannone et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Machacek and Danuser, 2006</xref>). Our results demonstrate that both kinases that phosphorylate MLC (ROCK and MLCK) participate in the formation of the recurrent waves of protrusion in response to local Src activation. However, ROCK appears to be less important for maintaining the overall elevated protrusion velocity downstream of Src activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Inhibition of MLCK resulted in much more noticeable reduction in average protrusion velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Previous studies suggested that MLCK predominantly acts at the cell periphery where it mediates formation of stable protrusions and persistent cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Totsukawa et al., 2004</xref>). Our data is consistent with these prior studies and suggest that MLCK is a predominant factor regulating cell protrusions downstream of Src.</p><p>Several previous studies described approaches for the regulation of Cre recombinase activity by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morikawa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kawano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Taslimi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sheets et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kennedy et al., 2010</xref>). However, these methods are designed based on the split protein reassembly strategy, which has its limitations. Split proteins tend to reassemble spontaneously, leading to undesirable basal activity of engineered split Cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dagliyan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liu and Tucker, 2017</xref>). Moreover, when activated, not all split halves of the protein reassemble, which often leads to suboptimal activation levels of the engineered enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dagliyan et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, this method requires co-expression of two proteins and, to achieve optimal results, both split halves must be co-expressed in equimolar ratios in a cell. LightR overcomes some of these limitations, because LightR-Cre is, by design, a single construct that expresses a complete Cre enzyme fused with LightR domain. Although high levels of LightR-Cre expression sometimes lead to low basal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 2</xref>), this could be solved by optimizing the expression level of LightR-Cre and/or by modifying the linkers connecting LightR domain to the Cre recombinase. We believe that such optimization is feasible because we did not detect any basal activity for the LightR-kinases regardless of their expression level in cells.</p><p>In summary, the LightR-approach to regulate enzyme activity demonstrates versatility and broad applicability to a variety of enzymes and can thus help unravel signaling pathways and networks as well as study defined biological processes that are direct consequences of the regulated enzymes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies, chemical reagents, materials, and cell lines</title><p>The following antibodies were used: anti-phospho-p130Cas (Y249) (BD Pharmigen cat. no. 558401), anti-p130Cas (BD Pharmigen cat. no. 610271), anti-GFP (Clontech, cat. no. 632381), anti-paxillin (Fisher Scientific, cat. no.

The resulting data matrix was visualized as a color map with the highest positive velocity (protrusion) in red and the highest negative velocity (retraction) in blue. Although we use the same number of points in the cell boundary representation, the perimeter of these boundaries varies from frame to frame, which can create artificial horizontal misalignment depending on how the first point of the boundary is chosen. To avoid this issue at the edge region of our interest, we used our automated algorithm (see below) to align velocity values such that the edge position along the line of the most active protrusion near the site of the light activation was in the middle of the kymograph. This way, any boundary misalignments due to the variation of the cell perimeter can occur only on the sides of the kymographs, where our further comparative quantification was not performed.

The local maximum of this measure in the vicinity of the laser activation is taken as the middle position in the velocity kymograph.

activity. Albeit the use of fungal-based LOV domains to orthogonally control different cellular processes is not new, this light-regulated allosteric switch presents unique features that makes of LightR a powerful tool to dissect and explore basic and fundamental biological questions. The dataset presents fine examples of how Src activity can be controlled with the switch of a light, allowing tunable, temporal and spatial control of its activity (with subcellular resolution), revealing important details about its dynamics. The modular features of LightR are clearly exemplified in its use not only to modulate Src activity (ON in the light/ OFF in the dark), but also in the control of the kinases Abl and bRaf, as well as of Cre recombinase. For sure LightR (and future variations of this type of optogenetic allosteric switch) will continue to enlighten not only aspects of kinase biology, but also unforeseen features of diverse cellular processes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;LightR: A Light-Regulated Allosteric Switch Enables Temporal and Subcellular Control of Enzyme Activity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Luis F Larrondo as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The work by Shaaya et al. describes a new strategy for engineering allosteric regulation of proteins by blue light, by genetically inserting a light-sensitive clamping domain (LightR) into a loop of an enzyme's surface. The authors present examples of this strategy on three different well-studied kinases (Src, Abl, and bRaf) and on Cre recombinase. LightR is based on a tandem VVD (LOV domain) fusion and works as a clamp-like switch that opens in the dark and closes (because of VVD-VVD intramolecular dimerization) in response to blue-light. This rationally designed light-sensitive domain, based on a LOV fungal domain, constitutes a nice addition to the repertoire of optogenetic switches described in past years and exemplifies an interesting strategy to achieve intramolecular optogenetic control.</p><p>The ability to orthogonally regulate by light any enzyme that can be inactivated by inserting the LightR domain into a surface loop is novel and welcome, and the LightR variant with faster off-kinetics is a useful addition. As shown by the authors, this allows achieving reversible and repeatable light activation at different time scale with subcellular resolution.</p><p>The data described by the authors indicate that this strategy could represent a broadly applicable approach.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The major concern relates to some parts of the manuscript that require clarification. There are aspects of how the data are discussed, and how the methods are described, that ought to be improved in order to help colleagues grasp key aspects of the work and value its significance and reach. It is also important to contextualize the results in order to understand the novelty and contributions of the presented strategy.</p><p>1) The MD simulation methods used are not sufficiently detailed. Moreover, the scale of the molecular dynamics work presented in Figure 1 does not contribute to the claims made by the authors. More specifically, it relies on single short simulations of a homology model constructed with little experimental knowledge of the actual orientation of the VVD domain relative to the kinase catalytic domain.</p><p>2) Some experimental detail on the expression of LightR constructs in cells is unclear or lacking. From the Materials and methods section, it appears that most of the work was done in LinXE cells transiently expressing LightR constructs and that the phosphoproteomics work was done in HeLa cells stably expressing the constructs, but this is unclear in the main text. Also, the specifics of the LightR-kinase and LightR-Cre recombinase constructs are unclear: the figures seem to indicate that LightR-Src and FastLightR-Src are myc-tagged, while LightR-Abl and bRaf are GFP-tagged, but this is not mentioned in the main text or the Materials and methods. The authors should briefly describe the major components of the constructs used when they first appear in the main text and must also provide the full sequences of the constructs in the supplement.</p><p>3) Little validation data is presented for either transient or stable expression of the constructs: only single-time-point western blots for transient LightR-kinase expression in Figures 2, 3 and 6, no data for transient LightR-Cre expression and no data for stable LightR-Src expression. This data likely already exists and should probably be presented in supplementary figures.</p><p>4) The experiments using ROCK and MLCK inhibitors are problematic and may not support the conclusion that ROCK is less important a mediator of Src's effect on cell-edge velocity than MLCK. Y-27632, the ROCK inhibitor used, is reported to have an IC50 of 140 nM, so the authors' choice of a 10-¬µM working concentration is fairly reasonable, but the MLCK inhibitor peptide is reported to have an IC50 of 50 nM and to be cell-permeable, so the authors' choice of a 100-¬µM working concentration is worryingly high and may have off-target effects that are actually mediating the observed greater decrease in cell-edge velocity. The authors need to justify the concentrations used or otherwise justify the relative importance of ROCK and MLCK for mediating Src's effect on membrane protrusion. This is a relatively minor portion of this paper, which focuses on the development of the LightR tool, and removing this claim would not significantly affect the strength of the paper.</p><p>5) The authors propose that the novelty of the method lies in a combination of features: 1) regulation is achieved allosterically (rather than a sterically or by localization/sequestration) 2) regulation is achieved with subcellular precision and 3) the regulation shows tunable kinetics. However, each of these properties have been established elsewhere and here the main contribution lies in the combination of all three. The tunable kinetics in this work made use of a previously characterized mutation and thus isn't particularly unique. Other work has shown precise spatiotemporal localization (e.g. Cavanaugh et al.

There are aspects of how the data are discussed, and how the methods are described, that ought to be improved in order to help colleagues grasp key aspects of the work and value its significance and reach. It is also important to contextualize the results in order to understand the novelty and contributions of the presented strategy.</p><p>1) The MD simulation methods used are not sufficiently detailed. Moreover, the scale of the molecular dynamics work presented in Figure 1 does not contribute to the claims made by the authors. More specifically, it relies on single short simulations of a homology model constructed with little experimental knowledge of the actual orientation of the VVD domain relative to the kinase catalytic domain.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing enough details about the MD simulations. We included more details in the revised manuscript under the ‚ÄúDevelopment of a Light-Regulated Kinase‚Äù subsection in the Results section, and under the ‚ÄúMolecular dynamics modeling‚Äù subsection in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>We had previously failed to mention that the data presented were the combined result of three independent 100 ns simulations. In Figure 1‚Äîfigure supplement 1, we also included a plot of the RMSD of the system over the course of the simulation as validation of our homology model. Convergence of the RMSD of the system is indicative of a structure occupying an energetic minima and thus represents a reasonable structure for analysis. While we acknowledge that there are intrinsic limitations to homology modeling, it provides a method to guide protein engineering efforts and evaluate possible mechanisms of regulation before experimental data are obtained. Similar approaches have been used in previously published work to assess engineered molecules and propose potential mechanism of action</p><p>(https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27980211/, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10989-018-9791-9, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10989-006-9058-8, https://doi.org/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00004, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26673131/).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Some experimental detail on the expression of LightR constructs in cells is unclear or lacking. From the methods section, it appears that most of the work was done in LinXE cells transiently expressing LightR constructs and that the phosphoproteomics work was done in HeLa cells stably expressing the constructs, but this is unclear in the main text. Also, the specifics of the LightR-kinase and LightR-Cre recombinase constructs are unclear: the figures seem to indicate that LightR-Src and FastLightR-Src are myc-tagged, while LightR-Abl and bRaf are GFP-tagged, but this is not mentioned in the main text or the Materials and methods. The authors should briefly describe the major components of the constructs used when they first appear in the main text and must also provide the full sequences of the constructs in the supplement.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. In the revised manuscript, we specified the cell lines used in every experiment in the main text and figure legends (Figures 2-6; Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplements 1-4; Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1; Figure 5‚Äîfigure supplement 1B; and Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplements 1, 2). We also specified whether the constructs are transiently or stably expressed. Furthermore, we described the major components of the constructs when they first appear in the main text and provided their full DNA sequence at the end of the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Little validation data is presented for either transient or stable expression of the constructs: only single-time-point western blots for transient LightR-kinase expression in Figures 2, 3 and 6, no data for transient LightR-Cre expression and no data for stable LightR-Src expression. This data likely already exists and should probably be presented in supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not providing validation data for the HeLa stable cell line (LightR-Src HeLa) we generated. We included a western blot in the revised manuscript in Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1C that shows comparable expression levels of LightR-Src and endogenous Src.</p><p>We also provided western blots showing transient expression levels of LightR-Src,</p><p>LightR-Abl, and LightR-bRaf at each time point. These can be found in Figure 2C;</p><p>Figure 3A-C; Figure 6B, C; Figure 2‚Äîfigure supplement 1B; Figure 3‚Äîfigure supplement 1; Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 1.</p><p>To compare LightR-Cre-iRFP expression levels between different time points, we provided images of LightR-Cre-iRFP in Figure 6F and in Figure 6‚Äîfigure supplement 2. In the previous submission, we failed to indicate that all images were taken using the same illumination and acquisition settings and were adjusted to the same brightness/contrast level; so the expression levels can be compared between samples. Even though LightR-Cre-iRFP was not measured by Western blot, fluorescence microscopy suggests that similar expression levels were achieved in different experiments. This is now clarified in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experiments using ROCK and MLCK inhibitors are problematic and may not support the conclusion that ROCK is less important a mediator of Src's effect on cell-edge velocity than MLCK. Y-27632, the ROCK inhibitor used, is reported to have an IC50 of 140 nM, so the authors' choice of a 10-¬µM working concentration is fairly reasonable, but the MLCK inhibitor peptide is reported to have an IC50 of 50 nM and to be cell-permeable, so the authors' choice of a 100-¬µM working concentration is worryingly high and may have off-target effects that are actually mediating the observed greater decrease in cell-edge velocity. The authors need to justify the concentrations used or otherwise justify the relative importance of ROCK and MLCK for mediating Src's effect on membrane protrusion. This is a relatively minor portion of this paper, which focuses on the development of the LightR tool, and removing this claim would not significantly affect the strength of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern about the concentration we used. We decided to use 100 Œºm of the MLCK inhibitor peptide based on the published work referenced on the manufacturer‚Äôs website (https://faseb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1096/fj.09-146118#fsb2fj09146118-fig-0005). In this work, authors pre-treated microglia with 100 ¬µM MLCK inhibitor to achieve inactivation. Furthermore, a separate study demonstrated that MKCK inhibitor peptide 18 maintains high specificity for up to 4,000 fold of its IC50, which is a concentration of 200 Œºm (J. Med. Chem. 42(5), 910-919 (1999)).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors propose that the novelty of the method lies in a combination of features: 1) regulation is achieved allosterically (rather than a sterically or by localization/sequestration) 2) regulation is achieved with subcellular precision and 3) the regulation shows tunable kinetics. However, each of these properties have been established elsewhere and here the main contribution lies in the combination of all three. The tunable kinetics in this work made use of a previously characterized mutation and thus isn't particularly unique. Other work has shown precise spatiotemporal localization (e.g. Cavanaugh et al.

These aspects need to be explained/discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We added clarifications in the main text that better explain the advantage of the tool. The main contribution of this tool, specified in the Introduction, is that, unlike previous approaches for allosteric regulation, it combines all advantages of optogenetics (including regulation at a subcellular resolution) and enables broad applicability. We also further discussed the advantages of LightR as an allosteric activation tool in the Discussion section and dedicated a paragraph to comparing this method to other optogenetic tools enabling direct regulation of protein kinase activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Modulation of CRE by LightR is not mentioned in the Discussion.

To address this, we added a panel in Figure 2A that shows results of an in vitro kinase assay for LightR-Src and constitutively active Src. These results demonstrate that the insertion of LightR domain in Src kinase completely abolishes its activity in the dark and restores it in the light to levels comparable to that of constitutively active Src.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) &quot;This indicates that the open conformation of LightR clamp in the dark can cause changes in the catalytic domain of Src that will be reversed upon illumination with blue light&quot;.
