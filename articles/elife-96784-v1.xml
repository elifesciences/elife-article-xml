Fractal or aperiodic neural activity is a well-established marker of arousal and sleep stages measured using electroencephalography. We introduce a new concept of ‘fractal cycles’ of sleep, defined as a time interval during which time series of fractal activity descend to their local minimum and ascend to the next local maximum. We assess correlations between fractal and classical (i.e. non-REM – REM) sleep cycle durations and study cycles with skipped REM sleep. The sample comprised 205 healthy adults, 21 children and adolescents and 111 patients with depression. We found that fractal and classical cycle durations (89±34 vs 90±25 min) correlated positively (<italic>r</italic>=0.5, p&lt;0.001). Children and adolescents had shorter fractal cycles than young adults (76±34 vs 94±32 min). The fractal cycle algorithm detected cycles with skipped REM sleep in 91–98% of cases. Medicated patients with depression showed longer fractal cycles compared to their unmedicated state (107±51 vs 92±38 min) and age-matched controls (104±49 vs 88±31 min). In conclusion, fractal cycles are an objective, quantifiable, continuous and biologically plausible way to display sleep neural activity and its cycles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sleep cycles</kwd><kwd>aperiodic activity</kwd><kwd>non-REM-REM sleep cycle</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd><kwd>1/f</kwd><kwd>antidepressants and sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Dutch Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Veni</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dresler</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Development and Innovation Fund of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TKP2021- EGA-25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bódizs</surname><given-names>Róbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Development and Innovation Fund of the Ministry of Innovation and Technology of Hungary</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ÚNKP-22-3-II</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bódizs</surname><given-names>Róbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_153387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furrer</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Reto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_179443</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furrer</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Reto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>HMZ Flagship Grant of the University Medicine Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SleepLoop</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Furrer</surname><given-names>Melanie</given-names></name><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Reto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polysomnographical analysis in humans shows that temporal fluctuations of aperiodic neural activity reflect the cycling nature of sleep.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cyclic nature of sleep has long been established with a classical sleep cycle defined as a time interval that consists of an episode of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep followed by an episode of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feinberg and Floyd, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Bon, 2020</xref>). Typically, nocturnal sleep consists of 4–6 such cycles, which last for about 90 min each. Every cycle is seen as a fundamental physiological unit of sleep central to its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg, 1974</xref>) or a miniature representation of the sleep process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Le Bon et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Basic structural organization of normal sleep is rather conservative with some exceptions. Thus, occasionally, at the beginning of the night in healthy adolescents and young adults, there could occur cycles with skipped REM sleep, which are also called ‘skipped’ cycles. In skipped cycles, a REM sleep episode is expected to appear except that it does not and only a ‘lightening’ of sleep is observed presumably due to too high non-REM pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Bon, 2020</xref>). Likewise, some alterations of the sleep structure can be observed in sleep disorders, for example, narcolepsy and insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Scammell, 2015</xref>), and healthy aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carrier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conte et al., 2014</xref>). In some neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as major depressive disorder (MDD), Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, sleep architecture disturbances are further linked to the disease neuropathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtet and Olié, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palagini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pillai and Leverenz, 2017</xref>).</p><p>While the importance of sleep cycles is indisputable, their function as a unit is poorly understood and surprisingly under-explored, especially when compared to the extensive research on sleep stages (either non-REM or REM) or sleep microstructure (e.g. sleep spindles, slow waves, microarousals). One of the reasons for this striking absence of research progress might be the lack of a proper quantifiable and reliable objective measure from which sleep cycles could be derived directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Currently, sleep cycles are defined via a visual inspection of the hypnogram, the graph in which categorically separated sleep stages are plotted over time. Yet assigning a discrete category to each sleep stage is rather arbitrary as sleep stages are presumably continuous and thus do not occur as steep lines of a hypnogram. In addition, visual sleep stage scoring is very time-consuming, subjective and error-prone with a relatively low (~80%) inter-rater agreement. This results in a low accuracy regarding the sleep cycle definition.</p><p>We suggest that a data-driven approach based on a real-valued neurophysiological metric (as opposed to the categorical one) with a finer quantized scale could forward the understanding of sleep cycles considerably. Specifically, we propose that research on sleep cycles would benefit from recent advances in the field of fractal neural activity. In literature, fractal activity is also called aperiodic, non-oscillatory, 1 /f or scale-free activity, being named after the self-similarity exhibited by patterns of sensor signals across various time scales. Fractal activity is a distinct type of brain dynamics, which is sometimes seen as a ‘background’ state of the brain, from which linear, rhythmic (i.e. periodic, oscillatory) dynamics emerge to support active processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Freeman, 2006</xref>). Growing evidence confirms that fractal activity has a rich information content, which opens a window into diverse neural processes associated with sleep, cognitive tasks, age, and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bódizs et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Höhn et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Fractal dynamics follow a power-law 1 /f function, where power decreases with increasing frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He, 2014</xref>). The steepness of this decay is approximated by the spectral exponent, which is equivalent to the slope of the spectrum when plotted in the log-log space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerster et al., 2022</xref>). The fractal signal is not dominated by any specific frequency, rather it reflects the overall frequency composition within the time series (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>) such that steeper (more negative) slopes indicate that the spectral power is relatively stronger in slow frequencies and relatively weaker in faster ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In terms of mechanisms, it has been suggested that flatter high-band (30–50 Hz) fractal slopes reflect a shift in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neural currents in favour of excitation while steeper slopes reflect a shift towards inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Given that the specific balance between excitation and inhibition defines a specific arousal state and the conscious experience of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nir and Tononi, 2010</xref>), the introduction of Gao’s model led to an increased interest in fractal activity. For example, it has been shown that high-band fractal slopes discriminate between wakefulness, non-REM and REM sleep stages as well as general anesthesia or unconsciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lendner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Höhn et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>Of note, Gao’s model does not account for the lower part of the spectrum, which is also scale-free. An alternative model suggests that the broadband 1 /f² activity reflects the tendency of the central nervous system to alternate between UP- (very rapid spiking) and DOWN- (disfacilitation, no activity) states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranauskas et al., 2012</xref>). Empirical studies further showed that the broadband (2–48 Hz) slope is an especially strong indicator of sleep stages and sleep intensity with low inter-subject variability and sensitivity to age-related differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miskovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>). Taken together, this literature suggests that fractal slopes can serve as a marker of arousal, sleep stages and sleep intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lendner et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>). We expect that this line of inquiry could be extended to sleep cycles.</p><p>On a related note, the reciprocal interaction model of sleep cycles assumes that each sleep stage involves distinct activation patterns of inhibitory and excitatory neural networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>). This model explains alternations between non-REM and REM sleep stages by the interaction between aminergic and cholinergic neurons of the mesopontine junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>). Notably, during REM sleep, acetylcholine plays a major role in maintaining brain activation, which is expressed as EEG desynchronization, one of the main features of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nir and Tononi, 2010</xref>). This is of special importance in affective disorders since according to one of the pathophysiological explanations of depression, for example, the cholinergic-adrenergic hypothesis, central cholinergic factors play a crucial role in the aetiology of affective disorders, with depression being a disease of cholinergic dominance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Janowsky et al., 1972</xref>). Many antidepressants (e.g. serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) suppress REM sleep and thus cause essential alterations in sleep architecture. Intriguingly, REM sleep suppression is related to the improvement of depression during pharmacological treatment with antidepressants enhancing monoaminergic neurotransmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vogel et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wichniak et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on this background, we propose that a fractal neural activity-based definition of sleep cycles has the potential to considerably advance our understanding of the cyclic nature of sleep, for example, by introducing graduality to the categorical concept of sleep stages. The current study analyzes the dynamics of nocturnal fluctuations in fractal activity using five independently collected polysomnographic datasets overall comprising 205 recordings from healthy adults. Based on the inspection of fractal activity across a night, we introduce a new concept of fractal activity-based cycles of sleep or ‘fractal cycles’ for short. We describe differences and similarities between fractal cycles defined by our algorithm and classical (non-REM – REM) cycles defined by the hypnogram. We hypothesize that the timing and durations of the fractal cycles would closely correspond to those of classical cycles. We had no prior hypothesis regarding correspondence between the fractal cycles and classical cycles with skipped REM sleep, that is this analysis was exploratory.</p><p>Given the above-mentioned age-related changes in fractal activity (flatter slopes) and sleep structure (fewer and shorter classical cycles), we also study whether fractal cycle characteristics change with age. To this end, we use 5 healthy adult datasets with the age range of 18–75 years (n=205). Moreover, we add to our study a pediatric polysomnographic dataset (age range: 8–17 years, n=21) to explore fractal cycles in childhood and adolescence, a life period accompanied by deepest sleep and massive brain reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kurth et al., 2012</xref>) as well as a higher frequency of cycles with skipped REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jenni and Carskadon, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we test the clinical value of the fractal cycles by analyzing polysomnographic data in 111 patients with MDD, a condition characterized by disturbed sleep structure (besides its clinical symptoms, such as abnormalities of mood and affect). Specifically, we compare fractal cycles of sleep between medicated MDD patients (three MDD datasets, n=111) and healthy age-matched controls (n=111) as well as in the unmedicated and medicated states within the same MDD patients (one of the three MDD datasets, n=38). We hypothesize that the fractal cycle approach would be more sensitive in detecting differences between typical and atypical sleep architecture compared to the conventional classical cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fractal cycles in healthy adults</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> displays smoothed fractal slope time series and hypnogram for an example subject.

(<bold>B</bold>) In S22 from dataset 5, the second part of night has many wake epochs, some of them are identified by the algorithm as local peaks. This results in a higher number of fractal cycles as compared to the classical ones and a poor match between the fractal cycles No. 3–7 and classical cycles No. 2–5. The algorithm does not distinguish between the wake and REM-related fractal slopes and can define both as local peaks. Since the duration of the fractal cycles is defined as an interval of time between two adjacent peaks, more awakenings/arousals during sleep (usually associated with aging) are expected to result in more peaks and, consequently, more fractal cycles, that is a shorter cycle duration. This is one of the possible explanations for the correlation between the fractal cycle duration and age (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

Two fractal cycles, No. 4 and No. 5, correspond to one classical cycle, No. 5: the algorithm identifies the wake episode at the 380th minute (in the middle of the 5th classical cycle) as a local fractal peak, i.e., the end of the fractal cycle.

As a consequence, in some cases, especially for morning cycles that have rather long REM periods (&gt;20 min), the match between fractal and classical cycles can be rather coarse-grained (See, for example, cycle 3 in S16, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Yet, in other cases, the match between fractal and classical cycles might be almost perfect (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>To test this visual observation, we correlated the absolute values of the difference in classical vs fractal sleep cycle durations with the REM episode length within a given cycle. We included in this analysis only the participants who had an equal number of fractal and classical cycles in order to match each fractal cycle to a classical cycle individually. We found that longer REM episodes were associated with a higher difference between classical vs fractal sleep cycle durations (<italic>r</italic>=0.36, p&lt;0.001, n=417 cycles, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Interestingly, our recent study has shown that fractal activity within a REM sleep episode is not homogenous, with phasic states showing steeper fractal slopes than tonic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenblum et al., 2025</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-2"><title>Wake after sleep onset (WASO) duration</title><p>Visual inspection of the data suggested that participants with more WASO often had more fractal than classical cycles.

More fractal peaks imply more fractal cycles and thus, possibly, more mismatches between the number and duration of classical and fractal cycles. To test this hypothesis, we correlated the average difference between the durations of classical and fractal cycles for each participant with the WASO proportion. We found that a higher difference in cycle durations was associated with a higher WASO proportion in 3/5 datasets (r’s=0.36–0.49, p&lt;0.030) as well as in the merged dataset (<italic>r</italic>=0.23, p=0.001, n=205 participants, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we correlated the difference in classical vs fractal cycle durations with the fractal descent or ascent amplitudes (as reflections of fractal cycle depth and possibly sleep quality).

Visual inspection shows that it should be divided into 3 skipped cycles, however, our a priori definition of skipped cycles did not include an option to subdivide a long cycle into three short cycles; hence, we split it into two short cycles. The fractal cycle algorithm was sensitive to these sleep lightenings and detected all three short cycles. Classical cycle 4 looks like a skipped cycle as it has two clear episodes of slow-wave sleep separated by non-REM stage 2. However, the length of this cycle is shorter than 110 min (the threshold defined a priori), therefore, we did not split the classical cycle 4 into two cycles. The fractal cycle algorithm was sensitive to this lightening of sleep and defined two fractal cycles during this period.

We showed that durations of these fractal cycles correlated with those of classical (non-REM – REM) sleep cycles defined by hypnograms in five independently collected datasets counting 205 healthy participants overall as well as in 111 medicated patients with MDD. Overnight cycle-to-cycle dynamics in healthy adults showed an inverted U-shape for both fractal and classical cycle durations. The fractal cycle algorithm was effective in detecting cycles with skipped REM sleep. The findings further revealed that children and adolescents showed shorter fractal cycles as compared to young healthy adults. In adults, fractal cycle durations negatively correlated with participants’ age. Medicated patients with MDD showed longer fractal cycles compared to their own unmedicated state and healthy controls. Below we discuss these findings in detail.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Fractal cycles: definition and motivation</title><p>We observed that the time series of fractal slopes have a cyclical nature, descending and ascending for about 4–6 times per night with a mean duration of approximately 90 min for each such (‘fractal’) cycle. This strikingly resembles the description of classical sleep cycles. Indeed, both the visual inspection and formal correlational analyses revealed that the timing and duration of the fractal and classical cycles mainly matched. This led us to propose that <italic>the</italic> ‘<italic>fractal cycles of sleep’ could serve as a new data-driven definition of sleep cycles</italic>, that is a means to appreciate quantitatively what has been previously observed only qualitatively using hypnograms. Notably, we do not claim that fractal cycles are a substitute for the study of the individual sleep stages or microstructural features of sleep. We want to stress, however, that currently, sleep research is shifted towards the study of, to use a metaphor, ‘the atoms’ of sleep, such as individual sleep stages, slow oscillations, spindles, microarousals etc. Yet it is possible that some important (currently unknown) features of sleep could be explored only at the level of sleep cycles, ‘the molecules of sleep’. (Note, that we use the molecule and atom concepts only as a metaphor for the macro- and microstructure of sleep.)</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hypothetical functional significance of aperiodic activity and fractal cycles</title><p>The decision to incorporate fractal activity analysis in sleep cycle research was based on the reports that fractal (aperiodic) dynamics may reflect the bistability of the network (the overall tendency of alternating up and down states; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baranauskas et al., 2012</xref>) and/or alterations in the balance between neural excitatory and inhibitory currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gao et al., 2017</xref>). Circumstantial evidence suggests that fractal activity is a measure of sleep homeostasis or sleep intensity, reflecting sleep-wake history, sleep stage differences, sleep cycles, age-effects, local sleep and sleep disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bódizs et al., 2024</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that during human sleep, spectral slopes positively correlate with pupil size, a marker of arousal levels linked to the activity of the locus coeruleus-noradrenergic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carro-Domínguez et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>According to the reciprocal-interaction model of sleep cycles, each sleep phase is characterized by a specific neurochemical mixture. During non-REM sleep, aminergic inhibition decreases and cholinergic excitation increases such that at REM sleep onset, aminergic inhibition is shut off and cholinergic excitability reaches its maximum, while other outputs are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pace-Schott and Hobson, 2002</xref>). Complex inhibitory and excitatory connections between pontine REM-on and REM-off neurons are further modulated by such neurotransmitters as GABA, glutamate, nitric oxide, and histamine. Intriguingly, during REM sleep, acetylcholine plays the main role in maintaining brain activation, which is expressed as EEG desynchronization, one of the main features of REM sleep, and other systems are silent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nir and Tononi, 2010</xref>). This suggests that acetylcholine, which fluctuates cyclically across a night as a result of the REM-off – REM-on interactions, might have a key role in the sleep phase alternation.</p><p>Given that the specific neurochemical milieu of the brain produces a specific type of conscious experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nir and Tononi, 2010</xref>) and that conscious experience was shown to be related to fractal activity derived from the human sleep EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2019</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that fractal activity tracks sleep-related changes in the neurochemical milieu of the brain and overall network dynamics. This has not been tested in humans; nevertheless, in rats, cholinergic nucleus basalis stimulation acutely increased higher to lower frequency cortical LFP power ratio or in other words, caused flattering of spectral decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goard and Dan, 2009</xref>). One can, therefore, speculate that ascending parts and peaks of fractal cycles coincide with acetylcholine release. The troughs of fractal cycles, in turn, might reflect a higher homeostatic pressure and even cause feelings of sleepiness and the search for the opportunity of initiating sleep, as these are periods of the steepest fractal activity, which implies a higher ratio of lower over higher frequency power in the EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bódizs et al., 2024</xref>).</p><p>In view of this literature, we speculate that fractal fluctuations may reflect two antagonistic roles of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Simor et al., 2022</xref>).

Correlations between the durations of fractal and classical cycles were observed not only in healthy adults but also in MDD patients who took antidepressants. The results show that displaying sleep data using fractal activity as a function of time meaningfully adds to the conventionally used hypnograms thanks to the gradual and objective quality of fractal power.</p><p>Thus, in hypnograms, each sleep stage is ascribed with a categorical value (e.g. wake = 0, REM = –1, N1 = –2, N2 = –3 and SWS = –4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Yet categorical labeling of sleep stages can induce information loss and lead to several misinterpretations, such as an implied order of sleep stages (e.g. ‘REM sleep is located between wake and N1’) and an implied ‘attractor state’ conception of sleep stages (e.g. ‘no inter-stage states’). Likewise, defining the precise beginning and end of a classical sleep cycle using a hypnogram is often difficult and arbitrary, for example, in cycles with skipped or interrupted REM sleep or REM sleep without atonia.</p><p>In contrast, fractal cycles do not rely on the assignment of categories, being based on a real-valued metric with known neurophysiological functional significance. This introduces a biological foundation and a more gradual impression of nocturnal changes compared to the abrupt changes that are inherent to hypnograms.</p><p>Importantly, fractal cycle computation is automatic and thus objective. Even though recently, there has been a significant surge in sleep analysis incorporating various machine learning techniques and deep neural network architectures, we should stress that this research line mainly focused on the automatic classification of sleep stages and disorders almost ignoring the area of sleep cycles. Here, as the reference method, we used one of the very few available algorithms for sleep cycle detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blume and Cajochen, 2021</xref>). We found that automatically identified classical sleep cycles only moderately correlated with those detected by human raters (r’s=0.3–0.7 in different datasets). These coefficients lay within the range of the coefficients between fractal and classical cycle durations (<italic>r</italic>=0.41–0.55, moderate) and outside the range of the coefficients between classical cycle durations detected by two human scorers (r’s=0.7–0.9, strong, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table8">Appendix 1—table 8</xref>).</p><p>One of the most significant methodological strengths of the fractal cycle algorithm is its ability to detect cycles with skipped REM sleep common in children, adolescents and young adults. Our algorithm detected skipped cycles in 91–98% of cases. We deduce that the fractal cycle algorithm detected skipped cycles since a lightening of sleep that replaces a REM episode in skipped cycles is often expressed as a local peak in fractal slope time series. Based on this, we further hypothesize that, analogously, fractal cycles might detect REM sleep without atonia episodes in REM sleep behaviour disorder, the episodes currently often mistaken as non-REM sleep.</p><p>The mismatches between fractal and classical cycle numbers and durations (observed in 19% of cases) were mainly related to longer WASO or REM sleep episode durations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table5">Table 5</xref>). The latter finding is in line with our recent study that has shown that fractal activity within a REM sleep episode is not homogenous, with phasic states showing steeper fractal slopes than tonic ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosenblum et al., 2025</xref>). Future research should define whether the mismatches between fractal and classical cycles (when present) are the disadvantages of our algorithm or, on the contrary, the reflection of its ability to measure the cycling nature of sleep in a more precise way than the classical cycles.</p><p>In summary, we expect that fractal cycles could bring insights into (yet) unexplained phenomena thanks to their gradual and objective quality, and, therefore, have the potential to induce a paradigm shift in basic and clinical (see below) sleep research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Fractal slopes and SWA: overnight dynamics</title><p>Of note, currently, the gold standard marker of many sleep functions (e.g. restorative, regenerative) with a long-standing use is slow-wave activity (SWA), which, similar to fractal slopes, is also continuous and objective. SWA, however, has several disadvantages, such as large variability between individuals, which makes it impossible to set up a given reference point for healthy sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>). Interindividual variability of spectral slopes is much smaller compared to SWA, making it a less individual-specific metric, yet spectral slopes strongly correlate with SWA (31–53% of shared variance throughout the non-REM periods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bódizs et al., 2024</xref>). In addition, both the literature and our findings show that while SWA has a cycling nature during the first part of the night, neural dynamics of late-night’s sleep are not reflected by SWA at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>). Given that SWA is a primary marker of sleep homeostasis, this pattern possibly reflects the dissipation of a sleep need over the night (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bódizs et al., 2024</xref>). In contrast, fractal slopes show a cycling nature over the entire night’s sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>), suggesting that they are a more suitable means to reflect the macrostructure of the whole night’s sleep than SWA.</p><p>Having said this, we should highlight that characteristics of fractal cycles of sleep do undergo some overnight changes. Thus, the durations of both fractal and classical cycles in health show an inverted U-shape across a night and the amplitudes of fractal descents and ascents are larger during early-night- compared to late-night cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This is in line with the report on the flattening of fractal activity from early to late sleep cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Horváth et al., 2022</xref>). If seen in the context of the reactive and predictive homeostatic functions of sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Simor et al., 2023</xref>), deeper fractal cycles observed during early-night sleep could reflect intensive restorative processes (which are also reflected by SWA), whereas shallower fractal cycles seen during the later part of night’s sleep could reflect more active future-oriented processes (which are not reflected by SWA) with a shift towards neural excitation relative to inhibition expressed as overall flatter fractal activity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Fractal cycles and age</title><p>We found that older healthy participants had shorter fractal cycles compared to the younger ones while classical cycles did not correlate with the participants’ age. At first glance, it looked as if this association simply reflected an increased proportion of the wake after the sleep onset often seen in older adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Indeed, our algorithm does not discriminate between the smoothened wake- and REM-related fractal slopes and can define both as local peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). This happens because for the most part, wake- and REM sleep-related smoothed fractal slopes display comparable values, which are also the highest ones compared to other stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, green squares). Since the fractal cycle duration is defined as an interval of time between two adjacent peaks, more awakenings during sleep are expected to result in more peaks and, consequently, more fractal cycles per total sleep time, that is a shorter cycle duration. It is worth mentioning that unsmoothed wake- and REM-related slopes differ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> here (black squares). However, this is a side notion as raw values were not used in this study since our algorithm performed poorly on raw time series.</p><p>Moreover, a larger difference in classical vs fractal cycle duration was associated with a higher proportion of wake after sleep onset (WASO) in 3/5 datasets as well as in the merged dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). On the other hand, the partial correlation between fractal cycle duration and age remained significant after controlling for the WASO amount. This hints that the association between fractal cycles and age might reflect more than just a confounding effect of WASO. This interpretation is in line with literature on age-related changes in aperiodic activity, namely, on flattering of fractal slopes with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voytek and Knight, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bódizs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pathania et al., 2022</xref>), especially during SWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref>). Likewise, aging is associated with shorter and fewer classical cycles, with a mean of 3.5 cycles per night compared to the usual 4–5 in adults and adolescents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Conte et al., 2014</xref>). Our findings suggest that fractal cycles are more sensitive to these age-related alterations than the classical ones. We further speculate that the claim that ‘age affects sleep microstructure more than sleep macrostructure’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>) might reflect the lack of a reliable measure of sleep cycles.</p><p>Another plausible explanation for longer fractal cycles in younger compared to older adults could be rooted in increased sleep intensity of the younger adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jenni and Carskadon, 2004</xref>). Further, high sleep intensity driven by homeostatic pressure is associated with the delay in the emergence of the REM sleep phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Le Bon, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tarokh et al., 2012</xref>). In our dataset, REM latency also decreased with age. Thus, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref> illustrates that young adults might present with very delayed REM latency, that is 200–250 min after sleep onset, in line with the notion that younger adults more often show cycles with skipped REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). This can be partly explained by the fact that younger people often have a later chronotype (‘night owls’) than older people with puberty linked to delays in the sleep cycle by up to 2 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Randler, 2016</xref>). Young people also have a longer circadian rhythm (&gt;24 hr) than older ones (&lt;24 hr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Monk, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To further strengthen this line of explanations, we performed a supplemental analysis, which showed that prolonged REM latencies are indeed associated with longer fractal cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). Nevertheless, the correlation was weak (yet significant) and observed in the pooled dataset only, that is not while analyzing individual datasets. Likewise, the partial correlation between the fractal cycle duration and REM latency adjusted for the participants’ age was non-significant. Moreover, we found that children and adolescents (the group that has the longest REM latencies and the highest rate of cycles with skipped REM sleep) showed shorter fractal cycles compared to young adults, specifically the early-night fractal cycles. In view of these analyses, our attempt to explain longer fractal cycles in younger compared to older adults by increased REM sleep latency becomes less convincing. Moreover, given that our algorithm does not miss cycles with skipped REM sleep, longer REM sleep latencies should not necessarily be related to longer cycles. To summarize, at this stage, the mechanism underlying age-related differences in fractal cycle duration is unclear (possibly with some non-linearities) and future studies are needed to corroborate and further explore it.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Fractal cycles in MDD</title><p>In addition, our study shows that deviations from the observed fractal patterns have some clinical relevance. We found that MDD patients in the medicated state had longer fractal cycles compared to their own unmedicated state and healthy controls. The largest differences were observed for the first sleep cycles. Moreover, patients who took REM-suppressive antidepressants showed prolonged fractal cycles compared to patients who took REM-non-suppressive antidepressants. Given that the fractal cycle duration was defined as an interval of time between two adjacent peaks and that the peaks usually coincide with REM sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), this finding may reflect such aftereffects of antidepressants as delayed onset and reduced amount of REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palagini et al., 2013</xref>). In other words, if a patient has fewer REM sleep episodes, then the time series of their fractal slopes has fewer peaks and the algorithm detects fewer cycles per total sleep time, that is cycle’s duration is longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Another explanation considers our previous finding that medicated MDD patients show flatter average fractal slopes compared to controls and their own unmedicated state during all sleep stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rosenblum et al., 2023a</xref>). This might mean that the antidepressant intake results in shallower fractal fluctuations, which in turn implies that fewer peaks could be detected by our algorithm as the peak threshold was defined a priori in a healthy – not MDD – sample. Interestingly, recently, flatter fractal slopes during REM sleep have been also associated with sustained polyphasic sleep restriction in health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rosenblum et al., 2024b</xref>), whereas flatter fractal slopes during non-REM sleep were observed in patients with objective insomnia and sleep state misperception, reflecting an abnormally high level of excitation in line with the hyperarousal model of insomnia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrillon et al., 2020</xref>). Our pilot findings have shown that patient with psychophysiological insomnia have shorter fractal cycles compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>The major limitation of this study is its correlational approach, and thus an inability to shed light on the mechanism underlying sleep cycle generation. Therefore, the question of what determines the number and duration of cycles per night remains open. Moreover, further work is needed to determine the mathematically precise and physiologically meaningful model of fractal cycles. Notably, here, we suggest that fractal cycles are a new tool to study the macrostructure of sleep; however, they are presumably not a substitute for the study of the individual sleep stages and microstructural features of sleep (e.g. microarousals, spindles, slow waves).</p><p>Additionally, we explored the effect of developmental changes and aging on fractal cycles using a cross-sectional observational approach, whereas these factors might be disentangled more precisely in a longitudinal approach. The age of the pediatric group ranged from 8 to 17 years old; studying younger children and babies would add crucial information on the influence of neurodevelopmental changes on fractal cycles.</p><p>The strengths of this study are its large sample size, scripts and data sharing and self-replications in several clinical and healthy datasets of participants in a broad age range, affirming the overall robustness of the phenomena of fractal cycles. Another strength of this work is its generalizability as it has shown that the studies conducted in different experimental environments (including one study conducted at home) using different EEG devices provide comparable results.</p><p>To summarize, the large sample and self-replication performed in this study suggest that the ‘fractal cycle’ is a universal concept that should be extensively studied. Displaying the data in the format of fractal cycles provides an intuitive and biologically plausible way to present whole-night sleep neural activity and also adds some graduality to the purely categorical concept of sleep stages that comprise a hypnogram. In future studies, this graduality might help to illuminate differences in sleep architecture across different species, advance our understanding of the role of sleep in neurocognitive development in infants and adolescents as well as in neurodegenerative processes and other fields of neuroscience.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We observed that the slopes of the fractal (aperiodic) spectral power descend and ascend cyclically across a night such that the peaks of the time series of the fractal slopes coincide with REM sleep or sleep lightening while the troughs of these time series coincide with non-REM sleep. Based on this observation, we introduced a new concept of fractal activity-based cycles of sleep or ‘fractal cycles’ for short, defining it as a time interval between two adjacent local peaks of the fractal time series. We have shown that fractal cycles defined by our algorithm largely coincide with classical (non-REM – REM) sleep cycles defined by a hypnogram and replicated our findings in several independently collected healthy and clinical datasets. Moreover, we found that the fractal cycle algorithm reliably detected cycles with skipped REM sleep. In addition, we observed that fractal cycle duration changes as a non-linear function of age, being shorter in children and adolescents compared to young adults as well as in older compared to younger adults. To this end, we conclude that the fractal cycle is an objective, quantifiable and universal concept that could be used to define sleep cycles and display the whole-night sleep neural activity in a more intuitive and biologically plausible way as compared to the conventionally used hypnograms. Having shown that the fractal cycles are prolonged in medicated patients with MDD, we suggest that fractal cycles are a useful tool to study the effects of antidepressants on sleep. Possibly, fractal cycles also will be able to serve as a means to explore sleep architecture alterations in different clinical populations (e.g. to detect REM sleep without atonia) and during neurocognitive development. In summary, this study shows that the fractal cycles of sleep are a promising research tool relevant in health and disease that should be extensively studied.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Healthy participants</title><p>We retrospectively analyzed polysomnographic recordings from the following studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table6">Table 6</xref>):</p><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Datasets 1–3</title><p>40, 40, and 33 healthy controls from three independent sleep studies in MDD conducted at the Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Germany.

For each participant, we averaged the EEG signal over the F3 and F4 electrodes (or C3 and C4 – for Dataset 1 where the frontal channels were unavailable), calculated its spectral power for every 30 (adult datasets) or 20 (the pediatric dataset) seconds corresponding to the conventionally defined duration of sleep epochs and differentiated the total power to its fractal (i.e. aperiodic, 1 /f, scale-free) and oscillatory components. Several methods to calculate fractal components exist. We opted to use the Irregularly Resampled Auto-Spectral Analysis (IRASA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wen and Liu, 2016</xref>) tool embedded in the Fieldtrip toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oostenveld et al., 2011</xref>), one of the leading open-source EEG softwares, with the <italic>ft_freqanalysis</italic> function as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rosenblum et al., 2023b</xref>). A side note: slopes calculated with the IRASA strongly correlate (r = |0.9|) with those calculated using the ‘fitting oscillations and one over f’ (FOOOF, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schneider et al., 2022</xref>), another useful method used for aperiodic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>). The fractal power component (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) was transformed to log-log coordinates and its slope was calculated to estimate the power-law exponent (the rate of spectral decay), using the function <italic>logfit</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lansey, 2020</xref>). The loglog data fit is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>As opposed to the oscillatory component, the fractal component is usually treated as a unity and, therefore, is filtered in the broadband frequency range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bódizs et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerster et al., 2022</xref>).

As an output, this method provides the maximum a posterior estimate – the most likely value of the population parameter. To quantify the uncertainty of this estimate, Bayesian prevalence also provides the highest posterior density intervals for various levels (we used the 96% probability level) – the range within which the true population value lies with the specified probability.

In autocorrelation, a given value from a time series is regressed on previous values from that same time series. Partial autocorrelation is similar to autocorrelation except that it displays only the correlation between two observations that the shorter lags between those observations do not explain. In other words, the partial correlation for each lag is the unique correlation between those two observations after partialling out the intervening correlations, that is it controls for other lags.</p><p>For both autocorrelation and partial autocorrelations, we defined the number of lags as 180, which corresponds to 90 min, an average duration of a fractal cycle, with a 30 s step. We assessed these correlations in each participant separately and then averaged the correlation coefficients for each time lag over all participants of a given dataset and in a pooled dataset.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10-2"><title>Results</title><p>Autocorrelation strength decayed throughout the lags showing a somewhat sinusoid shape. Specifically, positive correlations of moderate strength were observed for the 0.5–14 min lags; for the 14–25 min lags, the correlations were weak. In addition, weak positive autocorrelations were observed around the 90th minute while weak negative autocorrelations were observed around the 45th minute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>, left), corroborating 90 min periodicity of fractal cycles.</p><p>The partial autocorrelation that controls for other lags further revealed that only 0–5 min lag coefficients were statistically significant, that is autocorrelation equals zero at lags greater than 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s7">Figure 4—figure supplement 7</xref>, right). This finding indicates that the fractal slopes of the consecutive sleep epochs within a given 5 min are not independent, they autocorrelate so that they are much more likely to appear in an observed pattern (e.g. as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) than expected by chance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Cross-correlations</title><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-1"><title>Method</title><p>To further model the temporal relationship between fractal and classical cycles, we explored them on a finer grained level using cross-correlations between time series of fractal slopes and time series of non-REM or REM sleep proportion per each 5 min of sleep. Cross-correlation allows one to evaluate how two time series might concomitantly covary in the same or opposite directions at given temporal intervals (i.e. lags). Thus, it enables the identification of temporally coordinated fluctuations between two variables. From the shape of the cross-correlation function, information concerning the possible direction of the influence between the two processes can be obtained. Cross-correlation analyses were performed between the time series of the fractal slopes averaged over each 5 min (based on the results of autocorrelation analysis reported above) of sleep on one side and the time series of the proportion of either REM or non-REM stages 2 and 3 (together) on the other side. We averaged the values of all the time series (originally calculated for each 30 s of sleep) over each 5 min of sleep. The cross-correlation coefficients were computed for lags ranging from –40 to 40 min, a period approximately corresponding to an average duration of a fractal cycle, with a 5 min step. Confidence intervals of 95% were calculated to infer statistical significance. We calculated cross-correlations in each participant separately and then averaged correlation coefficients for each time lag over all healthy adult participants in a pooled dataset (Datasets 1–5). Likewise, we calculated the proportion of the participants who showed statistically significant correlation coefficients for each lag.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-2"><title>Results</title><p>We found that the time series of fractal slopes positively cross-correlated with the time series of REM sleep proportion and negatively correlated with the time series of non-REM sleep proportion for lags lying between –15 and +5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>).

Previous results have shown that the slope of the non-oscillatory component of the power spectrum (called the aperiodic or fractal component) changes with sleep stage. Building on this, the authors present an algorithm that extracts the continuous-time fluctuations in the fractal slope and propose that peaks in this variable can be used to identify sleep cycle limits. Cycles defined in this way are termed &quot;fractal cycles&quot;. The main focus of the article is a comparison of &quot;fractal&quot; and &quot;classical&quot; (ie defined manually based on the hypnogram) sleep cycles in numerous datasets.</p><p>The manuscript amply illustrates through examples the strong overlap between fractal and classical cycle identification. Accordingly, a high percentage (81%) can be matched one-to-one between methods and sleep cycle duration is well correlated (around R = 0.5). Moreover, the methods track certain global changes in sleep structure in different populations: shorter cycles in children and longer cycles in patients medicated with REM-suppressing anti-depressants. Finally, a major strength of the results is that they show similar agreement between fractal and classical sleep cycle length in 5 different data sets, showing that it is robust to changes in recording settings and methods.</p><p>The match between fractal and classical cycles is not one-to-one. For example, the fractal method identifies a correlation between age and cycle duration in adults that is not apparent with the classical method.</p><p>The difference between the fractal and classical methods appear to be linked to the uncertain definition of sleep cycles since they are tied to when exactly the cycle begins/ends and whether or not to count cycles during fractured sleep architecture at sleep onset. Moreover, the discrepancies between the two are on the order of that found between classical cycles defined manually or via an automatic algorithm.</p><p>Overall the fractal cycle is an attractive method to study sleep architecture since it dispenses with time-consuming and potentially subjective manual identification of sleep cycles. However, given its difference with the classical method, it is unlikely that fractal scoring will be able to replace classical scoring directly. By providing a complementary quantification, it will likely contribute to refining the definition of sleep cycles that is currently ambiguous in certain cases. Moreover, it has the potential to be applied on animal studies which rarely deal with sleep cycle structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96784.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study focused on using strictly the slope of the power spectral density (PSD) to perform automated sleep scoring and evaluation of the durations of sleep cycles. The method appears to work well because the slope of the PSD is highest during slow-wave sleep, and lowest during waking and REM sleep. Therefore, when smoothed and analyzed across time, there are cyclical variations in the slope of the PSD, fit using an IRASA (Irregularly resampled auto-spectral analysis) algorithm proposed by Wen &amp; Liu (2016).</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The main novelty of the study is that the non-fractal (oscillatory) components of the PSD that are more typically used during sleep scoring can be essentially ignored because the key information is already contained within the fractal (slope) component. The authors show that for the most part, results are fairly consistent between this and conventional sleep scoring, but in some cases show disagreements that may be scientifically interesting.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The previous weaknesses were well-addressed by the authors in the revised manuscript. I will note that from the fractal cycle perspective, waking and REM sleep are not very dissimilar. Combining these states underlies some of the key results of this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1:</bold></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The match between fractal and classical cycles is not one-to-one. For example, the fractal method identifies a correlation between age and cycle duration in adults that is not apparent with the classical method. This raises the question as to whether differences are due to one method being more reliable than another or whether they are also identifying different underlying biological differences. It is not clear for example whether the agreement between the two methods is better or worse than between two human scorers, which generally serve as a gold standard to validate novel methods. The authors provide some insight into differences between the methods that could account for differences in results. However, given that the fractal method is automatic it would be important to clearly identify criteria for recordings in which it will produce similar results to the classical method.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the insightful suggestions. In the revised Manuscript, we have added a number of additional analyses that provide a quantitative comparison between the classical and fractal cycle approaches aiming to identify the source of the discrepancies between classical and fractal cycle durations. Likewise, we assessed the intra-fractal and intra-classical method reliability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2:</bold></p><p>One weakness of the study, from my perspective, was that the IRASA fits to the data (e.g. the PSD, such as in Figure 1B), were not illustrated. One cannot get a sense of whether or not the algorithm is based entirely on the fractal component or whether the oscillatory component of the PSD also influences the slope calculations. This should be better illustrated, but I assume the fits are quite good.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In the revised Manuscript, we have added a new figure (Fig.S1 E, Supplementary Material 2), illustrating the goodness of fit of the data as assessed by the IRASA method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cycles detected using IRASA are called fractal cycles. I appreciate the use of a simple term for this, but I am also concerned whether it could be potentially misleading? The term suggests there is something fractal about the cycle, whereas it's really just that the fractal component of the PSD is used to detect the cycle. A more appropriate term could be &quot;fractal-detected cycles&quot; or &quot;fractal-based cycle&quot; perhaps?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these cycles are not fractal per se. In the Introduction, when we mention them for the first time, we name them “fractal activity-based cycles of sleep” and immediately after that add “or fractal cycles for short”. In the revised version, we renewed this abbreviation with each new major section and in Abstract. Nevertheless, given that the term “fractal cycles” is used 88 times, after those “reminders”, we used the short name again to facilitate readability. We hope that this will highlight that the cycles are not fractal per se and thus reduce the possible confusion while keeping the manuscript short.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study performs various comparisons of the durations of sleep cycles evaluated by the IRASA-based algorithm vs. conventional sleep scoring. One concern I had was that it appears cycles were simply identified by their order (first, second, etc.) but were not otherwise matched. This is problematic because, as evident from examples such as Figure 3B, sometimes one cycle conventionally scored is matched onto two fractal-based cycles. In the case of the Figure 3B example, it would be more appropriate to compare the duration of conventional cycle 5 vs. fractal cycle 7, rather than 5 vs. 5, as it appears is currently being performed.</p></disp-quote><p>In cases where the number of fractal cycles differed from the number of classical cycles (from 34 to 55% in different datasets as in the case of Fig.3B), we did not perform one-to-one matching of cycles. Instead, we averaged the duration of the fractal and classical cycles over each participant and only then correlated between them (Fig.2C). For a subset of the participants (45 – 66% of the participants in different datasets) with a one-to-one match between the fractal and classical cycles, we performed an additional correlation without averaging, i.e., we correlated the durations of individual fractal and classical cycles (Fig.4S of Supplementary Material 2). This is stated in the Methods, section Statistical analysis, paragraph 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are a few statements in the discussion that I felt were either not well-supported. L629: about the &quot;little biological foundation&quot; of categorical definitions, e.g. for REM sleep or wake? I cannot agree with this statement as written. Also about &quot;the gradual nature of typical biological processes&quot;. Surely the action potential is not gradual and there are many other examples of all-or-none biological events.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Manuscript, we have removed these statements from both Introduction and Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors appear to acknowledge a key point, which is that their methods do not discriminate between awake and REM periods. Thus their algorithm essentially detected cycles of slow-wave sleep alternating with wake/REM. Judging by the examples provided this appears to account for both the correspondence between fractal-based and conventional cycles, as well as their disagreements during the early part of the sleep cycle. While this point is acknowledged in the discussion section around L686. I am surprised that the authors then argue against this correspondence on L695. I did not find the &quot;not-a-number&quot; controls to be convincing. No examples were provided of such cycles, and it's hard to understand how positive z-values of the slopes are possible without the presence of some wake unless N1 stages are sufficient to provide a detected cycle (in which case, then the argument still holds except that its alterations between slow-wave sleep and N1 that could be what drives the detection).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised Manuscript, we have removed the “NaN analysis” from both Results and Discussion. We have replaced it with the correlation between the difference between the durations of the classical and fractal cycles and proportion of wake after sleep onset. The finding is as follows:</p><p>“A larger difference between the durations of the classical and fractal cycles was associated with a higher proportion of wake after sleep onset in 3/5 datasets as well as in the merged dataset (Supplementary Material 2, Table S10).” Results, section “Fractal cycles and wake after sleep onset”, last two sentences. This is also discussed in Discussion, section “Fractal cycles and age”, paragraph 1, last sentence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To me, it seems important to make clear whether the paper is proposing a different definition of cycles that could be easily detected without considering fractals or spectral slopes, but simply adjusting what one calls the onset/offset of a cycle, or whether there is something fundamentally important about measuring the PSD slope. The paper seems to be suggesting the latter but my sense from the results is that it's rather the former.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important comment. Overall, our paper suggests that the fractal approach might reflect the cycling nature of sleep in a more precise and sensitive way than classical hypnograms. Importantly, neither fractal nor classical methods can shed light on the mechanism underlying sleep cycle generation due to their correlational approach. Despite this, the advantages of fractal over classical methods mentioned in our Manuscript are as follows:</p><p>(1) Fractal cycles are based on a real-valued metric with known neurophysiological functional significance, which introduces a biological foundation and a more gradual impression of nocturnal changes compared to the abrupt changes that are inherent to hypnograms that use a rather arbitrary assigned categorical value (e.g., wake=0, REM=-1, N1=-2, N2=-3 and SWS=-4, Fig.2 A).</p><p>(2) Fractal cycle computation is automatic and thus objective, whereas classical sleep cycle detection is usually based on the visual inspection of hypnograms, which is time-consuming, subjective and error-prone. Few automatic algorithms are available for sleep cycle detection, which only moderately correlated with classical cycles detected by human raters (r’s = 0.3 – 0.7 in different datasets here).</p><p>(3) Defining the precise end of a classical sleep cycle with skipped REM sleep that is common in children, adolescents and young adults using a hypnogram is often difficult and arbitrary. The fractal cycle algorithm could detect such cycles in 93% of cases while the hypnogram-based agreement on the presence/absence of skipped cycles between two independent human raters was 61% only; thus, 32% lower.</p><p>(4) The fractal analysis showed a stronger effect size, higher F-value and R-squared than the classical analysis for the cycle duration comparison in children and adolescents vs young adults. The first and second fractal cycles were significantly shorter in the pediatric compared to the adult group, whereas the classical approach could not detect this difference.</p><p>(5) Fractal – but not classical – cycle durations correlated with the age of adult participants.</p><p>These bullets are now summarized in Table 5 that has been added to the Discussion of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>The authors have added a lot of quantifications to provide a more complete comparison of classical and fractal cycles that address the points I raised.</p><p>Regarding, the question of skipped REM cycles: I am not sure the comparison of skipped cycle accuracies between fractal and manual methods makes sense. To make a fair comparison fractal and 2nd scorer classifications should be compared to the same baseline dataset which doesn't seem to be the case since the number of skipped cycles is not the same. Moreover, it's not indicated whether the fractal method identifies any false positive skipped cycles.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In the revised Manuscript, we have reported the number of false positive skipped cycles identified by the fractal algorithm. Likewise, we have added the comparison between the fractal algorithm and the second scorer detection of cycles with skipped REM sleep (Results, the section “Skipped cycles”, last paragraph). The text has been revised as follows:</p><p>“Visual inspection of the hypnograms from Datasets 1 – 6 was performed by two independent researchers. Scorer 1 and Scorer 2 detected that out of 226 first sleep cycles 58 (26%) and 64 (28%), respectively, lacked REM episodes. The agreement on the presence of skipped cycles between two human raters equaled 91% (58 cycles detected by both raters out of 64 cycles detected by either one or two scorers). The fractal cycle algorithm detected skipped cycles in 57 out of 58 (98%) cases detected by Scorer 1 with one false positive (which, however, was tagged as a skipped cycle by Scorer2), and in 58 out of 64 (91%) cases detected by Scorer 2 with no false positives.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>I suggest reporting the values of inter-method / inter-scorer correlations with the classical method in the main text since otherwise interpreting the value for fractal vs classical is impossible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. In the revised Manuscript, we have moved this section to the main text (Table 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 5 + text of discussion: cycle identification based on hypnograms is claimed to be. &quot;based on arbitrary assigned categorical values&quot; the categories are not arbitrary since they correspond to well-validate sleep states, only the number associated it and this does not seem to be very important since it's only for visualization purposes.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment.
